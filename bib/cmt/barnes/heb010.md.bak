Analysis Of The Chapter

The general subject of this chapter Heb. 10 is the sacrifice which
Christ has made for sin, and the consequences which flow from the fact,
that he has made a sufficient atonement. In chapter IX. the apostle had
shown that the Jewish rites were designed to be temporary and typical,
and that the offerings which were made under that dispensation could
never remove sin. In this chapter he shows that the true sacrifice had
been made, by which sin could be pardoned, and that certain very
important consequences followed from that fact. The subject of
"sacrifice" was the most important part of the Jewish economy, and was
also the essential thing in the Christian dispensation, and hence, it is
that the apostle dwells upon it at so great length. The chapter embraces
the following topics.

I. The apostle repeats what he had said before about the inefficacy of
the sacrifices made under the Law; [Heb
10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md). The Law was a mere shadow of
good things to come, and the sacrifices which were made under it could
never render those who offered them perfect. This was conclusively
proved by the fact, that they continued constantly to be offered.

II\. Since this was the fact in regard to those sacrifices, a better
offering had been provided in the gospel by the Redeemer; [Heb
10:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md). A body had been prepared him
for this work; and when God had said that he had no pleasure in the
offerings under the Law, Christ had come and offered his body once for
all, in order that an effectual atonement might be made for sin.

III\. This sentiment the apostle further illustrates, by showing how
this one great offering was connected with the forgiveness of sins; [Heb
10:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011.md). Under the Jewish
dispensation, sacrifices were repeated every day; but under the
Christian economy, when the sacrifice was once made, he who had offered
it sat down forever on the right hand of God, for his great work was
done. Having done this, he looked forward to the time when his work
would have full effect, and when his enemies would be made his
footstool. That this was to be the effect of the offering made by the
Messiah, the apostle then shows from the Scriptures themselves, where it
is said [Jer 31:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md), that under the
gospel the laws of God would be written on the heart, and sin would be
remembered no more. There must then be, the apostle inferred, some way
by which this was to be secured, and this was by the great sacrifice on
the cross, which had the effect of perfecting forever those who were
sanctified.

IV\. Since it was a fact that such an atonement had been made; that one
great offering for sin had been presented to God which was never to be
repeated, there were certain consequences which followed from that,
which the apostle proceeds to state; [Heb
10:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md). They were these:

\(a\) the privilege of drawing near to God with full assurance of faith
[Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md);

\(b\) the duty of holding fast the profession of faith without wavering
[Heb 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023.md);

\(c\) the duty of exhorting one another to fidelity and to good works
[Heb 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024.md);

\(d\) the duty of assembling for public worship, since they had a High
Priest in heaven, and might now draw near to God; [Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md).

V. As a "reason" for fidelity in the divine life, and for embracing the
offer of mercy now made through the one sacrifice on the cross, the
apostle urges the consequence which "must" follow from the rejection of
that atonement, and especially after having been made acquainted with
the truth; [Heb 10:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md). The result,
says he, must be certain destruction. If that was rejected, there could
remain nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment for there was no
other way of salvation. In support of this, the apostle refers to what
was the effect, under the Law of Moses, of disobedience, and says that,
under the greater light of the gospel, much more fearful results must
follow.

VI\. The chapter closes [Heb 10:32-39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032.md)
with an exhortation to fidelity and perseverance. The apostle reminds
those to whom he wrote of what they had already endured; encourages them
by the commendation of what they had already done, and especially by the
kindness which they had shown to him; says that they had need only of
patience, and that the time of their deliverance from all trial was not
far off, for that he who was to come would come; says that it was their
duty to live by faith, but that if any one drew back, God could have no
pleasure in him. Having thus in the close of the chapter alluded to the
subject of faith, he proceeds in the following chapter to illustrate its
value at length. The object of the whole is to encourage Christians to
make strenuous efforts for salvation; to guard them against the danger
of apostasy; and to exhort them to bear their trials with patience, and
with submission to the will of God.

[Hebrews 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 10:1</span></span>

For the law having a shadow - That is, the whole of the Mosaic economy
was a shadow; for so the word "Law" is often used. The word "shadow"
here refers to a rough outline of anything, a mere sketch, such as a
carpenter draws with a piece of chalk, or such as an artist delineates
when he is about to make a picture. He sketches an outline of the object
which he designs to draw, which has "some" resemblance to it, but is not
the "very image;" for it is not yet complete. The words rendered "the
very image" refer to a painting or statue which is finished, where every
part is an exact copy of the original. The "good things to come" here
refer to the future blessings which would be conferred on man by the
gospel. The idea is, that under the ancient sacrifices there was an
imperfect representation; a dim outline of the blessings which the
gospel would impart to people. They were a typical representation; they
were not such that it could be pretended that they would answer the
purpose of the things themselves which they were to represent, and would
make those who offered them perfect. Such a rude outline; such a mere
sketch, or imperfect delineation, could no more answer the purpose of
saving the soul than the rough sketch which an architect makes would
answer the purpose of a house, or than the first outline which a painter
draws would answer the purpose of a perfect and finished portrait. All
that could be done by either would be to convey some distant and obscure
idea of what the house or the picture might be, and this was all that
was done by the Law of Moses.

Can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year
continually - The sacrifices here particularly referred to were those
which were offered on the great day of atonement. These were regarded as
the most sacred and efficacious of all, and yet the apostle says that
the very fact that they were offered every year showed that there must
be some deficiency about them, or they would have ceased to be offered.

Make the comers thereunto perfect - They could not free them from the
stains of guilt; they could not give ease to a troubled conscience;
there was in them no efficacy by which sin could be put away; compare
the notes on [Heb 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md).

[Hebrews 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 10:2</span></span>

For then would they not have ceased to be offered? - Margin, "Or they
would have." The sense is the same. The idea is, that the very fact that
they were repeated showed that there was some deficiency in them as to
the matter of cleansing the soul from sin. If they had answered all the
purposes of a sacrifice in putting away guilt, there would have been no
need of repeating them in this manner. They were in this respect like
medicine. If what is given to a patient heals him, there is no need of
repeating it; but if it is repeated often it shows that there was some
deficiency in it, and if taken periodically through a man's life, and
the disease should still remain, it would show that it was not
sufficient to effect his cure. So it was with the offerings made by the
Jews. They were offered every year, and indeed every day, and still the
disease of sin remained. The conscience was not satisfied; and the
guilty felt that it was necessary that the sacrifice should be repeated
again and again.

Because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more
conscience of sin - That is, if their sacrifices had so availed as to
remove their past sins, and to procure forgiveness, they would have had
no more trouble of conscience on account of them. They would not have
felt that it was necessary to make these sacrifices over and over again
in order to find peace. When a man has full evidence that an atonement
has been made which will meet all the demands of the Law, and which
secures the remission of sin, he feels that it is enough. It is all that
the case demands, and his conscience may have peace. But when he does
"not" feel this, or has not evidence that his sins are all forgiven,
those sins will rise to remembrance, and he will be alarmed. He may be
punished for them after all. Thence it follows that if a man wants peace
he should have good evidence that his sins are forgiven through the
blood of the atonement.

No temporary expedient; no attempt to cover them up; no effort to forget
them will answer the purpose. They "must be blotted out" if he will have
peace - and that can be only through a perfect sacrifice. By the use of
the word rendered "conscience" here, it is not meant that he who was
pardoned would have no "consciousness" that he was a sinner, or that he
would forget it, but that he would have no trouble of conscience; he
would have no apprehension of future wrath. The pardon of sin does not
cause it to cease to be remembered. He who is forgiven may have a deeper
conviction of its evil than he had ever had before. But he will not be
troubled or distressed by it as if it were to expose him to the wrath of
God. The remembrance of it will humble him; it will serve to exalt his
conceptions of the mercy of God and the glory of the atonement, but it
will no longer overwhelm the mind with the dread of hell. This effect,
the apostle says, was not produced on the minds of those who offered
sacrifices every year. The very fact that they did it, showed that the
conscience was not at peace.

[Hebrews 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 10:3</span></span>

But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every
year - The reference here is to the sacrifices made on the great day of
atonement. This occurred once in a year. Of course as often as a
sacrifice was offered, it was an acknowledgment of guilt on the part of
those for whom it was made. As these sacrifices continued to be offered
every year, they who made the offering were reminded of their guilt and
their desert of punishment. All the efficacy which could be pretended to
belong those sacrifices, was that they made expiation for the past year.
Their efficacy did not extend into the future, nor did it embrace any
but those who were engaged in offering them. These sacrifices,
therefore, could not make the atonement which man needed. They could not
make the conscience easy; they could not be regarded as a sufficient
expiation for the time to come, so that the sinner at any time could
plead an offering which was already made as a ground of pardon, and they
could not meet the wants of all people in all lands and at all times.
These things are to be found only in that great sacrifice made by the
Redeemer on the cross.

[Hebrews 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 10:4</span></span>

For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take
away sins - The reference here is to the sacrifices which were made on
the great day of the atonement, for on that day the blood of bulls and
of goats alone was offered; see the notes on [Heb
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md). Paul here means to say,
doubtless, that it was not possible that the blood of these animals
should make a complete expiation so as to purify the conscience, and so
as to save the sinner from deserved wrath. According to the divine
arrangement, expiation was made by those sacrifices for offences of
various kinds against the ritual law of Moses, and pardon for such
offences was thus obtained. But the meaning here is, that there was no
efficacy in the blood of a mere animal to wash away a "moral" offence.
It could not repair the Law; it could not do anything to maintain the
justice of God; it had no efficacy to make the heart pure. The mere
shedding of the blood of an animal never could make the soul pure. This
the apostle states as a truth which must be admitted at once as
indisputable, and yet it is probable that many of the Jews had imbibed
the opinion that there was such efficacy in blood shed according to the
divine direction, as to remove all stains of guilt from the soul; see
the notes, [Heb 9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md).

[Hebrews 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 10:5</span></span>

Wherefore - This word shows that the apostle means to sustain what he
had said by a reference to the Old Testament itself. Nothing could be
more opposite to the prevailing Jewish opinions about the efficacy of
sacrifice, than what he had just said. It was, therefore, of the highest
importance to defend the position which he had laid down by authority
which they would not presume to call in question, and he therefore makes
his appeal to their own Scriptures.

When he cometh into the world - When the Messiah came, for the passage
evidently referred to him. The Greek is, "Wherefore coming into the
world, he saith." It has been made a question "when" this is to be
understood as spoken - whether when he was born, or when he entered on
the work of his ministry. Grotius understands it of the latter. But it
is not material to a proper understanding of the passage to determine
this. The simple idea is, that since it was impossible that the blood of
bulls and goats should take away sin, Christ coming into the world made
arrangements for a better sacrifice.

He saith - That is, this is the language denoted by his great
undertaking; this is what his coming to make an atonement implies. We
are not to suppose that Christ formally used these words on any occasion
for we have no record that he did - but this language is what
appropriately expresses the nature of his work. Perhaps also the apostle
means to say that it was originally employed in the Psalm from which it
is quoted in reference to him, or was indited by him with reference to
his future advent.

Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not - This is quoted from [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md). There has been much perplexity
felt by expositorsin reference to this quotation, and after all which
has been written, it is not entirely removed. The difficulty relates to
these points.

\(1\) to the question whether the Psalm originally had any reference to
the Messiah. The Psalm "appears" to have pertained merely to David, and
it would probably occur to no one on reading it to suppose that it
referred to the Messiah, unless it had been so applied by the apostle in
this place.

\(2\) there are many parts of the Psalm, it has been said, which cannot,
without a very forced interpretation, be applied to Christ; see [Psa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md), [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md), [Psa
40:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md).

\(3\) the argument of the apostle in the expression "a body hast thou
prepared me," seems to be based on a false translation of the
Septuagint, which he has adopted, and it is difficult to see on what
principles he has done it. - It is not the design of these notes to go
into an extended examination of questions of this nature. Such
examination must be sought in more extended commentaries, and in
treatises expressly relating to points of this kind.

On the design of Ps. 40, and its applicability to the Messiah, the
reader may consult Prof. Stuart on the Hebrews, Excursus xx. and Kuinoel
in loc. After the most attentive examination which I can give of the
Psalm, it seems to me probable that it is one of the Psalms which had an
original and exclusive reference to the Messiah, and that the apostle
has quoted it just as it was meant to be understood by the Holy Spirit,
as applicable to him. The reasons for this opinion are briefly these:

\(1\) There are such Psalms, as is admitted by all. The Messiah was the
hope of the Jewish people; he was made the subject of their most sublime
prophecies, and nothing was more natural than that he should be the
subject of the songs of their sacred bards. By the spirit of inspiration
they saw him in the distant future in the various circumstances in which
he would be placed, and they dwelt with delight upon the vision; compare
Introduction to Isaiah, section 7.iii.

\(2\) The fact that it is here applied to the Messiah, is a strong
circumstance to demonstrate that it had an original applicability to
him. This proof is of two kinds. "First," that it is so applied by an
inspired apostle, which with all who admit his inspiration seems
decisive of the question. "Second," the fact that he so applied it shows
that this was an ancient and admitted interpretation. The apostle was
writing to those who had been Jews, and whom he was desirous to convince
of the truth of what he was alleging in regard to the nature of the
Hebrew sacrifices. For this purpose it was necessary to appeal to the
Scriptures of the Old Testament, but it cannot be supposed that he would
adduce a passage for proof whose relevancy would not be admitted. The
presumption is, that the passage was in fact commonly applied as here.

\(3\) the whole of the Psalm may be referred to the Messiah without
anything forced or unnatural. The Psalm throughout seems to be made up
of expressions used by a suffering person, who had indeed been delivered
from some evils, but who was expecting many more. The principal
difficulties in the way of such an interpretation, relate to the
following points.

\(a\) In [Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md), the speaker in the
Psalm says, "He brought me up out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
clay, and set my feet upon a rock," and on the ground of this he gives
thanks to God. But there is no real difficulty in supposing that this
may refer to the Messiah. His enemies often plotted against his life;
laid snares for him and endeavored to destroy him, and it may be that he
refers to some deliverance from such machinations. If it is objected to
this that it is spoken of as having been uttered" when he came into the
world," it may be replied that that phrase does not necessarily refer to
the time of his birth, but that he uttered this sentiment sometime
"during" the period of his incarnation. "He coming into the world for
the purpose of redemption made use of this language." In a similar
manner we would say of Lafayette, that "he coming to the United States
to aid in the cause of liberty, suffered a wound in battle." That is,
during the period in which he was engaged in this cause, he suffered in
this manner.

\(b\) The next objection or difficulty relates to the application of
[Psa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md) to the Messiah. "Mine
iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
they are more than the hairs of my head; therefore my heart faileth me."
To meet this some have suggested that he refers to the sins of people
which he took upon himself, and which he here speaks of as "his own."
But it is not true that the Lord Jesus so took upon himself the sins of
others that they could be his. They were "not" his, for he was in every
sense "holy, harmless, and undefiled." The true solution of this
difficulty, probably is, that the word rendered "iniquity" - צון ̀awon -
means "calamity, misfortune, trouble;" see [Psa
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md); [Sa1
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#010.md); [Kg2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#009.md); [Psa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006.md); compare [Psa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md). The proper idea in the word is
that of "turning away, curving, making crooked;" and it is thus applied
to anything which is "perverted" or turned from the right way; as when
one is turned from the path of rectitude, or commits sin; when one is
turned from the way of prosperity or happiness, or is exposed to
calamity. This seems to be the idea demanded by the scope of the Psalm,
for it is not a penitential Psalm, in which the speaker is recounting
his "sins," but one in which he is enumerating his "sorrows;" praising
God in the first part of the Psalm for some deliverance already
experienced, and supplicating his interposition in view of calamities
that he saw to be coming upon him. This interpretation also seems to be
demanded in [Psa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md) by the
"parallelism." In the former part of the verse, the word to which
"iniquity" corresponds, is not "sin," but "evil," that is, calamity.

"For innumerable evils have compassed me about;

Mine iniquities (calamities) have taken hold upon me."

If the word, therefore, be used here as it often is, and as the scope of
the Psalm and the connection seem to demand, there is no solid objection
against applying this verse to the Messiah.

\(c\) A third objection to this application of the Psalm to the Messiah
is, that it cannot be supposed that he would utter such imprecations on
his enemies as are found in [Psa
40:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md). "Let them be ashamed and
confounded; let them be driven backward; let them be desolate." To this
it may be replied, that such imprecations are as proper in the mouth of
the Messiah as of David; but particularly, it may be said also, that
they are improper in the mouth of neither. Both David and the Messiah
"did" in fact utter denunciations against the enemies of piety and of
God. God does the same thing in his word and by his Providence. There is
no evidence of any "malignant" feeling in this; nor is it inconsistent
with the highest benevolence. The Lawgiver who says that the murderer
shall die, may have a heart full of benevolence; the judge who sentences
him to death, may do it with eyes filled with tears. The objections,
then, are not of such a nature that it is improper to regard this Psalm
as wholly applicable to the Messiah.

\(4\) the Psalm cannot be applied with propriety to David, nor do we
know of anyone to whom it can be but to the Messiah. When was it true of
David that he said that he "had come to do the will of God in view of
the fact that God did not require sacrifice and offerings?" In what
"volume of a book" was it written of him before his birth that he
"delighted to do the will of God?" When was it true that he had"
preached righteousness in the great congregation?" These expressions are
such as can be applied properly only to the Messiah, as Paul does here;
and taking all these circumstances together it will probably be regarded
as the most proper interpretation to refer the whole Psalm at once to
the Redeemer and to suppose that Paul has used it in strict accordance
with its original design. The other difficulties referred to will be
considered in the exposition of the passage. The difference between
"sacrifice" and "offering" is, that the former refers to "bloody"
sacrifices; the latter to "any" oblation made to God - as a
thank-offering; an offering of flour, oil, etc.; see the notes on [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md).

When it is said "sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not," the meaning
is not that such oblations were "in no sense" acceptable to God - for as
his appointment, and when offered with a sincere heart, they doubtless
were; but that they were not as acceptable to him as obedience, and
especially as the expression is used here that they could not avail to
secure the forgiveness of sins. They were not in their own nature such
as was demanded to make an expiation for sin, and hence, a body was
prepared for the Messiah by which a more perfect sacrifice could be
made. The sentiment here expressed occurs more than once in the Old
Testament. Thus, [Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md). "Behold,
to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams,"
[Hos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md), "For I desired mercy and not
sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings;" compare
[Psa 51:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md), "For thou desirest not
sacrifice, else would I give it; thou delightest not in burnt-offering.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit." This was an indisputable
principle of the Old Testament, though it was much obscured and
forgotten in the common estimation among the Jews. In accordance with
this principle the Messiah came to render obedience of the highest
order, even to such an extent that he was willing to lay down his own
life.

But a body hast thou prepared me - This is one of the passages which has
caused a difficulty in understanding this quotation from the Psalm. The
difficulty is, that it differs from the Hebrew, and that the apostle
builds an argument upon it. It is not unusual indeed in the New
Testament to make use of the language of the Septuagint even where it
varies somewhat from the Hebrew; and where no "argument" is based on
such a "passage," there can be no difficulty in such a usage, since it
is not uncommon to make use of the language of others to express our own
thoughts. But the apostle does not appear to have made such a use of the
passage here, but to have applied it in the way of "argument." The
argument, indeed, does not rest "wholly," perhaps not "principally," on
the fact that a "body had been prepared" for the Messiah; but still this
was evidently in the view of the apostle an important consideration, and
this is the passage on which the proof of this is based.

The Hebrew [Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md) "Mine ears hast
thou opened," or as it is in the margin, "digged." The idea there is,
that the ear had been, as it were, excavated, or dug out, so as to be
made to hear distinctly; that is, certain truths had been clearly
revealed to the speaker; or perhaps it may mean that he had been made
"readily and attentively obedient." Stuart; compare [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005.md). "The Lord God hath opened mine
ear, and I was not rebellious." In the Psalm, the proper connection
would seem to be, that the speaker had been made obedient, or had been
so led that he was disposed to do the will of God. This may be expressed
by the fact that the ear had been opened so as to be quick to hear,
since an indisposition to obey is often expressed by the fact that the
ears are "stopped." There is manifestly no allusion here, as has been
sometimes supposed, to the custom of boring through the ear of a servant
with an awl as a sign that he was willing to remain and serve his
master; [Exo 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md); [Deu
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017.md).

In that case, the outer circle, or rim of the ear was bored through with
an awl; here the idea is that of hollowing out, digging, or excavating -
a process to make the passage clear, not to pierce the outward ear. The
Hebrew in file Psalm the Septuagint translates, "a body hast thou
prepared me," and this rendering has been adopted by the apostle.
Various ways have been resorted to of explaining the fact that the
translators of the Septuagint rendered it in this manner, none of which
are entirely free from difficulty. Some critics, as Cappell, Ernesti,
and others have endeavored to show that it is probable that the
Septuagint reading in [Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), was -
ὠτίον κατηρτίσω μοι ōtion katērtisō moi - "my ear thou hast prepared;"
that is, for obedience. But of this there is no proof, and indeed it is
evident that the apostle quoted it as if it were σῶμα sōma, "body;" see
[Heb 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md). It is probably altogether
impossible now to explain the reason why the translators of the
Septuagint rendered the phrase as they did; and this remark may be
extended to many other places of their version. It is to be admitted
here, beyond all doubt, whatever consequences may follow:

\(1\) that their version does not accord with the Hebrew;

\(2\) that the apostle has quoted their version as it stood, without
attempting to correct it;

\(3\) that his use of the passage is designed, to some extent at least,
as "proof" of what he was demonstrating.

The leading idea; the important and essential point in the argument, is,
indeed, not that "a body was prepared," but that "he came to do the will
of God;" but still it is clear that the apostle meant to lay some stress
on the fact that a body had been prepared for the Redeemer. Sacrifice
and offering by the bodies of lambs and goats were not what was
required, but instead of that the Messiah came to do the will of God by
offering a more perfect sacrifice, and in accomplishing that it was
necessary that he should be endowed with a body But on what principle
the apostle has quoted a passage to prove this which differs from the
Hebrew, I confess I cannot see, nor do any of the explanations offered
commend themselves as satisfactory. The only circumstances which seem to
furnish any relief to the difficulty are these two:

\(1\) that the "main point" in the argument of the apostle was not that
"a body had been prepared," but that the Messiah came to do the "will of
God," and that the preparation of a body for that was rather an
incidental circumstance; and

\(2\) that the translation by the Septuagint was not a material
departure from the "scope" of the whole Hebrew passage.

The "main" thought - that of doing the will of God in the place of
offering sacrifice - was still retained; the opening of the ears, that
is, rendering the person attentive and disposed to obey, and the
preparing of a body in order to obedience, were not circumstances so
unlike as to make it necessary for the apostle to re-translate the whole
passage in order to the main end which he had in view. Still, I admit,
that these considerations do not seem to me to be wholly satisfactory.
Those who are disposed to examine the various opinions which have been
entertained of this passage may find them in Kuinoel, in loc.,
Rosenmuller, Stuart on the Hebrews, Excursus xx., and Kennicott on [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md). Kennicott supposes that there
has been a change in the Hebrew text, and that instead of the present
reading - אזנים ‛aaznaayim - "ears," the reading was אז גוף ‛aaz guwph -
then a body;" and that these words became united by the error of
transcribers, and by a slight change then became as the present copies
of the Hebrew text stands. This conjecture is ingenious, and if it were
ever allowable to follow a "mere" conjecture, I should be disposed to do
it here. But there is no authority from mss. for any change, nor do any
of the old versions justify it, or agree with this except the Arabic.

[Hebrews 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 10:6</span></span>

In burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure -
This is not quoted literally from the Psalm, but the sense is retained.
The reading there is, "burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not
required." The quotation by the apostle is taken from the Septuagint,
with the change of a single word, which does not materially affect the
sense - the word ὀυκ ἐυδόκησας ouk eudokēsas - "ouk eudokesas" - "thou
hast no pleasure," instead of ὀυκ ἠθέλησας ouk ēthelēsas - "ouk
ethelesas" - "thou dost not will." The idea is, that God had no pleasure
in them as compared with obedience. He preferred the latter, and they
could not be made to come in the place of it, or to answer the same
purpose. When they were performed with a pure heart, he was doubtless
pleased with the offering. As used here in reference to the Messiah, the
meaning is, that they would not be what was required of "him." Such
offerings would not answer the end for which he was sent into the world,
for that end was to be accomplished only by his being "obedient unto
death."

[Hebrews 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 10:7</span></span>

Then said I - "I the Messiah." Paul applies this directly to Christ,
showing that he regarded the passage in the Psalms as referring to him
as the speaker.

Lo, I come - Come into the world; [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md). It is not easy to see how this
could be applied to David in any circumstance of his life. There was no
situation in which he could say that, since sacrifices and offerings
were not what was demanded, he came to do the will of God in the place
or stead of them. The time here referred to by the word "then" is when
it was manifest that sacrifices and offerings for sin would not answer
all the purposes desirable, or when in view of that fact the purpose of
the Redeemer is conceived as formed to enter upon a work which would
effect what they could not.

In the volume of the book it is written of me - The word rendered here
"volume " - κεφαλίς kephalis - means properly "a little head;" and then
a knob, and here refers doubtless to the head or knob of the rod on
which the Hebrew manuscripts were rolled. Books were usually so written
as to be rolled up, and when they were read they were unrolled at one
end of the manuscript, and rolled up at the other as fast as they were
read; see notes on [Luk 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md). The rods
on which they were rolled had small heads, either for the purpose of
holding them, or for ornament, and hence, the name head came
metaphorically to be given to the roll or volume. But what volume is
here intended? And where is that written which is here referred to? If
David was the author of the Psalm from which this is quoted Ps. 40, then
the book or volume which was then in existence must have been
principally, if not entirely, the five books of Moses, and perhaps the
books of Job, Joshua, and Judges, with probably a few of the Psalms. It
is most natural to understand this of the Pentateuch, or the five books
of Moses, as the word "volume" at that time would undoubtedly have most
naturally suggested that.

But plainly, this could not refer to David himself, for in what part of
the Law of Moses, or in any of the volumes then extant, can a reference
of this kind be found to David? There is no promise, no intimation that
he would come to "do the will of God" with a view to effect what could
not be done by the sacrifices prescribed by the Jewish Law. The
reference of the language, therefore, must be to the Messiah - to some
place where it is represented that he would come to effect by his
obedience what could not be done by the sacrifices and offerings under
the Law. But still, in the books of Moses, this language is not
literally found, and the meaning must be, that this was the language
which was there implied respecting the Messiah; or this was the
substance of the description given of him, that he would como to take
the place of those sacrifices, and by his obedience unto death would
accomplish what they could not do.

They had a reference to him; and it was contemplated in their
appointment that their inefficiency would be such that there should be
felt a necessity for a higher sacrifice, and when he should come they
would all be done away. The whole language of the institution of
sacrifices, and of the Mosaic economy, was, that a Saviour would
hereafter come to do the will of God in making an atonement for the sin
of the world. That there are places in the books of Moses which refer to
the Saviour, is expressly affirmed by Christ himself [Joh
5:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046.md), and by the apostles (compare
[Act 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022.md), [Act
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#003).md), and that the general spirit of
the institutions of Moses had reference to him is abundantly
demonstrated in this Epistle. The meaning here is, "I come to do thy
will in making an atonement, for no other offering would expiate sin.
That I would do this is the language of the Scriptures which predict my
coming, and of the whole spirit and design of the ancient dispensation."

To do thy will, O God - This expresses the amount of all that the
Redeemer came to do. He came to do the will of God:

\(1\) by perfect obedience to his Law, and,

\(2\) by making an atonement for sin - becoming "obedient unto death;"
[Phi 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md).

The latter is the principal thought here, for the apostle is showing
that sacrifice and offering such as were made under the Law would not
put away sin, and that Christ came in contradistinction from them to
make a sacrifice that would be efficacious. Everywhere in the Scriptures
it is held out as being the "will of God" that such an atonement should
be made. There was salvation in no other way, nor was it possible that
the race should be saved unless the Redeemer drank that cup of bitter
sorrows; see [Mat 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md). We are not to
suppose, however, that it was by mere arbitrary will that those
sufferings were demanded. There were good reasons for all that the
Saviour was to endure, though those reasons are not all made known to
us.

[Hebrews 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 10:8</span></span>

Above when he said - That is, the Messiah. The word "above" refers here
to the former part of the quotation. That is, "having in the former part
of what was quoted said that God did not require sacrifices, in the
latter part he says that he came to do the will of God in the place of
them."

Sacrifice and offering, and burnt-offerings ... - These words are not
all used in the Psalm from which the apostle quotes, but the idea is,
that the specification there included all kinds of offerings. The
apostle dwells upon it because it was important to show that the same
remark applied to all the sacrifices which could be offered by man. When
the Redeemer made the observation about the inefficacy of sacrifices, he
meant that there was none of them which would be sufficient to take away
sin.

[Hebrews 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 10:9</span></span>

Then said he - In another part of the passage quoted. When he had said
that no offering which man could make would avail, then he said that he
would come himself.

He taketh away the first - The word "first" here refers to sacrifices
and offerings. He takes them away; that is, he shows that they are of no
value in removing sin. He states their inefficacy, and declares his
purpose to abolish them.

That he may establish the second - To wit, the doing of the will of God.
The two stand in contrast with each other, and he shows the inefficacy
of the former, in order that the necessity for his coming to do the will
of God may be fully seen. If they had been efficacious, there would have
been no need of his coming to make an atonement.

[Hebrews 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 10:10</span></span>

By the which will - That is, by his obeying God in the manner specified.
It is in virtue of his obedience that we are sanctified. The apostle
immediately specifies what he means, and furnishes the key to his whole
argument, when he says that it was "through the offering of the body of
Jesus Christ." It was not merely his doing the will of God in general,
but it was the specific thing of offering his body in the place of the
Jewish sacrifices; compare [Phi 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md).
Whatever part his personal obedience had in our salvation, yet the
particular thing here specified is, that it was his doing the will of
God by offering himself as a sacrifice for sin that was the means of our
sanctification.

We are sanctified - We are made holy. The word here is not confined to
the specific work which is commonly called sanctification - or the
process of making the soul holy after it is renewed, but it includes
everything by which we are made holy in the sight of God. It embraces,
therefore, justification and regeneration as well as what is commonly
known as sanctification. The idea is, that whatever there is in our
hearts which is holy, or whatever influences are brought to bear upon us
to make us holy, is all to be traced to the fact that the Redeemer
became obedient unto death, and was willing to offer his body as a
sacrifice for sin.

Through the offering of the body - As a sacrifice. A body just adapted
to such a purpose had been prepared for him; [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md). It was perfectly holy; it was so
organized as to be keenly sensitive to suffering; it was the
dwelling-place of the incarnate Deity.

Once for all - In the sense that it is not to be offered again; see the
notes on [Heb 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md). This ideals
repeated here because it was very important to be clearly understood in
order to show the contrast between the offering made by Christ, and
those made under the Law. The object of the apostle is to exalt the
sacrifice made by him above those made by the Jewish high priests. This
he does by showing that such was the efficacy of the atonement made by
him that it did not need to be repeated; the sacrifices made by them,
however, were to be renewed every year.

[Hebrews 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 10:11</span></span>

And every priest standeth daily ministering - That is, this is done
every day. It does not mean literally that every priest was daily
concerned in offering sacrifices, for they took turns according to their
courses, (notes on [Luk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005).md), but that
this was done each day, and that every priest was to take his regular
place in doing it; [Num 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003.md). The
object of the apostle is to prove that under the Jewish economy
sacrifices were repeated constantly, showing their imperfection, but
that under the Christian economy the great sacrifice had been offered
once, which was sufficient for all.

And offering oftentimes the same sacrifices - The same sacrifices were
offered morning and evening every day.

Which can never take away sins - notes, [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md).

[Hebrews 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 10:12</span></span>

But this man - The Lord Jesus. The word "man" is not in the original
here. The Greek is literally "but this;" to wit, this priest. The
apostle does not state here whether he was a man, or a being of a higher
order. He merely mentions him as a priest in contradistinction from the
Jewish priests.

After he had offered one sacrifice for sins - By dying on the cross.
This he did but once; this could not be repeated; and need not be
repeated, for it was sufficient for the sins of the world.

For ever sat down - That is, he sat down then to return no more for the
purpose of offering sacrifice for sin. He will no more submit himself to
scenes of suffering and death to expiate human guilt.

On the right hand of God - see the notes on [Mar
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md); compare the notes on [Eph
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md).

[Hebrews 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 10:13</span></span>

From henceforth expecting - Or waiting. He waits there until this shall
be accomplished according to the promise made to him that all things
shall be subdued under him; see the notes on [Co1
15:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md).

Till his enemies - There is an allusion here to [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), where it is said, "The Lord
said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies
thy footstool." The enemies of the Redeemer are Satan, the wicked of the
earth, and all the evil passions of the heart. The idea is, that all
things are yet to be made subject to his will - either by a cheerful and
cordial submission to his authority, or by being crushed beneath his
power. The Redeemer, having performed his great work of redemption by
giving himself as a sacrifice on the cross, is represented now as calmly
waiting until this glorious triumph is achieved, and this promise is
fulfilled. We are not to suppose that he is inactive, or that he takes
no share in the agency by which this is to be done. but the meaning is,
that he looks to the certain fulfillment of the promise.

His footstool - That is, they shall be thoroughly and completely
subdued. The same idea is expressed in [Co1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md), by saying that all his enemies
shall be put under his feet. The language arose from the custom of
conquerors in putting their feet on the necks of their enemies, as a
symbol of subjection; see [Jos 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md);
notes, [Isa 26:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005.md).

[Hebrews 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 10:14</span></span>

For by one offering - By offering himself once on the cross. The Jewish
priest offered his sacrifices often, and still they did not avail to put
away sin; the Saviour made one sacrifice, and it was sufficient for the
sins of the world.

He hath perfected forever - He hath laid the foundation of the eternal
perfection. The offering is of such a character that it secures their
final freedom from sin, and will make them forever holy. It cannot mean
that those for whom he died are made at once perfectly holy, for that is
not true; but the idea is, that the offering was complete, and did not
need to be repeated; and that it was of such a nature as entirely to
remove the penalty due to sin, and to lay the foundation for their final
and eternal holiness. The offerings made under the Jewish Law were so
defective that there was a necessity for repeating them every day; the
offering made by the Saviour was so perfect that it needed not to be
repeated, and that it secured the complete and final salvation of those
who availed themselves of it.

Them that are sanctified - Those who are made holy by that offering. It
does not mean that they are as yet "wholly" sanctified, but that they
have been brought under the influence of that gospel which sanctifies
and saves; see [Heb 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md); [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md). The doctrine taught in this
verse is, that all those who are in any measure sanctified will be
perfected forever. It is not a temporary work which has been begun in
their souls, but one which is designed to be carried forward to
perfection. In the atonement made by the Redeemer there is the
foundation laid for their eternal perfection, and it was with reference
to that, that it was offered. Respecting this work and the consequences
of it, we may remark, that there is:

\(1\) perfection in its nature, it being of such a character that it
needs not to be repeated;

\(2\) there is perfection in regard to the pardon of sin - all past sins
being forgiven to those who embrace it, and being forever forgiven; and

\(3\) there is to be absolute perfection for them forever.

They will be made perfect at some future period, and when that shall
take place it will be to continue forever and ever.

(The perfection, in this place, is not to be understood of the
perfection of grace or of glory. It is perfection, in regard to the
matter in hand, in regard to what was the chief design of sacrifices,
namely, expiation and consequent pardon and acceptance of God. And this
indeed is the Τελειωσις Teleiōsis of the Epistle to the Hebrews
generally, [Heb 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md). Perfect moral purity and
consummate happiness will doubtless follow as consequences of the
sacrifice of Christ, but the completeness of his expiation, and its
power to bring pardon and peace to the guilty and trembling sinner, to
justify him unto eternal life, is here, at all events, principally
intended. The parties thus perfected or completely justified, are τους
ἁγιαζομενους tous hagiazomenous, the "sanctified." Ἁγιαζω Hagiazō,
however, besides the general sense of "sanctify" has in this Epistle,
like τελειοω teleioō, its sacrificial sense of cleansing from guilt.
"Whether ceremonially, as under the Levitical dispensation; [Heb
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md); comp, [Lev
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#019.md); or really and truly, by the
offering of the body of Christ; [Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md), [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md), [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md); compare [Heb
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md), and [Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md); [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md)." - Parkhurst's Greek Lexicon.
The meaning, then, may be, that they who are purged or cleansed by this
sacrifice, in other words, those to whom its virtue is applied, are
perfectly justified.

Wherever this divine remedy is used, it will effectually save. By one
offering Christ hath forever justified such as are purged or cleansed by
it. This could not be said of those sanctified or purged by the legal
sacrifices. Mr. Scott gives the sacrificial sense of the word, but
combines with it the sense of sanctifying morally, in the following
excellent paraphrase. "By his one oblation he hath provided effectually
for the perfect justification unto eternal life, of all those who should
ever receive his atonement, by faith springing from regeneration, and
evidenced 'by the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience,' and who
were thus set apart and consecrated to the service of God.")

[Hebrews 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 10:15</span></span>

Whereof the Holy Ghost is a witness to us - That is, the Holy Spirit is
a proof of the truth of the position here laid down - that the one
atonement made by the Redeemer lays the foundation for the eternal
perfection of all who are sanctified. The witness of the Holy Spirit
here referred to is what is furnished in the Scriptures, and not any
witness in ourselves. Paul immediately makes his appeal to a passage of
the Old Testament, and he thus shows his firm conviction that the
Scriptures were inspired by the Holy Spirit.

For after that he had said before - The apostle here appeals to a
passage which he had before quoted from [Jer
31:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md); see it explained in the
notes on [Heb 8:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md). The object of
the quotation in both cases is, to show that the new covenant
contemplated the formation of a holy character or a holy people. It was
not to set apart a people who should be externally holy only, or be
distinguished for conformity to external rites and ceremonies, but who
should be holy in heart and in life. There has been some difficulty felt
by expositors in ascertaining what corresponds to the expression "after
that he had said before," and some have supposed that the phrase "then
he saith" should be understood before [Heb
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017.md). But probably the apostle means
to refer to two distinct parts of the quotation from Jeremiah, the
former of which expresses the fact that God meant to make a new covenant
with his people, and the latter expresses the nature of that covenant,
and it is particularly to the latter that he refers. This is seen more
distinctly in the passage in Jeremiah than it is in our translation of
the quotation in this Epistle. The meaning is this, "The Holy Spirit
first said, this is the covenant that I will make with them:" and having
said this, he then added, "After those days, I will put my laws into
their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their sins and
their iniquities will I remember no more." The first part of it
expresses the purpose to form such a covenant; the latter states what
that covenant would be. The quotation is not, indeed, literally made,
but the sense is retained; compare the notes on [Heb
8:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md). Still, it may be asked, how
this quotation proves the point for which it is adduced - that the
design of the atonement of Christ was "to perfect forever them that are
sanctified?" In regard to this, we may observe:

\(1\) that it was declared that those who were interested in it would be
holy, for the law would be in their hearts and written on their minds;
and,

\(2\) that this would be "entire and perpetual." Their sins would be
"wholly" forgiven; they would never be remembered again - and thus they
would be "perfected forever."

[Hebrews 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 10:18</span></span>

Now where remission of these is - Remission or forgiveness of sins; that
is, of the sins mentioned in the previous verse.

There is no more offering for sin - If those sins are wholly blotted
out, there is no more need of sacrifice to atone for them, any more than
there is need to pay a debt again which has been once paid. The idea of
Paul is, that in the Jewish dispensation there was a constant repeating
of the remembrance of sins by the sacrifices which were offered, but
that in reference to the dispensation under the Messiah, sin would be
entirely cancelled. There would be one great and all-sufficient
sacrifice, and when there was faith in that offering, sin would be
absolutely forgiven. If that was the case, there would be no occasion
for any further sacrifice for it, and the offering need not be repeated.
This circumstance, on which the apostle insists so much, made a very
important difference between the new covenant and the old. In the one,
sacrifices were offered every day; in the other, the sacrifice once made
was final and complete; in the one case, there was no such forgiveness
but that the offender was constantly reminded of his sins by the
necessity of the repetition of sacrifice; in the other, the pardon was
so complete that all dread of wrath was taken away, and the sinner might
look up to God as calmly and joyfully as if he had never been guilty of
transgression.

[Hebrews 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 10:19</span></span>

Having therefore, brethren - The apostle, in this verse, enters on the
hortatory part of his Epistle, which continues to the end of it. He had
gone into an extensive examination of the Jewish and Christian systems;
he had compared the Founders of the two - Moses and the Son of God, and
shown how far superior the latter was to the former; he had compared the
Christian Great High Priest with the Jewish high priest, and shown his
superiority; he had compared the sacrifices under the two dispensations,
and showed that in all respects the Christian sacrifice was superior to
the Jewish - that it was an offering that cleansed from sin; that it was
sufficient when once offered without being repeated, while the Jewish
offerings were only typical, and were unable to put away sin; and he had
shown that the great High Priest of the Christian profession had opened
a way to the mercy-seat in heaven, and was himself now seated there; and
having shown this, he now exhorts Christians to avail themselves fully
of all their advantages, and to enjoy to the widest extent all the
privileges now conferred on them. One of the first of these benefits
was, that they had now free access to the mercy-seat.

Boldness to enter into the holiest - Margin, "liberty." The word
rendered "boldness" - παῤῥησίαν parrēsian - properly means "boldness of
speech," or freedom where one speaks all that he thinks (notes, [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013).md); and then it means boldness in
general, license, authority, pardon. Here the idea is, that before
Christ died and entered into heaven, there was no such access to the
throne of grace as man needed. Man had no offering which he could bring
that would make him acceptable to God. But now the way was open. Access
was free for all, and all might come with the utmost freedom. The word
"holiest" here is taken from the holy of holies in the temple (notes on
[Heb 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#003).md), and is there applied to
heaven, of which that was the emblem. The entrance into the most holy
place was forbidden to all but the high priest; but now access to the
real "holy of holies" was granted to all in the name of the great High
Priest of the Christian profession.

By the blood of Jesus - The blood of Jesus is the means by which this
access to heaven is procured. The Jewish high priest entered the holy of
holies with the blood of bullocks and of rams (notes, [Heb
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007).md); but the Saviour offered his own
blood, and that became the means by which we may have access to God.

[Hebrews 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 10:20</span></span>

By a new and living way - By a new method or manner. It was a mode of
access that was till then unknown. No doubt many were saved before the
Redeemer came, but the method by which they approached God was imperfect
and difficult. The word which is rendered here "new" - πρόσφατον
prosphaton - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means
"slain, or killed thereto;" that is, "newly killed, just dead; and then
fresh, recent." Passow. It does not so much convey the idea that it is
new in the sense that it had never existed before, as new in the sense
that it is recent, or fresh. It was a way which was recently disclosed,
and which had all the freshness of novelty. It is called a "living way,"
because it is a method that imparts life, or because it leads to life
and happiness. Doddridge renders it "ever-living way," and supposes, in
accordance with the opinion of Dr. Owen, that the allusion is to the
fact that under the old dispensation the blood was to be offered as soon
as it was shed, and that it could not be offered when it was cold and
coagulated. The way by Christ was, however, always open. His blood was,
as it were, always warm, and as if it had been recently shed. This
interpretation seems to derive some support from the word which is
rendered "new." See above. The word "living," also, has often the sense
of perennial, or perpetual, as when applied to a fountain always
running, in opposition to a pool that dries up (see the notes on [Joh
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010).md), and the new way to heaven may
be called living - in all these respects. It is away that conducts to
life. It is ever-living as if the blood which was shed always retained
the freshness of what is flowing from the vein. And it is "perpetual"
and "constant" like a fountain that always flows - for it is by a
sacrifice whose power is perpetual and unchanging.

Which he hath consecrated for us - Margin, "or new made." The word here
used means properly to renew, and then to initiate, to consecrate, to
sanction. The idea is, that he has dedicated this way for our use; as if
a temple or house were set apart for our service. It is a part
consecrated by him for the service and salvation of man; a way of access
to the eternal sanctuary for the sinner which has been set apart by the
Redeemer for this service alone.

Through the veil, that is to say, his flesh - The Jewish high priest
entered into the most holy place through the veil that divided the holy
from the most holy place. That entrance was made by his drawing the veil
aside, and thus the interior sanctuary was laid open. But there has been
much difficulty felt in regard to the sense of the expression used here.
The plain meaning of the expression is, that the way to heaven was
opened by means, or through the medium of the flesh of Jesus; that is,
of his body sacrificed for sin, as the most holy place in the temple was
entered by means or through the medium of the veil. We are not to
suppose, however, that the apostle meant to say that there was in all
respects a resemblance between the veil and the flesh of Jesus, nor that
the veil was in any manner typical of his body, but there was a
resemblance in the respect under consideration - to wit, in the fact
that the holy place was rendered accessible by withdrawing the veil, and
that heaven was rendered accessible through the slain body of Jesus. The
idea is, that there is by means both of the veil of the temple, and of
the body of Jesus, a medium of access to God. God dwelt in the most holy
place in the temple behind the veil by visible symbols, and was to be
approached by removing the veil; and God dwells in heaven, in the most
holy place there, and is to be approached only through the offering of
the body of Christ. Prof. Stuart supposes that the point of the
comparison may be, that the veil of the temple operated as a screen to
hide the visible symbol of the presence of God from human view, and that
in like manner the body of Jesus might be regarded as a "kind of
temporary tabernacle, or veil of the divine nature which dwelt within
him." and that "as the veil of the tabernacle concealed the glory of
Yahweh in the holy of holies, from the view of people, so Christ's flesh
or body screened or concealed the higher nature from our view, which
dwelt within this veil, as God did of old within the veil of the
temple."

See this and other views explained at length in the larger commentaries.
It does not seem to me to be necessary to attempt to carry out the point
of the comparison in all respects. The simple idea which seems to have
been in the mind of the apostle was, that the veil of the temple and the
body of Jesus were alike in this respect, that they were the medium of
access to God. It is by the offering of the body of Jesus; by the fact
that he was clothed with flesh, and that in his body he made an
atonement for sin, and that with his body raised up from the dead he has
ascended to heaven, that we have access now to the throne of mercy.

[Hebrews 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 10:21</span></span>

And having an High Priest over the house of God - Over the spiritual
house of God; that is, the church; compare the notes on [Heb
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md). Under the Jewish dispensation
there was a great high priest, and the same is true under the Christian
dispensation. This the apostle had shown at length in the previous part
of the Epistle. The idea here is, that as under the former dispensation
it was regarded as a privilege that the people of God might have access
to the mercy-seat by means of the high priest; so it is true in a much
higher sense that we may now have access to God through our greater and
more glorious High Priest.

[Hebrews 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 10:22</span></span>

Let us draw near with a true heart - In prayer and praise; in every act
of confidence and of worship. A sincere heart was required under the
ancient dispensation; it is always demanded of people when they draw
near to God to worship him; see [Joh
4:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md). Every form of religion which
God has revealed requires the worshippers to come with pure and holy
hearts.

In full assurance of faith - see the word used here explained in the
notes on [Heb 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md). The "full
assurance of faith" means unwavering confidence; a fulness of faith in
God which leaves no room for doubt. Christians are permitted to come
thus because God has revealed himself through the Redeemer as in every
way deserving their fullest confidence. No one approaches God in an
acceptable manner who does not come to him in this manner. What parent
would feel that a child came with any right feelings to ask a favour of
him who had not "the fullest confidence in him?"

("This πληροφορια plērophoria, or full assurance of faith, is not, as
many imagine, absolute certainty of a man's own particular salvation,
for that is termed "the full assurance of hope," [Heb
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md), and arises from faith and its
fruits. But the full assurance of faith is the assurance of that truth,
which is testified and proposed in the gospel, to all the hearers of it
in common, to be believed by them, unto their salvation, and is also
termed the full assurance of understanding; [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md). Though all that the gospel
reveals, claims the full assurance of faith, yet here it seems more
particularly to respect the efficacy and all-sufficiency of Christ's
offering for procuring pardon and acceptance." - McLean.

Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience - By the blood of
Jesus. This was prepared to make the conscience pure. The Jewish
cleansing or sprinkling with blood related only to what was external,
and could not make the conscience perfect [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md), but the sacrifice offered by the
Saviour was designed to give peace to the troubled mind, and to make it
pure and holy. An "evil conscience" is a consciousness of evil, or a
conscience oppressed with sin; that is, a conscience that accuses of
guilt. We are made free from such a conscience through the atonement of
Jesus, not because we become convinced that we have not committed sin,
and not because we are led to suppose that our sins are less than we had
otherwise supposed - for the reverse of both these is true - but because
our sins are forgiven, and since they are freely pardoned they no longer
produce remorse and the fear of future wrath. A child that has been
forgiven may feel that he has done very wrong, but still he will not be
then overpowered with distress in view of his guilt, or with the
apprehension of punishment.

And our bodies washed with pure water - It was common for the Jews to
wash themselves, or to perform various ablutions in their services; see
[Exo 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#004.md); [Exo
30:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#019.md); [Exo
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#012.md); [Lev
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#027.md); [Lev
13:54](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#054.md), [Lev
13:58](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#058.md); [Lev
14:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#008.md); [Lev
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#016.md); [Lev
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004.md), [Lev
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#024.md); [Lev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#006.md); compare the notes on [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md). The same thing was also true
among the pagan. There was usually, at the entrance of their temples, a
vessel placed with consecrated water, in which, as Pliny says (Hist.
Nat. lib. 15:c. 30), there was a branch of laurel placed with which the
priests sprinkled all who approached for worship. It was necessary that
this water should be pure, and it was drawn fresh from wells or
fountains for the purpose. Water from pools and ponds was regarded as
unsuitable, as was also even the purest water of the fountain, if it had
stood long. AEneas sprinkled himself in this manner, as he was about to
enter the invisible world (Aeneid vi. 635), with fresh water.

Porphyry says that the Essenes were accustomed to cleanse themselves
with the purest water. Thus, Ezekiel also says, "Then will I sprinkle
clean water upon you, and you shall be clean." Sea-water was usually
regarded as best adapted to this purpose, as the salt was supposed to
have a cleansing property. The Jews who dwelt near the sea, were thence
accustomed, as Aristides says, to wash their hands every morning on this
account in the sea-water. Potter's Greek Archae. i. 222. Rosenmuller,
Alte und Neue Morgenland, in loc. It was from the pagan custom of
placing a vessel with consecrated water at the entrance of their
temples, that the Roman Catholic custom is derived in their churches of
placing "holy water" near the door, that those who worship there may
"cross themselves." In accordance with the Jewish custom, the apostle
says, that it was proper that under the Christian dispensation we should
approach God, having performed an act emblematic of purity by the
application of water to the body.

That there is an allusion to baptism is clear. The apostle is comparing
the two dispensations, and his aim is to show that in the Christian
dispensation there was everything which was regarded as valuable and
important in the old. So he had shown it to have been in regard to the
fact that there was a Lawgiver; that there was a great High Priest; and
that there were sacrifices and ordinances of religion in the Christian
dispensation as well as the Jewish. In regard to each of these, he had
shown that they existed in the Christian religion in a much more
valuable and important sense than under the ancient dispensation. In
like manner it was true, that as they were required to come to the
service of God, having performed various ablutions to keep the body
pure, so it was with Christians. Water was applied to the Jews as
emblematic of purity, and Christians came, having had it applied to them
also in baptism, as a symbol of holiness.

It is not necessary, in order to see the force of this, to suppose that
water had been applied to the whole of the body, or that they had been
completely immersed, for all the force of the reasoning is retained by
the supposition that it was a mere symbol or emblem of purification. The
whole stress of the argument here turns, not on the fact that the body
had been washed all over, but that the worshipper had been qualified for
the spiritual service of the Most High in connection with an appropriate
emblematic ceremony. The quantity of water used for this is not a
material point, any more than the quantity of oil was in the ceremony of
inaugurating kings and priests. This was not done in the Christian
dispensation by washing the body frequently, as in the ancient system,
nor even necessarily by washing the whole body - which would no more
contribute to the purity of the heart than by application of water to
any part of the body, but by the fact that water had been used as
emblematic of the purifying of the soul. The passage before us proves,
undoubtedly:

\(1\) that water should be applied under the new dispensation as an
ordinance of religion; and,

\(2\) that pure water should be used - for that only is a proper emblem
of the purity of the heart.

[Hebrews 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 10:23</span></span>

Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering - To
secure this was one of the leading designs of this Epistle, and hence,
the apostle adverts to it so frequently. It is evident that those whom
he wrote were suffering persecution Heb. 12, and that there was great
danger that they would apostatize. As these persecutions came probably
from the Jews, and as the aim was to induce them to return to their
former opinions, the object of the apostle is to show that there was in
the Christian scheme every advantage of which the Jews could boast;
everything pertaining to the dignity of the great Founder of the system,
the character of the High Priest, and the nature and value of the
sacrifices offered, and that all this was possessed far more abundantly
in the permanent Christian system than in what was typical in its
character, and which were designed soon to vanish away. In view of all
this, therefore, the apostle adds that they should hold fast the
profession of their faith without being shaken by their trials, or by
the arguments of their enemies. We have the same inducement to hold fast
the profession of our faith - for it is the same religion still; we have
the same Saviour, and there is held out to us still the same prospect of
heaven.

For he is faithful that promised - To induce them to hold fast their
profession, the apostle adds this additional consideration. God, who had
promised eternal life to them, was faithful to all that he had said. The
argument here is:

\(1\) that since God is so faithful to us, we ought to be faithful to
him;

\(2\) the fact that he is faithful is an encouragement to us.

We are dependent on him for grace to hold fast our profession. If he
were to prove unfaithful, we should have no strength to do it. But this
he never does; and we may be assured, that all that he has promised he
will perform. To the service of such a God, therefore, we should adhere
without wavering; compare the notes on [Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md).

[Hebrews 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 10:24</span></span>

And let us consider one another - Let us so regard the welfare of others
as to endeavor to excite them to persevere in the Christian life. The
idea is, that much might be done, in securing perseverance and fidelity,
by mutual kind exhortation. They were not to be selfish; they were not
to regard their own interests only (notes, [Phi
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004).md); they were to have a kind
sympathy in the concerns of each other. They had, as Christians have
now, the same duties to perform, and the same trials to meet, and they
should strengthen each other in their trials and encourage them in their
work.

To provoke unto love - We use the word "provoke" now in a somewhat
different sense, as meaning to offend, to irritate, to incense; but its
original meaning is to "arouse, to excite, to call into action," and it
is used in this sense here. The Greek is, literally, "unto a paroxysm of
love" - εἰς παροξυσμον eis paroxusmon - the word "paroxysm" meaning
"excitement or impulse," and the idea is, that they were to endeavor to
arouse or excite each other to the manifestation of love. The word is
what properly expresses excitement, and means that Christians should
endeavor to excite each other. Men are sometimes afraid of excitement in
religion. But there is no danger that Christians will ever be excited to
love each other too much, or to perform too many good works.

[Hebrews 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 10:25</span></span>

Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together - That is, for
purposes of public worship. Some expositors have understood the word
rendered here as "assembling" - ἐπισυναγωγὴν episunagōgēn - as meaning
"the society of Christians," or the church; and they have supposed that
the object of the apostle here is, to exhort them. not to apostatize
from the church. The arguments for this opinion may be seen at length in
Kuinoel, in loc. But the more obvious interpretation is what is commonly
adopted, that it refers to public worship. The Greek word (the noun) is
used nowhere else in the New Testament, except in [Th2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md), where it is rendered "gathering
together." The verb is used in [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md); [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md); [Mar
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#033.md); [Mar
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#027.md); [Luk
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md); [Luk
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034.md), in all which places it is
rendered "gathered together." It properly means an act of assembling, or
a gathering together, and is nowhere used in the New Testament in the
sense of an assembly, or the church. The command, then, here is, to meet
together for the worship of God, and it is enjoined on Christians as an
important duty to do it. It is implied, also, that there is blame or
fault where this is "neglected."

As the manner of some is - Why those here referred to neglected public
worship, is not specified. It may have been from such causes as the
following:

\(1\) some may have been deterred by the fear of persecution, as those
who were thus assembled would be more exposed to danger than others.

\(2\) some may have neglected the duty because they felt no interest in
it - as professing Christians now sometimes do.

\(3\) it is possible that some may have had doubts about the necessity
and propriety of this duty, and on that account may have neglected it.

\(4\) or it may perhaps have been, though we can hardly suppose that
this reason existed, that some may have neglected it from a cause which
now sometimes operates - from dissatisfaction with a preacher, or with
some member or members of the church, or with some measure in the
church.

Whatever were the reasons, the apostle says that they should not be
allowed to operate, but that Christians should regard it as a sacred
duty to meet together for the worship of God. None of the causes above
suggested should deter people from this duty. With all who bear the
Christian name, with all who expect to make advances in piety and
religious knowledge, it should be regarded as a sacred duty to assemble
together for public worship. Religion is social; and our graces are to
be strengthened and invigorated by waiting together on the Lord. There
is an obvious propriety that people should assemble together for the
worship of the Most High, and no Christian can hope that his graces will
grow, or that he can perform his duty to his Maker, without uniting thus
with those who love the service of God.

But exhorting one another - That is, in your assembling together a
direction which proves that it is proper for Christians to exhort one
another when they are gathered together for public worship. Indeed there
is reason to believe that the preaching in the early Christian
assemblies partook much of the character of mutual exhortation.

And so much the more as ye see the day approaching - The term "day" here
refers to some event which was certainly anticipated, and which was so
well understood by them that no particular explanation was necessary. It
was also some event that was expected soon to occur, and in relation to
which there were indications then of its speedily arriving. If it had
not been something which was expected soon to happen, the apostle would
have gone into a more full explanation of it, and would have stated at
length what these indications were. There has been some diversity of
opinion about what is here referred to, many commentators supposing that
the reference is to the anticipated second coming of the Lord Jesus to
set up a visible kingdom on the earth; and others to the fact that the
period was approaching when Jerusalem was to be destroyed, and when the
services of the temple were to cease. So far as the language is
concerned, the reference might be to either event, for the word a "day"
is applied to both in the New Testament. The word would properly be
understood as referring to an expected period when something remarkable
was to happen which ought to have an important influence on their
character and conduct. In support of the opinion that it refers to the
approaching destruction of Jerusalem, and not to the coming of the Lord
Jesus to set up a visible kingdom, we may adduce the following
considerations:

\(1\) The term used - "day" - will as properly refer to that event as to
any other. It is a word which would be likely to suggest the idea of
distress, calamity, or judgment of some kind, for so it is often used in
the Scriptures; comp [Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md); [Sa1
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#010.md); [Jer
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007.md); [Eze
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#005.md); notes [Isa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012.md).

\(2\) such a period was distinctly predicted by the Saviour, and the
indications which would precede it were clearly pointed out; see Matt.
24. That event was then so near that the Saviour said that "that
generation would not pass" until the prediction had been fulfilled; [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034).(3.md) The destruction of Jerusalem
was an event of great importance to the Hebrews, and to the Hebrew
Christians to whom this Epistle was directed, and it might be reasonable
to suppose that the apostle Paul would refer to it.

\(4\) it is not improbable that at the time of writing this Epistle
there were indications that that day was approaching. Those indications
were of so marked a character that when the time approached they could
not well be mistaken (see [Mat
24:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006.md), [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024.md), [Mat
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#026).md), and it is probable that they
had already begun to appear.

\(5\) there were no such indications that the Lord Jesus was about to
appear to set up a visible kingdom. It was not a fact that that was
about to occur, as the result has shown; nor is there any positive proof
that the mass of Christians were expecting it, and no reason to believe
that the apostle Paul had any such expectation; see [Th2
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md).

\(6\) the expectation that the destruction of Jerusalem was referred to,
and was about to occur, was just what might be expected to produce the
effect on the minds of the Hebrew Christians which the apostle here
refers to. It was to be a solemn and fearful event. It would be a
remarkable manifestation of God. It would break up the civil and
ecclesiastical polity of the nation, and would scatter them abroad. It
would require all the exercise of their patience and faith in passing
through these scenes. It might be expected to be a time when many would
be tempted to apostatize, and it was proper, therefore, to exhort them
to meet together, and to strengthen and encourage each other as they saw
that that event was drawing near. The argument then would be this. The
danger against which the apostle desired to guard those to whom he was
writing was, that of apostasy from Christianity to Judaism. To preserve
them from this, he urges the fact that the downfall of Judaism was near,
and that every indication which they saw of its approach ought to be
allowed to influence them, and to guard them from that danger.

It is for reasons such as these that I suppose the reference here is not
to the "second advent" of the Redeemer, but to the approaching
destruction of Jerusalem. At the same time, it is not improper to use
this passage as an exhortation to Christians to fidelity when they shall
see that the end of the world draws nigh, and when they shall perceive
indications that the Lord Jesus is about to come. And so of death. We
should be the more diligent when we see the indications that the great
Messenger is about to come to summon us into the presence of our final
Judge. And who does not know that he is approaching him with silent and
steady footsteps, and that even now he may be very near? Who can fail to
see in himself indications that the time approaches when he must lie
down and die? Every pang that we suffer should remind us of this; and
when the hair changes its hue, and time makes furrows in the cheek, and
the limbs become feeble, we should regard them as premonitions that he
is coming, and should be more diligent as we see that be is drawing
near.

[Hebrews 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 10:26</span></span>

For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the
truth - If after we are converted and become true Christians we should
apostatize, it would be impossible to be recovered again, for there
would be no other sacrifice for sin; no way by which we could be saved.
This passage, however, like [Heb
6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md), has given rise to much
difference of opinion. But that the above is the correct interpretation,
seems evident to me from the following considerations:

\(1\) It is the natural and obvious interpretation, such as would occur
probably to ninety-nine readers in a hundred, if there were no theory to
support, and no fear that it would conflict with some other doctrine.

\(2\) it accords with the scope of the Epistle, which is, to keep those
whom the apostle addressed from returning again to the Jewish religion,
under the trials to which they were subjected.

\(3\) it is in accordance with the fair meaning of the language - the
words "after that we have received the knowledge of the truth,"
referring more naturally to true conversion than to any other state of
mind.

\(4\) the sentiment would not be correct if it referred to any but real
Christians. It would not be true that one who had been somewhat
enlightened, and who then sinned "wilfully," must look on fearfully to
the judgment without a possibility of being saved. There are multitudes
of cases where such persons are saved. They "wilfully" resist the Holy
Spirit; they strive against him; they for a long time refuse to yield,
but they are brought again to reflection, and are led to give their
hearts to God.

\(5\) it is true, and always will be true, that if a sincere Christian
should apostatize he could never be converted again; see the notes on
[Heb 6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md). The reasons are obvious.
He would have tried the only plan of salvation, and it would have
failed. He would have embraced the Saviour, and there would not have
been efficacy enough in his blood to keep him, and there would be no
more powerful Saviour and no more efficacious blood of atonement. He
would have renounced the Holy Spirit, and would have shown that his
influences were not effectual to keep him, and there would be no other
agent of greater power to renew and save him after he had apostatized.
For these reasons it seems clear to me that this passage refers to true
Christians, and that the doctrine here taught is, that if such an one
should apostatize, he must look forward only to the terrors of the
judgment, and to final condemnation.

Whether this in fact ever occurs, is quite another question. In regard
to that inquiry, see the notes on [Heb
6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md). If this view be correct, we may
add, that the passage should not be regarded as applying to what is
commonly known as the "sin against the Holy Spirit," or "the
unpardonable sin." The word rendered "wilfully" - ἑκουσίως hekousiōs -
occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, except in [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md), where it is rendered "willingly"
- "taking the oversight thereof (of the church) not by constraint, but
willingly." It properly means, "willingly, voluntarily, of our own
accord," and applies to cases where no constraint is used. It is not to
be construed here strictly, or metaphysically, for all sin is voluntary,
or is committed willingly, but must refer to a deliberate act, where a
man means to abandon his religion, and to turn away from God. If it were
to be taken with metaphysical exactness, it would demonstrate that every
Christian who ever does anything wrong, no matter how small, would be
lost.

But this cannot, from the nature of the case, be the meaning. The
apostle well knew that Christians do commit such sins (see the notes on
Rom. 7), and his object here is not to set forth the danger of such
sins, but to guard Christians against apostasy from their religion. In
the Jewish Law, as is indeed the case everywhere, a distinction is made
between sins of oversight, inadvertence, or ignorance, ([Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md), [Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), [Lev
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md), [Lev
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027.md); [Lev
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015.md); [Num
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#024.md), [Num
15:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#027.md); compare [Act
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md); [Act
17:30](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030).md), and sins of presumption; sins
that are deliberately and intentionally committed; see [Exo
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014.md); [Num
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md); [Deu
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012.md); [Psa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013.md). The apostle here has reference,
evidently, to such a distinction, and means to speak of a decided and
deliberate purpose to break away from the restraints and obligations of
the Christian religion.

There remaineth no more sacrifice for sins - Should a man do this, there
is no sacrifice for sins which could save him. He would have rejected
deliberately the only atonement made for sin, and there will be no other
made. It is as if a man should reject the only medicine that could heal
him, or push away the only boat that could save him when shipwrecked;
see notes, [Heb 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006.md). The sacrifice
made for sin by the Redeemer is never to be repeated, and if that is
deliberately rejected, the soul must be lost.

[Hebrews 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 10:27</span></span>

But a certain fearful looking for of judgment - The word "certain" here
does not mean "fixed, sure, inevitable," as our translation would seem
to imply. The Greek is the same as "a (τις tis) fearful expectation,"
etc. So it is rendered by Tyndale. The idea is, that if there was
voluntary apostasy after having embraced the Christian religion, there
could be nothing but an expectation of the judgment to come. There could
be no other hope but that through the gospel, and as this would have
been renounced, it would follow that the soul must perish. The "fearful
apprehension" or expectation here does not refer so much to what would
be in the mind itself, or what would be experienced, as to what must
follow. It might be that the person referred to would have no realizing
sense of all this, and still his situation be that of one who had
nothing to expect but the terrors of the judgment to come.

And fiery indignation - Fire is often used in the Scriptures as an
emblem of fierce punishment. The idea is, that the person referred to
could expect nothing but the wrath of God.

Which shall devour the adversaries - All who become the adversaries or
enemies of the Lord. Fire is often said to devour, or consume, and the
meaning here is, that those who should thus become the enemies of the
Lord must perish.

[Hebrews 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 10:28</span></span>

He that despised Moses' law - That is, the apostate from the religion of
Moses. It does not mean that in all cases the offender against the Law
of Moses died without mercy, but only where offences were punishable
with death, and probably the apostle had in his eye particularly the
case of apostasy from the Jewish religion. The subject of apostasy from
the Christian religion is particularly under discussion here, and it was
natural to illustrate this by a reference to a similar case under the
Law of Moses. The Law in regard to apostates from the Jewish religion
was positive. There was no reprieve; [Deu
13:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md).

Died without mercy - That is, there was no provision for pardon.

Under two or three witnesses - It was the settled law among the Hebrews
that in all cases involving capital punishment, two or three witnesses
should be necessary. That is, no one was to be executed unless two
persons certainly bore testimony, and it was regarded as important, if
possible, that three witnesses should concur in the statement. The
object was the security of the accused person if innocent. The
"principle" in the Law was, that it was to be presumed that two or three
persons would be much less likely to conspire to render a false
testimony than one would be, and that two or three would not be likely
to be deceived in regard to a fact which they had observed.

[Hebrews 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">heb 10:29</span></span>

Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy -
That is, he who renounces Christianity ought to be regarded as deserving
a much severer punishment than the man who apostatized from the Jewish
religion, and if he ought to be so regarded he will be - for God will
treat every man as he ought to be treated. This must refer to future
punishment, for the severest punishment was inflicted on the apostate
from the Jewish religion which can be in this world - death; and yet the
apostle here says that a severer punishment than that would be deserved
by him who should apostatize from the Christian faith. The reasons why
so much severer punishment would be deserved, are such as these - the
Author of the Christian system was far more exalted than Moses, the
founder of the Jewish system; he had revealed more important truths; he
had increased and confirmed the motives to holiness; he had furnished
more means for leading a holy life; he had given himself as a sacrifice
to redeem the soul from death, and he had revealed with far greater
clearness the truth that there is a heaven of glory and of holiness. He
who should apostatize from the Christian faith, the apostle goes on to
say, would also be guilty of the most aggravated crime of which man
could be guilty - the crime of trampling under foot the Son of God, of
showing contempt for his holy blood. and despising the Spirit of grace.

Who hath trodden under foot the Son of God - This language is taken
either from the custom of ancient conquerors who were accustomed to
tread on the necks of their enemies in token of their being subdued, or
from the fact that people tread on what they despise and contemn. The
idea is, that he who should apostatize from the Christian faith would
act as if he should indignantly and contemptuously trample on God's only
Son. What crime could be more aggravated than this?

And hath counted the blood of the covenant - The blood of Jesus by which
the new covenant between God and man was ratified; see the notes on [Heb
9:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md); compare the notes on [Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md).

Wherewith he was sanctified - Made holy, or set apart to the service of
God. The word "sanctify" is used in both these senses. Prof. Stuart
renders it, "by which expiation is made;" and many others, in accordance
with this view, have supposed that it refers to the Lord Jesus. But it
seems to me that it refers to the person who is here supposed to
renounce the Christian religion, or to apostatize from it. The reasons
for this are such as these:

\(1\) it is the natural and proper meaning of the word rendered here
"sanctified." This word is commonly applied to Christians in the sense
that they are made holy; see [Act
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md); [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018.md); [Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md); [Jde
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001.md); compare [Joh
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036.md); [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md).

\(2\) it is unusual to apply this word to the Saviour. It is true,
indeed, that he says [Joh 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md), "for
their sakes I sanctify myself," but there is no instance in which he
says that he was sanctified by his own blood. And where is there an
instance in which the word is used as meaning "to make expiations?"

\(3\) the supposition that it refers to one who is here spoken of as in
danger of apostasy, and not of the Lord Jesus, agrees with the scope of
the argument. The apostle is showing the great guilt, and the certain
destruction, of one who should apostatize from the Christian religion.
In doing this it was natural to speak of the dishonor which would thus
be done to the means which had been used for his sanctification - the
blood of the Redeemer. It would be treating it as if it were a common
thing, or as if it might be disregarded like anything else which was of
no value.

An unholy thing - Greek common; often used in the sense of unholy. The
word is so used because what was holy was separated from a common to a
sacred use. What was not thus consecrated was free to all, or was for
common use, and hence, also the word is used to denote what is unholy.

And hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace - The Holy Spirit, called
"the Spirit of grace," because he confers favor (grace) upon people. The
meaning of the phrase "done despite unto" - ἐνυβρίσας enubrisas - is,
"having reproached, or treated with malignity, or contempt." The idea
is, that if they were thus to apostatize, they would by such an act
treat the Spirit of God with disdain and contempt. It was by him that
they had been renewed; by him that they had been brought to embrace the
Saviour and to love God; by him that they had any holy feelings or pure
desires; and if they now apostatized from religion, such an act would be
in fact treating the Holy Spirit with the highest indignity. It would be
saying that all his influences were valueless, and that they needed no
help from him. From such considerations, the apostle shows that if a
true Christian were to apostatize, nothing would remain for him but the
terrific prospect of eternal condemnation. He would have rejected the
only Saviour; he would have in fact treated him with the highest
indignity; he would have considered his sacred blood, shed to sanctify
people, as a common thing, and would have shown the highest disregard
for the only agent who can save the soul - the Spirit of God. How could
such an one afterward be saved? The apostle does not indeed say that
anyone ever would thus apostatize from the true religion, nor is there
any reason to believe that such a case ever has occurred, but if it
should occur the doom would be inevitable. How dangerous then is every
step which would lead to such a precipice! And how strange and
unscriptural the opinion held by so many that sincere Christians may
"fall away" and be renewed, again and again!

(See the supplementary note on [Heb
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006.md). where certain principles are laid
down, for the interpretation of this and similar passages, in
consistency with the doctrine of the saints' perseverance. If that
doctrine be maintained, and our author's view of the passage at the same
be correct, then plainly it contains an impossible case. It is
descriptive of real Christians, yet they never can fall away. The
utility of the warning, in this case, may indeed successfully be
vindicated, on the ground that it is the means of preventing apostasy in
the saints, the means by which the decree of God in reference to their
stability is effected. Most, however, will incline to the view which
regards this case, as something more than imaginary, as possible, as
real. The warning is addressed to professors generally, without any
attempt of distinguishing or separating into true or false. Doubtless
there might be some even of the latter class in the churches whose
members the apostles, presuming on their professed character, addressed
as "saints, "elect," and "faithful," without distinction.

Of course, in consistency with the doctrine of perseverance only the
"false," in whom the "root of the matter" had never existed, could
apostatize; yet at the same time, when no distinction was made, when the
apostle made none, but addressed all in the language of charity, when
Christians themselves might find it difficult at all times to affirm
decidedly on their own case, universal vigilance was secured, or at all
events designed. But is not the party whose apostasy is here supposed,
described by two attributes which belong to none but genuine Christians,
namely, the "reception of the knowledge of the truth," and
"sanctification through the blood of the covenant?" The answer which has
been given to this question is generally, that neither of these things
necessarily involves more than external dedication to God. The first is
parallel to the "once enlightened" of [Heb
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md), and of course admits of the same
explanation; see supplementary note there.

The second thing, namely, the sanctification of the party "is not real
or internal sanctification, and all the disputes concerning the total
and final apostasy from the faith of them who have been really and
internally sanctified from this place, are altogether vain. As at the
giving of the Law, the people being sprinkled with blood, were
sanctified or dedicated to God in a special manner, so those who, by
baptism and confession of faith in the church of Christ, were separated
from all others were especially dedicated to God thereby." - "Owen."
Yet, this eminent writer is rather disposed to adopt the opinion of
those who construe, ἐν ᾡ ἡγιασθη en hō hēgiasthē with the immediate
antecedent, τον Υἱον του Θεου ton Huion tou Theou, thus referring the
sanctification to Christ, and not to the apostate; see [Joh
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md). Whichever of these views we
receive, the great doctrine of perseverance is, of course, unaffected.
In reference to an objection which the author has urged that "the
sentiment (in the [Heb 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md) and [Heb
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027) verses.md) would not be correct, if
it referred to any but true Christians," let it be noticed that while
many may be saved, who have long resisted the Spirit, yet the assertion
must appear hazardous in the extreme, that any can be saved, who do all
that the apostate in this passage is alleged to do. The sin described
seems to be that of a determined, insulting, final rejection of the only
remedy for sin.)

[Hebrews 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">heb 10:30</span></span>

For we know him that hath said - We know who has said this - God. They
knew this because it was recorded in their own sacred books.

Vengeance belongeth unto me ... - This is found in [Deu
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md); see it explained in the notes
on [Rom 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md). It is there quoted to
show that we should not avenge ourselves; it is here quoted to show that
God will certainly inflict punishment on those who deserve it. If any
should apostatize in the manner here referred to by the apostle, they
would, says he, be guilty of great and unparalleled wickedness, and
would have the certainty that they must meet the wrath of God.

And again, The Lord shall judge his people - This is quoted from [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md). That is, he will judge them
when they deserve it, and punish them if they ought to be punished. The
mere fact that they are his people will not save them from punishment if
they deserve it, any more than the fact that one is a beloved child will
save him from correction when he does wrong. This truth was abundantly
illustrated in the history of the Israelites; and the same great
principle would be applied should any sincere Christian apostatize from
his religion. He would have before him the certainty of the most fearful
and severe of all punishments.

[Hebrews 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">heb 10:31</span></span>

It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God - There
may be an allusion here to the request of David to "fall into the hands
of the Lord and not into the hands of men," when it was submitted to him
for the sin of numbering the people, whether he would choose seven years
of famine, or flee three months before his enemies, or have three days
of pestilence; 2 Sam. 24. He preferred "to fall into the hands of the
Lord," and God smote seventy thousand men by the pestilence. The idea
here is, that to fall into the hands of the Lord, after having despised
his mercy and rejected his salvation, would be terrific; and the fear of
this should deter from the commission of the dreadful crime. The phrase
"living God" is used in the Scripture in opposition to "idols." God
always lives; his power is capable of being always exerted. He is not
like the idols of wood or stone which have no life, and which are not to
be dreaded, but he always lives. It is the more fearful to fall into his
hands because he will live "forever." A man who inflicts punishment will
die, and the punishment will come to an end; but God will never cease to
exist, and the punshment which he is capable of inflicting today he will
be capable of inflicting forever and ever. To fall into his hands,
therefore, "for the purpose of punishment" - which is the idea here - is
fearful:

\(1\) because he has all power, and can inflict just what punishment he
pleases;

\(2\) because he is strictly just, and will inflict the punishment which
ought to be inflicted;

\(3\) because he lives forever, and can carry on his purpose of
punishment to eternal ages; and

\(4\) because the actual inflictions of punishment which have occurred
show what is to be dreaded.

So it was on the old world; on the cities of the plain; on Babylon,
Idumea, Capernaum, and Jerusalem; and so it is in the world of wo - the
eternal abodes of despair, where the worm never dies. All people must,
in one sense, fall into his hands. They must appear before him. They
must be brought to his bar when they die. How unspeakably important it
is then now to embrace his offers of salvation, that we may not fall
into his hands as a righteous, avenging judge, and sink beneath his
uplifted arm forever!

[Hebrews 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">heb 10:32</span></span>

But call to remembrance the former days - It would seem from this, that
at the time when the apostle wrote this Epistle they were suffering some
severe trials, in which they were in great danger of apostatizing from
their religion. It is also manifest that they had on some former
occasion endured a similar trial, and had been enabled to bear it with a
Christian spirit, and with resignation. The object of the apostle now is
to remind them that they were sustained under those trials, and he would
encourage them now to similar patience by the recollection of the grace
then conferred on them. What was the nature of their former trials, or
of what they were then experiencing, is not certainly known. It would
seem probable, however, that the reference in both instances is to some
form of persecution by their own countrymen. The meaning is, "that when
we have been enabled to pass through trials once, we are to make the
remembrance of the grace then bestowed on us a means of supporting and
encouraging us in future trials."

After ye were illuminated - After you became Christians, or were
enlightened to see the truth. This phrase, referring here undoubtedly to
the fact that they were Christians, may serve to explain the disputed
phrase in [Heb 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md); see notes on that
passage.

A great fight of afflictions - The language here seems to be taken from
the Grecian games. The word "fight" means properly contention, combat,
such as occurred in the public games. Here the idea is, that in the
trials referred to, they had a great struggle; that is, a struggle to
maintain their faith without wavering, or against those who would have
led them to apostatize from their religion. Some of the circumstances
attending this conflict are alluded to in the following verses.

[Hebrews 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">heb 10:33</span></span>

Partly - That is, your affliction consisted partly in this. The Greek
is, "this" - specifying one kind of affliction that they were called to
endure.

Whilst ye were made a gazing-stock - Greek θεατριζόμενοι theatrizomenoi
- you were made a public spectacle, as if in a theater; you were held up
to public view, or exposed to public scorn. When this was done, or in
precisely what manner, we are not told. It was not an uncommon thing,
however, for the early Christians to be held up to reproach and scorn,
and probably this refers to some time when it was done by rulers or
magistrates. It was a common custom among the Greeks and Romans to lead
criminals, before they were put to death, through the theater, and thus
to expose them to the insults and reproaches of the multitude. See the
proofs of this adduced by Kuinoel on this passage. The "language" here
seems to have been taken from this custom, though there is no evidence
that the Christians to whom Paul refers had been treated in this manner.

By reproaches - Repreached as being the followers of Jesus of Nazareth;
probably as weak and fanatical.

And afflictions - Various "sufferings" inflicted on them. They were not
merely reviled in words, but they were made to endure positive
sufferings of various kinds.

And partly, while ye became companions of them that were so used - That
is, even when they had not themselves been subjected to these trials,
they had sympathized with those who were. They doubtless imparted to
them of their property; sent to them relief, and identified themselves
with them. It is not known to what particular occasion the apostle here
refers. In the next verse he mentions one instance in which they had
done this, in aiding him when he was a prisoner.

[Hebrews 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">heb 10:34</span></span>

For ye had compassion of me in my bonds - You sympathized with me when a
prisoner, and sent to my relief. It is not known to what particular
instance of imprisonment the apostle here refers. It is probable,
however, that it was on some occasion when he was a prisoner in Judea,
for the persons to whom this Epistle was sent most probably resided
there. Paul was at one time a prisoner more than two years at Cesarea
[Act 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#027.md), and during this time he
was kept in the charge of a centurion, and his friends had free access
to him; [Act 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023.md). It would seem not
improbable that this was the occasion to which he here refers.

And took joyfully the spoiling of your goods - The plunder of your
property. It was not an uncommon thing for the early Christians to be
plundered. This was doubtless a part of the "afflictions" to which the
apostle refers in this case. The meaning is, that they yielded their
property not only without resistance, but with joy. They, in common with
all the early Christians, counted it a privilege and honor to suffer in
the cause of their Master; see the notes on [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md); compare [Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md). Men may be brought to such a
state of mind as to part with their property with joy. It is not usually
the case; but religion will enable a man to do it.

Knowing in yourselves - Marg "or, that ye have in yourselves; or, for
yourselves." The true rendering is, "knowing that ye have for
yourselves." It does not refer to any internal knowledge which they had
of this, but to the fact that they were assured that they had laid up
for themselves a better inheritance in heaven.

That ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance - Better than
any earthly possession, and more permanent. It is:

\(1\) better; it is worth more; it gives more comfort; it makes a man
really richer. The treasure laid up in heaven is worth more to a man
than all the wealth of Croesus. It will give him more solid peace and
comfort; will better serve his turn in the various situations in which
he may be placed in life, and will do more on the whole to make him
happy. It is not said here that property is worth nothing to a man -
which is not true, if he uses it well - but that the treasures of heaven
are worth more.

\(2\) it is more enduring. Property here soon vanishes. Riches take to
themselves wings and fly away, or at any rate all that we possess must
soon be left. But in heaven all is permanent and secure. No calamity of
war, pestilence, or famine; no change of times; no commercial
embarrassments; no failure of a crop, or a bank; no fraud of sharpers
and swindlers, and no act of a pick-pocket or highwayman can take it
away; nor does death ever come there to remove the inhabitants of heaven
from their "mansions." With this hope, therefore, Christians may
cheerfully see their earthly wealth vanish, for they can look forward to
their enduring and their better inheritance.

[Hebrews 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">heb 10:35</span></span>

Cast not away therefore your confidence - Greek "your boldness;"
referring to their confident hope in God. They were not to cast this
away, and to become timid, disheartened, and discouraged. They were to
bear up manfully under all their trials, and to maintain a steadfast
adherence to God and to his cause. The command is not to "cast this
away." Nothing could take it from them if they trusted in God, and it
could be lost only by their own neglect or imprudence. Rosenmuller
supposes (Alte und Neue Morgenland, "in loc.") that there may be an
allusion here to the disgrace which was attached to the act of a warrior
if he cast away his shield. Among the Greeks this was a crime which was
punishable with death. Alexander ab Alexand. Gen. Dier. L. ii c. 13.
Among the ancient Germans, Tacitus says, that to lose the shield in
battle was regarded as the deepest dishonor, and that those who were
guilty of it were not allowed to be present at the sacrifices or in the
assembly of the people. Many, says he, who had suffered this calamity,
closed their own lives with the baiter under the loss of honor. Tac.
Germ. c. 6. A similar disgrace would attend the Christian soldier if he
should cast away his shield of faith; compare the notes, [Eph
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016.md).

Which hath great recompense of reward - It will furnish a reward by the
peace of mind which it gives here, and will be connected with the
rewards of heaven.

[Hebrews 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">heb 10:36</span></span>

For ye have need of patience - They were then suffering, and in all
trials we have need of patience. We have need of it because there is in
us so much disposition to complain and repine; because our nature is
liable to sink under sufferings; and because our trials are often
protracted. All that Christians can do in such cases is to be patient -
to lie calmly in the hands of God, and submit to his will day by day,
and year by year; see [Jam 1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003.md);
notes, [Rom 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004.md).

That after ye have done the will of God - That is, in bearing trials,
for the reference here is particularly to afflictions.Ye might receive
the promise - The promised inheritance or reward - in heaven. It is
implied here that this promise will not be received unless we are
patient in our trials, and the prospect of this reward should encourage
us to endure them.

[Hebrews 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">heb 10:37</span></span>

For yet a little while - There seems to be an allusion here to what the
Saviour himself said, "A little while, and ye shall not see me; and
again, a little while and ye shall see me;" [Joh
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#016.md). Or more probably it may be to
[Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md). "For the vision is yet for
an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not he: though it
tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry." The
idea which the apostle means to convey evidently is, that the time of
their deliverance from their trials was not far remote.

And he that shall come will come - The reference here is, doubtless, to
the Messiah. But what "coming" of his is referred to here, is more
uncertain. Most probably the idea is, that the Messiah who was coming to
destroy Jerusalem, and to overthrow the Jewish power Matt. 24, would
soon do this. In this way he would put a period to their persecutions
and trials, as the power of the Jewish people to afflict them would be
at an end. A similar idea occurs in [Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028.md). "And when these things begin to
come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption
draweth nigh;" see the notes on that passage. The Christians in
Palestine were oppressed, reviled, and persecuted by the Jews. The
destruction of the city and the temple would put an end to that power,
and would be in fact the time of deliverance for those who had been
persecuted. In the passage before us, Paul intimates that that period
was not far distant. Perhaps there were already "signs" of his coming,
or indications that he was about to appear, and he therefore urges them
patiently to persevere in their fidelity to him during the little time
of trial that remained. The same encouragement and consolation may be
employed still. To all the afflicted it may be said that "he that shall
come will come" soon. The time of affiction is not long. Soon the
Redeemer will appear to deliver his afflicted people from all their
sorrow; to remove them from a world of pain and tears; and to raise
their bodies from the dust, and to receive them to mansions where trials
are forever unknown; [Joh 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003.md) note; 1
Thes. 4:13-18 notes.

[Hebrews 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">heb 10:38</span></span>

Now the just shall live by faith - This is a part of the quotation from
Habakkuk [Hab 2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md), which was
probably commenced in the previous verse; see the passage fully
explained in the notes on [Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md).
The meaning in the connection in which it stands here, in accordance
with the sense in which it was used by Habakkuk, is, that the righteous
should live by "continued confidence" in God. They should pass their
lives not in doubt, and fear, and trembling apprehension, but in the
exercise of a calm trust in God. In this sense it accords with the scope
of what the apostle is here saying. He is exhorting the Christians whom
he addressed, to perseverance in their religion even in the midst of
many persecutions. To encourage this he says, that it was a great
principle that the just, that is, all the pious, ought to live in the
constant exercise of "faith in God." They should not confide in their
own merits, works, or strength. They should exercise constant reliance
on their Maker, and he would keep them even unto eternal life. The sense
is, that a persevering confidence or belief in the Lord will preserve us
amidst all the trials and calamities to which we are exposed.

But if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him - This
also is a quotation from [Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), but
from the Septuagint, not from the Hebrew. "Why" the authors of the
Septuagint thus translated the passage, it is impossible now to say. The
Hebrew is rendered in the common version, "Behold, his soul which is
lifted up is not upright in him;" or more literally, "Behold the
scornful; his mind shall not be happy" (Stuart); or as Gesenius renders
it, "See, he whose soul is unbelieving shall, on this account, be
unhappy." The sentiment there is, that the scorner or unbeliever in that
day would be unhappy, or would not prosper - לה ישרה lo' yaasharaah. The
apostle has retained the general sense of the passage, and the idea
which he expresses is, that the unbeliever, or he who renounces his
religion, will incur the divine displeasure. He will be a man exposed to
the divine wrath; a man on whom God cannot look but with disapprobation.
By this solemn consideration, therefore, the apostle urges on them the
importance of perseverance, and the guilt and danger of apostasy from
the Christian faith. If such a case should occur, no matter what might
have been the former condition, and no matter what love or zeal might
have been evinced, yet such an apostasy would expose the individual to
the certain wrath of God. His former love could not save him, any more
than the former obedience of the angels saved them from the horrors of
eternal chains and darkness, or than the holiness in which Adam was
created saved him and his posterity from the calamities which his
apostasy incurred.

[Hebrews 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">heb 10:39</span></span>

But we are not of them ... - We who are true Christians do not belong to
such a class. In this the apostle expresses the fullest conviction that
none of those to whom he wrote would apostatize. The case which he had
been describing was only a supposable case, not one which he believed
would occur. He had only been stating what "must" happen if a sincere
Christian should apostatize. But he did not mean to say that this
"would" occur in regard to them. or in any case. He made a statement of
a general principle under the divine administration, and he designed
that this should be a means of keeping them in the path to life. What
could be a more effectual means than the assurance that if a Christian
should apostatize "he must inevitably perish forever?" See the sentiment
in this verse illustrated at length in the notes on [Heb
6:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md).

Remarks

\(1\) It is a subject of rejoicing that we are brought under a more
perfect system than the ancient people of God were. We have not merely a
rude outline - a dim and shadowy sketch of religion, as they had. We are
not now required to go before a bloody altar every day, and lead up a
victim to be slain. We may come to the altar of God feeling that the
great sacrifice has been made, and that the last drop of blood to make
atonement has been shed. A pure, glorious, holy body was prepared for
the Great Victim, and in that body he did the will of God and died for
our sins; [Heb 10:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md).

\(2\) like that Great Redeemer, let us do the will of God. It may lead
us through sufferings, and we may he called to meet trials strongly
resembling his. But the will of God is to be done alike in bearing
trials, and in prayer and praise. "Obedience" is the great thing which
he demands; which he has always sought. When his ancient people led up
in faith, a lamb to the altar, still he preferred obedience to
sacrifice; and when his Son came into the world to teach us how to live,
and how to die, still the great thing was obedience. He came to
illustrate the nature of perfect conformity to the will of God, and he
did that by a most holy life, and by the most patient submission to all
the trials appointed him in his purpose to make atonement for the sins
of the world. Our model, alike in holy living and holy dying, is to be
the Saviour; and like him we are required to exercise simple submission
to the will of God; [Heb 10:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md).

\(3\) the Redeemer looks calmly forward to the time when all his foes
will be brought in submission to his feet; [Heb
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md), [Heb
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013.md). He is at the right hand of God.
His great work on earth is done. He is to suffer no more. He is exalted
beyond the possibility of pain and sorrow, and he is seated now on high
looking to the period when all his foes shall be subdued and he will be
acknowledged as universal Lord.

\(4\) the Christian has exalted advantages. He has access to the
mercy-seat of God. He may enter by faith into the "Holiest" - the very
heavens where God dwells. Christ, his great High Priest, has entered
there; has sprinkled over the mercy-seat with his blood, and ever lives
there to plead his cause. There is no privilege granted to people like
that of a near and constant access to the mercy-seat. This is the
privilege not of a few; and not to be enjoyed but once in a year, or at
distant intervals, but which the most humble Christian possesses, and
which may be enjoyed at all times, and in all places. There is not a
Christian so obscure, so poor, so ignorant that he may not come and
speak to God; and there is not a situation of poverty, want, or wo,
where he may not make his wants known with the assurance that his
prayers will be heard through faith in the great Redeemer; [Heb
10:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md).

\(5\) when we come before God, let our hearts be pure; [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md). The body has been washed with
pure water in baptism, emblematic of the purifying influences of the
Holy Spirit. Let the conscience be also pure. Let us lay aside every
unholy thought. Our worship will not be acceptable; our prayers will not
be heard, if it is not so. "If we regard iniquity in our hearts the Lord
will not hear us." No matter though there be a great High Priest; no
matter though he have offered a perfect sacrifice for sin, and no matter
though the throne of God be accessible to people, yet if there is in the
heart the love of sin; if the conscience is not pure, our prayers will
not be heard. Is this not one great reason why our worship is so barren
and unprofitable?

\(6\) it is the duty of Christians to exhort one another to mutual
fidelity; [Heb 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024.md). We should so far
regard the interests of each other, as to strive to promote our mutual
advance in piety. The church is one. All true Christians are brethren.
Each one has an interest in the spiritual welfare of every one who loves
the Lord Jesus, and should strive to increase his spiritual joy and
usefulness. A Christian brother often goes astray and needs kind
admonition to reclaim him; or he becomes disheartened and needs
encouragement to cheer him or his Christian way.

\(7\) Christians should not neglect to assemble together for the worship
of God; [Heb 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md). It is a duty which
they owe to God to acknowledge him publicly, and their own growth in
piety is essentially connected with public worship. It is impossible for
a man to secure the advancement of religion in his soul who habitually
neglects public worship, and religion will not flourish in any community
where this duty is not performed. There are great benefits growing out
of the worship of God, which can be secured in no other way. God has
made us social beings, and he intends that the social principle shall be
called into exercise in religion, as well as in other things. We have
common wants, and it is proper to present them together before the
mercy-seat. We have received common blessings in our creation, in the
providence of God, and in redemption, and it is proper that we should
assemble together and render united praise to our Maker for his
goodness.

Besides, in any community, the public worship of God does more to
promote intelligence, order, peace, harmony, friendship, neatness of
apparel, and purity and propriety of contact between neighbors, than
anything else can, and for which nothing else can be a compensation.
Every Christian, and every other man, therefore, is bound to lend his
influence in thus keeping up the worship of God, and should always be in
his place in the sanctuary. The particular thing in the exhortation of
the apostle is, that this should be done "even in the face of
persecution." The early Christians felt so much the importance of this,
that we are told they were accustomed to assemble at night. Forbidden to
meet in public houses of worship, they met in caves, and even when
threatened with death they continued to maintain the worship of God. It
may be added, that so important is this, that it should be preserved
even when the preaching of the gospel is not enjoyed. Let Christians
assemble together. Let them pray and offer praise. Let them read the
Word of God, and an appropriate sermon. Even this will exert an
influence on them and on the community of incalculable importance, and
will serve to keep the flame of piety burning on the altar of their own
hearts, and in the community around them.

\(8\) we may see the danger of indulging in any sin; [Heb
10:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md). None can tell to what it may
lead. No matter how small and unimportant it may appear at the time, yet
if indulged in it will prove that there is no true religion, and will
lead on to those greater offences which make shipwreck of the Christian
name, and ruin the soul. He that "wilfully" and deliberately sins "after
he professes to have received the knowledge of the truth," shows that
his religion is but a name, and that he has never known any thing of its
power.

\(9\) we should guard with sacred vigilance against everything which
might lead to apostasy; [Heb 10:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md).
If a sincere Christian "should" apostatize from God, he could never be
renewed and saved. There would remain no more sacrifice for sins; there
is no other Saviour to be provided; there is no other Holy Spirit to be
sent down to recover the apostate. Since, therefore; so fearful a
punishment would follow apostasy from the true religion, we may see the
guilt of everything which has a "tendency" to it. That guilt is to be
measured by the fearful consequences which would ensue if it were
followed out; and the Christian should, therefore, tremble when he is on
the verge of committing any sin whose legitimate tendency would be such
a result.

\(10\) we may learn from the views presented in this chapter [Heb
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md), [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md), the error of those who suppose
that a true Christian may fall away and be renewed again and saved. If
there is any principle clearly settled in the New Testament, it is, that
if a sincere Christian should apostatize, "he must perish." There would
be no possibility of renewing him. He would have tried the only religion
which saves people, and it would in his case have failed; he would have
applied to the only blood which purifies the soul, and it would have
been found inefficacious; he would have been brought under the only
influence which renews the soul, and that would not have been sufficient
to save him. What hope could there be? What would then save him if these
would not? To what would he apply to what Saviour, to what blood of
atonement, to what renewing and sanctifying agent, if the gospel, and
the Redeemer, and the Holy Spirit had all been tried in vain? There are
few errors in the community more directly at variance with the express
teachings of the Bible than the belief that a Christian may fall away
and he again renewed.

\(11\) Christians, in their conflicts, their trials, and their
temptations, should be strengthened by what is past; [Heb
10:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032.md). They should remember the
days when they were afflicted and God sustained them, when they were
persecuted and he brought them relief. It is proper also to remember for
their own encouragement; now, the spirit of patience and submission
which they were enabled to manifest in those times of trial, and the
sacrifices which they were enabled to make. They may find in such things
evidence that they are the children of God; and they should find in
their past experience proof that he who has borne them through past
trials, is able to keep them unto his everlasting kingdom.

\(12\) we need patience - but it is only for a little time; [Heb
10:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md). Soon all our conflicts will
be over. "He that shall come will come and will not tarry." He will come
to deliver his suffering people from all their trials. He will come to
rescue the persecuted from the persecutor; the oppressed from the
oppressor; the down-trodden from the tyrant; and the sorrowful and sad
from their woes. The coming of the Saviour to each one of the afflicted
is the signal of release from sorrow, and his advent at the end of the
world will be proof that all the trials of the bleeding and persecuted
church are at an end. The time too is short before he will appear. In
each individual case it is to be but a brief period before he will come
to relieve the sufferer from his woes, and in the case of the church at
large the time is not far remote when the Great Deliverer shall appear
to receive "the bride," the church redeemed, to the "mansions" which he
has gone to prepare.
