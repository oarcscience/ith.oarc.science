### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 9:4</span></span>

David reaped the fruit of his kindness to Mephibosheth, for, when he
fled from Absalom, Machir, the son of Ammiel, was one of those who were
most liberal in providing him and his army with necessaries (marginal
reference). According to [Ch1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005.md),
Ammiel (called inversely Eliam, [Sa2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003).md) was the father of Bath-sheba. If
this be the same Ammiel, Machir would be Bath-sheba's brother. However,
the name is not a very uncommon one ([Num
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#012.md); [Ch1
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#005), etc..md).

Lo-debar - Evidently on the east of Jordan River, and in the
neighborhood of Ish-bosheth's capital, Mahanaim [Sa2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027.md), but not identified by any
modern traveler. Thought by some, not improbably, to be the same as
Debir [Jos 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 9:6</span></span>

Mephibosheth - Also called Merib-baal (and Meri-baal, probably by a
clerical error, [Ch1 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#040).md). The two
names seem to have the same meaning: Bosheth, shame, being the
equivalent for Baal, and Mephi (scattering or destroying, being
equivalent to Merib (contending with). Compare Ish-bosheth and Esh-baal,
Jerub-baal and Jerub-besheth.

He fell on his face - In fear. Such generosity to a fallen rival as
David showed in restoring him his paternal property seemed to him
scarcely credible.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 9:8</span></span>

Mephibosheth's humility of expression, even in the mouth of an Oriental,
is painful. It was perhaps in part the result of his helpless lameness,
and of the other misfortunes of his life.

A dead dog - The wild dogs of the East, which still abound in every
town, are the natural objects of contempt and dislike.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 9:9</span></span>

Saul's servant - Josephus calls him one of Saul's freedmen. The
difference this would make in Ziba's position would only be that instead
of paying in the fruits of the confiscated land to David, he would have
to pay them to Mephiboseth.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 9:10</span></span>

Fifteen sons ... - See [Sa2 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#017.md),
marginal reference.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 9:11</span></span>

Said the king - There is nothing in the Hebrew to warrant the insertion
of these words. The words are: "So Mephibosheth ate at my table as one
of the king's sons." Only it follows that the narrator is David himself.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 9:12</span></span>

Mephibosheth was five years old at Saul's death. He may have been
thirteen at David's accession to the throne of Israel. In the eighth
year of David's reign over all Israel he would have been twenty-one. His
having a son at this time indicates that we are about the 10th year of
David's reign.

Micha - Or Micah; who, as far as we know, was Mephibosheth's only son,
and had a numerous posterity (marginal references).
