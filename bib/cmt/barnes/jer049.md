### [Jeremiah Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 49:0</span></span>

To the north of the Moabites lay the country of the Ammonites, a closely
allied nation [Gen 19:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037.md) who
claimed that the land assigned to the tribe of Gad had originally
belonged to them [Jdg 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md). They seem
to have been far less civilized than the Moabites, and possessed but one
stronghold, Rabbah, not devoting themselves to agriculture, but
wandering with their flocks over the Arabian wastes. When, however,
Tiglath-Pileser carried the inhabitants of Gilead into captivity, the
Ammonites occupied much of the vacant land, and many of them probably
adopted a more settled life; at this time they even possessed Heshbon,
once the frontier town between Reuben and Gad. It is this seizure of the
territory of Gad which forms the starting-point of Jeremiah's
prediction. Older prophecies against Ammon are [Amo
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md); [Zep
2:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008.md).

[Jeremiah 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 49:1</span></span>

Hath Israel no sons? - i. e., the Ammonites in seizing Gilead have acted
as if the country had no rightful owner. The sons of Israel were to
return from captivity, and the land was their hereditary property.

Their king - Milcom (and in [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003).md), see the margin. The Ammonite
god stands for the Ammonites just as Chemosh [Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md) is the equivalent of the
Moabites.

Inherit - i. e., take possession of.

[Jeremiah 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 49:2</span></span>

Rabbah - i. e., the "great city." See [Sa2
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#027.md) note for a distinction between
Rabbah, the citadel, and the town itself, lying below upon the Jabbok.

Daughters - i. e., unwalled villages (and in [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003).md).

Shall Israel be heir ... - i. e., "shall be victor over his victors;"
compare [Mic 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015.md).

[Jeremiah 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 49:3</span></span>

Ai - Not the town on the west of the Jordan [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md); a place not mentioned elsewhere.
For Ai some read Ar.

Hedges - Fields were not divided by hedges until recent times; the term
probably means the walls which enclose the vineyards [Num
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#024.md).

[Jeremiah 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 49:4</span></span>

Thy flowing valley - The (fertile) valley in which Rabbah was situated.
The Septuagint again has: "in the valleys of the Anakim," as in [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005) (see the note.md).

[Jeremiah 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 49:5</span></span>

Every man right forth - The Ammonites will live in terror of the tribes
which rove in the neighborhood, and at the slightest alarm will flee
straight away without resistance.

[Jeremiah 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 49:6</span></span>

In 1 Macc. 5:6, 7, the Ammonites appear again as a powerful nation.

[Jeremiah 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 49:7</span></span>

Edom stretched along the south of Judah from the border of Moab on the
Dead Sea to the Mediterranean and the Arabian deserts, and held the same
relation to Judah which Moab held toward the kingdom of Israel. Although
expressly reserved from attack by Moses [Deu
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#005.md), a long feud caused the Edomites
to cherish so bitter an enmity against Judah, that they exulted with
cruel joy over the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans, and showed
great cruelty toward those why fled to them for refuge.

Of the prophecies against Edom the first eight verses of Obadiah are
also found in Jeremiah (see the marginal references). As Jeremiah wrote
before the capture of Jerusalem, and Obadiah apparently after it (see
[Jer 49:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013).md), it might seem certain
that Obadiah copied from Jeremiah. Others held the reverse view; while
some consider that the two prophets may both have made common use of
some ancient prediction. See the introduction to Obadiah.

The prophecy is divisible into three strophes. In the first [Jer
49:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md), the prophet describes Edom as
terror-stricken.

[Jer 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md)

Teman - A strip of land on the northeast of Edom, put here for Edom
generally. Its inhabitants were among those "children of the East" famed
for wisdom, because of their skill in proverbs and dark sayings.

[Jer 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008.md)

Dwell deep - [Jer 49:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#030.md). The
Dedanites, who were used to travel through the Edomite territory with
their caravans, are advised to retire as far as possible into the
Arabian deserts to be out of the way of the invaders.

[Jer 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#009.md)

Translate it: "If vintagers come to thee, they will not leave any
gleaning: if thieves by night, they will destroy their fill."

[Jer 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#010.md)

But - For. The reason why the invaders destroy Edom so completely. His
secret places are the hiding-places in the mountains of Seir.

His seed - Esau's seed, the Edomites; his brethren are the nations
joined with him in the possession of the land, Amalek, and perhaps the
Simeonites; his neighbors are Dedan, Tema, Buz.

[Jer 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#011.md)

As with Moab [Jer 48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047.md), and Ammon
[Jer 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md), so there is mercy for Edom.
The widows shall be protected, and in the orphans of Edom the nation
shall once again revive.

[Jer 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md)

Translate it: "Behold they whose rule was not to drink of the cup shall
surely drink etc." It was not the ordinary manner of God's people to
suffer from His wrath: but now when they are drinking of the wine-cup of
fury [Jer 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md), how can those not in
covenant with Him hope to escape?

[Jer 49:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014.md)

The second strophe, Edom's chastisement.

[Jer 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014.md)

Rumour - Or, "revelation."

Ambassador - Or, messenger, i. e., herald. The business of an ambassador
is to negotiate, of a herald to carry a message.

[Jer 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#015.md)

Small ... - Rather, small among the nations, i. e., of no political
importance.

[Jer 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016.md)

Edom's "terribleness" consisted in her cities being hewn in the sides of
inaccessible rocks, from where she could suddenly descend for predatory
warfare, and retire to her fastnesses without fear of reprisals.

The clefts of the rock - Or, the fastnesses of Sela, the rock-city,
Petra (see [Isa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001).md).

The hill - i. e., Bozrah.

[Jer 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017.md)

Better, "And Edom shall become a terror: every passer by shalt be
terrified, and shudder etc."

[Jer 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018.md)

Neighbour ... - Admah and Zeboim.

A son of man - i. e., "Any man." From 536 a.d. onward, Petra suddenly
vanishes from the pages of history. Only in the present century was its
real site discovered.

[Jer 49:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md)

Concluding strophe. The fall of Edom is compared to the state of a flock
worried by an enemy strong as a lion [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md), and swift as an eagle.

[Jer 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md)

The swelling of Jordan - Or, the pride of Jordan, the thickets on his
banks (marginal reference note).

Against the habitation of the strong - Or, to the abiding pasturage. The
lion stalks forth from the jungle to attack the fold, sure to find sheep
there because of the perennial (evergreen) pasturage: "but I will
suddenly make him (the flock, Edom) run away from her (or it, the
pasturage)."

And who is a chosen ... - Better, and I will appoint over it, the
abandoned land of Edom, him who is chosen, i. e., my chosen ruler
Nebuchadnezzar.

Who will appoint me the time? - The plaintiff, in giving notice of a
suit, had to mention the time when the defendant must appear (see the
margin). Yahweh identifies himself with Nebuchadnezzar [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md), and shows the hopelessness of
Edom's cause. For who is like Yahweh, His equal in power and might? Who
will dare litigate with Him, and question His right? etc.

[Jer 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md)

Surely the least ... - Rather, Surely they will worry them, the feeble
ones of the flock: surely their pasture shall be terror-stricken over
them. No shepherd can resist Nebuchadnezzar [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md), but all flee, and leave the
sheep unprotected. Thereupon, the Chaldaeans enter, and treat the poor
feeble flock so barbarously, that the very fold is horrified at their
cruelty.

[Jer 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#021.md)

Is moved - Quakes.

At the cry ... - The arrangement is much more poetical in the Hebrew,
The shriek - to the sea of Suph ([Exo
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#019) note.md) is heard its sound.

[Jer 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md)

Nebuchadnezzar shall swoop down like an eagle, the emblem of swiftness.

[Jeremiah 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 49:23</span></span>

Though the superscription is confined to Damascus, the prophecy relates
to the whole of Aram, called by us Syria, which was divided into two
parts, the northern, of which Hamath was the capital, and the
southeastern, belonging to Damascus.

Hamath is confounded - Or, is ashamed. For Hamath see [Isa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009.md) note. Arpad lay about fourteen
miles north of Aleppo, at a place now called Tel Erfad.

Fainthearted - The sinews are relaxed unknit, through terror.

There is sorrow on the sea - In the sea. As the sea is used (marginal
reference) of the agitation of the thoughts of evil men, its sense here
also probably is, there is sorrow, or rather anxiety, in the agitated
hearts of the Syrians.

[Jeremiah 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 49:24</span></span>

And turneth - Omit and. The original is a rapid sequence of unconnected
sentences. "Damascus is unnerved; she turned to flee, and a trembling
seized her; anguish and writhings took hold of her etc."

[Jeremiah 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 49:25</span></span>

An exclamation of sorrow wrung from the prophet at the thought of the
people of Damascus remaining to be slaughtered. The words my joy express
the prophet's own sympathy. The praise of Damascus for beauty has been
universal from the days of Naaman [Kg2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012.md), to those of recent travelers.

[Jeremiah 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 49:27</span></span>

See the marginal reference and [Kg1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md) note.

[Jeremiah 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 49:28</span></span>

Hazor, derived from a word signifying an unwalled village, is a general
appellative of those Arab tribes who were partially settled, while Kedar
signifies the Bedawin, who used only tents. Some think that Hazor is
another way of spelling Jetor, i. e., Ituraea, whose inhabitants, with
the Kedarenes, would naturally be called the sons of the East.

Shall smite - Or, smote.

[Jeremiah 49:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 49:29</span></span>

Curtains - The hangings of the tents.

Fear is on every side - Magor-missabib (see [Jer
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025) note.md); a cry, indicating the
panic which followed the unexpected onset of the enemy.

[Jeremiah 49:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 49:30</span></span>

A purpose against you - Others read "against them" (the wealthy nation,
[Jer 49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031).md).

[Jeremiah 49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 49:31</span></span>

The wealthy nation - Or, a nation at rest, living securely and in
confidence.

Which dwell alone - They dwell alone, i. e., have neither alliances with
other nations, nor contact by commerce.

[Jeremiah 49:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 49:32</span></span>

Them ... corners - Or, those who clip the corners of their beards
(compare [Jer 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026).md).

[Jeremiah 49:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 49:33</span></span>

Dragons - i. e., jackals.

[Jeremiah 49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 49:34</span></span>

Against Elam - Or, concerning Elam. This country, better known as
Susiana, is the modern Chuzistan, and lies on the east of Chaldaea, from
which it is separated by the Tigris. In the cuneiform inscriptions we
find the Elamites on friendly terms with Babylon. The suggestion
therefore that they served as auxiliaries in the Chaldaean army in the
expedition against Judah is not improbable. It was in the first year of
Zedekiah that this prophecy was written, and thus it is a little prior
to the prophecies against Babylon [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md), which immediately follow. The
words, "the Elam," appear in the Septuagint in [Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md), followed by this prophecy,
while in [Jer 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001.md) we find, "In the
beginning of the reign of king Zedekiah there was this word about Elam,"
followed in [Jer 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#002.md) by the prophecy
(Jer. 46 of the Hebrew) against Egypt. This is a proof simply of the
confusion which existed in the Egyptian transcripts of the prophecies
relating to the nations.

[Jeremiah 49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 49:35</span></span>

The bow was the national weapon of Elam, and therefore the "chief of
their might," that on which their strength in war depended.

[Jeremiah 49:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 49:36</span></span>

In a whirlwind violent gales seem to blow from every quarter, and
whatever is exposed to their fury they scatter over the whole country.
With similar violence the whole nation of Elam shall be dispersed far
and wide.

[Jeremiah 49:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 49:38</span></span>

Literally, king and princes. Elam will lose its independence, and
henceforward have no native ruler with his attendant officers.

[Jeremiah 49:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 49:39</span></span>

Elam - Elam was subject to Babylon [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md), and its capital Shushan a
favorite residence of the Persian kings [Est
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#002.md). Of its subsequent fate we know
little; the Elamites continued to exist, and members of their nation
were present at Pentecost among those chosen to represent the Gentile
world at the first preaching of the Gospel [Act
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md).
