### [Judges Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md)

[Judges 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 12:1</span></span>

Compare the similar complaint of the Ephraimites to Gideon [Jdg
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md), when a civil war was only avoided
by Gideon's wise and patriotic moderation. The overhearing pride of
Ephraim comes out in both occurrences (see also [Jos
17:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014).md).

We will burn thine house upon thee with fire - Compare the fierce threat
of the Philistines to Samson's wife [Jdg
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#015.md), and the yet fiercer execution
[Jdg 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#006.md). Burning appears as a mode
of capital punishment [Gen 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024.md); [Jos
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025.md), and as a mode of desperate
warfare ([Jdg 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md); [Jdg
20:48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#048.md); [Jos
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#008.md), [Jos
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#019), etc..md).

[Judges 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 12:2</span></span>

When I called you ... - This circumstance is not related in the main
narrative. It is likely to have occurred when Jephthah was first chosen
leader by the Gileadites, and when Ephraim would probably ignore his
pretensions.

[Judges 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 12:3</span></span>

I put my life in my hands - Compare [Sa1
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#005.md); [Sa1
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#021.md). The phrase expresses the utmost
possible risk, knowingly incurred.

[Judges 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 12:4</span></span>

Because they said ... - This passage is extremely obscure. Render: -
"The men of Gilead smote Ephraim, for they (the Gileadites) said, Ye
are. the fugitives of Ephraim. (Gilead lies between Ephraim and
Manasseh; and Gilead took the fords of Jordan before Ephraim, and it
came to pass, when the fugitives of Ephraim said Let me pass over, and
the Gileadites asked him, art thou an Ephraimite, and he answered No,
Then (the Gileadites) said to him say Shibboleth, etc. So they (the
Gileadites) killed them at the fords of Jordan"). All that is included
in the parenthesis is explanatory of the brief statement "They smote
them, for they said, Ye are the fugitives of Ephraim;" i. e. in spite of
denial they ascertained that they were the fugitives of Ephraim, and so
pitilessly slaughtered them when they endeavored to return to their own
country through Gilead. This part of Gilead, where the fords were, was
clearly not in Manasseh, but in Gad. "Slew" [Jdg
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#006.md) implies "slaughtering" in cold
blood, not killing in battle (see [Jer
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006).md). The word in the original text
is the proper word for slaying animals for sacrifice.

[Judges 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 12:6</span></span>

Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth - This is a curious instance of
dialectic difference of pronunciation between the East and West Jordanic
tribes. It is an evidence of the sound "sh" having passed into the
Hebrew from the East of Jordan, possibly from the Arabians, with whom
the sound is common.

Forty-two thousand - The number includes the slain in battle and those
killed at the fords.

[Judges 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 12:8</span></span>

Ibzan of Bethlehem - Some have fancied him the same as Boaz [Rut
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001.md) of Bethlehem-Judah. Others, from
the juxtaposition of Elon the Zebulonite [Jdg
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#011.md), understand Bethlehem in the
tribe of Zebulon [Jos 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md).

[Judges 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 12:11</span></span>

A Zebulonite - The tribe of Zebulon had shown its bravery, patriotism,
and prowess in the time of Barak [Jdg
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010.md); [Jdg
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#018.md).

[Judges 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 12:13</span></span>

A Pirathonite - He was, therefore, an Ephraimite [Ch1
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#014.md). Its name still lingers in
"Feratah," 6 miles west of Shechem. The 25 years, apparently
consecutive, occupied by the judgeship of Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon, seem
to have been very uneventful and prosperous, since the only record of
them, preserved in the annals of their country, relates to the
flourishing families and peaceful magnificence of two of the number.
