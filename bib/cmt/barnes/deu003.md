### [Deuteronomy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 3:4</span></span>

Threescore cities - Probably the cities of Jair in Bashan described in
[Deu 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md) as Bashan-havoth-jair.

All the region of Argob - The Hebrew word here rendered "region," means
literally "rope" or "cable"; and though undoubtedly used elsewhere in a
general topographical sense for portion or district (e. g. [Jos
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#005).md), has a special propriety in
reference to Argob (mod. Lejah). The name Argob means "stone-heap," and
is paraphrased by the Targums, Trachonitis [Luk
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md), or "the rough country;" titles
designating the more striking features of the district. Its borders are
compared to a rugged shore-line; hence, its description in the text as
"the girdle of the stony country," would seem especially appropriate.
(Others identify Argob with the east quarter of the Hauran.)

[Deuteronomy 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 3:5</span></span>

Gates, and bars - literally, "Double gates and a bar." The stone doors
of Bashan, their height pointing to a race of great stature, and the
numerous cities (deserted) exist to illustrate the statements of these
verses.

[Deuteronomy 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 3:9</span></span>

Hermon, the southern and culminating point of the range of Lebanon, was
also the religious center of primaeval Syria. Its Baal sanctuaries not
only existed but gave it a name before the Exodus. Hence, the careful
specification of the various names by which the mountain was known. The
Sidonian name of it might easily have become known to Moses through the
constant traffic which had gone on from the most ancient times between
Sidon and Egypt.

[Deuteronomy 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 3:10</span></span>

Salchah - Compare [Jos 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005.md); [Ch1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011.md), where it is named as belonging
to the tribe of Gad. It lies seven hours' journey to the southeast of
Bostra or Bozrah of Moab. As the eastern border city of the kingdom of
Bashan it was no doubt strongly fortified.

Edrei - Compare [Num 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#033.md) note.

[Deuteronomy 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 3:11</span></span>

Giants - Or Rephaim: see the marginal reference note.

A bedstead of iron - The "iron" was probably the black basalt of the
country, which not only contains a large proportion, about 20 percent,
of iron, but was actually called "iron," and is still so regarded by the
Arabians. Iron was indeed both known and used, principally for tools
(see e. g. [Deu 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#005.md) and compare [Gen
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#022) note.md), at the date in question by
the Semitic people of Palestine and the adjoining countries; but bronze
was the ordinary metal of which weapons, articles of furniture, etc.,
were made.

The word translated "bedstead" is derived from a root signifying "to
unite" or "bind together," and so "to arch" or "cover with a vault." The
word may then certainly mean "bier," and perhaps does so in this
passage. Modern travelers have discovered in the territories of Og
sarcophagi as well as many other articles made of the black basalt of
the country.

Is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? - Probably after the
defeat and death of Og at Edrei the remnant of his army fled into the
territory of the friendly Ammonites, and carried with them the corpse of
the giant king.

After the cubit of a man - i. e. after the usual and ordinary cubit,
counted as people are accustomed to count. Taking 18 inches to the
cubit, the bedstead or sarcophagus would thus be from thirteen to
fourteen feet long.

[Deuteronomy 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 3:14</span></span>

These Geshurites held territory adjoining, if not included within,
Bashan. They are not to be confounded with those mentioned in [Jos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002.md), who were neighbors of the
Philistines [Sa1 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#008.md).

The exact position of Maachah like that of Geshur cannot be ascertained;
but it was no doubt among the fastnesses which lay between Bashan and
the kingdom of Damascus, and on the skirts of Mount Hermon.

Unto this day - This expression, like our "until now," does not, as used
in the Bible, necessarily imply that the time spoken of as elapsed is
long. It may here denote the duration to the time then present of that
which had been already some months accomplished.

[Deuteronomy 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 3:16</span></span>

The sense is that the Reubenites and Gadites were to possess the
district from the Jabbok on the north to the Arnon on the south,
including the middle part of the valley of the Arnon, and the territory
("coast" or "border") thereto pertaining.

[Deuteronomy 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 3:25</span></span>

That goodly mountain - i. e., that mountainous district. The fiat
districts of the East are generally scorched, destitute of water, and
therefore sterile: the hilly ones, on the contrary, are of more tempered
climate, and fertilized by the streams from the high grounds. Compare
[Deu 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#011.md).

The whole of this prayer of Moses is very characteristic. The longing to
witness further manifestations of God's goodness and glory, and the
reluctance to leave unfinished an undertaking which he had been
permitted to commence, are striking traits in his character: compare
[Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md) ff; [Exo
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012.md), [Exo
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018.md) ff; [Num
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012.md) ff.

[Deuteronomy 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 3:26</span></span>

The Lord was wroth with me for your sakes - Here, as in [Deu
1:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#037.md); [Deu
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#021.md); the sin of the people is stated
to be the ground on which Moses' prayer is denied. In [Deu
32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051.md); and in [Num
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md); the transgression of Moses and
Aaron themselves is assigned as the cause of their punishment. The
reason why one side of the transaction is put forward in this place, and
the other elsewhere, is evident. Here Moses is addressing the people,
and mentions the punishment of their leaders as a most impressive
warning to them, whose principal fault it was. In Deut. 32 and Num. 27,
God is addressing Moses, and visits on him, as is fitting, not the sin
of the people hut his own.

[Deuteronomy 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 3:29</span></span>

Beth-peor, i. e., the house of Peor, no doubt derived its name from a
temple of the Moabite god Peor which was there situated. It was no doubt
near to Mount Peor [Num 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028.md), and
also to the valley of the Jordan perhaps in the Wady Heshban.
