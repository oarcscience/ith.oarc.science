### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 1:1</span></span>

The "Song of songs," i. e., the best or most excellent of songs.

Which is Solomon's - literally, "to" or "for Solomon," i. e., belonging
to Solomon as its author or concerning him as its subject. In a title or
inscription, the former interpretation is to be preferred.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 1:2</span></span>

the prologue. - The Song commences with two stanzas in praise of the
king (now absent) by a chorus of virgins belonging to the royal
household. Expositors, Jewish and Christian, interpret the whole as
spoken by the Church of the heavenly Bridegroom.

[Sol 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md)

Let him kiss me - Christian expositors have regarded this as a prayer of
the Church under the old covenant for closer communion with the Godhead
through the Incarnation. Thus, Gregory: "Every precept of Christ
received by the Church is as one of His kisses."

Thy love - Better as margin, i. e., thy endearments or tokens of
affection are more desired than any other delights.

[Sol 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003.md)

Because ... - Better, For fragrance are thine ointments good, making
with the clause that follows two steps of a climax: "thy perfumes are
good, thy name the best of all perfumes." "Ointments" here are unguents
or fragrant oils largely used for anointing at entertainments (compare
[Psa 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md); [Luk
7:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#046.md); [Joh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003).md).

Thy name ... poured forth - As unguents are the sweeter for diffusion,
so the king's name the wider it is known.

[Sol 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md)

The king hath brought me - Made me a member of his household. This is
true of every member of the chorus as well as of the bride.

The upright love thee - Better as in the margin: uprightly do they (i.
e., "the virgins" of [Sol 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003).md) love
thee. Compare the use of the same word in [Psa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md); [Pro
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 1:5</span></span>

This section is made by the Targumist and other Jewish interpreters to
adumbrate the condition of Israel in the wilderness; by some Christian
expositors, that of the Gentile Church on her first conversion.

[Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md)

I am black ... - Dark-hued, as the tents of Kedar with their black
goats' hair coverings, rough and weather-stained, "but comely
(beautiful) as the rich hangings which adorn the pavilion of Solomon.
Kedar was the name of an Arab tribe [Gen
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#013.md); [Psa
120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005.md). The word itself signifies
"dark" or "black." Possibly "tents of Kedar" stand here poetically for
shepherds' tents in general [Isa 60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007.md).

[Sol 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md)

Look not upon me - In wonder or scorn at my swarthy hue. It was acquired
in enforced but honest toil: the sun hath scanned me (or "glared upon
me") with his burning eye. The second word rendered "looked" is a word
twice found in Job [Job 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#009.md); [Job
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#007.md), and indicates in the latter
place the piercing glance of a bird of prey.

My mother's children, - Or, sons; a more affectionate designation than
"brothers," and implying the most intimate relationship.

Angry - This anger was perhaps but a form of jealous care for their
sister's safety (compare [Sol 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012).md).
By engaging her in rustic labors they preserved her from idleness and
temptation, albeit with a temporary loss of outward comeliness.

Mine own vineyard - A figurative expression for herself or her beauty.

[Sol 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007.md)

whom my soul loveth - A phrase recurring several times. It expresses
great intensity of affection.

Feedest - i. e., "Pursuest thy occupation as a shepherd;" so she speaks
figuratively of the Son of David. Compare [Sol
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md); [Sol
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003.md); [Psa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md).

Rest - Or, lie down; a term properly used of the couching of four-footed
animals: "thy flock" is here therefore easily understood. Compare [Eze
34:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#014.md); [Psa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002.md); [Jer
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006.md).

As one that turneth aside - Or, goeth astray like an outcast.

[Sol 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md)

The chorus, and not the king, are the speakers here. Their meaning seems
to be: If thy beloved be indeed a shepherd, then seek him yonder among
other shepherds, but if a king, thou wilt find him here in his royal
dwelling.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 1:9</span></span>

This and the next Cant. 1:15-2:7 sections are regarded by ancient
commentators (Jewish and Christian) as expressing "the love of
espousals" [Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md) between the Holy
One and His Church, first in the wilderness of the Exodus, and then in
the wilderness of the world [Eze
20:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035.md).

[Sol 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md)

Or, to a mare of mine in the chariots of Pharaoh I liken thee, O my
friend. (The last word is the feminine form of that rendered "friend" at
[Sol 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016)..md) The comparison of the
bride to a beautiful horse is singularly like one in Theocritus, and
some have conjectured that the Greek poet, having read at Alexandria the
Septuagint Version of the Song, may have borrowed these thoughts from
it. If so, we have here the first instance of an influence of sacred on
profane literature. The simile is especially appropriate on the lips, or
from the pen, of Solomon, who first brought horses and chariots from
Egypt [Kg1 10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md). As applied to the
bride it expresses the stately and imposing character of her beauty.

[Sol 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#010.md), [Sol
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#011.md)

Rows ... borders - The same Hebrew word in both places; ornaments
forming part of the bride's head-dress, probably strings of beads or
other ornaments descending on the cheeks. The introduction of "jewels"
and "gold" in [Sol 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#010.md) injures the
sense and destroys the climax of [Sol
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#011.md), which was spoken by a chorus
(hence "we," not "I," as when the king speaks, [Sol
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009).md). They promise the bride ornaments
more worthy and becoming than the rustic attire in which she has already
such charms for the king: "Ornaments of gold will we make for thee with
studs (or 'points') of silver." The "studs" are little silver ornaments
which it is proposed to affix to the golden (compare [Pro
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#012).md), or substitute for the strung
beads of the bride's necklace.

[Sol 1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012.md)

The bride's reply [Sol 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012.md) may mean,
"While the king reclines at the banquet I anoint him with my costliest
perfume, but he has for me a yet sweeter fragrance" [Sol
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md). According to Origen's
interpretation, the bride represents herself as anointing the king, like
Mary [Joh 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003.md), with her most precious
unguents.

Spikenard - An unguent of great esteem in the ancient world, retaining
its Indian name in Hebrew, Greek and Latin. It is obtained from an
Indian plant now called "jatamansi."

[Sol 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md)

Render: A bag of myrrh is my beloved to me, which lodgeth in my bosom.

[Sol 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md)

Camphire - Rather, כפר kôpher," from which "cyprus" is probably derived
(in the margin misspelled "cypress "),the name by which the plant called
by the Arabs "henna" was known to the Greeks and Romans. It is still
much esteemed throughout the East for the fragrance of its flowers and
the dye extracted from its leaves. Engedi was famous for its vines, and
the henna may have been cultivated with the vines in the same
enclosures.
