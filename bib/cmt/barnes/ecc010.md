### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 10:0</span></span>

This chapter resembles a portion of the Book of Proverbs, consisting
entirely of rhythmical sentences giving advice, more or less direct, as
to conduct. It is part of the writer's answer to the question [Ecc
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md); [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md) "What is good for men to do?" The
thought which underlies the whole chapter is the advantage of that
wisdom which includes piety and patience, as practical guidance through
all the perplexities of life: various traits of wisdom are set forth in
a favorable light, heightened by contrast with folly. A great part of
the advice seems, in addition to its general application, to have a
special reference to servants of a king.

[Ecclesiastes 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 10:1</span></span>

This verse is by its meaning so closely connected with [Ecc
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#018.md) that the selection of it for the
beginning of a new chapter seems unfortunate.

Apothecary - Rather: a dealer in spices and perfumes (compare [Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025).md). The swarms of flies in the
East very soon corrupt and destroy any moist unguent or mixture left
uncovered, and pollute a dish of food in a few minutes.

So doth ... - literally, more weighty than wisdom, than honor, is a
little folly.

[Ecclesiastes 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 10:2</span></span>

The metaphor perhaps means "A wise man's sense is in its place, ready to
help and protect him; but a fool's sense is missing when it is wanted,
and so is useless."

[Ecclesiastes 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 10:3</span></span>

"Way" may be understood either literally (compare [Ecc
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#015).md), or figuratively, of the course
of action which he follows.

He saith ... - He exposes his folly to every one he meets.

[Ecclesiastes 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 10:4</span></span>

If the spirit ... - i. e., If he is angry.

Leave not thy place - i. e., Do not lose thy self-control and quit his
presence. Gentleness on thy part will calm both thyself and him, and
prevent great wrongs being committed by either.

[Ecclesiastes 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 10:6</span></span>

The "evil" of [Ecc 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md) is here
specified as that caprice of a king by which an unworthy favorite of low
origin is promoted to successive dignities, while a noble person is
degraded or neglected.

[Ecclesiastes 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 10:8</span></span>

The figures seem to be taken from the work of building up and pulling
down houses. In their general application, they recommend the man who
would act wisely to be cautious when taking any step in life which
involves risk.

[Ecc 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#008.md)

Breaketh an hedge - Rather: "breaks through a wall."

Serpent - The habit of snakes is to nestle in a chink of a wall, or
among stones (compare [Amo 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019).md).

[Ecc 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#009.md)

Be endangered - Rather: "cut himself."

[Ecclesiastes 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 10:11</span></span>

Rather: "If a serpent without enchantment (i. e., not being enchanted)
bites, then there is no advantage to the charmer": i. e., if the charmer
is unwisely slack in exercising his craft, he will be bitten like other
people. See [Psa 58:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004.md) note.

[Ecclesiastes 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 10:14</span></span>

Full of words - Confident talking of the future is indicated rather than
mere loquacity. Compare [Jam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013.md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 10:15</span></span>

The sense is: "The fool wearies himself with ineffectual attempts, he
has not sufficient knowledge for the transaction of ordinary business."

[Ecclesiastes 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 10:16</span></span>

Foolish rulers, by their weakness, self-indulgence and sloth, bring
decay upon the state: nobleness and temperance insure prosperity: yet
the subject must not rebel in word or thought against his king.

[Ecc 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md)

A child - Rather, young. The word is applied to Rehoboam [Ch2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#007.md) at the time of his accession to
the throne, when he was 41 years old.

Eat in the morning - A sign of intemperance (compare [Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011).md).

[Ecc 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#017.md)

Son of nobles - i. e., of a noble disposition.

[Ecc 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#018.md)

The "building" or "house" represents the state. Compare [Isa
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006.md); [Amo
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#010.md).

Droppeth through - i. e., Lets the rain through the roof.

[Ecc 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019.md)

literally, For merriment they make a feast (bread), and wine gladdens
the living, and money supplies all things.

[Ecc 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md)

Curse - Compare [Ecc 7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#021.md).
