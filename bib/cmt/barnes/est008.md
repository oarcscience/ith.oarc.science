### [Esther Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001)

[Esther 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 8:1</span></span>

Give the house of Haman - Confiscation of goods accompanied public
execution in Persia as in other Oriental countries.

[Esther 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 8:2</span></span>

His ring - i. e. the royal signet by which the decrees of the government
were signed.

Over the house of Haman - Not only the building and the furniture, but
the household - the vast train of attendants of all kinds that was
attached to the residence of a Persian noble.

[Esther 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 8:3</span></span>

Though Haman was dead, his work was not yet undone. The royal decree had
gone forth, and, according to Persian notions, could not be directly
recalled or reversed [Est 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008).
Mordecai did not dare, without express permission from the king, to take
any steps even to stay execution. And Esther, being in favor, once more
took the initiative.

[Esther 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 8:8</span></span>

Write ... as it liketh you ... - (See the [Est
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#019) note. Practically, Ahasuerus
reversed the "device" of Haman).

[Esther 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 8:9</span></span>

Sivan corresponds nearly to our June; it was the second month from the
issue of the first edict [Est 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012).

[Esther 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 8:10</span></span>

Riders on mules, camels and young dromedaries - Most moderns translate
"riders upon coursers and mules, the offspring of mares;" but the words
translated "mules" and "mares," are of very doubtful signification,
since they scarcely occur elsewhere. The real meaning of the clause must
remain doubtful; perhaps the true translation is, "riders upon coursers
of the king's stud, offspring of high-bred steeds." So [Est
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#014).

[Esther 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 8:11</span></span>

This fresh decree allowed the Jews to stand on their defense, and to
kill all who attacked them. It has been pronounced incredible that any
king would thus have sanctioned civil war in all the great cities of his
empire; but some even of the more skeptical critics allow that "Xerxes"
might not improbably have done so.

[Esther 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 8:14</span></span>

Being hastened - Between Sivan, the third month (June), when the posts
went out, and Adar, the twelfth month (March), when the struggle was to
take place, the interval would be one of more than 8 months; but all
haste was made, with the object of their being no misunderstanding.

[Esther 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 8:15</span></span>

See the [Est 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#006) note. The "crown" was
not a crown like the king's, but a mere golden band or coronet.

A garment - Or, "an inner robe." The tunic or inner robe of the king was
of purple, striped with white.

[Esther 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">est 8:17</span></span>

Became Jews - Joined the nation as proselytes, so casting in their lot
with them.
