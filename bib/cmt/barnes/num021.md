### [Numbers Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001)

[Numbers 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 21:1</span></span>

King Arad the Canaanite - Rather, "the Canaanite, the king of Arad."
Arad stood on a small hill, now called Tel-Arad, 20 miles south of
Hebron.

In the south - See [Num 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017), [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022).

By the way of the spies - i. e. through the desert of Zin, the route
which the spies sent out by Moses 38 years before had adopted (compare
[Num 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021)).

He fought against Israel - This attack (compare [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001) and note), can hardly have taken
place after the death of Aaron. It was most probably made just when the
camp broke up from Kadesh, and the ultimate direction of the march was
not as yet pronounced. The order of the narrative in these chapters, as
occasionally elsewhere in this book (compare [Num
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001), etc.), is not that of time, but
of subject matter; and the war against Arad is introduced here as the
first of the series of victories gained under Moses, which the historian
now takes in hand to narrate.

[Numbers 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 21:3</span></span>

He called the name of the place - Render it as: "the name of the place
was called." The transitive verb here is, by a common Hebrew idiom,
equivalent to an impersonal one.

Hormah - i. e. "Ban." See [Num 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045)
and note. In [Jdg 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017), we read that
the men of Judah and Simeon "slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath,
and utterly destroyed it;" and further, that "the name of the city was
called Hormah." But it does not follow that the name "Hormah" was first
bestowed in consequence of the destruction of the place in the time of
the Judges, and that in Numbers its occurrence is a sign of a
post-Mosaic date of composition. The text here informs us that this
aggression of the king of Arad was repelled, and avenged by the capture
and sack of his cities; and that the Israelites "banned" them (compare
[Lev 27:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028)). But it was not the
plan of the Israelites in the time of Moses to remain in this district.
They therefore marched away southeastward; and no doubt for the time the
Canaanites resumed possession, and restored the ancient name (Zephath).
But Joshua again conquered the king of this district, and finally in the
time of the early Judges the ban of Moses and his contemporaries was
fully executed. We have therefore in the passage before us the history
of the actual origin of the name "Hormah."

[Numbers 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 21:4</span></span>

The direct route to Moab through the valleys of Edom being closed
against them [Num 20:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#020), they were
compelled to turn southward. Their course lay down the Arabah; until, a
few hours north of Akaba (Ezion-Geber) the Wady Ithm opened to them a
gap in the hostile mountains, allowed them to turn to their left, and to
march northward toward Moab [Deu 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#003).
They were thus for some days (see [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001) note) in the Arabah, a mountain
plain of loose sand, gravel, and detritus of granite, which though
sprinkled with low shrubs, especially near the mouths of the wadys and
the courses of the winter-torrents, furnishes extremely little food or
water, and is often troubled by sand-storms from the shore of the gulf.
Hence, "the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way."

[Numbers 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 21:5</span></span>

This light bread - i. e. "this vile, contemptible bread."

[Numbers 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 21:6</span></span>

Fiery serpents - The epithet [Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015); [Isa
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029); [Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006) denotes the inflammatory effect
of their bite. The peninsula of Sinai, and not least, the Arabah,
abounds in mottled snakes of large size, marked with fiery red spots and
wavy stripes, which belong to the most poisonous species, as the
formation of the teeth clearly show.

[Numbers 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 21:8</span></span>

Make thee a fiery serpent - i. e. a serpent resembling in appearance the
reptiles which attacked the people. The resemblance was of the essence
of the symbolism (compare [Sa1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#005)).
As the brass serpent represented the instrument of their chastisement,
so the looking unto it at God's word denoted acknowledgment of their
sin, longing for deliverance from its penalty, and faith in the means
appointed by God for healing. In the serpent of brass, harmless itself,
but made in the image of the creature that is accursed above others [Gen
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014), the Christian fathers rightly
see a figure of Him [Joh 3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014) who
though "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners" [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026), was yet "made sin" [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021), and "made a curse for us" [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013). And the eye of faith fixed on
Him beholds the manifestation at once of the deserts of sin, of its
punishment imminent and deprecated, and of the method of its remission
devised by God Himself.

[Numbers 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 21:10</span></span>

The earlier stations in this part of their journey were Zalmonah and
Punon [Num 33:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#041). Oboth was north
of Punon, east of the northern part of Edom, and is pretty certainly the
same as the present pilgrim halting-place el-Ahsa. Ije ("ruinous heaps")
of Abarim, or Iim of Abarim, was so called to distinguish it from
another Iim in southwestern Canaan [Jos
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#029). Abarim denotes generally the
whole upland country on the east of the Jordan. The Greek equivalent of
the name is Peraea.

[Numbers 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 21:12</span></span>

The valley of Zared - Rather, the brook or watercourse of Zared "the
willow." It is probably the present Wady Ain Franjy.

[Numbers 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 21:13</span></span>

The Arnon, now the Wady Mojeb, an impetuous torrent, divided the
territory which remained to the Moabites from that which the Amorites
had wrested from them, [Num 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026).

[Numbers 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 21:14</span></span>

Of "the book of the wars of the Lord" nothing is known except what may
be gathered from the passage before us. It was apparently a collection
of sacred odes commemorative of that triumphant progress of God's people
which this chapter records. From it is taken the ensuing fragment of
ancient poetry relating to the passage of the Arnon River, and probably
also the Song of the Well, and the Ode on the Conquest of the Kingdom of
Sihon [Num 21:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017), [Num
21:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027).

What he did ... - The words which follow to the end of the next verse
are a reference rather than a quotation. Contemporaries who had "the
Book" at hand, could supply the context. We can only conjecture the
sense of the words; which in the original are grammatically incomplete.
The marg. is adopted by many, and suggests a better sense: supplying
some such verb as "conquered," the words would run "He" (i. e. the Lord)
"conquered Vaheb in Suphah, and the brooks, etc." Suphah would thus be
the name of a district remarkable for its reeds and water-flags in which
Vaheb was situated.

[Numbers 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 21:15</span></span>

To the dwelling of Ar - Ar (compare [Num
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028); [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001)) was on the bank of the Arnon,
lower down the stream than where the Israelites crossed. Near the spot
where the upper Arnon receives the tributary Nahaliel [Num
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#019), there rises, in the midst of
the meadow-land between the two torrents, a hill covered with the ruins
of the ancient city ([Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009), [Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016); compare [Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036)).

[Numbers 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 21:16</span></span>

Beer is probably the "Well," afterward known as Beer-elim, the "well of
heroes" [Isa 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008).

[Numbers 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 21:17</span></span>

This song, recognized by all authorities as dating from the earliest
times, and suggested apparently by the fact that God in this place gave
the people water not from the rock, but by commanding Moses to cause a
well to be dug, bespeaks the glad zeal, the joyful faith, and the hearty
cooperation among all ranks, which possessed the people. In after time
it may well have been the water-drawing song of the maidens of Israel.

[Num 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018)

By the direction of the lawgiver - Some render, with the lawgiver's
scepter; i. e. under the direction and with the authority of Moses;
compare [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010), and note.

[Numbers 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 21:19</span></span>

Nahaliel - i. e. "brook of God;" the modern Wady Enkheileh. The
Israelites must have crossed the stream not much above Ar.

Bamoth - Otherwise Bamoth-baal, "the high places of Baal" [Num
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041) : mentioned as near Dibon
(Dhiban) in [Jos 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017), and [Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002). See [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034).

[Numbers 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 21:20</span></span>

In the country of Moab - Rather, in the field of Moab: the upland
pastures, or flat downs, intersected by the ravine of Wady Waleh.

Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon - Or, "toward the waste." See [Num
33:47](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#047). Pisgah was a ridge of the
Abarim mountains, westward from Heshbon. From the summit the Israelites
gained their first view of the wastes of the Dead Sea and of the valley
of the Jordan: and Moses again ascended it, to view, before his death,
the land of promise. The interest attaching to the spot, and the need of
a convenient name for it, has led Christians often to designate it as
"Nebo," rather than as "the mountain of, or near to, Nebo;" but the
latter is the more correct: Nebo denoted the town [Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002); [Jer
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001), [Jer
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#022) on the western slope of the
ridge.

[Numbers 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 21:24</span></span>

Jabbok (now Wady Zerka: compare [Gen
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#022)) runs eastward under Rabbah of
the children of Ammon, thence westward, and reaches the Jordan, 45 miles
north of the Arnon. It was between Rabbah and Gerasa that it formed the
Ammonite boundary.

[Numbers 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 21:25</span></span>

Heshbon - Now Heshban, a ruined city, due east of the point where the
Jordan enters the Dead Sea; conspicuous from all parts of the high
plateau on which it stands, but concealed, like the rest of the plateau,
from the valley beneath.

[Numbers 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 21:27</span></span>

They that speak in proverbs - The original word is almost equivalent to
"the poets." The word supplies the title of the Book of Proverbs itself;
and is used of the parable proper in [Eze
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#002); of the prophecies of Balsam in
[Num 23:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007); [Num
24:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003); etc.; and of a song of triumph
over Babylon in [Isa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004).

[Numbers 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 21:29</span></span>

Chemosh - The national God of the Moabites (compare the marginal
references). The name probably means "Vanquisher," or "Master." The
worship of Chemosh was introduced into Israel by Solomon [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007); [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013). It was no doubt to Chemosh that
Mesha, king of Moab, offered up his son as a burnt-offering [Kg2
3:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#026).

In the first six lines [Num 21:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027)
the poet imagines for the Amorites a song of exultation for their
victories over Moab, and for the consequent glories of Heshbon, their
own capital. In the next lines [Num
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029) he himself joins in this strain;
which now becomes one of half-real, half-ironical compassion for the
Moabites, whom their idol Chemosh was unable to save. But in the last
lines [Num 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030) a startling change
takes place; the new and decisive triumph of the poet's own countrymen
is abruptly introduced; and the boastings of the Arnorites fade utterly
away. Of the towns Heshbon was the northernmost, and therefore, to the
advancing Israelites, the last to be reached. Medeba, now Madeba, was
four miles south of Heshbon (compare [Ch1
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007), [Ch1
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#015)).

[Numbers 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 21:32</span></span>

Jaazer - To he identified probably with the ruins Sir or es-Sir 10 miles
north of Heshbon. The occupation of it by the Israelites virtually
completed their conquest of the Amorite kingdom; and prepared the way
for the pastoral settlements in it which they not long after established
[Num 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#035).

[Numbers 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 21:33</span></span>

In these apparently unimportant words is contained the record of the
Israelite [Num 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#039) occupation of
Gilead north of the Jabbok; a territory which, though populated, like
southern Gilead, by the Amorites ([Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009); [Jos
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#010), etc.), formed part of the domain
of Og king of Bashan, who was himself of a different race [Deu
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#002); [Jos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005); [Jos
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#011). We are not told whether they
were led there by express warrant of God, or whether their advance upon
Bashan was provoked by Og and his people.

At Edrei - Now Edhra'ah, commonly Der'a; situate on a branch of the
Jarmuk. This river formed the boundary between Gilead and Bashan.
