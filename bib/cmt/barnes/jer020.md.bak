### [Jeremiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 20:0</span></span>

The breaking of the bottle Jer. 20 had been done so solemnly before
witnesses of such high position, and its meaning had been so
unmistakeably proclaimed in the temple, that those in authority could
endure such proceedings no longer. Roused therefore to anger by the
sight of the listening crowds, Pashur, the deputy high priest, caused
Jeremiah to be arrested, inflicted upon him the legal 40 stripes except
one, and made him pass a night in the stocks, exposed to the jeers of
the scoffers, at the most public gate of the temple. Apparently, it was
Jeremiah's last public prophecy in Jehoiakim's reign, and was the cause
why in the fourth year of that king it was no longer safe for him to go
to the house of Yahweh [Jer 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#005.md). It
is probable also that Jehoiakim's scroll ended with the prophecy of the
potter's vessel, and the account of the contumelies to which the prophet
had in consequence been exposed. One prophecy, however, at least in our
present book, is of a later date, that of the linen girdle Jer. 13.

[Jeremiah 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 20:1</span></span>

Pashur, the father probably of the Gedaliah mentioned in [Jer
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md), was the head of the 16th course
(shift) of priests (marginal reference); the other Pashur [Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md) belonged to the fifth course, the
sons of Melchiah. Both these houses returned in great strength from the
exile. See [Ezr 2:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#037.md).

Chief governor - Or, "deputy governor." The Nagid or governer of the
temple was the high priest [Ch1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#011.md),
and Pashur was his Pakid, i. e., deputy (see [Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010) note.md). Zephaniah held this office
[Jer 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026.md), and his relation to the
high priest is exactly defined [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md); [Jer
52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024.md). The Nagid at this time was
Seraiah the high priest, the grandson of Hilkiah, or (possibly) Azariah,
Hilkiah's son and Jeremiah's brother [Ch1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#013.md), [Ezr
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001.md).

[Jeremiah 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 20:2</span></span>

Jeremiah the prophet - Jeremiah is nowhere so called in the first 19
chapters. In this place he thus characterizes himself, because Pashur's
conduct was a violation of the respect due to the prophetic office.

The stocks - This instrument of torture comes from a root signifying to
"twist." It thus implies that the body was kept in a distorted position.
Compare [Act 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024.md).

The high gate ... - Rather, "the upper gate of Benjamin in the house of
Yahweh (compare [Kg2 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035).md);" to be
distinguished from the city gate of Benjamin leading toward the north.

[Jeremiah 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 20:3</span></span>

Magor-missabib - See [Jer 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025.md) note.
Jeremiah uses it no less than five times, having probably adopted it as
his watchword from [Psa 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013.md).

[Jeremiah 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 20:4</span></span>

A terror to thyself, and to all thy friends - Jeremiah plays upon the
meaning of Magormissabib saying that Pusbur would be a terror to all
around. It is remarkable that he prophesies no evil of Pashur [Jer
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006.md). His was to be the milder fate of
being carried into captivity with Jehoiachin, and dying peaceably at
Babylon [Jer 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006.md), whereas his
successor Zephaniah was put to death at Riblah [Jer
52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024.md), [Jer
52:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#027.md). His punishment probably
consisted in this. He had prophesied "lies." When then he saw the
dreadful slaughter of his countrymen, Jehoiakim put to death, his young
son dragged into captivity, and the land stripped of all that was best,
his conscience so condemned him as the guilty cause of such great misery
that in the agonies of remorse he became a terror to himself and his
friends.

[Jeremiah 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 20:5</span></span>

All the strength - "All the stores."

The labors - The gains of the citizens.

[Jeremiah 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 20:6</span></span>

Thou hast prophesied lies - Pushur belonged to the warlike party, whose
creed it was, that Judaea by a close alliance with Egypt might resist
the arms of Assyria.

[Jeremiah 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 20:7</span></span>

In the rest of the chapter we have an outbreak of deep emotion, of which
the first part ends in a cry of hope [Jer
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#013.md), followed nevertheless by curses
upon the day of his birth. Was this the result of feelings wounded by
the indignities of a public scourging and a night spent in the stocks?
Or was it not the mental agony of knowing that his ministry had (as it
seemed) failed? He stands indeed before the multitudes with unbending
strength, warning prince and people with unwavering constancy of the
national ruin that would follow necessarily upon their sins. Before God
he stood crushed by the thought that he had labored in vain, and spent
his strength for nothing.

It is important to notice that with this outpouring of sorrow Jeremiah's
ministry virtually closed. Though he appeared again at Jerusalem toward
the end of Jehoiakim's reign, yet it was no longer to say that by
repentance the national ruin might be averted. During the fourth year of
Jehoiakim, the die was cast, and all the prophet henceforward could do,
was to alleviate a punishment that was inevitable.

[Jer 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md)

Thou hast deceived me ... - What Jeremiah refers to is the joy with
which he had accepted the prophetic office [Jer
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016.md), occasioned perhaps by taking
the promises in [Jer 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018.md) too
literally as a pledge that he would succeed.

Thou art stronger than I - Rather, "Thou hast taken hold of me." God had
taken Jeremiah in so firm a grasp that he could not escape from the
necessity of prophesying. He would have resisted, but the hand of God
prevailed.

I am in derision daily - literally, "I am become a laughing-stock all
the day, i. e., peripetually.

[Jer 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008.md)

Translate," For as often as I speak, I must complain; I call out,
Violence and spoil."

From the time Jeremiah began to prophesy, he had had reason for nothing
but lamentation. Daily with louder voice and more desperate energy he
must call out "violence and spoil;" as a perpetual protest against the
manner in which the laws of justice were violated by powerful men among
the people.

[Jer 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009.md)

Seeing that his mission was useless, Jeremiah determined to withdraw
from it.

I could not stay - Rather, "I prevailed not," did not succeed. See [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md).

[Jer 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md)

The defaming - Rather, "the talking." The word refers to people
whispering in twos and threes apart; in this case plotting against
Jeremiah. Compare [Mar 14:58](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#058.md).

Report ... - Rather, "Do you report, and we will report him: i. e., they
encourage one another to give information against Jeremiah.

My familiars - literally, "the men of my peace" [Psa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md). In the East the usual salutation
is "Peace be to thee:" and the answer, "And to thee peace." Thus, the
phrase rather means acquaintances, than familiar friends.

Enticed - literally, "persuaded, misled," the same word as "deceived
[Jer 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md)." Compare [Mar
12:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013.md).

[Jer 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#011.md)

A mighty terrible one - Rather, "a terrible warrior." The mighty One
[Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md) who is on his side is a
terror to them. This change of feeling was the effect of faith, enabling
him to be content with calmly doing his duty, and leaving the result to
God.

For ... - Rather, "because they have not acted wisely ([Jer
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021) note.md), with an everlasting
disgrace that shall never be forgotten."

[Jer 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#012.md)

This verse is repeated almost verbatim from [Jer
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020.md).

[Jer 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#013.md)

Sing - Jeremiah's outward circumstances remained the same, but he found
peace in leaving his cause in faith to God.

[Jer 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md)

This sudden outbreak of impatience after the happy faith of [Jer
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#013.md) has led to much discussion.
Possibly there was more of sorrow in the words than of impatience;
sorrow that the earnest labor of a life had been in vain. Yet the form
of the expression is fierce and indignant; and the impatience of
Jeremiah is that part of his character which is most open to blame. He
does not reach that elevation which is set before us by Him who is the
perfect pattern of all righteousness. Our Lord was a prophet whose
mission to the men of His generation equally failed, and His sorrow was
even more deep; but it never broke forth in imprecations. See [Luk
19:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041.md).

[Jer 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016.md)

The cry - is the sound of the lamentation [Jer
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008.md); "the shouting" is the alarm of
war.
