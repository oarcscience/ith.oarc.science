### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 10:1</span></span>

Doubt has arisen whether the "queen of Sheba" was an Ethiopian or an
Arabian princess. Both countries profess to have traditions on the
subject connecting the queen of Sheba with their history; and in both
countries, curiously enough, government by queens was common. But the
claims of Arabia decidedly preponderate. The Arabian Sheba was the great
spice country of the ancient world; whereas Ethiopia furnished no
spices. The Arabian Sheba was an important kingdom. Sheba in Ethiopia
was a mere town, subject to Meroe. And it may be doubted whether the
Cushite Sheba of Scripture [Gen 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md)
is not rather to be sought on the shores of the Persian Gulf ([Gen
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007) note.md), from where no one supposes
"the queen of Sheba" to have come. If Ophir be placed in Arabia, there
will be an additional reason for regarding Sheba as in the same quarter,
because then Solomon's trade with that place will account for his fame
having reached the Sabaean princess.

"The fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord," has been
variously explained, and is confessedly very obscure. May it not mean
what we should call "his religious fame," as distinct from his artistic,
literary, military, or political fame - "his fame with respect to God
and the things of God" - or, in other words, "his moral and religious
wisdom?" (compare [Kg1 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#006).md).

Hard questions - Or "riddles" [Jdg
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012.md), though not exactly riddles in
our sense. The Orientals have always been fond of playing with words and
testing each other's wit and intelligence by verbal puzzles of various
kinds. This spirit seems to have been particularly rife in Solomon's
time, for Josephus records other encounters with Hiram of Tyre and
another Tyrian called Abdemonus.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 10:2</span></span>

See [Kg1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md) note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 10:5</span></span>

And the meat of his table - Compare [Kg1
4:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md). The scene here described
receives very apt illustration from the Assyrian banquet scenes, where
we have numerous guests sitting, dressed handsomely in fringed robes,
with armlets upon their arms, and bracelets round their wrists,
attendants standing behind them, and magnificent drinking-cups,
evidently of a costly metal, in the hands of the guests, which are
filled from a great wine-bowl at one end of the chamber.

And his ascent by which he went up - A rendering preferable to "the
burnt-offering which he cffered in." The "ascent" was probably a private
way by which the king passed from his palace on the western hill, across
the ravine (Tyropoeum) and up the eastern hill, to the west side of the
temple area (compare the marginal reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 10:9</span></span>

Blessed be the Lord thy God - This acknowledgment of Yahweh falls below
the confessions of Hiram [Ch2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012.md) and
Cyrus [Ezr 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003.md). It does not imply more
than an admission of His power as a local deity; namely, that He is the
God of the Jews and of their country.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 10:10</span></span>

Strabo relates that the Sabaeans were enormously wealthy, and used gold
and silver in a most lavish manner in their furniture, their utensils,
and even on the walls, doors, and roofs of their houses. That the gold
of Sheba should be given to Solomon was prophesied by the writer of Ps
72 (see the marginal reference). The immense abundance of spices in
Arabia, and especially in the Yemen or Sabaean country, is noted by many
writers. According to Strabo, the spice-trade of Arabia was in the hands
of two nations, the Sabaeans and the Gerrhaeans. The spices in which
they dealt seem to have been only in part the produce of Arabia itself;
some of the most important kinds, as the cinnamon and the cassia, must
have been imported from India, since Arabia does not yield them. The
chief precious stones which Arabia now yields are the onyx and the
emerald. Anciently she is said to have produced other gems. Pearls, too,
were readily procurable in Arabia from the Persian Gulf fishery.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 10:11</span></span>

The navy of Hiram - i. e., Solomon's navy in the Red Sea, which was
chiefly manned by subjects of Hiram. (see the marginal reference).

Almug-trees - Probably the sandal-wood tree (pterocarpus santalinus).
The wood is very heavy, hard, and fine grained, and of a beautiful
garnet color, which, according to the rabbinical writers, was the color
of the algum. One of the names of the red sandal-wood, in its own native
country (India) is "valguka," a word of which "algum" is a natural
corruption.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 10:12</span></span>

Pillars - The Hebrew word signifies ordinarily a "prop" (margin). It is
generally supposed to mean in this place a "railing," or "balustrade," a
sense which connects and harmonises the present passage with the
parallel passage in Chronicles (marginal reference), where Solomon is
said to have made of the almug-wood "stairs" for the temple and for his
own house.

Harps - The Jewish harp כנור kı̂nnôr was of a triangular shape, and had
ordinarily ten strings. It probably resembled the more ancient harp of
the Assyrians, which was played with a plectrum, as was (ordinarily) the
"kinnor."

Psalteries - The psaltery, or viol. Hebrew: נבל nebel; Greek: νάβλα
nabla, was a stringed instrument played with the hand; perhaps a lyre,
like those on Hebrew coins, the sounding-board of which is shaped like a
jug; or, perhaps, a sort of guitar, with a hollow jug-shaped body at the
lower end.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 10:14</span></span>

Six hundred threescore and six talents of gold - About 3,646, 350 of our
money. Solomon's annual revenue exceeded that of Oriental empires very
much greater in extent than his, and must have made him one of the
richest, if not the very richest, of the monarchs of his time.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 10:15</span></span>

There is no mention in the original of "spice merchants." Two classes of
traders are spoken of; but both expressions are general.

Kings of Arabia - Rather, "kings of the mingled people" (compare [Jer
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024).md). These were probably tribes
half Jewish, half Arabian, on the borders of the western desert. They
are regarded as Arabs by the author of Chronicles (marginal reference).

Governors - The word used here is thought to be of Aryan origin. It
appears to have been a title given by the Persians to petty governors,
inferior to the great satraps of provinces. We find it borne by, among
others, Tatnai [Ezr 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006.md), Zerubbabel
[Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md), and Nehemiah [Neh
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014.md). It can scarcely have been in use
among the Jews so early as Solomon, and we must therefore suppose it to
have been substituted by the writer of Kings for some corresponding
Semitic title. The empire of Solomon was not a state governed from a
single center by an organisation of satrapies or provinces ([Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021) note.md). But exceptionally, in some
parts of the empire, the kings had been superseded by "governors"
(compare [Kg1 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#024).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 10:16</span></span>

The "targets" seem to have been long shields protecting the whole body,
while the "shields" of the next verse were bucklers of a smaller size,
probably round, and much lighter. They may be compared with the Assyrian
long shield, and the ordinary Assyrian round shield. As the amount of
gold used in each of the larger shields was only 600 shekels - worth
from 650 to 700 of our money - and that used in the smaller ones was
only half as much it is evident that the metal did not form the
substance of the shields, but was laid as a coating or plating over
them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 10:17</span></span>

These shields, together with the 500 taken by David from Hadadezer [Sa2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#007.md) were hung round the outer walls of
a building, reckoned as belonging to the "house of the Forest of
Lebanon," but separate from it, and called sometimes "the Tower of
David" [Sol 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004.md), or from its use "the
armoury" [Sol 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004.md); [Isa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008.md). The practice of hanging shields
outside walls for ornamentation seems to have existed at Tyre [Eze
27:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010.md), Rome, Athens, and elsewhere.
Traces of it are thought to be found in the Assyrian sculptures.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 10:18</span></span>

It is, on the whole, probable that the substance of the throne was wood,
and that the ivory, cut into thin slabs, and probably carved in
patterns, was applied externally as a veneer. This is found to have been
the practice in Assyria. The gold was probably not placed over the
ivory, but covered other parts of the throne.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 10:19</span></span>

Representations of thrones are frequent in the Egyptian and Assyrian
sculptures. They have no steps up to them, but frequently stand upon
square bases. The back appears to be flat at the top, not rounded.
Assyrian thrones have "stays" or arms on either side, and they stand
generally upon lion's feet. They are always accompanied by a footstool.

Lions stood beside the stays - The arms of Assyrian thrones are
occasionally supported by figures of animals. The throne of Rameses II
at Medinet Abou has a sphinx at the side and a lion below the sphinx.
The figure of the lion is naturally adopted by any imaginative race as
an emblem of sovereignty. In the present case its adoption seems to have
grown directly out of the poetic imagery of inspired prophets, who,
living before the time of Solomon, had compared Israel [Num
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024.md); [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md), and more particularly Judah [Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md), to a lion. The "twelve lions" of
[Kg1 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#020.md) were probably intended to
be emblematic of the twelve tribes. Josephus adds to the description of
Solomon's throne here given, that the seat was supported by a golden ox
or bull, with its head turned over its shoulder. As the lion was
especially emblematic of Judah, so was the ox or bull of Ephraim. ([Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md); [Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md); [Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018), etc..md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 10:20</span></span>

Solomon's throne, as described, is certainly grander than any of which
we have a representation, either in Assyria or Egypt. Much more, then,
would it transcend the thrones in inferior kingdoms.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 10:22</span></span>

This is given as the reason of the great plentifulness of silver in the
time of Solomon. The "navy of Tharshish" (not the same as the navy of
Ophir, [Kg1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026).md) must therefore have
imported very large quantities of that metal. Tharshish, or Tartessus,
in Spain, had the richest silver mines known in the ancient world, and
had a good deal of gold also; apes and ivory were produced by the
opposite coast of Africa; and, if north Africa did not produce
"peacocks," which is uncertain, she may have produced the birds called
here "tukkiyim," which some translate "parrots," others "guinea-fowl" -
the latter being a purely African bird. The etymology of the Hebrew
words here rendered "ivory," "apes," and "peacocks," is uncertain; but
even if of Indian origin, the Jews may have derived their first
knowledge of ivory, apes, and peacocks, through nations which traded
with India, and may thus have got the words into their language long
before the time of Solomon. The names once fixed would be retained,
whatever the quarter from where the things were procured afterward.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 10:23</span></span>

See the marginal references. By "all the earth" we are, of course, only
to understand the kings or people of neighboring nations.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 10:25</span></span>

His present - i. e., his tribute ([Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021) note.md). A statement illustrated by
Egyptian and Assyrian sculptures on slabs and obelisks. Tribute-bearers
from the subject kings, bring not only the fixed rate of bullion, but a
tribute in kind besides, consisting of the most precious products of
their respective countries.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 10:26</span></span>

See [Kg1 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md) note. Until the time of
Solomon, war-chariots had not been in use among the Jews, except to a
very small extent [Ch1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004.md). Hence, it
was necessary for him to put himself on an equality in this respect with
neighboring powers.

Cities for chariots - They were probably fortresses upon the borders of
his territory, in which he maintained the standing army necessary for
the support of his dominion.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 10:27</span></span>

Made silver as stones - This strong hyperbole marks in the most striking
way the great wealth and prosperity of the capital during Solomon's
reign. The lavish expenditure which impoverished the provinces, and
produced, or helped to produce, the general discontent that led to the
outbreak under Jeroboam, enriched the metropolis, which must have
profited greatly by the residence of the court, the constant influx of
opulent strangers, and the periodical visits of all Israelites not
hindered by some urgent reason at the great festivals.

The "sycomore-trees in the vale" (Shephelah) are mentioned also in [Ch1
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#028.md). Like the olives and the vines,
they were placed by David under a special overseer, on account of their
value. The tree meant seems to be the sycomore proper, or
"fig-mulberry," which is still common in Palestine, and is highly
esteemed both on account of its fruit and its timber.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 10:28</span></span>

The word translated "linen yarn" is thought now by Hebraists to mean "a
troop" or "company." If the present reading is retained, they would
translate the passage - "As for the bringing up of Solomon's horses out
of Egypt, a band of the king's merchants fetched a band (or troop) of
horses at a price." But the reading is very uncertain. The Septuagint
had before them a different one, which they render "and from Tekoa."
Tekoa, the home of Amos [Amo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md), was
a small town on the route from Egypt to Jerusalem, through which the
horses would have naturally passed. The monuments of the 18th and of
later dynasties make it clear that the horse, though introduced from
abroad, became very abundant in Egypt. During the whole period of
Egyptian prosperity the corps of chariots constituted a large and
effective portion of the army. That horses were abundant in Egypt at the
time of the Exodus is evident from [Exo
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#003.md); [Exo
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#009.md), [Exo
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#023.md), [Exo
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028.md); [Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md). That they continued numerous in
later times appears from frequent allusions, both in the Historical
Books of Scripture and in the prophets, as [Kg2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006.md); [Kg2
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#024.md); [Isa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#009.md); [Eze
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015.md), etc. The monuments show that
the horse was employed by the Egyptians in peace no less than in war,
private persons being often represented as paying visits to their
friends in chariots.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 10:29</span></span>

Taking the shekel at about three shillings of our money, six hundred
silver shekels would be equal to about 90; and 150 shekels to 22 British
pounds and 10 shillings. "Average" price seems to be in each case
intended; and we may account for the comparatively high price of the
chariot by supposing that by "chariot" is intended the entire equipage,
including car, harness, and trained horses, of which there would be two
at least, if not three. The "horses" mentioned separately from the
chariots are not chariot-horses, but chargers for the cavalry.

The kings of the Hittites - See [Kg2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006.md) note. The kings intended were
probably Solomon's vassals, whose armies were at his disposal if he
required their aid.
