### [Matthew Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 20:1</span></span>

For the kingdom of heaven ... - The word "for" shows that this chapter
should have been connected with the preceding. The parable was spoken
expressly to illustrate the sentiment in the last verse of that chapter:
"Many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first." The
kingdom of heaven means here the church, including, perhaps, its state
here and hereafter. See the notes at [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md). It has reference to rewards, and
the meaning may be thus expressed: "Rewards shall be bestowed in my
kingdom, or on my followers, in the same manner as they were by a
certain householder - in such a way that the last shall be equal to the
first, and the first last."

A householder - A master of a family. One at the head of family affairs.

His vineyard - No inconsiderable part of Judea was employed in the
culture of the grape. Vineyards are often used, therefore, to represent
a fertile or well-cultivated place, and hence the church, denoting the
care and culture that God has bestowed on it. See the notes at [Isa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md). Compare [Jer
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010.md). For the manner of their
construction, see the notes at [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md).

[Matthew 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 20:2</span></span>

A penny a day - The coin here referred to was a Roman coin, equal in
value, at different periods, to 15 cents or 17 cents (7 1/2 d. to 8 1/2
d.) (circa 1880's). The original denotes the Roman denarius δηνάριον
dēnarion, a silver coin, which was originally equivalent to ten ases (a
brass Roman coin), from which it gets its name. The consular denarius
bore on one side a head of Rome, and an X or a star, to denote the value
in ases, and a chariot with either two or four horses. At a later period
the casts of different deities were on the obverse, and these were
finally superseded by the heads of the Caesars. Many specimens of this
coin have been preserved.

It was probably at that time the price of a day's labor. See Tobit 5:14.
This was the common wages of a Roman soldier. In England, before the
discovery of the mines of gold and silver in South America, and
consequently before money was plenty, the price of labor was about in
proportion. In 1351 the price of labor was regulated by law, and was a
penny a day; but provisions were of course proportionally cheap, and the
avails of a man's labor in articles of food were nearly as much as they
are now.

[Matthew 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 20:3</span></span>

About the third hour - The Jews divided their days into twelve equal
parts, or hours, beginning at sunrise and ending at sunset. This was,
therefore about nine o'clock in the morning.

Standing idle in the market-place - A place where provisions are sold in
towns. Of course, many resort to such places, and it would be the
readiest place to meet persons and find employers. They were not,
therefore, disposed to be idle, but were waiting in the proper place to
find employers.

[Matthew 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 20:4</span></span>

Whatsoever is right - Whatsoever it shall appear you can earn. The
contract with the first was definite; with this one it depended on the
judgment of the employer.

[Matthew 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 20:5</span></span>

The sixth and ninth hour - That is, about twelve o'clock and three
o'clock.

[Matthew 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 20:6</span></span>

The eleventh hour - About five o'clock in the afternoon, or when there
was but one working hour of the day left.

[Matthew 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 20:8</span></span>

When even was come - That is, when the twelfth hour had come; the day
was ended, and the time of payment was come.

The steward - A steward is one who transacts business in the place of
another. He was one who had the administration of affairs in the absence
of the householder, who provided for the family, and who was entrusted
with the payment of laborers and servants. He was commonly the most
trusty and faithful of the servants, raised to that station as a reward
for his fidelity.

Beginning from the last unto the first - It was immaterial where he
began to pay, provided he dealt justly by them. In the parable this
order is mentioned to give opportunity for the remarks which follow. Had
those first hired been first paid, they would have departed satisfied,
and the point of the parable would have been lost.

[Matthew 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 20:9</span></span>

They received every man a penny - There was no agreement how much they
should receive, but merely that justice should be done, [Mat
20:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#004.md), [Mat
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#007.md). The householder supposed they
had earned it, or chose to make a present to them to compensate for the
loss of the first part of the day, when they were willing to work, but
could not find employment.

[Matthew 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 20:10</span></span>

They supposed that they should have received more - They had worked
longer - they had been in the heat; they supposed that it was his
intention to pay them, not according to contract, but according to the
time of the labor.

[Matthew 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 20:11</span></span>

Murmured - Complained; found fault with.

The goodman of the house - The original here is the same word which in
[Mat 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md) is translated householder,
and should have been so translated here. It is the old English way of
denoting the father of a family. It expresses no moral quality.

[Matthew 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 20:12</span></span>

The burden and heat of the day - The burden means the heavy labor, the
severe toil. We have continued at that toil in the heat of the day. The
others had worked only a little while, and that in the cool of the
evening, and when it was fax more pleasant and much less fatiguing.

[Matthew 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 20:13</span></span>

Friend, I do thee no wrong - I have fully complied with the contract. We
had an agreement: I have paid all that I promised. If I choose to give a
penny to another man if he labors little or not at all if I should
choose to give all my property away to others, it would not affect this
contract with you: it is fully met; and with my own with that on which
you have no further claim I may do as I please. So, if Christians are
just, and pay their lawful debts, and injure no one, the world has no
right to complain if they give the rest of their property to the poor,
or devote it to send the gospel to the pagan, or to release the prisoner
or the captive. It is their own. They have a right to do with it as they
please. They are answerable, not to people, but to God, and infidels,
and worldly people, and cold professors in the church have no right to
interfere.

[Matthew 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 20:14</span></span>

Take that thine is - Take what is justly due to you what is properly
your own.

[Matthew 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 20:15</span></span>

Is thine we evil because I am good? - The Hebrews used the word evil,
when applied to the eye, to denote one envious and malicious, [Deu
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009.md); [Pro
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006.md). The eye is called evil in such
cases, because envy and malice show themselves directly in the eye. No
passions are so fully expressed by the eye as these. "Does envy show
itself in the eye? is thine eye so soon turned to express envy and
malice because I have chosen to do good?"

[Matthew 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 20:16</span></span>

So the last shall be first ... - This is the moral or scope of the
parable. "To teach this it was spoken." Many that, in the order of time,
are brought last into the kingdom, shall be first in the rewards. Higher
proportionate rewards shall be given to them than to others. "To all
justice shall be done." To all to whom the rewards of heaven are
promised they shall be given. Nothing shall be withheld that was
promised. If, among this number who are called into the kingdom, I
choose to raise some to stations of distinguished usefulness, and to
confer on them special talents and higher rewards, I injure no other
one. They shall enter heaven, as was promised. If, amid the multitude of
Christians, I choose to signalize such men as Paul, and Martyn, and
Brainerd, and Spencer, and Summerfield - to appoint some of them to
short labor but to wide usefulness, and raise them to signal rewards, I
injure not the great multitude of others who live long lives less useful
and less rewarded. All shall reach heaven, and all shall receive what I
promise to the faithful.

Many be called, but few chosen - The meaning of this, in this
connection, I take to be simply this: "Many are called into my kingdom;
they come and labor as I command them; many of them are comparatively
unknown and obscure; yet they are real Christians, and shall all receive
the proper reward. A few I have chosen for higher stations in the
church. I have endowed them with apostolic gifts or with superior
talents, and suited them for wider usefulness. They may not be as long
in the vineyard as others; their race may be sooner run; but I have
chosen to honor them in this manner, and I have a right to do it. I
injure no one, and have a right to do what I will with my own." Thus
explained, this parable has no reference to the call of the Gentiles,
nor to the call of aged sinners, nor to the call of sinners out of the
church at all. It is simply designed to teach that in the church, among
the multitudes who will be saved, Christ makes a difference. He makes
some more useful than others, without regard to the time which they
serve, and he will reward them accordingly. The parable teaches one
truth, and but one; and where Jesus has explained it, we have no right
to add to it, and say that it teaches anything else. It adds to the
reason for this interpretation, that Christ was conversing about the
rewards that should be given to his followers, and not about the numbers
that should be called, or about the doctrine of election. See [Mat
19:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#027.md).

[Matthew 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 20:17</span></span>

See also [Mar 10:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032.md); [Luk
18:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031.md).

And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem - That is, doubtless, to the Passover.
This journey was from the east side of Jordan. See the notes at [Mat
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md). At this time he was on this
journey to Jerusalem, probably not far from Jericho. This was his last
journey to Jerusalem. He was going up to die for the sins of the world.

Took the twelve disciples apart - All the males of the Jews were
required to be at this feast, [Exo
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017.md). The roads, therefore, on such
occasions, would probably be thronged. It is probable, also, that they
would travel in companies, or that whole neighborhoods would go
together. See [Luk 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#044.md). By his taking
them apart is meant his taking them aside from the company. He had
something to communicate which he did not wish the others to hear. Mark
adds: "And Jesus went before them, and they were amazed; and as they
followed they were sore afraid." He led the way. He had told them before
[Mat 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022.md) that he should be betrayed
into the hands of people and be put to death. They began now to be
afraid that this would happen, and to be solicitous for his life and for
their own safety, and they were amazed at his boldness and calmness, and
at his fixed determination to go up to Jerusalem in these circumstances.

[Mat 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#018.md), [Mat
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#019.md)

Behold, we go up to Jerusalem - Jesus assured them that what they feared
would come to pass, but he had, in some measure, prepared their minds
for this state of suffering by the promises which he had made to them,
[Mat 19:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#027.md); 20:1-16. In all their
sufferings they might be assured that eternal rewards were before them.

Shall be betrayed - See [Mat 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022.md).
"Unto the chief priests and scribes." The high priest, and the learned
men who composed the Sanhedrin or the Great Council of the nation. He
was thus betrayed by Judas, [Mat
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015.md). He was delivered to the chief
priests and scribes, [Mat 26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057.md).

And they shall condemn him to death - They had not power to inflict
death, as that power had been taken away by the Romans; but they had the
power of expressing an opinion, and of delivering him to the Romans to
be put to death. This they did, [Mat
26:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#066.md); [Mat
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#002.md).

Shall deliver him to the Gentiles - That is, because they have not the
right of inflicting capital punishment, they will deliver him to those
who have to the Roman authorities. The Gentiles here means Pontius
Pilate and the Roman soldiers. See [Mat
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#002.md), [Mat
27:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027.md).

To mock - See the notes at [Mat 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#016.md).

To scourge - That is, to whip. This was done with thongs, or a whip made
for the purpose, and this punishment was commonly inflicted upon
criminals before crucifixion. See the notes at [Mat
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017.md).

To crucify him - That is, to put him to death on a cross - the common
punishment of slaves. See the notes at [Mat
27:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#031.md).

The third day ... - For the evidence that this was fulfilled, see the
notes at [Mat 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#015.md). Mark and Luke say
that he would be spit upon. Spitting on another has always been
considered an expression of the deepest contempt. Luke says [Luk
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031.md), "All things that are written by
the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished." Among
other things, he says he shall be "spitefully entreated;" that is,
treated with spite or malice; malice, implying contempt. These
sufferings of our Saviour, and this treatment, and his death, had been
predicted in many places. See [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md); [Dan
9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md).

[Matthew 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 20:20</span></span>

See also [Mar 10:35-45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035.md).

[Mat 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020.md)

Then came to him give mother of Zebedee's children ... - This was
probably Salome, [Mar 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040.md); [Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md).

With her sons - The names of these sons were James and John, [Mar
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035.md)

Mark says they came and made the request. That is, they made it, as
appears from Matthew, through the medium of their mother; they requested
her to ask it for them. It is not improbable that she was an ambitious
woman, and was desirous to see her sons honored.

Worshipping him - Showing him respect; respectfully saluting him. In the
original, kneeling. See the notes at [Mat
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002.md).

[Mat 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#021.md)

Grant that these my two sons may sit ... - They were still looking for a
temporal kingdom.

They expected that he would reign on the earth with great pomp and
glory. They anticipated that he would conquer as a prince and a warrior.
They wished to be distinguished in the day of his triumph. To sit on the
right and left hand of a prince was a token of confidence, and the
highest honor granted to his friends, [Kg1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#019.md); [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md); [Sa1
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#025.md). The disciples, here, had no
reference to the kingdom of heaven, but only to the kingdom which they
supposed he was about to set up on the earth.

[Mat 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022.md)

Ye know not what ye ask - You do not know the nature of your request,
nor what would be involved in it.

You suppose that it would be attended only with honor and happiness if
the request was granted, whereas it would require much suffering and
trial.

Are ye able to drink of the cup ... - To drink of a cup, in the
Scriptures, often signifies to be afflicted, or to be punished, [Mat
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md); [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md), [Isa
51:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#022.md); [Psa
73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010.md); [Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md); [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md); [Rev
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#009.md). The figure is taken from a
feast, where the master of a feast extends a cup to those present. Thus
God is represented as extending to his Son a cup filled with a bitter
mixture - one causing deep sufferings, [Joh
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011.md). This was the cup to which he
referred.

The baptism that I am baptized with - This is evidently a phrase
denoting the same thing. Are ye able to suffer with me - to endure the
trials and pains which shall come upon you and me in endeavoring to
build up my kingdom? Are you able to bear it when sorrows shall cover
you like water, and you shall be sunk beneath calamities as floods, in
the work of religion? Afflictions are often expressed by being sunk in
the floods and plunged in deep waters, [Psa
69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md); [Isa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002.md); [Psa
124:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md); [Lam
3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054.md).

[Mat 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023.md)

Ye shall indeed drink of my cup ... - You will follow me, and you will
partake of my afflictions, and will suffer as I shall.

This was fulfilled. James was slain with the sword by Herod, [Act
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#002.md). John lived many years; but he
attended the Saviour through his sufferings, and was himself banished to
Patmos, a solitary island, for the testimony of Jesus Christ - a
companion of others in tribulation, [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md).

Is not mine to give ... - The translation of this place evidently does
not express the sense of the original. The translation expresses the
idea that Jesus has nothing to do in bestowing rewards on his followers.
This is at variance with the uniform testimony of the Scriptures, [Mat
25:31-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md); [Joh
5:22-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md). The correct translation of
the passage would be, "To sit on my right hand and on my left is not
mine to give, except to those for whom it is prepared by my Father." The
passage thus declares that Christ would give rewards to his followers,
but only to such as should be entitled to them according to the purpose
of his Father. Much as he might be attached to these two disciples, yet
he could not bestow any such signal favors on them out of the regular
course of things. Rewards were prepared for his followers, and in due
time they should be bestowed. He would bestow them according as they had
been provided from eternity by God the Father, [Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md). The correct sense is seen by
leaving out that part of the verse in italics, and this is one of the
places in the Bible where the sense has been obscured by the
introduction of words which have nothing to correspond with them in the
original. See a similar instance in [Jo1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023.md).

[Mat 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#024.md)

The ten heard it - That is, the ten other apostles.

They were moved with indignation - They were offended at their ambition,
and at their desire to be exalted above their brethren.

The word "it" refers not to what Jesus said, but to their request. When
the ten heard the request which they had made they were indignant.

[Mat 20:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#025.md)

But Jesus called them unto him - That is, he called all the apostles to
him, and stated the principles on which they were to act.

The princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them - That is, over
their subjects. "You know that such honors are customary among nations.
The kings of the earth raise their favorites to posts of trust and power
they give authority to some over others; but my kingdom is established
in a different manner. All are to be on a level. The rich, the poor, the
learned, the unlearned, the bond, the free, are to be equal. He will be
the most distinguished that shows most humility, the deepest sense of
his unworthiness, and the most earnest desire to promote the welfare of
his brethren."

Gentiles - All who were not Jews - used here to denote the manner in
which human governments are constituted.

Minister - A servant. The original word is deacon - a word meaning a
servant of any kind; one especially who served at the table, and, in the
New Testament, one who serves the church, [Act
6:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md); [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md). Preachers of the gospel are
called minister's because they are the servants of God and of the church
[Co1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005.md); [Co1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001.md); [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md); [Co2
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004.md); [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md); an office, therefore, which
forbids them to lord it over God's heritage, which is the very opposite
of a station of superiority, and which demands the very lowest degree of
humility.

[Mat 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md)

Even as the Son of man ... - See the notes at [Mat
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020.md). Jesus points them to his own
example. He was in the form of God in heaven, [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md). He came to people in the form of
a servant, [Phi 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md). He came not with
pomp and glory, but as a man in humble life; and since he came he had
not required them to minister to him. "He labored for them." He strove
to do them good. He provided for their needs; fared as poorly as they
did; went before them in dangers and sufferings; practiced self-denial
on their account, and for them was about to lay down his life. See [Joh
13:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md).

To give his life a ransom for many - The word "ransom" means literally a
price paid for the redemption of captives. In war, when prisoners are
taken by an enemy, the money demanded for their release is called a
ransom; that is, it is the means by which they are set at liberty. So
anything that releases anyone from a state of punishment, or suffering,
or sin, is called a ransom. People are by nature captives to sin. They
are sold under it. They are under condemnation, [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md); [Rom

3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md); [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md). They are under a curse, [Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md). They are in love with sin They
are under its withering dominion, and are exposed to death eternal, [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md); [Psa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md); [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md); [Psa
68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002.md); [Psa

25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046.md); [Rom
2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md). They must have perished unless
there had been some way by which they could he rescued. This was done by
the death of Jesus - by giving his life a ransom. The meaning is, that
he died in the place of sinners, and that God was willing to accept the
pains of his death in the place of the eternal suffering of the
redeemed. The reasons why such a ransom was necessary are:

1\. that God had declared that the sinner shall die; that is, that he
would punish, or show his hatred to, all sin.

2\. that all people had sinned, and, if justice was to take its regular
course, all must perish.

3\. that man could make no atonement for his own sins. All that he could
do, were he holy, would be only to do his duty, and would make no amends
for the past. Repentance and future obedience would not blot away one
sin.

4\. No man was pure, and no angel could make atonement. God was pleased,
therefore, to appoint his only-begotten Son to make such a ransom. See
[Joh 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); [Jo1

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 20:29</span></span>

See [Mar 10:46-52](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#046.md), and [Luk
18:35-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#035.md); [Luk
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md), where this account of his
restoring to sight two blind men is also recorded. "And as they departed
from Jericho." This was a large town about eight miles west of the
Jordan, and about 19 miles northeast from Jerusalem. Near to this city
the Israelites crossed the Jordan when they entered into the land of
Canaan, [Jos 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016.md). It was the first
city taken by Joshua, who destroyed it to the foundation, and pronounced
a curse on him who should rebuild it, [Jos
6:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#020.md), [Jos
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026.md). This curse was literally
fulfilled in the days of Ahab, nearly 500 years later, [Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md). It afterward became the place
of the school of the prophets, [Kg2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#005.md). In this place Elisha worked a
signal miracle, greatly to the advantage of the inhabitants, by
rendering the waters near it, that were before bitter, sweet and
wholesome, [Kg2 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#021.md). In point of size
it was second only to Jerusalem. It was sometimes called the city of
palm-trees, from the fact that there were many palms in the vicinity.

A few of them are still remaining, [Ch2
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015.md); [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md); [Jdg
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md). At this place died Herod the
Great, of a most wretched and foul disease. See the notes at [Mat
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#019.md). It is now a small village,
wretched in its appearance, and inhabited by a very few persons, and
called "Riha, or Rah," situated on the ruins of the ancient city (or, as
some think, three or four miles east of it), which a modern traveler
describes as a poor, dirty village of the Arabs. There are perhaps fifty
houses, of rough stone, with roofs of bushes and mud, and the
population, two or three hundred, in number, is entirely Muslim. Dr.
Thomson (The Land and the Book, vol. ii. p. 443) says of this village,
that there are some forty or fifty of the most forlorn habitations that
I have seen. And this is Jericho! These houses, or rather huts, are
surrounded by a special kind of fortification, made of nubk, a species
of bush very abundant in this plain. Its thorns are so sharp and the
branches are so platted together that neither horse nor man will attack
it." The road from Jerusalem to Jericho lies through what is called the
"wilderness of Jericho," and is described by modern travelers as the
most dangerous and forbidding about Palestine. As recently as 1820, an
English traveler, Sir Frederick Henniker, was attacked on this road by
the Arabs with firearms, who left him naked and severely wounded. See
the notes at [Luk 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md). Jesus was
going to Jerusalem from the east side of the Jordan [Mat
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md); his regular journey was
therefore through Jericho.

As they departed from Jericho - Luke says, "As he was come nigh unto
Jericho." The original word used in Luke, translated "was come nigh,"
commonly expresses approach to a place, but it does not of necessity
mean that always. It may denote nearness to a place, whether going to it
or from it. It would be rendered here correctly, "when they were near to
Jericho," or when they were in the vicinity of it, without saying
whether they were going to it or from it. Matthew and Mark say they were
going from it. The passage in [Luk
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md) - "and Jesus entered and passed
through Jericho" - which seems to be mentioned as having taken place
after the cure of the blind man, does not necessarily suppose that. That
passage might be intended to be connected with the account of Zacchaeus,
and not to denote the order of time in which these events took place;
but simply that as he was passing through Jericho, Zacchaeus sought to
see him, and invited him to his house. Historians vary in the
circumstances and order of events. The main facts of the narrative are
observed; and such variations of circumstances and order, where there is
no palpable contradiction, show the honesty of the writers - show that
they did not conspire together to deceive, and are in courts of justice
considered as confirmations of the truth of the testimony.

[Mat 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#030.md)

Two blind men - Mark and Luke mention but one.

They do not say, however, that there was no more than one. They mention
one because he was probably well known; perhaps the son of a
distinguished citizen reduced to poverty. His name was Bartimeus. Bar is
a Syriac word, meaning "son;" and the name means, therefore, "the son of
Timeus." Probably "Timeus" was a man of distinction; and as the case of
his son attracted most attention, Mark and Luke recorded it
particularly. If they had said that there was only one healed, there
would have been a contradiction. As it is, there is no more
contradiction or difficulty than there is in the fact that the
evangelists, like all other historians, often omit many facts which they
do not choose to record.

Heard that Jesus passed by - They learned who he was by inquiring. They
heard a noise, and asked who it was (Luke). They had doubtless heard
much of his fame, but had never before been where he was, and probably
would not be again. They were therefore more earnest in calling upon
him.

Son of David - That is, "Messiah," or "Christ." This was the name by
which the Messiah was commonly known. He was the illustrious descendant
of David in whom the promises especially centered, [Psa
132:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md); [Psa
89:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md). It was the universal opinion
of the Jews that the Messiah was to be the descendant of David. See [Mat
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042.md). On the use of the word son, see
the notes at [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md).

[Mat 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#031.md)

And the multitude rebuked them because ... - They chid or reproved them,
and in a threatening manner told them to be silent.

They cried the more - Jesus, standing still, ordered them to be brought
to him (Mark)

His friends then addressed the blind men and told them that Jesus called
(Mark). Mark adds that Bartimeus cast away his garment, and rose and
came to Jesus. "The garment" was not his only raiment, but was the outer
garment, thrown loosely over him, and commonly laid aside when persons
labored or ran. See the notes at [Mat
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040.md). His doing it denoted haste and
earnestness in order to come to Jesus.

[Mat 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#034.md)

And touched their eyes - Mark and Luke say he added, "Thy faith hath
saved thee." Thy "confidence, or belief" that I could cure, has been the
means of obtaining this blessing.

Faith had no power to open the eyes, but it led the blind men to Jesus;
it showed that they had just views of his power; it was connected with
the cure. So "faith" has no power to save from sin, but it leads the
poor, lost, blind sinner to him who has power, and in this sense it is
said we are saved by faith. His "touching" their eyes was merely "a
sign" that the power of healing proceeded from him.

Here was an undoubted miracle.

1\. These blind men were well known. One, at least, had been blind for a
long time.

2\. They were strangers to Jesus. They could not have, therefore,
"feigned" themselves blind, or done this by any "collusion or agreement"
between him and themselves in order to impose on the multitude.

3\. The miracle was in the presence of multitudes who took a deep
interest in it, and who could easily have detected the imposition if
there had been any.

4\. The people followed him. They praised or "glorified" God (Mark and
Luke). The people gave praise to God also (Luke). They were all
satisfied that a real miracle was performed.

Remarks On Matthew 20

1\. From the parable at the beginning of this chapter Mat. 20:1-16 we
learn that it is not so much the time that we serve Christ as the
"manner," that is to entitle us to high rewards in heaven. Some may be
in the church many years, yet accomplish little. In a few years, others
may be more distinguished in the success of their labors and in their
rewards.

2\. God will do justice to all, [Mat
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#013.md). He will give to every one of
his followers all that he promised to give. To him entitled to the least
he will give everything which he has promised, and to each one
infinitely more than he has deserved.

3\. On some he will bestow higher rewards than on others, [Mat
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md). There is no reason to think
that the condition of people in heaven will be "equal," any more than it
is on earth. Difference of rank may run through all God's government,
and still no one be degraded or be deprived of his rights.

4\. God does as he pleases with his own, [Mat
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015.md). It is his right to do so - a
right which people claim, and which God may claim. If he does injustice
to no one, he has a right to bestow what favors on others he pleases. In
doing good to another man he does no injury to me. He violated none of
my rights by bestowing great talents on Newton or great wealth on
Solomon. He did not injure me by making Paul a man of distinguished
talents and piety, or John a man of much meekness and love. What he
gives me I should be thankful for and improve; nor should I be envious
or malignant that he has given to others more than he has to me. Nay, I
should rejoice that he has bestowed such favors on undeserving people at
all; that the race is in possession of such talents and rewards, to
whosoever given; and should believe that in the hands of God such favors
will be well bestowed. God is a sovereign, and the Judge of all the
earth will do that which is right.

5\. It is our duty to go into the vineyard and labor faithfully when
ever the Lord Jesus calls us, and until he calls us to receive our
reward, Mat. 20:1-16. He has a right to call us, and there are none who
are not invited to labor for Him.

6\. Rewards are offered to all who will serve him, [Mat
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#004.md). It is not that we deserve any
favor, or that we shall not say at the end of life that we have been
"unprofitable" servants, but He graciously promises that our rewards
shall be measured by our faithfulness in His cause. He will have the
glory of bringing us into His kingdom and saving us, while He will
bestow rewards on us according as we have been faithful in His service.

7\. People may be saved in old age, [Mat
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#006.md). Old people are sometimes brought
into the kingdom of Christ and made holy, but it is rare. Few aged
people are converted. They drop into the grave as they lived; and to a
man who wastes his youth and his middle life in sin, and goes down into
the vale of years a rebel against God, there is a dreadful probability
that he will die as he lived. It will be found to be true, probably,
that by far more than half who are saved are converted before they reach
the age of 20. Besides, it is foolish as well as wicked to spend the
best of our days in the service of Satan, and to give to God only the
poor remnant of our lives that we can no longer use in the cause of
wickedness. God should have our first and best days.

8\. Neither this parable nor any part of the Bible should be so abused
as to lead us to put off the time of repentance to old age. It is
"possible," though not "probable," that we shall live to be old. Few,
few, of all the world, live to old age. Thousands die in childhood. The
time, the accepted time to serve God, is in early life; and God will
require it at the hands of parents and teachers if they do not train up
the children committed to them to love and obey Him.

9\. One reason why we do not understand the plain doctrines of the Bible
is our own prejudice, [Mat 20:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017.md).
Our Saviour plainly told his disciples that he must die. He stated the
manner of his death, and the principal circumstances. To us, all this is
plain, but they did not understand it (Luke). They had filled their
heads with notions about his earthly glory and honor, and they were not
willing to see the truth as he stated it. Never was there a more just
proverb than that "none are so blind as those who will not see." So to
us the Bible might be plain enough. The doctrines of truth are revealed
as clear as a sunbeam, but we are filled with previous notions - we are
determined to think differently; and the easiest way to gratify this is
to say we do not see it so. The only correct principle of interpretation
is, that the Bible is to be taken "just as it is." The meaning that the
sacred writers intended to teach is to be sought honestly; and when
found, that, and that only, is religious truth.

10\. Mothers should be cautious about seeking places of honor for their
sons, [Mat 20:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020.md). Doing this, they
seldom know what they ask. They may be seeking the ruin of their
children. it is not in posts of honor that happiness or salvation are
certainly secured. Contentment and peace are found oftenest in the
humble vale of honest and sober industry - in attempting to fill up our
days with usefulness in the situation where God has placed us. As the
purest and loveliest streams often flow in the retired grove, far from
the thundering cataract or the stormy ocean, so is the sweet peace of
the soul; it dwells oftenest far from the bustle of public life, and the
storms and tempests of ambition.

11\. Ambition in the church is exceedingly improper, [Mat
20:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022.md). It is not the nature of
religion to produce it. It is opposed to all the modest, retiring, and
pure virtues that Christianity produces. An ambitious man will be
destitute of religion just in proportion to his ambition, and piety may
always be measured by humility. He that has the most lowly views of
himself, and the highest of God - that is willing to stoop the lowest to
aid his fellow-creatures and to honor God has the most genuine piety.
Such was the example of our Saviour, and it can never be any dishonor to
imitate the Son of God.

12\. The case of the blind men is an expressive representation of the
condition of the sinner, [Mat
20:30-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#030.md).

\(1\) people are blinded by sin. They do not by nature see the truth of
religion.

\(2\) it is proper in this state of "blindness" to call upon Jesus to
open our eyes. If we ever see, it will be by the grace of God. God is
the fountain of light, and those in darkness should seek him.

\(3\) present opportunities should be improved. This was the first time
that Jesus had been in Jericho. It was the last time he would be there.
He was passing through it on his way to Jerusalem. So he passes among us
by his ordinances. So it may be the last time that we shall have an
opportunity to call upon him. While he is near we should seek him.

\(4\) when people rebuke us and laugh at us, it should not deter us from
calling on the Saviour. There is danger that they will laugh us out of
our purpose to seek him, and we should cry the more earnestly to him. We
should feel that our eternal all depends on our being heard.

\(5\) the persevering cry of those who seek the Saviour aright will not
be in vain. They who cry to him, sensible of their blindness, and
sensible that he only can open their eyes, will be heard. He turns none
away who thus call upon him.

\(6\) sinners must rise and come to Jesus. They must cast away
everything that hinders their coming. As the blind Bartimeus threw off
his "garments," so sinners should throw away everything that hinders
their going to him everything that obstructs their progress and cast
themselves at his feet. No man will be saved while "sitting still." The
command is, "Strive to enter in;" and the promise is made to those only
who "ask," and "seek," and "knock."

\(7\) faith is the only channel through which we shall receive mercy.
According to our faith - that is, our confidence in Jesus, our trust and
reliance on him so will it be to us. Without that, we shall perish.

\(8\) they who apply to Jesus thus will receive sight. Their eyes will
be opened and they will see clearly.

\(9\) they who are thus restored to sight should follow Jesus. They
should follow him wherever he leads; they should follow him always; they
should follow none else but him. He that can give sight to the blind
cannot lead us astray. He that can shed light in the "beginning" of our
faith, can enlighten our goings through all our pilgrimage, and even
down through the dark valley of the shadow of death.
