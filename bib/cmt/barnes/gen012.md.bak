\- The Call of Abram

6\. שׁכם shekem Shekem, "the upper part of the back." Here it is the
name of a person, the owner of this place, where afterward is built the
town called at first Shekem, then Flavia Neapolis, and now Nablous. אלון
'ēlôn "the oak;" related: "be lasting, strong." מורה môreh In Onkelos
"plain;" Moreh, "archer, early rain, teacher." Here the name of a man
who owned the oak that marked the spot. In the Septuagint it is rendered
ὑψηγήν hupseegeen.

8\. בית־אל bēyt-'êl, Bethel, "house of God." ים yam "sea, great river,
west." עי ‛ay, 'Ai, "heap."

9\. נגב negeb "south."

The narrative now takes leave of the rest of the Shemites, as well as
the other branches of the human family, and confines itself to Abram. It
is no part of the design of Scripture to trace the development of
worldliness. It marks its source, and indicates the law of its downward
tendency; but then it turns away from the dark detail, to devote its
attention to the way by which light from heaven may again pierce the
gloom of the fallen heart. Here, then, we have the starting of a new
spring of spiritual life in the human race.

[Gen 12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

Having brought the affairs of Terah's family to a fit resting point, the
sacred writer now reverts to the call of Abram. This, we have seen, took
place when he was seventy years of age, and therefore five years before
the death of Terah. "The Lord said unto Abram." Four hundred and
twenty-two years on the lowest calculation after the last recorded
communication with Noah, the Lord again opens his mouth, to Abram. Noah,
Shem, or Heber, must have been in communication with heaven, indeed, at
the time of the confusion of tongues, and hence, we have an account of
that miraculous interposition. The call of Abram consists of a command
and a promise. The command is to leave the place of all his old and fond
associations, for a land which he had not yet seen, and therefore did
not know. Three ties are to be severed in complying with this command -
his country, in the widest range of his affections; his place of birth
and kindred comes closer to his heart; his father's house is the inmost
circle of all his tender emotions. All these are to be resigned; not,
however, without reason. The reason may not be entirely obvious to the
mind of Abram. But he has entire faith in the reasonableness of what God
proposes. So with reason and faith he is willing to go to the unknown
land. It is enough that God will show him the land to which he is now
sent.

[Gen 12:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md)

The promise corresponds to the command. If he is to lose much by his
exile, he will also gain in the end. The promise contains a lower and
higher blessing. The lower blessing has three parts: "First, I will make
of thee a great nation." This will compensate for the loss of his
country. The nation to which he had hitherto belonged was fast sinking
into polytheism and idolatry. To escape from it and its defiling
influence was itself a benefit; but to be made himself the head of a
chosen nation was a double blessing. Secondly, "And bless thee." The
place of his birth and kindred was the scene of all his past earthly
joys. But the Lord will make up the loss to him in a purer and safer
scene of temporal prosperity. Thirdly, "And make thy name great." This
was to compensate him for his father's house. He was to be the patriarch
of a new house, on account of which he would be known and venerated all
over the world.

The higher blessing is expressed in these remarkable terms: "And be thou
a blessing." He is to be not merely a subject of blessing, but a medium
of blessing to others. It is more blessed to give than to receive. And
the Lord here confers on Abram the delightful prerogative of dispensing
good to others. The next verse expands this higher element of the divine
promise. "I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
thee." Here the Lord identifies the cause of Abram with his own, and
declares him to be essentially connected with the weal or woe of all who
come into contact with him. "And blessed in thee shall be all the
families of the ground." The ground was cursed for the sake of Adam, who
fell by transgression. But now shall the ground again participate in the
blessing. "In thee." In Abram is this blessing laid up as a treasure hid
in a field to be realized in due time. "All the families" of mankind
shall ultimately enter into the enjoyment of this unbounded blessing.

Thus, when the Lord saw fit to select a man to preserve vital piety on
the earth and be the head of a race suited to be the depository of a
revelation of mercy, he at the same time designed that this step should
be the means of effectually recalling the sin-enthralled world to the
knowledge and love of himself. The race was twice already since the fall
put upon its probation - once under the promise of victory to the seed
of the woman, and again under the covenant with Noah. In each of these
cases, notwithstanding the growing light of revelation and accumulating
evidence of the divine forbearance, the race had apostatised from the
God of mercy, with lamentably few known exceptions. Yet, undeterred by
the gathering tokens of this second apostasy, and after reiterated
practical demonstration to all people of the debasing, demoralizing
effect of sin, the Lord, with calm determination of purpose, sets about
another step in the great process of removing the curse of sin,
dispensing the blessing of pardon, and eventually drawing all the
nations to accept of his mercy. The special call of Abram contemplates
the calling of the Gentiles as its final issue, and is therefore to be
regarded as one link in a series of wonderful events by which the legal
obstacles to the divine mercy are to be taken out of the way, and the
Spirit of the Lord is to prevail with still more and more of men to
return to God.

It is sometimes inadvertently said that the Old Testament is narrow and
exclusive, while the New Testament is broad and catholic in its spirit.
This is a mistake. The Old and New Testaments are of one mind on this
matter. Many are called, and few chosen. This is the common doctrine of
the New as well as of the Old. They are both equally catholic in
proclaiming the gospel to all. The covenant with Adam and with Noah is
still valid and sure to all who return to God; and the call of Abram is
expressly said to be a means of extending blessing to all the families
of man. The New Testament does not aim at anything more than this; it
merely hails the approaching accomplishment of the same gracious end.
They both concur also in limiting salvation to the few who repent and
believe the gospel. Even when Abram was called there were a few who
still trusted in the God of mercy. According to the chronology of the
Masoretic text, Heber was still alive, Melkizedec was contemporary with
Abram, Job was probably later, and many other now unknown witnesses for
God were doubtless to be found, down to the time of the exodus, outside
the chosen family. God marks the first symptoms of decaying piety. He
does not wait until it has died out before he calls Abram. He proceeds
in a leisurely, deliberate manner with his eternal purpose of mercy, and
hence, a single heir of promise suffices for three generations, until
the set time comes for the chosen family and the chosen nation.
Universalism, then, in the sense of the offer of mercy to man, is the
rule of the Old and the New Testament. Particularism in the acceptance
of it is the accident of the time. The call of Abram is a special
expedient for providing a salvation that may be offered to all the
families of the earth.

In all God's teachings the near and the sensible come before the far and
the conceivable, the present and the earthly before the eternal and the
heavenly. Thus, Abram's immediate acts of self-denial are leaving his
country, his birthplace, his home. The promise to him is to be made a
great nation, be blessed, and have a great name in the new land which
the Lord would show him. This is unspeakably enhanced by his being made
a blessing to all nations. God pursues this mode of teaching for several
important reasons. First, the sensible and the present are intelligible
to those who are taught. The Great Teacher begins with the known, and
leads the mind forward to the unknown. If he had begun with things too
high, too deep, or too far for the range of Abram's mental vision, he
would not have come into relation with Abram's mind. It is superfluous
to say that he might have enlarged Abram's view in proportion to the
grandeur of the conceptions to be revealed.

On the same principle he might have made Abram cognizant of all present
and all developed truth. On the same principle he might have developed
all things in an instant of time, and so have had done with creation and
providence at once. Secondly, the present and the sensible are the types
of the future and the conceivable; the land is the type of the better
land; the nation of the spiritual nation; the temporal blessing of the
eternal blessing; the earthly greatness of the name of the heavenly. And
let us not suppose that we are arrived at the end of all knowledge. We
pique ourselves on our advance in spiritual knowledge beyond the age of
Abram. But even we may be in the very infancy of mental development.
There may be a land, a nation, a blessing, a great name, of which our
present realizations or conceptions are but the types. Any other
supposition would be a large abatement from the sweetness of hope's
overflowing cup.

Thirdly, these things which God now promises are the immediate form of
his bounty, the very gifts he begins at the moment to bestow. God has
his gift to Abram ready in his hand in a tangible form. He points to it
and says, This is what thou presently needest; this I give thee, with my
blessing and favor. But, fourthly, these are the earnest and the germ of
all temporal and eternal blessing. Man is a growing thing, whether as an
individual or a race. God graduates his benefits according to the
condition and capacity of the recipients. In the first boon of his
good-will is the earnest of what he will continue to bestow on those who
continue to walk in his ways. And as the present is the womb of the
future, so is the external the symbol of the internal, the material the
shadow of the spiritual, in the order of the divine blessing. And as
events unfold themselves in the history of man and conceptions in his
soul within, so are doctrines gradually opened up in the Word of God,
and progressively revealed to the soul by the Spirit of God.

[Gen 12:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004.md)

Abram obeys the call. He had set out from Ur under the revered
guardianship of his aged father, Terah, with other companions, "as the
Lord had spoken unto him." Lot is now mentioned as his companion.
Terah's death has been already recorded. Sarai is with him, of course,
and therefore it is unnecessary to repeat the fact. But Lot is
associated with him as an incidental companion for some time longer. The
age of Abram at the second stage of his journey is now mentioned. This
enables us to determine, as, we have seen, that he departed from Ur five
years before.

[Gen 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005.md)

This is the record of what is presumed in the close of [Gen
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004.md); namely, the second setting out
for Kenaan. "Abram took." He is now the leader of the little colony, as
Terah was before his death. Sarai, as well as Lot, is now named. "The
gaining they had gained" during the five years of their residence in
Haran. If Jacob became comparatively rich in six years [Gen
30:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#043.md), so might Abram, with the divine
blessing, in five. "The souls they had gotten" - the bondservants they
had acquired. Where there is a large stock of cattle, there must be a
corresponding number of servants to attend to them. Abram and Lot enter
the land as men of substance. They are in a position of independence.
The Lord is realizing to Abram the blessing promised. They start for the
land of Kenaan, and at length arrive there. This event is made as
important as it ought to be in our minds by the mode in which it is
stated.

[Gen 12:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md)

Abram does not enter into immediate possession, but only travels through
the land which the Lord had promised to show him [Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md). He arrives at "the place of
Shekem." The town was probably not yet in existence. It lay between
Mount Gerizzim and Mount Ebal. It possesses a special interest as the
spot where the Lord first appeared to Abram in the land of promise. It
was afterward dedicated to the Lord by being made a Levitical town, and
a city of refuge. At this place Joshua convened an assembly of all
Israel to hear his farewell address. "So Joshua made a covenant with the
people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shekem" Jos.
24:1-25. The particular point in the place of Shekem where Abram halted
is the oak of Moreh; so called, probably, from its planter or owner. The
oak attains to great antiquity, and a single tree, well grown, becomes
conspicuous for its grandeur and beauty, and was often chosen in ancient
times as a meeting-place for religious rites.

And the Kenaanite was then in the land. - This simply implies that the
land was not open for Abram to enter upon immediate possession of it
without challenge. Another was in possession. The sons of Kenaan had
already arrived and preoccupied the country. It also intimates, or
admits, of the supposition that there had been previous inhabitants who
may have been subjugated by the invading Kenaanites. Thus, אן 'āz then
alludes to the past, as in [Gen 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026.md).
Some of these former inhabitants will meet us in the course of the
narrative. It admits also of the supposition that the Kenaanites
afterward ceased to be its inhabitants. Hence, some have inferred that
this could not have been penned by Moses, as they were expelled after
his death. If this supposition were the necessary or the only one
implied in the form of expression, we should acquiesce in the conclusion
that this sentence came from one of the prophets to whom the
conservation, revision, and continuation of the living oracles were
committed. But we have seen that two other presuppositions may be made
that satisfy the import of the passage. Moreover, the first of the three
accounts for the fact that Abram does not instantly enter on possession,
as there was an occupying tenant. And, finally, the third supposition
may fairly be, not that the Kenaanites afterward ceased, but that they
should afterward cease to be in the land. This, then, as well as the
others, admits of Moses being the writer of this interesting sentence.

We are inclined to think, however, that the term "Kenaanite" here means,
not the whole race of Kenaan, but the special tribe so called. If the
former were meant, the statement would be in a manner superfluous, after
calling the country the land of Kenaan. If the proper tribe be intended,
then we have evidence here that they once possessed this part of the
land which was afterward occupied by the Hivite and the Amorite [Gen
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002.md); [Jos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003.md); for, at the time of the conquest
by Abram's descendants, the mountainous land in the center, including
the place of Shekem, was occupied by the Amorites and other tribes,
while the coast of the Mediterranean and the west bank of the Jordan was
held by the Kenaanites proper (Josephus v. 1; xi. 3). This change of
occupants had taken place before the time of Moses.

[Gen 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md)

And the Lord appeared unto Abram. - Here, for the first time, this
remarkable phrase occurs. It indicates that the Lord presents himself to
the consciousness of man in any way suitable to his nature. It is not
confined to the sight, but may refer to the hearing [Sa1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#015.md). The possibility of God appearing
to man is antecedently undeniable. The fact of his having done so proves
the possibility. On the mode of his doing this it is vain for us to
speculate. The Lord said unto him, "Unto thy seed will I give this
land." "Unto thy seed," not unto thee. To Abram himself "he gave none
inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on" [Act
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md). "This land" which the Lord had
now shown him, though at present occupied by the Kenaanite invader. "An
altar." This altar is erected on the spot which is hallowed by the
appearance of the Lord to Abram. The place of Shekem might have been
supposed to have received its name from Shekem, a son of Gilead [Num
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#031.md), did we not meet with Shekem,
the son of Hamor, in this very place in the time of Jacob [Gen
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002.md). We learn from this the
precariousness of the inference that the name of a place is of later
origin because a person of that name lived there at a later period. The
place of Shekem was doubtless called after a Shekem antecedent to Abram.
Shekem and Moreh may have preceded even the Kenaanites, for anything we
know.

[Gen 12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md)

From the oak of Moreh Abram now moves to the hill east of Bethel, and
pitches his tent, with "Bethel on the west and Ai on the east." These
localities are still recognized - the former as Beiten, and the latter
as Tell er-Rijmeh (the mount of the heap). Bethel was "a place,"
adjacent to which was the town called "Luz at the first" [Gen
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019.md). Jacob gave this name to the
place twice [Gen 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019.md); [Gen
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#015.md). The name, then, was not first
given at the second nomination by him. It follows that it may not have
been first given at his first nomination. Accordingly we meet with it as
an existing name in Abram's time, without being constrained to account
for it by supposing the present narrative to have been composed in its
present form after the time of Jacob's visit. On the other hand, we may
regard it as an interesting trace of early piety having been present in
the land even before the arrival of Abram. We shall meet with other
corroborating proofs. Bethel continued afterward to be a place hallowed
by the presence of God, to which the people resorted for counsel in the
war with Benjamin [Jdg 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018.md), [Jdg
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md), [Jdg
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#031.md); [Jdg
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#002.md), and in which Jeroboam set up one
of the golden calves [Kg1 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029.md).

On the hill east of this sacred ground Abram built another altar; and
called upon the name of the Lord. Here we bare the reappearance of an
ancient custom, instituted in the family of Adam after the birth of Enok
[Gen 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026.md). Abram addresses God by his
proper name, Yahweh, with an audible voice, in his assembled household.
This, then, is a continuation of the worship of Adam, with additional
light according to the progressive development of the moral nature of
man. But Abram has not yet any settled abode in the land. He is only
surveying its several regions, and feeding his flocks as he finds an
opening. Hence, he continues his journey southward.

[Genesis 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 12:10</span></span>

\- XXXVIII. Abram in Egypt

15\. פרעה par‛oh, Par'oh, "ouro." Coptic for "king," with the masculine
article pi. or p. P-ouro, "the king." If we separate the article p. from
the Hebrew form, we have רעה re‛oh for king, which may be compared with
רעה ro‛eh, "pastor, leader," and the Latin rex, king. This is the common
title of the Egyptian sovereigns, to which we have the personal name
occasionally added, as Pharaoh-Necho, Pharaoh-Hophrah.

[Gen 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md)

This first visit of Abram to Mizraim, or Egypt, is occasioned by the
famine in the land of promise. This land is watered by periodical rains.
A season of drought arrests the progress of vegetation, and brings on a
famine. But in Egypt, the fertility of the loamy soil depends not on
local showers, but on the annual rise of the Nile, which is fed by the
rains of a far-distant mountain range. Hence, when the land of Kenaan
was wasted by drought and consequent famine, Egypt was generally so
productive as to be the granary of the neighboring countries. As Kenaan
was the brother of Mizraim, the contact between the two countries in
which they dwelt was natural and frequent. Dry seasons and dearth of
provisions seem to have been of frequent occurrence in the land of
Kenaan [Gen 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md); [Gen
41:56-57](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#056.md). Even Egypt itself was not
exempt from such calamitous visitations. Famine is one of God's rods for
the punishment of the wicked and the correction of the penitent [Sa2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#013.md). It visits Abram even in the
land of promise. Doubtless the wickedness of the inhabitants was great
even in his day. Abram himself was not out of the need of that
tribulation that worketh patience, experience, and hope. He may have
been left to himself under this trial, that he might find out by
experience his own weakness, and at the same time the faithfulness and
omnipotence of Yahweh the promiser. In the moment of his perplexity he
flees for refuge to Egypt, and the Lord having a lesson for him, there
permits him to enter that land of plenty.

It is not without misgivings, however, that Abram approaches Egypt. All
the way from Ur to Haran, from Haran to the land of Kenaan, and from
north to south of the land in which he was a stranger, we hear not a
word of apprehension. But now he betakes himself to an expedient which
had been preconcerted between him and Sarai before they set out on their
earthly pilgrimage [Gen 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#013.md). There
are some obvious reasons for the change from composure to anxiety he now
betrays. Abram was hitherto obeying the voice of the Lord, and walking
in the path of duty, and therefore he was full of unhesirating
confidence in the divine protection. Now he may be pursuing his own
course, and, without waiting patiently for the divine counsel, venturing
to cross the boundary of the land of promise. He may therefore be
without the fortifying assurance of the divine approval. There is often
a whisper of this kind heard in the soul, even when it is not fully
conscious of the delinquency which occasions it.

Again, the countries through which be had already passed were inhabited
by nomadic tribes, each kept in check by all the others, all unsettled
in their habits, and many of them not more potent than himself. The
Kenaanites spoke the same language with himself, and were probably only
a dominant race among others whose language they spoke, if they did not
adopt. But in Egypt all was different. Mizraim had seven sons, and, on
the average, the daughters are as numerous as the sons. In eight or nine
generations there might be from half a million to a million of
inhabitants in Egypt, if we allow five daughters as the average of a
family. The definite area of the arable ground on the two sides of the
Nile, its fertilization by a natural cause without much human labor, the
periodical regularity of the inundation, and the extraordinary abundance
of the grain crops, combined both to multiply the population with great
rapidity, and to accelerate amazingly the rise and growth of fixed
institutions and a stable government. Here there were a settled country
with a foreign tongue, a prosperous people, and a powerful sovereign.
All this rendered it more perilous to enter Egypt than Kenaan.

If Abram is about to enter Egypt of his own accord, without any divine
intimation, it is easy to understand why he resorts to a device of his
own to escape the peril of assassination. In an arbitrary government,
where the will of the sovereign is law, and the passions are
uncontrolled, public or private resolve is sudden, and execution
summary. The East still retains its character in this respect. In these
circumstances, Abram proposes to Sarai to conceal their marriage, and
state that she was his sister; which was perfectly true, as she was the
daughter of his father, though not of his mother. At a distance of three
or four thousand years, with all the development of mind which a
completed Bible and an advanced philosophy can bestow, it is easy to
pronounce, with dispassionate coolness, the course of conduct here
proposed to be immoral and imprudent. It is not incumbent on us, indeed,
to defend it; but neither does it become us to be harsh or excessive in
our censure. In the state of manners and customs which then prevailed in
Egypt, Abram and Sarai were not certainly bound to disclose all their
private concerns to every impertinent inquirer. The seeming simplicity
and experience which Abram betrays in seeking to secure his personal
safety by an expedient which exposed to risk his wife's chastity and his
own honor, are not to be pressed too far. The very uncertainty
concerning the relation of the strangers to each other tended to abate
that momentary caprice in the treatment of individuals which is the
result of a despotic government. And the prime fault and folly of Abram
consisted in not waiting for the divine direction in leaving the land of
promise, and in not committing himself wholly to the divine protection
when he did take that step.

It may seem strange that the Scripture contains no express
disapprobation of the conduct of Abram. But its manner is to affirm the
great principles of moral truth, on suitable occasions, with great
clearness and decision; and in ordinary circumstances simply to record
the actions of its characters with faithfulness, leaving it to the
reader's intelligence to mark their moral quality. And God's mode of
teaching the individual is to implant a moral principle in the heart,
which, after many struggles with temptation, will eventually root out
all lingering aberrations.

Sarai was sixty-five years of age [Gen
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md) at the time when Abram describes
her as a woman fair to look upon. But we are to remember that beauty
does not vanish with middle age; that Sarai's age corresponds with
twenty-five or thirty years in modern times, as she was at this time not
half the age to which men were then accustomed to live; that she had no
family or other hardship to bring on premature decay; and that the women
of Egypt were far from being distinguished for regularity of feature or
freshness of complexion.

[Gen 12:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#014.md)

The inadequacy of Abram's expedient appears in the issue, which is
different from what he expected. Sarai is admired for her beauty, and,
being professedly single, is selected as a wife for Pharaoh; while
Abram, as her brother, is munificently entertained and rewarded. His
property seems to be enumerated according to the time of acquirement, or
the quantity, and not the quality of each kind. Sheep and oxen and
he-asses he probably brought with him from Kenaan; men-servants and
maid-servants were no doubt augmented in Egypt. For she-asses the
Septuagint has mules. These, and the camels, may have been received in
Egypt. The camel is the carrier of the desert. Abram had now become
involved in perplexities, from which he had neither the wisdom nor the
power to extricate himself. With what bitterness of spirit he must have
kept silence, received these accessions to his wealth which he dared not
to refuse, and allowed Sarai to be removed from his temporary abode! His
cunning device had saved his own person for the time; but his beautiful
and beloved wife is torn from his bosom.

[Gen 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017.md)

The Lord, who had chosen him, unworthy though he was, yet not more
unworthy than others, to be the agent of His gracious purpose, now
interposes to effect his deliverance. "And the Lord plagued Pharaoh."
The mode of the divine interference is suited to have the desired effect
on the parties concerned. As Pharaoh is punished, we conclude he was
guilty in the eye of heaven in this matter. He committed a breach of
hospitality by invading the private abode of the stranger. He further
infringed the law of equity between man and man in the most tender
point, by abstracting, if not with violence, at least with a show of
arbitrary power which could not be resisted, a female, whether sister or
wife, from the home of her natural guardian without the consent of
either. A deed of ruthless self-will, also, is often rendered more
heinous by a blamable inattention to the character or position of him
who is wronged. So it was with Pharaoh. Abram was a man of blameless
life and inoffensive manners. He was, moreover, the chosen and special
servant of the Most High God. Pharaoh, however, does not condescend to
inquire who the stranger is whom he is about to wrong; and is thus
unwittingly involved in an aggravated crime. But the hand of the
Almighty brings even tyrants to their senses. "And his house." The
princes of Pharaoh were accomplices in his crime [Gen
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#015.md), and his domestics were
concurring with him in carrying it into effect. But even apart from any
positive consent or connivance in a particular act, men, otherwise
culpable, are brought into trouble in this world by the faults of those
