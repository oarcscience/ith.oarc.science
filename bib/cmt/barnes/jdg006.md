### [Judges Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001)

[Judges 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 6:1</span></span>

Midian - See [Gen 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002) note. They were
remarkable not only for the vast number of their cattle [Jdg
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005); [Num
31:32-39](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#032), but also for their great
wealth in gold and other metal ornaments, showing their connection with
a gold country. (Compare [Num 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#022),
[Num 31:50-54](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050), with [Jdg
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#024) :26.) At this time they were
allies of the Amalekites and of the Arabian tribes called collectively
"the children of the East" [Jdg 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003).
They seem to have extended their settlements to the east of Jordan, and
to have belonged to the larger section of Arabs called Ishmaelites [Jdg
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#024).

[Judges 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 6:2</span></span>

The word rendered "dens" is only found in this passage. It is best
explained of ravines hollowed out by torrents, which the Israelites made
into hiding-places.

[Judges 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 6:4</span></span>

Gaza indicates the extreme point south to which they spread their
devastations, crossing the Jordan near Bethshan (Scythopolls), and
entering by the valley of Jezreel, and sweeping along the whole of the
maritime plain or Shephelah.

[Judges 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 6:5</span></span>

Grasshoppers - Rather locusts (compare [Exo
10:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#004), [Exo
10:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#014); Joel 1; 2; [Psa
78:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#046))

[Judges 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 6:8</span></span>

A prophet - His name is not given. (Compare 1 Kings 13.) This message is
somewhat similar to that of the Angel, [Jdg
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001). The reference to [Exo
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002) is plain, and supposes the people
to whom the prophet addresses these words to be familiar with the facts
recorded in that text.

[Judges 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 6:10</span></span>

A similar use of the name Amorite, instead of the more usual name
Canaanite, occurs in [Jos 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015), [Jos
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#018). Perhaps a special reason may be
found for the use of Amorite, if the prophet was addressing those who
dwelt in the mountains, where the Amorites chiefly dwelt. The idolatries
of the Amorites seem, too, to have been preeminently abominable (see
[Kg2 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#011); [Kg1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#026)). It should be observed that the
prophet's language, as it traces the misery of Israel to their sins, so
also intimates the necessity of repentance and of breaking off their
sins - especially the sin of idolatry - as preliminary to any
deliverance. In exact accordance with this view, Gideon commences his
work by throwing down the altar of Baal, and building up the altar of
Yahweh [Jdg 6:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024).

[Judges 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 6:11</span></span>

An oak - "The oak," indicating it as a well-known tree, still standing
in the writer's days.

There was another Ophrah in Benjamin [Jos
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023). This Ophrah was in Manasseh,
and was the village of Joash, the head, apparently, of the family of
Abiezer, which was one of the families of Gilead, the son of Machir, the
son of Manasseh [Num 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#030).

[Judges 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 6:12</span></span>

Thou mighty man of valor - Known to God to be such, though as yet not
known to be such either by himself or his countrymen (compare [Luk
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028), [Luk
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030)).

[Judges 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 6:13</span></span>

The extreme bitterness of the national sufferings under the Midianite
occupation breaks out in Gideon's language. The Angel's words, suitable
to times of prosperity, seemed to be a mockery, when it was evident the
Lord was not with them. (Compare [Deu
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017).)

[Judges 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 6:14</span></span>

The Lord looked upon him - That gracious look conferred immediate
strength (compare [Eph 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010); [Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009); [Joh
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022); [Act
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006)) The change of phrase from "the
angel of the Lord" to "the Lord" is remarkable. When messages are
delivered by the Angel of the Lord, the form of the message is as if God
Himself were speaking (compare [Jdg
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001)).

The sending implied a valid commission and sufficient powers. Compare
[Exo 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#010); [Isa
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026); [Eze
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003); [Zac
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#011); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001); [Luk
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003); [Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021); and the term APOSTLE, as
applied to our Lord [Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001) and to
the Twelve.

[Judges 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 6:15</span></span>

Gideon now perceived that the Lord was speaking to him by His angel. He
saw, however, no qualifications in himself, or in his family or tribe,
for the office of saviour to his people. He therefore desires some
assurance that the message he had just received was indeed from God, and
not a mere dream or delusion. He asks as a sign [Jdg
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#018) that his mysterious visitor
should tarry under the oak until he should return to Him with his gifts
and offerings.

[Judges 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 6:17</span></span>

A sign - If the Angel ate of Gideon's present it would be a conclusive
proof of the reality of the vision. (Compare [Joh
21:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#009); [Luk
24:37-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#037); [Act
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041).) It would also be a token of
God's goodwill to Gideon. Compare [Gen
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003).

[Judges 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 6:18</span></span>

My present - My Minchah: the word used regularly, though not
exclusively, for the meat and drink offering ([Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001) note). Its double sense of an
offering to God, and of a gift to man, suits the doubt in Gideon's mind
as to who his visitor might be.

[Judges 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 6:19</span></span>

Unleavened cakes - As being much more quickly baked (compare [Gen
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003)) (and as connected with the meat
offering). An ephah, containing 3 measures, was the quantity of flour
commonly used at one baking [Gen 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#006);
[Exo 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016).

Presented it - A word especially, though not exclusively, proper for
offerings to God. See [Amo 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025), where
the same word is rendered offered.

[Judges 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 6:20</span></span>

Pour out the broth - Libations were a very ancient form of offering
(compare [Gen 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014)). The drink
offerings of wine under the Levitical law were poured upon the altar
[Exo 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009). The pouring of the broth
upon the rock was evidently of the nature of a libation. It might also,
like the water poured by Elijah upon his sacrifice, make the miracle of
the fire that consumed the sacrifice more apparent. (Compare [Kg1
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#033).)

[Judges 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 6:22</span></span>

Alas, O Lord GOD! - Compare [Jos 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#007).
"because I have seen an angel of the Lord" Compare the marginal
references, in which the notion that it was death for mortal man to see
God appears clearly. The same notion prevailed among the pagan.

[Judges 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 6:24</span></span>

Gideon's naming the altar which he built, in commemoration of the words
of peace spoken by the Angel, is very similar to what we read of Abraham
[Gen 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014), and of Moses ([Exo
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015), when he named the altar
Jehovah-nissi).

[Judges 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 6:25</span></span>

Even - Rather, as in the margin, and. Two bullocks are spoken of. The
labor of both would be required for pulling down and removing the altar
of Baal, and for bringing the materials for building the altar of
Yahweh.

The grove by it - Rather, "the idol upon it," the Asherah, the wooden
image of Astarte [Jdg 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007).

[Judges 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 6:26</span></span>

In the ordered place - See the margin. "Build an altar, etc., with the
materials," "the wood laid in order" (compare [Gen
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009)), that, namely, which he would
find ready to hand in the altar of Baal which he was to throw down.

The wood of the grove - "The (blocks of) wood of the idol," i. e. the
image of Astarte. The command from God Himself to build an altar, and
sacrifice upon it, is analogous to Elijah's sacrifice 1 Kings 18, and
was doubtless caused by the extraordinary circumstance of the defection
of the Israelites from the worship of the true God. Possibly, too, the
Midianite invasion had made the worship at Shiloh impossible at this
time.

[Judges 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 6:27</span></span>

The mention of the "men of the city" by the side of Gideon's "father's
household" suggests the probability of their being a remnant of the
Canaanite population, and the special patrons of Baal-worship.

[Judges 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 6:31</span></span>

From the boldness of Joash in defending his son, it is likely that the
majority of the Abi-ezrites sided with him against "the men of the
city," and already felt drawn toward Gideon as their national and
religious leader [Jdg 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034). Joash
appears as the chief magistrate of Ophrah.

Will ye plead ...? will ye save? - The emphasis is upon ye, as much as
to say, What business is it of yours?

[Judges 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jdg 6:32</span></span>

He called him - i. e. "He was called" Jerubbaal, as being the person
against whom it was popularly said that Baal might strive. See margin.

[Judges 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jdg 6:33</span></span>

A fresh invasion, and the last, of Midianites Amalekites, and Arabs (see
[Jdg 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003)). But the Israelites, instead
of hiding in dens and caves, and tamely leaving all their substance as
pIunder to the invaders, now rally around their leader.

[Judges 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jdg 6:34</span></span>

The Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon - See the margin. The word
contains a striking thought. It is different from that used in the case
of Othniel [Jdg 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010), Jephthah [Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029), and Samson [Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025); [Jdg
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006), [Jdg
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019).

[Judges 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jdg 6:35</span></span>

His own tribe, Manasseh, and the three northern tribes of Asher,
Zebulon, and Naphtali hastened to join him. Issachar was probably unable
to do so, because the Midianites were encamped in the heart of their
country. Asher no longer "abode in his breaches," as in the time of
Jabin [Jdg 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#017), perhaps ashamed of
their former backwardness, and stung by the rebuke of Deborah; perhaps,
too, from feeling the Midianite yoke much more galling than that of
Jabin.

[Judges 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 6:36</span></span>

The caution of Gideon, desirous of being assured that he really had a
promise from God, does not imply doubts as to God's faithfulness or
power to fulfill His promise. Of such doubts there is not a trace in
Gideon's character. He is a worthy example of faith [Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032).

[Judges 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jdg 6:37</span></span>

The threshing floors were and still are under the open air, and usually
circular. The second sign [Jdg 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#040),
would be more convincing than the former, because it is the nature of
fleeces to attract and retain moisture.
