### [Leviticus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001)

[Leviticus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 3:1</span></span>

The peace-offering (like the burnt-offering, [Lev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003), and the Minchah, [Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)) is here spoken of as if it was
familiarly known before the giving of the Law. "Peace-offering" seems
preferable to "thank-offering," which occurs in several places in the
margin of our Bible. "thank-offering" appears to be the right name for a
subordinate class of peace-offering.

[Leviticus 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 3:2</span></span>

Kill it at the door ... - See [Lev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003). Tradition says that the
peace-offerings might be killed in any part of the court.

[Leviticus 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 3:3</span></span>

"The fat that covereth the inwards" refers to the caul or transparent
membrane which has upon it a network of fatty tissue: "the fat upon the
inwards" refers to the small lumps of suet found upon the intestines of
healthy animals.

[Leviticus 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 3:4</span></span>

The caul above the liver - Probably the membrane covering the upper part
of the liver.

[Leviticus 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 3:5</span></span>

Upon the burnt sacrifice - Upon the ashes of the continual
burnt-offering [Exo 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038), in
accordance with [Lev 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#012).

[Leviticus 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 3:7</span></span>

A lamb - A sheep. The word signifies a full-grown sheep, in its prime.

[Leviticus 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 3:8</span></span>

See [Lev 1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004) notes.

[Leviticus 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 3:9</span></span>

The whole rump - The whole fat tail: i. e., the tail of the kind of
sheep well known in the East, and often weighing 15 lbs. and even as
much as 50 lbs., when the sheep has been increased by artificial
fattening.

[Leviticus 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 3:11</span></span>

Burn it - See [Lev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009) note.

[Leviticus 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 3:12</span></span>

See [Lev 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010) note. Birds were not
accepted as peace-offerings, most probably because they were, by
themselves, insufficient to make up a sacrificial meal.

[Leviticus 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 3:16</span></span>

Rather, as food of an offering made by fire for a sweet savour, shall
all the fat be for Yahweh. Our bodily taste and smell furnish figures of
the satisfaction with which the Lord accepts the appointed symbols of
the true worship of the heart. All that was sent up in the fire of the
altar, including the parts of the sin-offering [Lev
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#031), as well as the burnt-offering
([Lev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009), etc.), was accepted for "a
sweet savour": but the word food may here have a special fitness in its
application to the peace-offering, which served for food also to the
priests and the offerer, and so symbolized communion between the Lord,
His ministers, and His worshippers.

The fat is the Lord's - The significance of this appears to consist in
the fact that its proper development in the animal is, in general, a
mark of perfection.

[Leviticus 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 3:17</span></span>

Blood - See [Lev 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011) note.

Throughout all your dwellings - The suet was neither to be eaten in
sacrificial meals in the sanctuary, nor in ordinary meals in private
houses.
