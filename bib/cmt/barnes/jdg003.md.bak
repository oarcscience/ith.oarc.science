### [Judges Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001.md)

[Judges 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 3:1</span></span>

Even as many of Israel ... - These words show that the writer has
especially in view the generation which came to man's estate immediately
after the close of the wars with the Canaanites [Jos
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001.md). Compare [Jdg
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#010.md).

[Judges 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 3:3</span></span>

Lords - Seranim, a title used exclusively of the princes of the five
Philistine cities. The title is probably of Phoenician origin.

Joshua appears to have smitten and subdued the Hivites as far north as
Baal-Gad, in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017.md); [Jos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md), but no further [Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005.md). There was an unsubdued Hivite
population to the north of Baal-hermon (probably Baal-Gad under Hermon,
since it is not synonymous with Hermon; see [Ch1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023).md), to the entering in of Hamath:
i. e. in the fertile valley of Coele-Syria. Hamath is always spoken of
as the extreme northern boundary of the land of Canaan. It was the gate
of approach to Canaan from Babylon, and all the north [Zac
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#002.md); [Jer
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md). It formed part of the dominions
of Solomon [Ch2 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004.md), and of the future
inheritance of Israel, as described in vision by Ezekiel [Eze
47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md).

[Judges 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 3:6</span></span>

See [Jdg 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#002.md) note.

[Judges 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 3:7</span></span>

And the groves - literally, Asheroth, images of Asherah (the goddess
companion of Baal): see [Deu 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021.md)
note.

[Judges 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 3:8</span></span>

Here we hold again the thread of the proper narrative, which seems as if
it ought to have run thus [Jdg 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md) :
Now, etc. [Jdg 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#008.md), therefore (or
"and") etc.

Served Chushan-Rishathaim - This is the same phrase as in [Jdg
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#014.md). From it is derived the
expression, "the times of servitude," as distinguished from "the times
of rest," in speaking of the times of the Judges. Mesopotamia, or
Aram-naharaim, was the seat of Nimrod's kingdom, and Nimrod was the son
of Cush [Gen 10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008.md). Rishathaim is
perhaps the name of a city, or a foreign word altered to a Hebrew form.
Nothing is known from history, or the cuneiform inscriptions, of the
political condition of Mesopotamia at this time, though Thotmes I and
III in the 18th Egyptian dynasty are known to have invaded Mesopotamia.
It is, however, in accordance with such an aggressive Aramean movement
toward Palestine, that as early as the time of Abraham we find the kings
of Shinar and of Elam invading the south of Palestine. There is also
distinct evidence in the names of the Edomite kings [Gen
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#032.md), [Gen
36:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#035.md), [Gen
36:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#037.md) of an Aramean dynasty in Edom
about the time of the early Judges. Compare, too, [Job
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#017.md).

[Judges 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 3:9</span></span>

Othniel was already distinguished in Joshua's lifetime as a brave and
successful leader. See [Jos 15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016.md).

[Judges 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 3:10</span></span>

And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him - The phrase occurs frequently
in this book and in the books of Samuel and Kings. It marks the special
office of the Judges. They were saviors ([Jdg
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009.md) margin; [Neh
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027).md) called and directed by the Holy
Spirit, who endued them with extraordinary wisdom, courage, and strength
for the work which lay before them (compare [Jdg
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034.md); [Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md); [Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025.md); [Jdg
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006.md), [Jdg
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019).md), and were in this respect types
of Christ the "Judge of Israel" [Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md), in whom "the Spirit of the Lord
God" was "without measure" [Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md);
[Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); [Mat
12:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md); Job 1:32; [Act
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md).

[Judges 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 3:11</span></span>

The land - means here, as in [Jdg 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002.md),
not the whole land of Canaan, but the part concerned, probably the land
of the tribe of Judah. Forty years, here and elsewhere, is (like
fourscore years, [Jdg 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#030).md) a round
number, perhaps equivalent to a generation.

[Judges 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 3:12</span></span>

The "strengthening" Eglon was the special work of God, and because
Israel "had done evil," etc. Samuel's comment on the event is to the
same effect [Sa1 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#009.md).

[Judges 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 3:13</span></span>

The children of Ammon (Bent-Ammon), almost always so spoken of from
their ancestor Ben-ammi [Gen 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#038.md),
seem to be under the leadership of the king of Moab, as do also the
Amlekites: this is perhaps the strengthening spoken of in [Jdg
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012.md). In Judg. 6 the combination is
Midianites, Amalekites, and children of the East, or Arab tribes. In the
narrative of Jephthah's judgeship, the Ammonites alone are mentioned;
but with a reference to the Moabites, and as if they were one people
[Jdg 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024.md). The Amalekites appear as
the constant and bitter foes of the Israelites ([Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008) notes and references.md); and the
naming a mountain in Ephraim, "the mount of the Amalekites" [Jdg
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#015.md) is probably a memorial of this
joint invasion of Moabites and Amalekites, and marks the scene either of
their occupation, or of some signal victory over them.

The city of palm trees: i. e. Jericho [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md), having been utterly destroyed by
Joshua, and not rebuilt until the time of Ahab [Jos
6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#024.md); [Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md), can only have existed at this
time as an unwalled village, - like Jerusalem after its destruction by
Nebuzaradan, until Nehemiah rebuilt its waits - and like its modern
representative er-Riha, a village with a fortress for the Turkish
garrison. This occupation of Jericho should be compared with the
invasion in [Jdg 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#009.md), where two out
of the three tribes named, Benjamin and Ephraim, are the same as those
here concerned, and where [Jdg 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md)
the Philistines are coupled with the Ammonites, just as here [Jdg
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md) the Philistines are mentioned in
near connection with the Moabites. See Introduction.

[Judges 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 3:15</span></span>

But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised
them up a deliverer - The very same words as are used at [Jdg
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009.md). See, too, [Jdg
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#016.md), [Jdg
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#018.md), and [Neh
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027.md).

Ehud "the Benjamite" was of the family or house of Gera [Sa2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005.md), the son of Bela, Benjamin's
first-born, born before Jacob's descent into Egypt [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md), and then included among "the
sons of Benjamin." The genealogy in [Ch1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006.md) intimates that Ehud (apparently
written Abihud in [Jdg 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003).md) became the
head of a separate house.

Left-handed - See the margin. The phrase is thought to describe not so
much a defect as the power to use left and right hands equally well
(compare [Jdg 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md); [Ch1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002).md).

A present - i. e. tribute [Sa2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md),
[Sa2 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006.md); [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md); [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010.md). The employment of Ehud for this
purpose points him out as a chief of some distinction. He would be
attended by a numerous suite [Jdg
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#018.md). We may conclude that the
destruction of the Benjamites Judg. 20 had not taken place at this time.

[Judges 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 3:16</span></span>

Upon his right thigh - The proper side for a left-handed man. It would
give him the appearance of being unarmed. The narrative shows clearly
that his action was premeditated [Jdg
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#021.md).

[Judges 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 3:19</span></span>

Gilgal was in the immediate neighborhood of Jericho [Jdg
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001.md), where doubtless Eglon held his
court at this time [Jdg 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md).

Quarries - Some take the original of this word in its common meaning of
carved images or idols (see the margin).

[Judges 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 3:20</span></span>

Probably Ehud's first message [Jdg
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#019.md) had been delivered to the
attendants, and by them carried to the king. Now Ehud is admitted to the
king's presence, into the cool upper chamber.

I have a message from God unto thee - Ehud believed himself to be
accomplishing the divine mandate, and so his words were true in a
certain sense. But it was also a stratagem to cause the king to rise,
that the thrust might be sure. (The king rose at once, in true Oriental
respect for a divine message, or from fear, compare [Jos
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#024)..md)

[Judges 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 3:22</span></span>

The King James Version and margin give different explanations of the
last words of this verse. Others explain it of a vestibule or chamber,
through which Ehud passed into the porch where the entrance doors were.
He locked the doors, took the key with him; and then retired through the
midst of the attendants below (or: more probably, through the door which
communicated directly with the outside).

[Judges 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 3:24</span></span>

He covereth his feet - Compare the marginal references. The explanation
of the phrase as "taking sleep" suits both passages best.

[Judges 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 3:25</span></span>

A key - literally, "an opener." Probably a wooden instrument with which
they either lifted up the latch within, or drew back the wooden bar or
bolt. The chief officer of Eglon's household probably had a second key
(compare [Isa 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015.md), [Isa
22:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#020.md); [Isa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#002).md).

[Judges 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 3:26</span></span>

Seirath - "The forest" or "weald," which evidently bordered on the
cultivated plain near Gilgal, and extended into "the mountain or hill
country of Ephraim." Once there, he was safe from pursuit (compare [Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006).md), and quickly collected a strong
force of Ephraimires and probably the bordering Benjamites.

[Judges 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 3:28</span></span>

Ehud "went down" from the mountain of Ephraim into the Jordan valley
beneath it, straight to the Jordan fords [Jos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#007.md), so as to intercept all
communication between the Moabites on the west side and their countrymen
on the east.

[Judges 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 3:30</span></span>

The land - i. e. that portion of it which had suffered from the
oppression of Moab, probably Benjamin and Ephraim chiefly (see [Jdg
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011).md).

In judging of the nature of Ehud's act there are many considerations
which must greatly modify our judgment. Acts of violence or cunning,
done in an age when human society applauded such acts, when the best men
of the age thought them right, and when men were obliged to take the law
into their own hands in self-defense, are very different from the same
acts done in an age when the enlightened consciences of men generally
condemn them, and when the law of the land and the law of nations give
individuals adequate security. We can allow faith and courage and
patriotism to Ehud, without being blind to those defective views of
moral right which made him and his countrymen glory in an act which in
the light of Christianity is a crime. It is remarkable that neither Ehud
nor Jael are included in Paul's list in [Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032.md).

[Judges 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 3:31</span></span>

From this verse and [Jdg 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006.md) we may
gather that Shamgar was contemporary with Jael, and that he only
procured a temporary and partial deliverance for Israel by his exploit.
He may have been of the tribe of Judah.

An ox goad - An instrument of wood about eight feet long, armed with an
iron spike or point at one end, with which to spur the ox at plow, and
with an iron scraper at the other end with which to detach the earth
from the plowshare when it became encumbered with it. The fact of their
deliverer having no better weapon enhances his faith, and the power of
his divine helper. At the same time it shows how low the men of Judah
were brought at this time, being disarmed by their oppressors [Jdg
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#008.md), as was also the case later [Sa1
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#019.md).
