### [Leviticus Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 21:4</span></span>

The sense seems to be that, owing to his position in the nation, the
priest is not to defile himself in any cases except those named in [Lev
21:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#002.md). The Septuagint appear to have
followed a different reading of the text which would mean, "he shall not
defile himself for a moment." The explanation in the margin of our
version is hardly in keeping with the prohibition to Ezekiel on a
special occasion. See [Eze 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#016.md).

[Leviticus 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 21:5</span></span>

These prohibitions given to the people at large (compare the margin
reference.) had a special fitness for the Hebrew priests. They were the
instruments of the divine will for averting death, all their sacrifices
were a type of the death of Christ, which swallowed up death in victory
[Co1 15:54-57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md), and it would therefore
have been unsuitable that they should have the same freedom as other
people to become mourners.

[Leviticus 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 21:6</span></span>

The word here and in [Lev 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#008.md)
rendered "bread", is the same as is rendered food in [Lev
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#011.md), [Lev
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#016.md), etc., and meat in [Lev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#011.md). The reader of the English Bible
should keep in view that bread, meat, and food, were nearly equivalent
terms when our translation was made, and represent no distinctions that
exist in the Hebrew.

[Leviticus 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 21:7</span></span>

Profane - A woman who has been seduced, or one of illegitimate birth. A
somewhat stricter rule for the priests' marriages was revealed to the
prophet in later times, [Eze 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#022.md).

[Leviticus 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 21:8</span></span>

The people of Israel are now addressed. They are commanded to regard the
priests, who perform for them the service of the altar, as holy in
respect of their office.

[Leviticus 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 21:9</span></span>

burnt with fire - See the [Lev 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md)
note.

[Leviticus 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 21:10</span></span>

It was the distinguishing mark of the anointing of the high priest, that
the holy oil was poured upon his head like a crown (compare [Lev
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#012).md).

Uncover his head - Rather, let his hair be disheveled. See the note at
[Lev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md).

[Leviticus 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 21:12</span></span>

Go out of the sanctuary - i. e. not for the purpose to which reference
is here made. The words do not mean, as some have imagined, that his
abode was confined to the sanctuary.

[Leviticus 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 21:15</span></span>

Profane his seed - i. e. by a marriage which was not in keeping with the
holiness of his office.

[Leviticus 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 21:16</span></span>

He was not treated as an outcast, but enjoyed his privileges as a son of
Aaron, except in regard to active duties.

[Lev 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#020.md)

A dwarf - One who is small and wasted, either short, as in the text, or
slender, as in the margin. It is hardly likely that dwarfishness would
be overlooked in this enumeration. So most critical authorities.

Scurry or scabbed - These words most probably include all affected with
any skin disease.

[Lev 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#022.md)

See [Lev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md) note; [Lev
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025.md) note.

[Lev 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#023.md)

Sanctuaries - The places especially holy, including the most holy place,
the holy place, and the altar.

This law is of course to be regarded as one development of the great
principle that all which is devoted to the service of God should be as
perfect as possible of its kind.
