### [Exodus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 25:1</span></span>

Yahweh had redeemed the Israelites from bondage. He had made a covenant
with them and had given them laws. He had promised, on condition of
their obedience, to accept them as His own "peculiar treasure," as "a
kingdom of priests and an holy nation" [Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md). And now He was ready visibly
to testify that He made his abode with them. He claimed to have a
dwelling for Himself, which was to be in external form a tent of goats'
hair [Exo 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004.md), to take its place
among their own tents, and formed out of the same material (see [Exo
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007) note.md). The special mark of His
presence within the tent was to be the ark or chest containing the Ten
Commandments on two tables of stone [Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018.md), symbolizing the divine law of
holiness, and covered by the mercy-seat, the type of reconciliation.
Moses was divinely taught regarding the construction and arrangement of
every part of the sanctuary. The directions which were given him are
comprised in Exo. 25:1-31:11. The account of the performance of the
work, expressed generally in the same terms, is given Exo. 35:21-40:33.

Moses is commanded to invite the people to bring their gifts for the
construction and service of the sanctuary and for the dresses of the
priests.

[Exo 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002.md)

An offering - The word is used here in its general sense, being
equivalent to korban, κορβᾶν korban, (compare [Mar
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#011).md). On the marginal rendering
"heave offering," see the note at [Exo
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027.md).

That giveth it willingly with his heart - The public service of Yahweh
was to be instituted by freewill offerings, not by an enforced tax.
Compare [Ch1 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003.md), [Ch1
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#009.md),[Ch1
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014.md); [Ezr
2:68-69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#068.md); [Co2
8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011.md); [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md). On the zeal with which the people
responded to the call, see [Exo
35:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#021.md); [Exo
36:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#005.md).

[Exo 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#003.md)

Gold, and silver, and brass - The supply of these metals possessed by
the Israelites at this time probably included what they had inherited
from their forefathers, what they had obtained from the Egyptians [Exo
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#035.md), and what may have been found
amongst the spoils of the Amalekites [Exo
17:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md). But with their abundant
flocks and herds, it can hardly be doubted that they had carried on
important traffic with the trading caravans that traversed the
wilderness, some of which, most likely, in the earliest times were
furnished with silver, with the gold of Ophir (or gold of Sheba, as it
seems to have been indifferently called), and with the "brass" (the
alloy of copper and tin, called bronze) of Phoenicia and Egypt. Compare
[Exo 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024.md) note.

[Exo 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004.md)

Blue, and purple, and scarlet - i. e. the material dyed with these
colors. The Jewish tradition has been very generally received that this
material was wool. Compare [Heb 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019.md)
with [Lev 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004.md), [Lev
14:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#049.md), etc. When spun and dyed by the
women, it was delivered in the state of yarn; and the weaving and
embroidering was left to Aholiab and his assistants, [Exo
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#025.md), [Exo
35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035.md). The "blue" and "purple" dye are
usually thought to have been obtained from shell-fish, the "scarlet"
from the cochineal insect of the holm-oak.

Fine linen - The fine flax or the manufactured linen, for which Egypt
was famous [Eze 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#007.md), and which the
Egyptians were in the habit of using for dresses of state [Gen
41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042.md). It was used as the groundwork
of the figured curtains of the tabernacle as well as of the embroidered
hangings of the tent and the court. See [Exo
35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035.md).

[Exo 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005.md)

Rams' skins dyed red - Skins tanned and colored like the leather now
known as red morocco.

Badgers' skins - Rather, leather, probably of a sky-blue color, formed
from the skins of the תחשׁ tachash (a general name for marine animals),
which was well adapted as a protection against the weather.

Shittim wood - The word שׁטים shı̂ṭṭâm is the plural form of שׁטה shı̂ṭâh,
which occurs as the name of the growing tree, [Isa
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#019.md). The tree is satisfactorily
identified with the Acacia seyal, a gnarled and thorny tree, somewhat
like a solitary hawthorn in its habit and manner of growth, but much
larger. It flourishes in the driest situations, and is scattered more or
less numerously over the Sinaitic Peninsula. It appears to be the only
good wood produced in the wilderness. No other kind of wood was employed
in the tabernacle or its furniture. In the construction of the temple
cedar and fir took its place [Kg1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#008.md);
[Kg1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#018.md); [Ch2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#008.md).

[Exo 25:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#006.md)

See the notes to Exo. 27; 28; 30,

[Exo 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008.md)

sanctuary - i. e. a hallowed place. This is the most comprehensive of
the words that relate to the place dedicated to Yahweh. It included the
tabernacle with its furniture, its tent, and its court.

That I may dwell among them - The purpose of the sanctuary is here
definitely declared by the Lord Himself. It was to be the constant
witness of His presence among His people. Compare the marginal
references.

[Exo 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#009.md)

According to all that I shew thee - The tabernacle and all that
pertained to it were to be in strict accordance with the ideas revealed
by the Lord to Moses (compare [Exo
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040.md); [Exo
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#030.md); [Act
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md); [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005).md). The word here translated
"pattern" is also used to denote the plans for the temple which were
given by David to Solomon [Ch1
28:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011.md), [Ch1
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019.md); it is elsewhere rendered "form,
likeness, similitude," [Deu 4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#016.md);
[Eze 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md), [Eze
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010.md).

The tabernacle - The Hebrew word signifies the "dwelling-place." It here
denotes the wooden structure, containing the holy place and the most
holy place, with the tent which sheltered it. See [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md) note.

[Exodus 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 25:10</span></span>

(compare [Exo 37:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#001).md). The ark is
uniformly designated in Exodus the ark of the testimony. Elsewhere it is
called the testimony, the ark of the covenant (most frequently in
Deuteronomy and the other books of the Old Testament), the ark of the
lord, the ark of god, the ark of the strength of the lord, and the holy
ark.

The ark of the covenant was the central point of the sanctuary. It was
designed to contain the testimony [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016.md); [Exo
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#020.md); [Deu
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026.md), that is, the tables of the
divine law, the terms of the covenant between Yahweh and His people: and
it was to support the mercy-seat with its cherubim, from between which
He was to hold communion with them [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md). On this account, in these
directions for the construction of the sanctuary, it is named first of
all the parts. But on the other hand, in the narrative of the work as it
was actually carried out, we find that it was not made until after the
tabernacle [Exo 37:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#001.md). It was
suitable that the receptacle should be first provided to receive and
shelter the most sacred of the contents of the sanctuary as soon as it
was completed. The order in which the works were executed seems to be
given in [Exo 31:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#007.md), and [Exo
35:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#011.md). The completion of the ark is
recorded in [Exo 37:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#001.md). On its
history, see the concluding <span class="small"><span class="small">note
to Exo. 40.</span></span>

[Exo 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010.md)

An ark - Taking the cubit at 18 inches (see [Gen
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#015) note.md), the ark of the covenant
was a box 3 ft. 9 in. long, 2 ft. 3 in. wide, and 2 ft. 3 in. deep.

[Exo 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#011.md)

Overlay it with pure gold - Words descriptive of the common process of
gilding. The Egyptians in early times were acquainted with both the art
of gilding and that of covering a substance with thin plates of gold.

A crown of gold - That is, an edging or moulding of gold round the top
of the ark, within which the cover or mercy-seat [Exo
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017.md) may have fitted (compare [Exo
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#002).md). There were golden mouldings,
called by the same name, to the table of showbread [Exo
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#024.md); [Exo
37:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#011.md), and to the golden altar [Exo
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#003.md); [Exo
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#026.md).

[Exo 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#012.md)

Four corners thereof - Rather, its four bases, or feet. It is not
unlikely that there were low blocks, or plinths, placed under the
corners to which the rings were attached (see [Exo
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#026).md), and that it is to them the
word is here applied. The ark, when it was carried, must thus have been
raised above the shoulders of the bearers.

[Exo 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015.md)

They shall not be taken from it - This direction was probably given in
order that the ark might not be touched by the hand (compare [Sa2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006).md).

[Exo 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016.md)

The testimony - Literally, "something spoken again and again." The stone
tables of the Ten Commandments are called the Testimony, or, the tables
of the Testimony, as the ark which contained them is called the ark of
the Testimony, and the tabernacle in which the ark was placed, the
tabernacle of the testimony. Taking this in connection with the
prohibitory form of the commandments, the name must have been understood
as signifying the direct testimony of Yahweh against sin in man [Deu
31:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026.md).

The ark of the covenant has been most generally likened to the arks, or
moveable shrines, which are represented on Egyptian monuments. The
Egyptian arks were carried by poles on the shoulders, and some of them
had on the cover two winged figures not unlike what we conceive the
golden cherubim to have been. Thus far the similarity is striking. But
there were points of great dissimilarity. Between the winged figures on
the Egyptian arks there was placed the material symbol of a deity, and
the arks themselves were carried about in religious processions, so as
to make a show in the eyes of the people. We know not what they
contained. As regards the ark of the covenant, the absence of any symbol
of God was one of its great characteristics. It was never carried in a
ceremonial procession: when it was moved from one place to another, it
was closely packed up, concealed from the eyes even of the Levites who
bore it. When the tabernacle was pitched, the ark was never exhibited,
but was kept in solemn darkness. Rest, it is evident, was its appointed
condition. It was occasionally moved out of its place in the holy of
holies, but only so long as the nation was without a settled capital,
and had something of the character of an army on the march. Not less was
it distinguished from all other arks in the simple grandeur of its
purpose: it was constructed to contain the plain text of the Ten
Commandments written on stone in words that were intelligible to all.

[Exodus 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 25:17</span></span>

A mercy seat of pure gold - (Compare [Exo
37:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#006)..md) In external form, the
mercy-seat was a plate of gold with the cherubim standing on it, the
whole beaten out of one solid piece of metal [Exo
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#007.md); it was placed upon the ark and
so took the place of a cover. "mercy" seat expresses well the distinct
significance and recognized designation of the Hebrew name.

[Exo 25:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018.md)

The cherubim of the mercy-seat were human figures, each having two
wings. They must have been of small size, proportioned to the area of
the mercy-seat. Comparing the different references to form in this
place, in [Sa2 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#011.md) [Psa
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md), in Ezek. 1; 10 and in [Rev
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md), it would appear that the name
"cherub" was applied to various combinations of animal forms. Among the
Egyptians, the Assyrians and the Greeks, as well as the Hebrews, the
creatures by far most frequently introduced into these composite
figures, were man, the ox, the lion, and the eagle, as being types of
the most important and familiarly known classes of living material
beings. Hence, the cherubim, described by Ezekiel, have been regarded as
representing the whole creation engaged in the worship and service of
God (compare [Rev 4:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#009.md); [Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013).md); and it would be in harmony with
this view to suppose that the more strictly human shape of the cherubim
of the mercy seat represented the highest form of created intelligence
engaged in the devout contemplation of the divine law of love and
justice. (Compare [Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012)..md) It is
worthy of notice that the golden cherubim from between which Yahweh
spoke [Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md) to His people bore
witness, by their place on the mercy-seat, to His redeeming mercy; while
the cherubim that took their stand at the gate of Eden, [Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024.md), to keep the way to the tree of
life, witnessed to His condemnation of sin in man.

[Exo 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018.md)

Of beaten work - i. e. elaborately worked with the hammer.

[Exo 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#019.md)

Even of the mercy seat - See the margin. The sense appears to be that
the cherubim and the mercy-seat were to be worked out of one mass of
gold. (Compare [Exo 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#007)..md)

[Exo 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#021.md)

The testimony - See [Exo 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016.md) note.
Compare [Exo 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#020.md).

[Exodus 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 25:23</span></span>

(Compare [Exo 37:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#010)..md) The table and
the candlestick figured on the Arch of Titus at Rome are those of the
Maccabaean times, but made as nearly as possible after the ancient
models reproduced under the direction of Solomon and Zerubbabel. The
details and size of the figure, and the description of Josephus, appear
to agree very nearly with the directions here given to Moses, and to
illustrate them in several particulars. Josephus says that the table was
like the so-called Delphic tables, richly ornamented pieces of furniture
in use amongst the Romans, which were sometimes, if not always, covered
with gold or silver.

[Exo 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#024.md)

See [Exo 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#011.md) note. The moulding of
the table is still seen at the ends of the sculptured figure.

[Exo 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#025.md)

A border - Rather a framing, which reached from leg to leg so as to make
the table firm, as well as to adorn it with a second moulding of gold.
Two fragments of such framing are still seen in the sculpture attached
to the legs halfway down.

[Exo 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#027.md)

Over against the border - Rather, Over against the framing; that is, the
rings were to be placed not upon the framing itself, but at the
extremities of the legs answering to each corner of it.

[Exo 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029.md)

Dishes - deep vessels like "bowls," similar to the large silver vessels
(or chargers) which were filled with fine flour, and formed part of the
offerings of the Princes of Israel ([Num
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#013) following.md).

Spoons - Rather, the small gold cups that were filled with frankincense
in the offerings of the Princes [Num
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#014.md), and represented on the table in
the sculpture.

Covers ... bowls - Or flagons and chalices, such as were used for the
rite of the drink offering, which appears to have regularly accompanied
every Meat offering ([Lev 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018.md); [Num
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#015.md); [Num
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#014), etc..md). The subject is important
in its bearing upon the meaning of the showbread: the corrected
rendering of the words tends to show that it was a true Meat offering.

To cover withal - See the margin. The first part of the verse might be
better rendered: And thou shalt make its bowls and its incense-cups and
its flagons and its chalices for pouring out "the drink offerings."

[Exo 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030.md)

The showbread table was placed in the holy place on the north side [Exo
26:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#035.md). Directions for preparing the
showbread are given in [Lev 24:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005.md). It
consisted of twelve large cakes of unleavened bread, which were arranged
on the table in two piles, with a golden cup of frankincense on each
pile. It was renewed every Sabbath day. The stale loaves were given to
the priests, and the frankincense appears to have been lighted on the
altar for a memorial. The showbread, with all the characteristics and
significance of a great national Meat offering, in which the twelve
tribes were represented by the twelve cakes, was to stand before Yahweh
"perpetually," in token that He was always graciously accepting the good
works of His people, for whom atonement had been made by the victims
offered on the altar in the court of the sanctuary. The showbread or
bread which is set forth would be more fairly rendered "bread of the
presence." See the notes at [Lev
24:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005.md).

[Exodus 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 25:31</span></span>

[Exo 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md)

A candlestick of pure gold - (Compare [Exo
37:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#017)..md) A lampstand rather than a
candlestick. Its purpose was to support seven oil-lamps. Its height
appears to have been about three feet, and its width two feet. The
original foot was lost or stolen when the candlestick was taken out of
the temple, and the pedestal in the sculpture was added by some Roman
artist to set off the trophy.

His shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers - Or,
its base, its stem, its flower cups, its knobs, and its lilies.

[Exo 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#033.md)

Three bowls made like unto almonds - Three cups of almond flowers. These
appear to be the cups in immediate contact with the knobs as shown in
the sculpture.

A flower - A lily; and this rendering well agrees with the sculpture.

The candlestick - Here, and in the two following verses, the word
appears to denote "the stem," as the essential part of the candlestick.
It would seem from [Exo 25:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#033.md) that
the ornamentation of the candlestick consisted of uniform members, each
comprising a series of an almond flower, a knob and a lily; that the
stem comprised four of these members; that each pair of branches was
united to the stem at one of the knobs; and that each branch comprised
three members. In comparing the description in the text with the
sculptured figure, allowance must be made for some deviation in the
sculptor's copy.

[Exo 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037.md)

Seven lamps - These lamps were probably like those used by the Egyptian
and other nations, shallow covered vessels more or less of an oval form,
with a mouth at one end from which the wick protruded. The candlestick
was placed on the south side of the holy place [Exo
26:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#035.md), with the line of lamps parallel
with the wall, or, according to Josephus, somewhat obliquely. If the
wick-mouths of the lamps were turned outwards, they would give light
over against the candlestick; that is, toward the north side (see [Num
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#002).md).

Light was of necessity required in the tabernacle, and wherever light is
used in ceremonial observance, it may of course be taken in a general
way as a figure of the Light of Truth; but in the sanctuary of the
covenanted people, it must plainly have been understood as expressly
significant that the number of the lamps (seven) agreed with the number
of the covenant. The covenant of Yahweh was essentially a covenant of
light.

They shall light - See the margin and the note at [Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md).

[Exo 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#038.md)

The tongs - Used to trim and adjust the wicks. (Compare [Isa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#006)..md)

The snuff-dishes - These were shallow vessels used to receive the burnt
fragments of wick removed by the tongs. The same Hebrew word is
translated, in accordance with its connection, "fire pans," [Exo
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003.md); [Exo
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#003.md); and "censers," [Num
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#014.md); [Num
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#006.md).

[Exo 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#039.md)

A talent of pure gold - about 94 lbs.
