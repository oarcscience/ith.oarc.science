### [Ezekiel Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 18:0</span></span>

(v. 1-20) God has no respect of persons.

([Eze 18:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021).md) The Divine providence
is vindicated.

([Eze 18:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030).md) A gracious invitation
to repentance.

[Ezekiel 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 18:1</span></span>

The soul that sinneth it shall die. As to eternity, every man was, is,
and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the
old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward
sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for
their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for
the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great
Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish
for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for
his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal
with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ.
If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose
character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be
expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his
father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who
walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his
father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he
should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the
meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with
the righteous and the wicked.

[Ezekiel 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 18:21</span></span>

The wicked man would be saved, if he turned from his evil ways. The true
penitent is a true believer. None of his former transgressions shall be
mentioned unto him, but in the righteousness which he has done, as the
fruit of faith and the effect of conversion, he shall surely live. The
question is not whether the truly righteous ever become apostates. It is
certain that many who for a time were thought to be righteous, do so,
while [Eze 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#026.md), [Eze
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#027.md) speaks the fulness of pardoning
mercy: when sin is forgiven, it is blotted out, it is remembered no
more. In their righteousness they shall live; not for their
righteousness, as if that were an atonement for their sins, but in their
righteousness, which is one of the blessings purchased by the Mediator.
What encouragement a repenting, returning sinner has to hope for pardon
and life according to this promise! In [Eze
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#028.md) is the beginning and progress of
repentance. True believers watch and pray, and continue to the end, and
they are saved. In all our disputes with God, he is in the right, and we
are in the wrong.

[Ezekiel 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 18:30</span></span>

The Lord will judge each of the Israelites according to his ways. On
this is grounded an exhortation to repent, and to make them a new heart
and a new spirit. God does not command what cannot be done, but
admonishes us to do what is in our power, and to pray for what is not.
Ordinances and means are appointed, directions and promises are given,
that those who desire this change may seek it from God.
