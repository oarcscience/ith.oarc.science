### [Luke Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 7:0</span></span>

([Luk 7:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001).md) The centurion's servant
healed.

([Luk 7:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011).md) The widow's son raised.

(v. 19-35) John the Baptist's inquiry concerning Jesus.

([Luk 7:36-50](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036).md) Christ anointed in the

[Luke 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 7:1</span></span>

Servants should study to endear themselves to their masters. Masters
ought to take particular care of their servants when they are sick. We
may still, by faithful and fervent prayer, apply to Christ, and ought to
do so when sickness is in our families. The building places for
religious worship is a good work, and an instance of love to God and his
people. Our Lord Jesus was pleased with the centurion's faith; and he
never fails to answer the expectations of that faith which honours his
power and love. The cure soon wrought and perfect.

[Luke 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 7:11</span></span>

When the Lord saw the poor widow following her son to the grave, he had
compassion on her. See Christ's power over death itself. The gospel call
to all people, to young people particularly, is, Arise from the dead,
and Christ shall give you light and life. When Christ put life into him,
it appeared by the youth's sitting up. Have we grace from Christ? Let us
show it. He began to speak: whenever Christ gives us spiritual life, he
opens the lips in prayer and praise. When dead souls are raised to
spiritual life, by Divine power going with the gospel, we must glorify
God, and look upon it as a gracious visit to his people. Let us seek for
such an interest in our compassionate Saviour, that we may look forward
with joy to the time when the Redeemer's voice shall call forth all that
are in their graves. May we be called to the resurrection of life, not
to that of damnation.

[Luke 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 7:19</span></span>

To his miracles in the kingdom of nature, Christ adds this in the
kingdom of grace, To the poor the gospel is preached. It clearly pointed
out the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, that the messenger he sent
before him to prepare his way, did it by preaching repentance and
reformation of heart and life. We have here the just blame of those who
were not wrought upon by the ministry of John Baptist or of Jesus Christ
himself. They made a jest of the methods God took to do them good. This
is the ruin of multitudes; they are not serious in the concerns of their
souls. Let us study to prove ourselves children of Wisdom, by attending
the instructions of God's word, and adoring those mysteries and glad
tidings which infidels and Pharisees deride and blaspheme.

[Luke 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 7:36</span></span>

None can truly perceive how precious Christ is, and the glory of the
gospel, except the broken-hearted. But while they feel they cannot
enough express self-abhorrence on account of sin, and admiration of his
mercy, the self-sufficient will be disgusted, because the gospel
encourages such repenting sinners. The Pharisee, instead of rejoicing in
the tokens of the woman's repentance, confined his thoughts to her
former bad character. But without free forgiveness none of us can escape
the wrath to come; this our gracious Saviour has purchased with his
blood, that he may freely bestow it on every one that believes in him.
Christ, by a parable, forced Simon to acknowledge that the greater
sinner this woman had been, the greater love she ought to show to Him
when her sins were pardoned. Learn here, that sin is a debt; and all are
sinners, are debtors to Almighty God. Some sinners are greater debtors;
but whether our debt be more or less, it is more than we are able to
pay. God is ready to forgive; and his Son having purchased pardon for
those who believe in him, his gospel promises it to them, and his Spirit
seals it to repenting sinners, and gives them the comfort. Let us keep
far from the proud spirit of the Pharisee, simply depending upon and
rejoicing in Christ alone, and so be prepared to obey him more
zealously, and more strongly to recommend him unto all around us. The
more we express our sorrow for sin, and our love to Christ, the clearer
evidence we have of the forgiveness of our sins. What a wonderful change
does grace make upon a sinner's heart and life, as well as upon his
state before God, by the full remission of all his sins through faith in
the Lord Jesus!
