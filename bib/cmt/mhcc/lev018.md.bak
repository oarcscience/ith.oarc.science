### [Leviticus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 18:0</span></span>

Unlawful marriages and fleshly lusts.

[Leviticus 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 18:1</span></span>

Here is a law against all conformity to the corrupt usages of the
heathen. Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous
idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the
Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence
to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin.
The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only
in the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to their
hearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.
