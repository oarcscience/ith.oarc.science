### [2 Corinthians Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 8:0</span></span>

([Co2 8:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001).md) The apostle reminds them
of charitable contributions for the poor saints.

([Co2 8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007).md) Enforces this by their
gifts, and by the love and grace of Christ.

([Co2 8:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010).md) By the willingness they
had shown to this good work.

([Co2 8:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016).md) He recommends Titus to
them.

[2 Corinthians 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 8:1</span></span>

The grace of God must be owned as the root and fountain of all the good
in us, or done by us, at any time. It is great grace and favour from
God, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. He
commends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paul
should urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we use
or lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we give
for charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to our
advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing all
really good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory to him
whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is. Abundant
spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour of love. How
different this from the conduct of those who will not join in any good
work, unless urged into it!

[2 Corinthians 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 8:7</span></span>

Faith is the root; and as without faith it is not possible to please
God, [Heb 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md), so those who abound in
faith, will abound in other graces and good works also; and this will
work and show itself by love. Great talkers are not always the best
doers; but these Corinthians were diligent to do, as well as to know and
talk well. To all these good things the apostle desires them to add this
grace also, to abound in charity to the poor. The best arguments for
Christian duties, are drawn from the grace and love of Christ. Though he
was rich, as being God, equal in power and glory with the Father, yet he
not only became man for us, but became poor also. At length he emptied
himself, as it were, to ransom their souls by his sacrifice on the
cross. From what riches, blessed Lord, to what poverty didst thou
descend for our sakes! and to what riches hast thou advanced us through
thy poverty! It is our happiness to be wholly at thy disposal.

[2 Corinthians 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 8:10</span></span>

Good purposes are like buds and blossoms, pleasant to behold, and give
hopes of good fruit; but they are lost, and signify nothing without good
deeds. Good beginnings are well; but we lose the benefit, unless there
is perseverance. When men purpose that which is good, and endeavour,
according to their ability, to perform also, God will not reject them
for what it is not in their power to do. But this scripture will not
justify those who think good meanings are enough, or that good purposes,
and the mere profession of a willing mind, are enough to save.
Providence gives to some more of the good things of this world, and to
some less, that those who have abundance might supply others who are in
want. It is the will of God, that by our mutual supplying one another,
there should be some sort of equality; not such a levelling as would
destroy property, for in such a case there could be no exercise of
charity. All should think themselves concerned to relieve those in want.
This is shown from the gathering and giving out the manna in the
wilderness, [Exo 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#018.md). Those who have
most of this world, have no more than food and raiment; and those who
have but little of this world, seldom are quite without them.

[2 Corinthians 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 8:16</span></span>

The apostle commends the brethren sent to collect their charity, that it
might be known who they were, and how safely they might be trusted. It
is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far as we
can, all unjust suspicions. It is needful, in the first place, to act
uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men
should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure
conscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christ as
instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful,
and employed in his service. The good opinion others have of us, should
be an argument with us to do well.
