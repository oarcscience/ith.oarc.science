### [Psalms Chapter 68](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 68:0</span></span>

([Psa 68:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001).md) A prayer-- The greatness
and goodness of God.

([Psa 68:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007).md) The wonderful works God
wrought for his people.

([Psa 68:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015).md) The presence of God in
his church.

([Psa 68:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022).md) The victories of
Christ.

([Psa 68:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029).md) Enlargement of the
church.

([Psa 68:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032).md) The glory and grace of
God.

[Psalms 68:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 68:1</span></span>

None ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. God is the joy
of his people, then let them rejoice when they come before him. He who
derives his being from none, but gives being to all, is engaged by
promise and covenant to bless his people. He is to be praised as a God
of mercy and tender compassion. He ever careth for the afflicted and
oppressed: repenting sinners, who are helpless and exposed more than any
fatherless children, are admitted into his family, and share all their
blessings.

[Psalms 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 68:7</span></span>

Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies. If God bring his
people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and
to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness
and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the
spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel
of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his
inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as
showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be
applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer,
for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared
wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and
Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to
Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they
reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be
as the wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold.
Full salvation will render those white as snow, who were vile and
loathsome through the guilt and defilement of sin.

[Psalms 68:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 68:15</span></span>

The ascension of Christ must here be meant, and thereto it is applied,
[Eph 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md). He received as the purchase
of his death, the gifts needful for the conversion of sinners, and the
salvation of believers. These he continually bestows, even on rebellious
men, that the Lord God might dwell among them, as their Friend and
Father. He gave gifts to men. Having received power to give eternal
life, the Lord Jesus bestows it on as many as were given him, [Joh
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md). Christ came to a rebellious
world, not to condemn it, but that through him it might be saved. The
glory of Zion's King is, that he is a Saviour and Benefactor to all his
willing people, and a consuming fire to all that persist in rebellion
against him. So many, so weighty are the gifts of God's bounty, that he
may be truly said to load us with them. He will not put us off with
present things for a portion, but will be the God of our salvation. The
Lord Jesus has authority and power to rescue his people from the
dominion of death, by taking away the sting of it from them when they
die, and giving them complete victory over it when they rise again. The
crown of the head, the chief pride and glory of the enemy, shall be
smitten; Christ shall crush the head of the serpent.

[Psalms 68:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 68:22</span></span>

The victories with which God blessed David over the enemies of Israel,
are types of Christ's victory, for himself and for all believers. Those
who take him for theirs, may see him acting as their God, as their King,
for their good, and in answer to their prayers; especially in and by his
word and ordinances. The kingdom of the Messiah shall be submitted to by
all the rulers and learned in the world. The people seem to address the
king, [Psa 68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028.md). But the words are
applicable to the Redeemer, to his church, and every true believer. We
pray, that thou, O God the Son, wilt complete thine undertaking for us,
by finishing thy good work in us.

[Psalms 68:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 68:29</span></span>

A powerful invitation is given to those that are without, to join the
church. Some shall submit from fear; overcome by their consciences, and
the checks of Providence, they are brought to make peace with the
church. Others will submit willingly, [Psa
68:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029.md), [Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031.md). There is that beauty and
benefit in the service of God, and in the gospel of Christ which went
forth from Jerusalem, which is enough to invite sinners out of all
nations.

[Psalms 68:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 68:32</span></span>

God is to be admired and adored with reverence and godly fear, by all
that attend in his holy places. The God of Israel gives strength and
power unto his people. Through Christ strengthening us we can do all
things, not otherwise; therefore he must have the glory of all we do,
with our humble thanks for enabling us to do it, and for accepting the
work of his hands in us.
