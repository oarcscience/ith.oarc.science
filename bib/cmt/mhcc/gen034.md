### [Genesis Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 34:0</span></span>

(v. 1-19) Dinah defiled by Shechem.

([Gen 34:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#020).md) The Shechemites
murdered by Simeon and Levi.

[Genesis 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 34:1</span></span>

Young persons, especially females, are never so safe and well off as
under the care of pious parents. Their own ignorance, and the flattery
and artifices of designing, wicked people, who are ever laying snares
for them, expose them to great danger. They are their own enemies if
they desire to go abroad, especially alone, among strangers to true
religion. Those parents are very wrong who do not hinder their children
from needlessly exposing themselves to danger. Indulged children, like
Dinah, often become a grief and shame to their families. Her pretence
was, to see the daughters of the land, to see how they dressed, and how
they danced, and what was fashionable among them; she went to see, yet
that was not all, she went to be seen too. She went to get acquaintance
with the Canaanites, and to learn their ways. See what came of Dinah's
gadding. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. How
great a matter does a little fire kindle! We should carefully avoid all
occasions of sin and approaches to it.

[Genesis 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 34:20</span></span>

The Shechemites submitted to the sacred rite, only to serve a turn, to
please their prince, and to enrich themselves, and it was just with God
to bring punishment upon them. As nothing secures us better than true
religion, so nothing exposes us more than religion only pretended to.
But Simeon and Levi were most unrighteous. Those who act wickedly, under
the pretext of religion, are the worst enemies of the truth, and harden
the hearts of many to destruction. The crimes of others form no excuse
for us. Alas! how one sin leads on to another, and, like flames of fire,
spread desolation in every direction! Foolish pleasures lead to
seduction; seduction produces wrath; wrath thirsts for revenge; the
thirst of revenge has recourse to treachery; treachery issues in murder;
and murder is followed by other lawless actions. Were we to trace the
history of unlawful commerce between the sexes, we should find it, more
than any other sin, ending in blood.
