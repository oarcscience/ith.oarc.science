### [Psalms Chapter 124](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 124:0</span></span>

([Psa 124:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001).md) The deliverance of the
church.

([Psa 124:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006).md) Thankfulness for the
deliverance.

[Psalms 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 124:1</span></span>

God suffers the enemies of his people sometimes to prevail very far
against them, that his power may be seen the more in their deliverance.
Happy the people whose God is Jehovah, a God all-sufficient. Besides
applying this to any particular deliverance wrought in our days and the
ancient times, we should have in our thoughts the great work of
redemption by Jesus Christ, by which believers were rescued from Satan.

[Psalms 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 124:6</span></span>

God is the Author of all our deliverances, and he must have the glory.
The enemies lay snares for God's people, to bring them into sin and
trouble, and to hold them there. Sometimes they seem to prevail; but in
the Lord let us put our trust, and we shall not be put to confusion. The
believer will ascribe all the honour of his salvation, to the power,
mercy, and truth of God, and look back with wonder and thanksgiving on
the way in which the Lord has led him. Let us rejoice that our help for
the time to come is in him who made heaven and earth.
