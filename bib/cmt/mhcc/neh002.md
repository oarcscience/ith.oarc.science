[Nehemiah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 2:1</span></span>

Our prayers must be seconded with serious endeavours, else we mock God.
We are not limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of
kings, but have liberty to go to him at all times; approaches to the
throne of grace are never out of season. But the sense of God's
displeasure and the afflictions of his people, are causes of sorrow to
the children of God, under which no earthly delights can comfort. The
king encouraged Nehemiah to tell his mind. This gave him boldness to
speak; much more may the invitation Christ has given us to pray, and the
promise that we shall speed, encourage us to come boldly to the throne
of grace. Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven, as infinitely above even
this mighty monarch. He lifted up his heart to that God who understands
the language of the heart. Nor should we ever engage in any pursuit in
which it would be wrong for us thus to seek and expect the Divine
direction, assistance, and blessing. There was an immediate answer to
his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never sought the God of Jacob in vain.

[Nehemiah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 2:9</span></span>

When Nehemiah had considered the matter, he told the Jews that God had
put it into his heart to build the wall of Jerusalem. He does not
undertake to do it without them. By stirring up ourselves and one
another to that which is good, we strengthen ourselves and one another
for it. We are weak in our duty, when we are cold and careless.

[Nehemiah 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 2:19</span></span>

The enmity of the serpent's seed against the cause of Christ is confined
to no age or nation. The application to ourselves is plain. The church
of God asks for our help. Is it not desolate, and exposed to assaults?
Does the consideration of its low estate cause you any grief? Let not
business, pleasure, or the support of a party so engage attention, as
that Zion and her welfare shall be nothing to you.
