### [Psalms Chapter 114](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

An exhortation to fear God.

[Psalms 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 114:1</span></span>

Let us acknowledge God's power and goodness in what he did for Israel,
applying it to that much greater work of wonder, our redemption by
Christ; and encourage ourselves and others to trust in God in the
greatest straits. When Christ comes for the salvation of his people, he
redeems them from the power of sin and Satan, separates them from an
ungodly world, forms them to be his people, and becomes their King.
There is no sea, no Jordan, so deep, so broad, but, when God's time is
come, it shall be divided and driven back. Apply this to the planting
the Christian church in the world. What ailed Satan and his idolatries,
that they trembled as they did? But especially apply it to the work of
grace in the heart. What turns the stream in a regenerate soul? What
affects the lusts and corruptions, that they fly back; that prejudices
are removed, and the whole man becomes new? It is at the presence of
God's Spirit. At the presence of the Lord, not only mountains, but the
earth itself may well tremble, since it has lain under a curse for man's
sin. As the Israelites were protected, so they were provided for by
miracles; such was that fountain of waters into which the flinty rock
was turned, and that rock was Christ. The Son of God, the Rock of ages,
gave himself to death, to open a fountain to wash away sins, and to
supply believers with waters of life and consolation; and they need not
fear that any blessing is too great to expect from his love. But let
sinners fear before their just and holy Judge. Let us now prepare to
meet our God, that we may have boldness before him at his coming.
