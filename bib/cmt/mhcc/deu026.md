### [Deuteronomy Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 26:1</span></span>

When God has made good his promises to us, he expects we should own it
to the honour of his faithfulness. And our creature comforts are doubly
sweet, when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise. The
person who offered his first-fruits, must remember and own the mean
origin of that nation, of which he was a member. A Syrian ready to
perish was my father. Jacob is here called a Syrian. Their nation in its
infancy sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there as slaves.
They were a poor, despised, oppressed people in Egypt; and though become
rich and great, had no reason to be proud, secure, or forgetful of God.
He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodness to Israel. The
comfort we have in our own enjoyments, should lead us to be thankful for
our share in public peace and plenty; and with present mercies we should
bless the Lord for the former mercies we remember, and the further
mercies we expect and hope for. He must offer his basket of
first-fruits. Whatever good thing God gives us, it is his will that we
make the most comfortable use we can of it, tracing the streams to the
Fountain of all consolation.

[Deuteronomy 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 26:12</span></span>

How should the earth yield its increase, or, if it does, what comfort
can we take in it, unless therewith our God gives us his blessing? All
this represented the covenant relation between a reconciled God and
every true believer, and the privileges and duties belonging to it. We
must be watchful, and show that according to the covenant of grace in
Christ Jesus, the Lord is our God, and we are his people, waiting in his
appointed way for the performance of his gracious promises.

[Deuteronomy 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 26:16</span></span>

Moses here enforces the precepts. They are God's laws, therefore thou
shalt do them, to that end were they given thee; do them, and dispute
them not; do them, and draw not back; do them, not carelessly and
hypocritically, but with thy heart and soul, thy whole heart and thy
whole soul. We forswear ourselves, and break the most sacred engagement,
if, when we have taken the Lord to be our God, we do not make conscience
of obeying his commands. We are elected to obedience, [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md); chosen that we should be holy,
[Eph 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md); purified a peculiar people,
that we might not only do good works, but be zealous in them, [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md). Holiness is true honour, and the
only way to everlasting honour.
