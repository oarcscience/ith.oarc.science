### [Matthew Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 18:1</span></span>

Christ spoke many words of his sufferings, but only one of his glory;
yet the disciples fasten upon that, and overlook the others. Many love
to hear and speak of privileges and glory, who are willing to pass by
the thoughts of work and trouble. Our Lord set a little child before
them, solemnly assuring them, that unless they were converted and made
like little children, they could not enter his kingdom. Children, when
very young, do not desire authority, do not regard outward distinctions,
are free from malice, are teachable, and willingly dependent on their
parents. It is true that they soon begin to show other dispositions, and
other ideas are taught them at an early age; but these are marks of
childhood, and render them proper emblems of the lowly minds of true
Christians. Surely we need to be daily renewed in the spirit of our
minds, that we may become simple and humble, as little children, and
willing to be the least of all. Let us daily study this subject, and
examine our own spirits.

[Matthew 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 18:7</span></span>

Considering the cunning and malice of Satan, and the weakness and
depravity of men's hearts, it is not possible but that there should be
offences. God permits them for wise and holy ends, that those who are
sincere, and those who are not, may be made known. Being told before,
that there will be seducers, tempters, persecutors, and bad examples,
let us stand on our guard. We must, as far as lawfully we may, part with
what we cannot keep without being entangled by it in sin. The outward
occasions of sin must be avoided. If we live after the flesh, we must
die. If we, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body, we shall
live. Christ came into the world to save souls, and he will reckon
severely with those who hinder the progress of others who are setting
their faces heavenward. And shall any of us refuse attention to those
whom the Son of God came to seek and to save? A father takes care of all
his children, but is particularly tender of the little ones.

[Matthew 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 18:15</span></span>

If a professed Christian is wronged by another, he ought not to complain
of it to others, as is often done merely upon report, but to go to the
offender privately, state the matter kindly, and show him his conduct.
This would generally have all the desired effect with a true Christian,
and the parties would be reconciled. The principles of these rules may
be practised every where, and under all circumstances, though they are
too much neglected by all. But how few try the method which Christ has
expressly enjoined to all his disciples! In all our proceedings we
should seek direction in prayer; we cannot too highly prize the promises
of God. Wherever and whenever we meet in the name of Christ, we should
consider him as present in the midst of us.

[Matthew 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 18:21</span></span>

Though we live wholly on mercy and forgiveness, we are backward to
forgive the offences of our brethren. This parable shows how much
provocation God has from his family on earth, and how untoward his
servants are. There are three things in the parable: 1. The master's
wonderful clemency. The debt of sin is so great, that we are not able to
pay it. See here what every sin deserves; this is the wages of sin, to
be sold as a slave. It is the folly of many who are under strong
convictions of their sins, to fancy they can make God satisfaction for
the wrong they have done him. 2. The servant's unreasonable severity
toward his fellow-servant, notwithstanding his lord's clemency toward
him. Not that we may make light of wronging our neighbour, for that is
also a sin against God; but we should not aggravate our neighbour's
wronging us, nor study revenge. Let our complaints, both of the
wickedness of the wicked, and of the afflictions of the afflicted, be
brought to God, and left with him. 3. The master reproved his servant's
cruelty. The greatness of sin magnifies the riches of pardoning mercy;
and the comfortable sense of pardoning mercy, does much to dispose our
hearts to forgive our brethren. We are not to suppose that God actually
forgives men, and afterwards reckons their guilt to them to condemn
them; but this latter part of the parable shows the false conclusions
many draw as to their sins being pardoned, though their after-conduct
shows that they never entered into the spirit, or experienced the
sanctifying grace of the gospel. We do not forgive our offending brother
aright, if we do not forgive from the heart. Yet this is not enough; we
must seek the welfare even of those who offend us. How justly will those
be condemned, who, though they bear the Christian name, persist in
unmerciful treatment of their brethren! The humbled sinner relies only
on free, abounding mercy, through the ransom of the death of Christ. Let
us seek more and more for the renewing grace of God, to teach us to
forgive others as we hope for forgiveness from him.
