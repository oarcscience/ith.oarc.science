### [Jeremiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 33:0</span></span>

([Jer 33:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)) The restoration of the
Jews.

([Jer 33:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014)) The Messiah promised;
happiness of his times.

[Jeremiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 33:1</span></span>

Those who expect to receive comforts from God, must call upon him.
Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken and encourage prayer.
These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; and in that God has
revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy. All who by
sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy
are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and
sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they
are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to
perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world
around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the
people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy. Where
the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will give all needful
supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will be comforts, as
sanctified by the word and by prayer.

[Jeremiah 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 33:14</span></span>

To crown the blessings God has in store, here is a promise of the
Messiah. He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God
to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in
him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and
our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world
prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day
and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true
believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up
spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place,
as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full
accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016), all that walk according to the
gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace
and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen
people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.
