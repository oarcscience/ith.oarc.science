### [Hebrews Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

([Heb 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001).md) The surpassing dignity of
the Son of God in his Divine person, and in his creating and mediatorial
work.

([Heb 1:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004).md) And in his superiority
to all the holy angels.

[Hebrews 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 1:1</span></span>

God spake to his ancient people at sundry times, through successive
generations, and in divers manners, as he thought proper; sometimes by
personal directions, sometimes by dreams, sometimes by visions,
sometimes by Divine influences on the minds of the prophets. The gospel
revelation is excellent above the former; in that it is a revelation
which God has made by his Son. In beholding the power, wisdom, and
goodness of the Lord Jesus Christ, we behold the power, wisdom, and
goodness of the Father, [Joh 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007.md); the
fulness of the Godhead dwells, not typically, or in a figure, but
really, in him. When, on the fall of man, the world was breaking to
pieces under the wrath and curse of God, the Son of God, undertaking the
work of redemption, sustained it by his almighty power and goodness.
From the glory of the person and office of Christ, we proceed to the
glory of his grace. The glory of His person and nature, gave to his
sufferings such merit as was a full satisfaction to the honour of God,
who suffered an infinite injury and affront by the sins of men. We never
can be thankful enough that God has in so many ways, and with such
increasing clearness, spoken to us fallen sinners concerning salvation.
That he should by himself cleanse us from our sins is a wonder of love
beyond our utmost powers of admiration, gratitude, and praise.

[Hebrews 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 1:4</span></span>

Many Jews had a superstitious or idolatrous respect for angels, because
they had received the law and other tidings of the Divine will by their
ministry. They looked upon them as mediators between God and men, and
some went so far as to pay them a kind of religious homage or worship.
Thus it was necessary that the apostle should insist, not only on
Christ's being the Creator of all things, and therefore of angels
themselves, but as being the risen and exalted Messiah in human nature,
to whom angels, authorities, and powers are made subject. To prove this,
several passages are brought from the Old Testament. On comparing what
God there says of the angels, with what he says to Christ, the
inferiority of the angels to Christ plainly appears. Here is the office
of the angels; they are God's ministers or servants, to do his pleasure.
But, how much greater things are said of Christ by the Father! And let
us own and honour him as God; for if he had not been God, he had never
done the Mediator's work, and had never worn the Mediator's crown. It is
declared how Christ was qualified for the office of Mediator, and how he
was confirmed in it: he has the name Messiah from his being anointed.
Only as Man he has his fellows, and as anointed with the Holy Spirit;
but he is above all prophets, priests, and kings, that ever were
employed in the service of God on earth. Another passage of Scripture,
[Psa 102:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md), is recited, in which
the Almighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ is declared, both in
creating the world and in changing it. Christ will fold up this world as
a garment, not to be abused any longer, not to be used as it has been.
As a sovereign, when his garments of state are folded and put away, is a
sovereign still, so our Lord, when he has laid aside the earth and
heavens like a vesture, shall be still the same. Let us not then set our
hearts upon that which is not what we take it to be, and will not be
what it now is. Sin has made a great change in the world for the worse,
and Christ will make a great change in it for the better. Let the
thoughts of this make us watchful, diligent, and desirous of that better
world. The Saviour has done much to make all men his friends, yet he has
enemies. But they shall be made his footstool, by humble submission, or
by utter destruction. Christ shall go on conquering and to conquer. The
most exalted angels are but ministering spirits, mere servants of
Christ, to execute his commands. The saints, at present, are heirs, not
yet come into possession. The angels minister to them in opposing the
malice and power of evil spirits, in protecting and keeping their
bodies, instructing and comforting their souls, under Christ and the
Holy Ghost. Angels shall gather all the saints together at the last day,
when all whose hearts and hopes are set upon perishing treasures and
fading glories, will be driven from Christ's presence into everlasting
misery.
