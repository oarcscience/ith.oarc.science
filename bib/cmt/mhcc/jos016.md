### [Joshua Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

The sons of Joseph.

[Joshua 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 16:1</span></span>

This and the following chapter should not be separated. They give the
lots of Ephraim and Manasseh, the children of Joseph, who, next to
Judah, were to have the post of honour, and therefore had the first and
best portion in the northern part of Canaan, as Judah in the southern
part. God's people now, as of old, suffer his enemies to remain. Blessed
Lord, when will all our enemies be subdued? [Co1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#026.md). Do thou drive them all out;
thou alone canst do it. These settled boundaries may remind us, that our
situation and provision in this life, as well as our future inheritance,
are appointed by the only wise and righteous God, and we should be
content with our portion, since he knows what is best for us, and all we
have is more than we deserve.
