### [Micah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 3:0</span></span>

([Mic 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)) The cruelty of the
princes, and the falsehood of the prophets.

([Mic 3:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009)) Their false security.

[Micah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 3:1</span></span>

Men cannot expect to do ill, and fare well; but to find that done to
them which they did to others. How seldom do wholesome truths reach the
ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others
are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love
to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their
salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not
drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself,
but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act
honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God,
must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be
thankful.

[Micah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 3:9</span></span>

Zion's walls owe no thanks to those that build them up with blood and
iniquity. The sin of man works not the righteousness of God. Even when
men do that which in itself is good, but do it for filthy lucre, it
becomes abomination both to God and man. Faith rests in the Lord as the
soul's foundation: presumption only leans upon the Lord as a prop, and
would use him to serve a turn. If men's having the Lord among them will
not keep them from doing evil, it never can secure them from suffering
evil for so doing. See the doom of wicked Jacob; Therefore shall Zion
for your sake be ploughed as a field. This was exactly fulfilled at the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and is so at this day. If sacred
places are polluted by sin, they will be wasted and ruined by the
judgments of God.
