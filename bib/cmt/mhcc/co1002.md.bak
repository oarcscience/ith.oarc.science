### [1 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co1 2:0</span></span>

([Co1 2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001).md) The plain manner in which
the apostle preached Christ crucified.

([Co1 2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006).md) The wisdom contained in
this doctrine.

([Co1 2:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010).md) It cannot be duly known
but by the Holy Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 2:1</span></span>

Christ, in his person, and offices, and sufferings, is the sum and
substance of the gospel, and ought to be the great subject of a gospel
minister's preaching, but not so as to leave out other parts of God's
revealed truth and will. Paul preached the whole counsel of God. Few
know the fear and trembling of faithful ministers, from a deep sense of
their own weakness They know how insufficient they are, and are fearful
for themselves. When nothing but Christ crucified is plainly preached,
the success must be entirely from Divine power accompanying the word,
and thus men are brought to believe, to the salvation of their souls.

[1 Corinthians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 2:6</span></span>

Those who receive the doctrine of Christ as Divine, and, having been
enlightened by the Holy Spirit, have looked well into it, see not only
the plain history of Christ, and him crucified, but the deep and
admirable designs of Divine wisdom therein. It is the mystery made
manifest to the saints, [Col 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md),
though formerly hid from the heathen world; it was only shown in dark
types and distant prophecies, but now is revealed and made known by the
Spirit of God. Jesus Christ is the Lord of glory; a title much too great
for any creature. There are many things which people would not do, if
they knew the wisdom of God in the great work of redemption. There are
things God hath prepared for those that love him, and wait for him,
which sense cannot discover, no teaching can convey to our ears, nor can
it yet enter our hearts. We must take them as they stand in the
Scriptures, as God hath been pleased to reveal them to us.

[1 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 2:10</span></span>

God has revealed true wisdom to us by his Spirit. Here is a proof of the
Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, [Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021.md). In proof of the Divinity of the
Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all
things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God,
but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who
makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear
testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy
Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the
revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving
impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in
plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different
from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural
man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of
God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to
spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the
real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about
common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger
to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The
spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his
will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And
the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the
Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are
fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that
they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They
experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good
fruits in their lives.
