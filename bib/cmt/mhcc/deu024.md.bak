### [Deuteronomy Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 24:0</span></span>

([Deu 24:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001).md) Of divorce.

([Deu 24:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005).md) Of new-married persons,
Of man-stealers, Of pledges.

([Deu 24:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014).md) Of justice and
generosity.

[Deuteronomy 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 24:1</span></span>

Where the providence of God, or his own wrong choice in marriage, has
allotted to a Christian a trial instead of a help meet; he will from his
heart prefer bearing the cross, to such relief as tends to sin,
confusion, and misery. Divine grace will sanctify this cross, support
under it, and teach so to behave, as will gradually render it more
tolerable.

[Deuteronomy 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 24:5</span></span>

It is of great consequence that love be kept up between husband and
wife; that they carefully avoid every thing which might make them
strange one to another. Man-stealing was a capital crime, which could
not be settled, as other thefts, by restitution. The laws concerning
leprosy must be carefully observed. Thus all who feel their consciences
under guilt and wrath, must not cover it, or endeavour to shake off
their convictions; but by repentance, and prayer, and humble confession,
take the way to peace and pardon. Some orders are given about pledges
for money lent. This teaches us to consult the comfort and subsistence
of others, as much as our own advantage. Let the poor debtor sleep in
his own raiment, and praise God for thy kindness to him. Poor debtors
ought to feel more than commonly they do, the goodness of creditors who
do not take all the advantage of the law against them, nor should this
ever be looked upon as weakness.

[Deuteronomy 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 24:14</span></span>

It is not hard to prove that purity, piety, justice, mercy, fair
conduct, kindness to the poor and destitute, consideration for them, and
generosity of spirit, are pleasing to God, and becoming in his redeemed
people. The difficulty is to attend to them in our daily walk and
conversation.
