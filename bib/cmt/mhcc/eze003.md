### [Ezekiel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 3:0</span></span>

([Eze 3:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001)) The preparation of the
prophet for his work.

([Eze 3:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012)) His office, as that of
a watchman.

([Eze 3:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022)) The restraining and
restoring his speech.

[Ezekiel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 3:1</span></span>

Ezekiel was to receive the truths of God as the food for his soul, and
to feed upon them by faith, and he would be strengthened. Gracious souls
can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the
wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him.
How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed
as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought
upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We
must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy
judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the
prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to
strengthen him. He must continue earnest in preaching, whatever the
success might be.

[Ezekiel 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 3:12</span></span>

This mission made the holy angels rejoice. All this was to convince
Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear him out in his
work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his
people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision he had seen. And
however retirement, meditation, and communion with God may be sweet, the
servant of the Lord must prepare to serve his generation. The Lord told
the prophet he had appointed him a watchman to the house of Israel. If
we warn the wicked, we are not chargeable with their ruin. Though such
passages refer to the national covenant made with Israel, they are
equally to be applied to the final state of all men under every
dispensation. We are not only to encourage and comfort those who appear
to be righteous, but they are to be warned, for many have grown
high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even died in their sins. Surely
then the hearers of the gospel should desire warnings, and even
reproofs.

[Ezekiel 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 3:22</span></span>

Let us own ourselves for ever indebted to the mediation of Christ, for
the blessed intercourse between God and man; and a true believer will
say, I am never less alone than when thus alone. When the Lord opened
Ezekiel's mouth, he was to deliver his message boldly, to place life and
death, the blessing and the curse, before the people, and leave them to
their choice.
