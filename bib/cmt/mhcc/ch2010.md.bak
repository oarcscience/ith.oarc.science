### [2 Chronicles Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

The ten tribes revolt from Rehoboam.

[2 Chronicles 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 10:1</span></span>

Moderate counsels are wisest and best. Gentleness will do what violence
will not do. Most people like to be accosted mildly. Good words cost
only a little self-denial, yet they purchase great things. No more needs
to be done to ruin men, than to leave them to their own pride and
passion. Thus, whatever are the devices of men, God is doing his own
work by all, and fulfilling the word which he has spoken. No man can
bequeath his prosperity to his heirs any more than his wisdom; though
our children will generally be affected by our conduct, whether good or
bad. Let us then seek those good things which will be our own for ever;
and crave the blessing of God upon our posterity, in preference to
wealth or worldly exaltation.
