### [Jeremiah Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 15:0</span></span>

([Jer 15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)) The destruction of the
wicked described.

([Jer 15:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)) The prophet laments
such messages, and is reproved.

([Jer 15:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015)) He supplicates pardon,
and is promised protection.

[Jeremiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 15:1</span></span>

The Lord declares that even Moses and Samuel must have pleaded in vain.
The putting of this as a case, though they should stand before him,
shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven do not pray for saints
on earth. The Jews were condemned to different kinds of misery by the
righteous judgment of God, and the remnant would be driven away, like
the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populous city made desolate. Bad
examples and misused authority often produce fatal effects, even after
men are dead, or have repented of their crimes: this should make all
greatly dread being the occasion of sin in others.

[Jeremiah 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 15:10</span></span>

Jeremiah met with much contempt and reproach, when they ought to have
blessed him, and God for him. It is a great and sufficient support to
the people of God, that however troublesome their way may be, it shall
be well with them in their latter end. God turns to the people. Shall
the most hardy and vigorous of their efforts be able to contend with the
counsel of God, or with the army of the Chaldeans? Let them hear their
doom. The enemy will treat the prophet well. But the people who had
great estates would be used hardly. All parts of the country had added
to the national guilt; and let each take shame to itself.

[Jeremiah 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 15:15</span></span>

It is matter of comfort that we have a God, to whose knowledge of all
things we may appeal. Jeremiah pleads with God for mercy and relief
against his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. It will be a comfort
to God's ministers, when men despise them, if they have the testimony of
their own consciences. But he complains, that he found little pleasure
in his work. Some good people lose much of the pleasantness of religion
by the fretfulness and uneasiness of their natural temper, which they
indulge. The Lord called the prophet to cease from his distrust, and to
return to his work. If he attended thereto, he might be assured the Lord
would deliver him from his enemies. Those who are with God, and faithful
to him, he will deliver from trouble or carry through it. Many things
appear frightful, which do not at all hurt a real believer in Christ.
