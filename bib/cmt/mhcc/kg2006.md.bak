[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 6:1</span></span>

There is that pleasantness in the converse of servants of God, which can
make those who listen to them forget the pain and the weariness of
labour. Even the sons of the prophets must not be unwilling to labour.
Let no man think an honest employment a burden or a disgrace. And labour
of the head, is as hard, and very often harder, than labour with the
hands. We ought to be careful of that which is borrowed, as of our own,
because we must do as we would be done by. This man was so respecting
the axe-head. And to those who have an honest mind, the sorest grievance
of poverty is, not so much their own want and disgrace, as being
rendered unable to pay just debts. But the Lord cares for his people in
their smallest concerns. And God's grace can thus raise the stony iron
heart, which is sunk into the mud of this world, and raise up
affections, naturally earthly.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 6:8</span></span>

The king of Israel regarded the warnings Elisha gave him, of danger from
the Syrians, but would not heed the warnings of danger from his sins.
Such warnings are little heeded by most; they would save themselves from
death, but will not from hell. Nothing that is done, said, or thought,
by any person, in any place, at any time, is out of God's knowledge.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 6:13</span></span>

What Elisha said to his servant is spoken to all the faithful servants
of God, when without are fightings, and within are fears. Fear not, with
that fear which has torment and amazement; for they that are with us, to
protect us, are more than they that are against us, to destroy us. The
eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger. Lord, open
the eyes of our faith, that with them we may see thy protecting hand.
The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and power of Heaven, the
less we shall fear the troubles of earth. Satan, the god of this world,
blinds men's eyes, and so deludes them unto their own ruin; but when God
enlightens their eyes, they see themselves in the midst of their
enemies, captives to Satan, and in danger of hell, though, before, they
thought their condition good. When Elisha had the Syrians at his mercy,
he made it appear that he was influenced by Divine goodness as well as
Divine power. Let us not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with
good. The Syrians saw it was to no purpose to try to assault so great
and so good a man.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 6:24</span></span>

Learn to value plenty, and to be thankful for it; see how contemptible
money is, when in time of famine it is so freely parted with for any
thing that is eatable! The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the
language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the
threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was
one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, [Deu
28:53-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053.md). The truth and the awful
justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what
miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man
perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king
swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause
of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their
sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would
avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of
their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May
the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that
we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the
Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.
