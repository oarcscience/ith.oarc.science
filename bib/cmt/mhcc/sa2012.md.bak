[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 12:1</span></span>

God will not suffer his people to lie still in sin. By this parable
Nathan drew from David a sentence against himself. Great need there is
of prudence in giving reproofs. In his application, he was faithful. He
says in plain terms, Thou art the man. God shows how much he hates sin,
even in his own people; and wherever he finds it, he will not let it go
unpunished. David says not a word to excuse himself or make light of his
sin, but freely owns it. When David said, I have sinned, and Nathan
perceived that he was a true penitent, he assured him his sin was
forgiven. Thou shalt not die: that is, not die eternally, nor be for
ever put away from God, as thou wouldest have been, if thou hadst not
put away the sin. Though thou shalt all thy days be chastened of the
Lord, yet thou shalt not be condemned with the world. There is this
great evil in the sins of those who profess religion and relation to
God, that they furnish the enemies of God and religion with matter for
reproach and blasphemy. And it appears from David's case, that even
where pardon is obtained, the Lord will visit the transgression of his
people with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. For one momentary
gratification of a vile lust, David had to endure many days and years of
extreme distress.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 12:15</span></span>

David now penned the [Psa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md), in
which, though he had been assured that his sin was pardoned, he prays
earnestly for pardon, and greatly laments his sin. He was willing to
bear the shame of it, to have it ever before him, to be continually
upbraided with it. God gives us leave to be earnest with him in prayer
for particular blessings, from trust in his power and general mercy,
though we have no particular promise to build upon. David patiently
submitted to the will of God in the death of one child, and God made up
the loss to his advantage, in the birth of another. The way to have
creature comforts continued or restored, or the loss made up some other
way, is cheerfully to resign them to God. God, by his grace,
particularly owned and favoured that son, and ordered him to be called
Jedidiah, Beloved of the Lord. Our prayers for our children are
graciously and as fully answered when some of them die in their infancy,
for they are well taken care of, and when others live, "beloved of the
Lord."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 12:26</span></span>

To be thus severe in putting the children of Ammon to slavery was a sign
that David's heart was not yet made soft by repentance, at the time when
this took place. We shall be most compassionate, kind, and forgiving to
others, when we most feel our need of the Lord's forgiving love, and
taste the sweetness of it in our own souls.
