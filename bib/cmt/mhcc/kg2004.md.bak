Elisha's miracles were acts of real charity: Christ's were so; not only
great wonders, but great favours to those for whom they were wrought.
God magnifies his goodness with his power. Elisha readily received a
poor widow's complaint. Those that leave their families under a load of
debt, know not what trouble they cause. It is the duty of all who
profess to follow the Lord, while they trust to God for daily bread, not
to tempt him by carelessness or extravagance, nor to contract debts; for
nothing tends more to bring reproach upon the gospel, or distresses
their families more when they are gone. Elisha put the widow in a way to
pay her debt, and to maintain herself and her family. This was done by
miracle, but so as to show what is the best method to assist those who
are in distress, which is, to help them to improve by their own industry
what little they have. The oil, sent by miracle, continued flowing as
long as she had empty vessels to receive it. We are never straitened in
God, or in the riches of his grace; all our straitness is in ourselves.
It is our faith that fails, not his promise. He gives more than we ask:
were there more vessels, there is enough in God to fill them; enough for
all, enough for each; and the Redeemer's all-sufficiency will only be
stayed from the supplying the wants of sinners and saving their souls,
when no more apply to him for salvation. The widow must pay her debt
with the money she received for her oil. Though her creditors were too
hard with her, yet they must be paid, even before she made any provision
for her children. It is one of the main laws of the Christian religion,
that we pay every just debt, and give every one his own, though we leave
ever so little for ourselves; and this, not of constraint, but for
conscience' sake. Those who bear an honest mind, cannot with pleasure
eat their daily bread, unless it be their own bread. She and her
children must live upon the rest; that is, upon the money received for
the oil, with which they must put themselves into a way to get an honest
livelihood. We cannot now expect miracles, yet we may expect mercies, if
we wait on God, and seek to him. Let widows in particular depend upon
him. He that has all hearts in his hand, can, without a miracle, send as
effectual a supply.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 4:8</span></span>

Elisha was well thought of by the king of Israel for his late services;
a good man can take as much pleasure in serving others, as in raising
himself. But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It
is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us,
and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they
did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret
wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the
prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending
unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of
God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 4:18</span></span>

Here is the sudden death of the child. All the mother's tenderness
cannot keep alive a child of promise, a child of prayer, one given in
love. But how admirably does the prudent, pious mother, guard her lips
under this sudden affliction! Not one peevish word escapes from her.
Such confidence had she of God's goodness, that she was ready to believe
that he would restore what he had now taken away. O woman, great is thy
faith! He that wrought it, would not disappoint it. The sorrowful mother
begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. She had not
thought it enough to have Elisha's help sometimes in her own family,
but, though a woman of rank, attended on public worship. It well becomes
the men of God, to inquire about the welfare of their friends and their
families. The answer was, It is well. All well, and yet the child dead
in the house! Yes! All is well that God does; all is well with them that
are gone, if they are gone to heaven; and all well with us that stay
behind, if, by the affliction, we are furthered in our way thither. When
any creature-comfort is taken from us, it is well if we can say, through
grace, that we did not set our hearts too much upon it; for if we did,
we have reason to fear it was given in anger, and taken away in wrath.
Elisha cried unto God in faith; and the beloved son was restored alive
to his mother. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls, must
feel deeply for their case, and labour fervently in prayer for them.
Though the minister cannot give Divine life to his fellow-sinners, he
must use every means, with as much earnestness as if he could do so.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg2 4:38</span></span>

There was a famine of bread, but not of hearing the word of God, for
Elisha had the sons of the prophets sitting before him, to hear his
wisdom. Elisha made hurtful food to become safe and wholesome. If a mess
of pottage be all our dinner, remember that this great prophet had no
better for himself and his guests. The table often becomes a snare, and
that which should be for our welfare, proves a trap: this is a good
reason why we should not feed ourselves without fear. When we are
receiving the supports and comforts of life, we must keep up an
expectation of death, and a fear of sin. We must acknowledge God's
goodness in making our food wholesome and nourishing; I am the Lord that
healeth thee. Elisha also made a little food go a great way. Having
freely received, he freely gave. God has promised his church, that he
will abundantly bless her provision, and satisfy her poor with bread,
[Psa 132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015.md); whom he feeds, he fills;
and what he blesses, comes to much. Christ's feeding his hearers was a
miracle far beyond this, but both teach us that those who wait upon God
in the way of duty, may hope to be supplied by Divine Providence.
