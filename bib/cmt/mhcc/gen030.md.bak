[Genesis 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 30:1</span></span>

Rachel envied her sister: envy is grieving at the good of another, than
which no sin is more hateful to God, or more hurtful to our neighbours
and ourselves. She considered not that God made the difference, and that
in other things she had the advantage. Let us carefully watch against
all the risings and workings of this passion in our minds. Let not our
eye be evil towards any of our fellow-servants, because our Master's is
good. Jacob loved Rachel, and therefore reproved her for what she said
amiss. Faithful reproofs show true affection. God may be to us instead
of any creature; but it is sin and folly to place any creature in God's
stead, and to place that confidence in any creature, which should be
placed in God only. At the persuasion of Rachel, Jacob took Bilhah her
handmaid to wife, that, according to the usage of those times, her
children might be owned as her mistress's children. Had not Rachel's
heart been influenced by evil passions, she would have thought her
sister's children nearer to her, and more entitled to her care than
Bilhah's. But children whom she had a right to rule, were more desirable
to her than children she had more reason to love. As an early instance
of her power over these children, she takes pleasure in giving them
names that carry in them marks of rivalry with her sister. See what
roots of bitterness envy and strife are, and what mischief they make
among relations. At the persuasion of Leah, Jacob took Zilpah her
handmaid to wife also. See the power of jealousy and rivalship, and
admire the wisdom of the Divine appointment, which joins together one
man and one woman only; for God hath called us to peace and purity.

[Genesis 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 30:14</span></span>

The desire, good in itself, but often too great and irregular, of being
the mother of the promised Seed, with the honour of having many
children, and the reproach of being barren, were causes of this
unbecoming contest between the sisters. The truth appears to be, that
they were influenced by the promises of God to Abraham; whose posterity
were promised the richest blessings, and from whom the Messiah was to
descend.

[Genesis 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 30:25</span></span>

The fourteen years being gone, Jacob was willing to depart without any
provision, except God's promise. But he had in many ways a just claim on
Laban's substance, and it was the will of God that he should be provided
for from it. He referred his cause to God, rather than agree for stated
wages with Laban, whose selfishness was very great. And it would appear
that he acted honestly, when none but those of the colours fixed upon
should be found among his cattle. Laban selfishly thought that his
cattle would produce few different in colour from their own. Jacob's
course after this agreement has been considered an instance of his
policy and management. But it was done by intimation from God, and as a
token of his power. The Lord will one way or another plead the cause of
the oppressed, and honour those who simply trust his providence. Neither
could Laban complain of Jacob, for he had nothing more than was freely
agreed that he should have; nor was he injured, but greatly benefitted
by Jacob's services. May all our mercies be received with thanksgiving
and prayer, that coming from his bounty, they may lead to his praise.
