### [Isaiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 42:0</span></span>

([Isa 42:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md) The character and coming
of Christ.

([Isa 42:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005).md) The blessings of his
kingdom.

([Isa 42:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013).md) The prevalence of true
religion.

([Isa 42:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#018).md) Unbelief and blindness
reproved.

[Isaiah 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 42:1</span></span>

This prophecy was fulfilled in Christ, [Mat
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#017.md). Let our souls rely on him, and
rejoice in him; then, for his sake, the Father will be well-pleased with
us. The Holy Spirit not only came, but rested upon him, and without
measure. He patiently bore the contradiction of sinners. His kingdom is
spiritual; he was not to appear with earthly honours. He is tender of
those oppressed with doubts and fears, as a bruised reed; those who are
as smoking flax, as the wick of a lamp newly lighted, which is ready to
go out again. He will not despise them, nor lay upon them more work or
more suffering than they can bear. By a long course of miracles and his
resurrection, he fully showed the truth of his holy religion. By the
power of his gospel and grace he fixes principles in the minds of men,
which tend to make them wise and just. The most distant nations wait for
his law, wait for his gospel, and shall welcome it. If we would make our
calling and election sure, and have the Father delight over us for good,
we must behold, hear, believe in, and obey Christ.

[Isaiah 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 42:5</span></span>

The work of redemption brings back man to the obedience he owes to God
as his Maker. Christ is the light of the world. And by his grace he
opens the understandings Satan has blinded, and sets at liberty from the
bondage of sin. The Lord has supported his church. And now he makes new
promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled as the old ones were.
When the Gentiles are brought into the church, he is glorified in them
and by them. Let us give to God those things which are his, taking heed
that we do not serve the creature more than the Creator.

[Isaiah 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 42:13</span></span>

The Lord will appear in his power and glory. He shall cry, in the
preaching of his word. He shall cry aloud in the gospel woes, which must
be preached with gospel blessings, to awaken a sleeping world. He shall
conquer by the power of his Spirit. And those that contradict and
blaspheme his gospel, he shall put to silence and shame; and that which
hinders its progress shall be taken out of the way. To those who by
nature were blind, God will show the way to life and happiness by Jesus
Christ. They are weak in knowledge, but He will make darkness light.
They are weak in duty, but their way shall be plain. Those whom God
brings into the right way, he will guide in it. This passage is a
prophecy, and is also applicable to every believer; for the Lord will
never leave nor forsake them.

[Isaiah 42:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 42:18</span></span>

Observe the call given to this people, and the character given of them.
Multitudes are ruined for want of observing that which they cannot but
see; they perish, not through ignorance, but carelessness. The Lord is
well-pleased in the making known his own righteousness. For their sins
they were spoiled of all their possessions. This fully came to pass in
the destruction of the Jewish nation. There is no resisting, nor
escaping God's anger. See the mischief sin makes; it provokes God to
anger. And those not humbled by lesser judgments, must expect greater.
Alas! how many professed Christians are blind as the benighted heathen!
While the Lord is well-pleased in saving sinners through the
righteousness of Christ he will also glorify his justice, by punishing
all proud despisers. Seeing God has poured out his wrath on his
once-favoured people, because of their sins, let us fear, lest a promise
being left us of entering into his rest, any of us should be found to
come short of it.
