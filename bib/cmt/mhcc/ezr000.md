[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 0:0</span></span>

The history of this book is the accomplishment of Jeremiah's prophecy
concerning the return of the Jews out of Babylon. From its contents we
especially learn, that every good work will meet with opposition from
enemies, and be hurt by the misconduct of friends; but that God will
make his cause to prevail, notwithstanding all obstacles and
adversaries. The restoration of the Jews was an event of the highest
consequence, tending to preserve religion in the world, and preparing
the way for the appearance of the Great Deliverer, the Lord Jesus
Christ.
