### [2 Chronicles Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 17:0</span></span>

Jehoshaphat promotes religion in Judah, His prosperity.

[2 Chronicles 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 17:1</span></span>

Jehoshaphat found his people generally very ignorant, and therefore
endeavoured to have them well taught. The public teaching of the word of
God forms, in all ages, the great method of promoting the power of
godliness. Thereby the understanding is informed, the conscience is
awakened and directed. We have a particular account of Jehoshaphat's
prosperity. But it was not his formidable army that restrained the
neighbouring nations from attempting any thing against Israel, but the
fear of God which fell upon them, when Jehoshaphat reformed his country,
and set up a preaching ministry in it. The ordinances of God are more
the strength and safety of a kingdom, than soldiers and weapons of war.
The Bible requires use to notice the hand of God in every event, yet
this is little regarded. But let all employ the talents they have: be
faithful, even in that which is little. Set up the worship of God in
your houses. The charge of a family is important. Why should you not
instruct them as Jehoshaphat did his subjects, in the book of the law of
the Lord. But be consistent. Do not recommend one thing, and practise
another. Begin with yourselves. Seek to the Lord God of Israel, then
call upon children and servants to follow your example.
