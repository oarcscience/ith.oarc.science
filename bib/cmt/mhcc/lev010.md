### [Leviticus Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 10:0</span></span>

([Lev 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md), [Lev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002).md) The sin and death of Nadab and
Abihu.

([Lev 10:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003).md) Aaron and his sons
forbidden to mourn for Nadab and Abihu.

([Lev 10:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#008).md) Wine forbidden to the
priests when in the service of the tabernacle.

([Lev 10:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012).md) Of eating the holy
things.

[Leviticus 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 10:1</span></span>

Next to Moses and Aaron, none were more likely to be honourable in
Israel than Nadab and Abihu. There is reason to think that they were
puffed up with pride, and that they were heated with wine. While the
people were prostrate before the Lord, adoring his presence and glory,
they rushed into the tabernacle to burn incense, though not at the
appointed time; both together, instead of one alone, and with fire not
taken from the altar. If it had been done through ignorance, they had
been allowed to bring a sin-offering. But the soul that doeth
presumptuously, and in contempt of God's majesty and justice, that soul
shall be cut off. The wages of sin is death. They died in the very act
of their sin. The sin and punishment of these priests showed the
imperfection of that priesthood from the very beginning, and that it
could not shelter any from the fire of God's wrath, otherwise than as it
was typical of Christ's priesthood.

[Leviticus 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 10:3</span></span>

The most quieting considerations under affliction are fetched from the
word of God. What was it that God spake? Though Aaron's heart must have
been filled with anguish and dismay, yet with silent submission he
revered the justice of the stroke. When God corrects us or ours for sin,
it is our duty to accept the punishment, and say, It is the Lord, let
him do what seemeth him good. Whenever we worship God, we come nigh unto
him, as spiritual priests. This ought to make us very serious in all
acts of devotion. It concerns us all, when we come nigh to God, to do
every religious exercise, as those who believe that the God with whom we
have to do, is a holy God. He will take vengeance on those that profane
his sacred name by trifling with him.

[Leviticus 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 10:8</span></span>

Do not drink wine or strong drink. During the time they ministered, the
priests were forbidden it. It is required of gospel ministers, that they
be not given to wine, [Ti1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md). It is,
Lest ye die; die when ye are in drink. The danger of death, to which we
are continually exposed, should engage all to be sober.

[Leviticus 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 10:12</span></span>

Afflictions should rather quicken us to our duty, than take us from it.
But our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful, will have
great allowances made for it; God will have mercy, and not sacrifice.
Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When
professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal
affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of
will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the
incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which
the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.
