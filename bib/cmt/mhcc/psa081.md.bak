### [Psalms Chapter 81](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 81:0</span></span>

([Psa 81:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001).md) God is praised for what
he has done for his people.

([Psa 81:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008).md) Their obligations to
him.

[Psalms 81:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 81:1</span></span>

All the worship we can render to the Lord is beneath his excellences,
and our obligations to him, especially in our redemption from sin and
wrath. What God had done on Israel's behalf, was kept in remembrance by
public solemnities. To make a deliverance appear more gracious, more
glorious, it is good to observe all that makes the trouble we are
delivered from appear more grievous. We ought never to forget the base
and ruinous drudgery to which Satan, our oppressor, brought us. But
when, in distress of conscience, we are led to cry for deliverance, the
Lord answers our prayers, and sets us at liberty. Convictions of sin,
and trials by affliction, prove his regard to his people. If the Jews,
on their solemn feast-days, were thus to call to mind their redemption
out of Egypt, much more ought we, on the Christian sabbath, to call to
mind a more glorious redemption, wrought out for us by our Lord Jesus
Christ, from worse bondage.

[Psalms 81:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 81:8</span></span>

We cannot look for too little from the creature, nor too much from the
Creator. We may have enough from God, if we pray for it in faith. All
the wickedness of the world is owing to man's wilfulness. People are not
religious, because they will not be so. God is not the Author of their
sin, he leaves them to the lusts of their own hearts, and the counsels
of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must be upon
themselves. The Lord is unwilling that any should perish. What enemies
sinners are to themselves! It is sin that makes our troubles long, and
our salvation slow. Upon the same conditions of faith and obedience, do
Christians hold those spiritual and eternal good things, which the
pleasant fields and fertile hills of Canaan showed forth. Christ is the
Bread of life; he is the Rock of salvation, and his promises are as
honey to pious minds. But those who reject him as their Lord and Master,
must also lose him as their Saviour and their reward.
