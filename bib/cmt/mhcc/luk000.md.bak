[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

This evangelist is generally supposed to have been a physician, and a
companion of the apostle Paul. The style of his writings, and his
acquaintance with the Jewish rites and usages, sufficiently show that he
was a Jew, while his knowledge of the Greek language and his name, speak
his Gentile origin. He is first mentioned [Act
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010.md), [Act
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#011.md), as with Paul at Troas, whence
he attended him to Jerusalem, and was with him in his voyage, and in his
imprisonment at Rome. This Gospel appears to be designed to supersede
many defective and unauthentic narratives in circulation, and to give a
genuine and inspired account of the life, miracles, and doctrines of our
Lord, learned from those who heard and witnessed his discourses and
miracles.
