### [Psalms Chapter 128](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 128:0</span></span>

The blessings of those who fear God.

[Psalms 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 128:1</span></span>

Only those who are truly holy, are truly happy. In vain do we pretend to
be of those that fear God, if we do not make conscience of keeping
stedfastly to his ways. Blessed is every one that fears the Lord;
whether he be high or low, rich or poor in the world. If thou fear him
and walk in his ways, all shall be well with thee while thou livest,
better when thou diest, best of all in eternity. By the blessing of God,
the godly shall get an honest livelihood. Here is a double promise; they
shall have something to do, for an idle life is a miserable,
uncomfortable life, and shall have health and strength, and power of
mind to do it. They shall not be forced to live upon the labours of
other people. It is as much a mercy as a duty, with quietness to work
and eat our own bread. They and theirs shall enjoy what they get. Such
as fear the Lord and walk in his ways, are the only happy persons,
whatever their station in life may be. They shall have abundant comfort
in their family relations. And they shall have all the good things God
has promised, and which they pray for. A good man can have little
comfort in seeing his children's children, unless he sees peace upon
Israel. Every true believer rejoices in the prosperity of the church.
Hereafter we shall see greater things, with the everlasting peace and
rest that remain for the Israel of God.
