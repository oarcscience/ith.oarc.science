### [Deuteronomy Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 13:0</span></span>

([Deu 13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001).md) Enticers to idolatry to
be put to death.

([Deu 13:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006).md) Relations who entice to
idolatry not to be spared.

([Deu 13:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#012).md) Idolatrous cities not
to be spared.

[Deuteronomy 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 13:1</span></span>

Moses had cautioned against the peril that might arise from the
Canaanites. Here he cautions against the rise of idolatry among
themselves. It is needful for us to be well acquainted with the truths
and precepts of the Bible; for we may expect to be proved by temptations
of evil under the appearance of good, of error in the guise of truth;
nor can any thing rightly oppose such temptations, but the plain,
express testimony of God's word to the contrary. And it would be a proof
of sincere affection for God, that, notwithstanding specious pretences,
they should not be wrought upon the forsake God, and follow other gods
to serve them.

[Deuteronomy 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 13:6</span></span>

It is the policy of Satan to try to lead us to evil by those whom we
love, whom we least suspect of any ill design, and whom we are desirous
to please, and apt to conform to. The enticement here is supposed to
come from a brother or child, who are near by nature; from a wife or
friend, who are near by choice, and are to us as our souls. But it is
our duty to prefer God and religion, before the nearest and dearest
friends we have in the world. We must not, to please our friends, break
God's law. Thou shalt not consent to him, nor go with him, not for
company, or curiosity, not to gain his affections. It is a general rule,
If sinners entice thee, consent thou not, [Pro
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010.md). And we must not hinder the
course of God's justice.

[Deuteronomy 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 13:12</span></span>

Here is the case of a city revolting from the God of Israel, and serving
other gods. The crime is supposed to be committed by one of the cities
of Israel. Even when they were ordered to preserve their religion by
force, yet they were not allowed to bring others to it by fire and
sword. Spiritual judgments under the Christian dispensation are more
terrible than the execution of criminals; we have not less cause than
the Israelites had, to fear the Divine wrath. Let us then fear the
spiritual idolatry of covetousness, and the love of worldly pleasure;
and be careful not to countenance them in our families, by our example
or by the education of our children. May the Lord write his law and
truth in our hearts, there set up his throne, and shed abroad his love!
