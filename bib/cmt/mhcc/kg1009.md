### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

([Kg1 9:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001).md) God's answer to Solomon.

([Kg1 9:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010).md) The presents of Solomon
and Hiram.

([Kg1 9:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015).md) Solomon's buildings,
His trade.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 9:1</span></span>

God warned Solomon, now he had newly built and dedicated the temple,
that he and his people might not be high-minded, but fear. After all the
services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lord as
before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would the true
believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened of the
Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 9:10</span></span>

Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities. Hiram did not like them. If Solomon
would gratify him, let it be in his own element, by becoming his partner
in trade, as he did. See how the providence of God suits this earth to
the various tempers of men, and the dispositions of men to the earth,
and all for the good of mankind in general.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 9:15</span></span>

Here is a further account of Solomon's greatness. He began at the right
end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began
his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other
buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the
last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others,
we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of
all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that
which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such
things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet
has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom
is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine
gold, [Pro 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014.md).
