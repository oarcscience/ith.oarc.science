### [2 Chronicles Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 33:0</span></span>

(v. 1-20) Manasseh's and repentance.

([Ch2 33:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#021).md) Amon's wicked reign in
Judah.

[2 Chronicles 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 33:1</span></span>

We have seen Manasseh's wickedness; here we have his repentance, and a
memorable instance it is of the riches of God's pardoning mercy, and the
power of his renewing grace. Deprived of his liberty, separated from his
evil counsellors and companions, without any prospect but of ending his
days in a wretched prison, Manasseh thought upon what had passed; he
began to cry for mercy and deliverance. He confessed his sins, condemned
himself, was humbled before God, loathing himself as a monster of
impiety and wickedness. Yet he hoped to be pardoned through the abundant
mercy of the Lord. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah was God, able to
deliver. He knew him as a God of salvation; he learned to fear, trust
in, love, and obey him. From this time he bore a new character, and
walked in newness of life. Who can tell what tortures of conscience,
what pangs of grief, what fears of wrath, what agonizing remorse he
endured, when he looked back on his many years of apostacy and rebellion
against God; on his having led thousands into sin and perdition; and on
his blood-guiltiness in the persecution of a number of God's children?
And who can complain that the way of heaven is blocked up, when he sees
such a sinner enter? Say the worst against thyself, here is one as bad
who finds the way to repentance. Deny not to thyself that which God hath
not denied to thee; it is not thy sin, but thy impenitence, that bars
heaven against thee.

[2 Chronicles 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 33:21</span></span>

Amon's father did ill, but he did worse. Whatever warnings or
convictions he had, he never humbled himself. He was soon cut off in his
sins, and made a warning for all men not to abuse the example of God's
patience and mercy to Manasseh, as an encouragement to continue in sin.
May God help us to be honest to ourselves, and to think aright
respecting our own character, before death fixes us in an unchangeable
state.
