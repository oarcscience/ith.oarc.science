### [Isaiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 10:0</span></span>

([Isa 10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001).md) Woes against proud
oppressors.

([Isa 10:5-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md) The Assyrian but an
instrument in the hand of God for the punishment of his people.

([Isa 10:20-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020).md) The deliverance from
him.

[Isaiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 10:1</span></span>

These verses are to be joined with the foregoing chapter. Woe to the
superior powers that devise and decree unrighteous decrees! And woe to
the inferior officers that draw them up, and enter them on record! But
what will sinners do? Whither will they flee?

[Isaiah 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 10:5</span></span>

See what a change sin made. The king of Assyria, in his pride, thought
to act by his own will. The tyrants of the world are tools of
Providence. God designs to correct his people for their hypocrisy, and
bring them nearer to him; but is that Sennacherib's design? No; he
designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition. The Assyrian
boasts what great things he has done to other nations, by his own policy
and power. He knows not that it is God who makes him what he is, and
puts the staff into his hand. He had done all this with ease; none moved
the wing, or cried as birds do when their nests are rifled. Because he
conquered Samaria, he thinks Jerusalem would fall of course. It was
lamentable that Jerusalem should have set up graven images, and we
cannot wonder that she was excelled in them by the heathen. But is it
not equally foolish for Christians to emulate the people of the world in
vanities, instead of keeping to things which are their special honour?
For a tool to boast, or to strive against him that formed it, would not
be more out of the way, than for Sennacherib to vaunt himself against
Jehovah. When God brings his people into trouble, it is to bring sin to
their remembrance, and humble them, and to awaken them to a sense of
their duty; this must be the fruit, even the taking away of sin. When
these points are gained by the affliction, it shall be removed in mercy.
This attempt upon Zion and Jerusalem should come to nothing. God will be
as a fire to consume the workers of iniquity, both soul and body. The
desolation should be as when a standard-bearer fainteth, and those who
follow are put to confusion. Who is able to stand before this great and
holy Lord God?

[Isaiah 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 10:20</span></span>

By our afflictions we may learn not to make creatures our confidence.
Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return to him in truth,
not in pretence and profession only. God will justly bring this wasting
away on a provoking people, but will graciously set bounds to it. It is
against the mind and will of God, that his people, whatever happens,
should give way to fear. God's anger against his people is but for a
moment; and when that is turned from us, we need not fear the fury of
man. The rod with which he corrected his people, shall not only be laid
aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourage God's people, the prophet
puts them in mind of what God had formerly done against the enemies of
his church. God's people shall be delivered from the Assyrians. Some
think it looks to the deliverance of the Jews out of their captivity;
and further yet, to the redemption of believers from the tyranny of sin
and Satan. And this, "because of the anointing;" for his people Israel's
sake, the believers among them that had received the unction of Divine
grace. And for the sake of the Messiah, the Anointed of God. Here is,
[Isa 10:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md), a prophetical
description of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when he threatened
to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiah trusted, cut down
his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us apply what is here written,
to like matters in other ages of the church of Christ. Because of the
anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke of every antichrist must be
broken from off his church: and if our souls partake of the unction of
the Holy Spirit, complete and eternal deliverances will be secured to
us.
