### [1 John Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md)

[1 John](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jo1 3:0</span></span>

([Jo1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md), [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md) The apostle admires the love of
God in making believers his children.

([Jo1 3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003).md) The purifying influence
of the hope of seeing Christ, and the danger of pretending to this, and
living in sin.

([Jo1 3:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011).md) Love to the brethren is
the character of real Christians.

([Jo1 3:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016).md) That love described by
its actings.

([Jo1 3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022).md) The advantage of faith,
love, and obedience.

[1 John 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 3:1</span></span>

Little does the world know of the happiness of the real followers of
Christ. Little does the world think that these poor, humble, despised
ones, are favourites of God, and will dwell in heaven. Let the followers
of Christ be content with hard fare here, since they are in a land of
strangers, where their Lord was so badly treated before them. The sons
of God must walk by faith, and live by hope. They may well wait in
faith, hope, and earnest desire, for the revelation of the Lord Jesus.
The sons of God will be known, and be made manifest by likeness to their
Head. They shall be transformed into the same image, by their view of
him.

[1 John 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 3:3</span></span>

The sons of God know that their Lord is of purer eyes than to allow any
thing unholy and impure to dwell with him. It is the hope of hypocrites,
not of the sons of God, that makes allowance for gratifying impure
desires and lusts. May we be followers of him as his dear children, thus
show our sense of his unspeakable mercy, and express that obedient,
grateful, humble mind which becomes us. Sin is the rejecting the Divine
law. In him, that is, in Christ, was no sin. All the sinless weaknesses
that were consequences of the fall, he took; that is, all those
infirmities of mind or body which subject man to suffering, and expose
him to temptation. But our moral infirmities, our proneness to sin, he
had not. He that abides in Christ, continues not in the practice of sin.
Renouncing sin is the great proof of spiritual union with, continuance
in, and saving knowledge of the Lord Christ. Beware of self-deceit. He
that doeth righteousness is righteous, and to be a follower of Christ,
shows an interest by faith in his obedience and sufferings. But a man
cannot act like the devil, and at the same time be a disciple of Christ
Jesus. Let us not serve or indulge what the Son of God came to destroy.
To be born of God is to be inwardly renewed by the power of the Spirit
of God. Renewing grace is an abiding principle. Religion is not an art,
a matter of dexterity and skill, but a new nature. And the regenerate
person cannot sin as he did before he was born of God, and as others do
who are not born again. There is that light in his mind, which shows him
the evil and malignity of sin. There is that bias upon his heart, which
disposes him to loathe and hate sin. There is the spiritual principle
that opposes sinful acts. And there is repentance for sin, if committed.
It goes against him to sin with forethought. The children of God and the
children of the devil have their distinct characters. The seed of the
serpent are known by neglect of religion, and by their hating real
Christians. He only is righteous before God, as a justified believer,
who is taught and disposed to righteousness by the Holy Spirit. In this
the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. May all
professors of the gospel lay these truths to heart, and try themselves
by them.

[1 John 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 3:11</span></span>

We should love the Lord Jesus, value his love, and therefore love all
our brethren in Christ. This love is the special fruit of our faith, and
a certain sign of our being born again. But none who rightly know the
heart of man, can wonder at the contempt and enmity of ungodly people
against the children of God. We know that we are passed from death to
life: we may know it by the evidences of our faith in Christ, of which
love to our brethren is one. It is not zeal for a party in the common
religion, or affection for those who are of the same name and sentiments
with ourselves. The life of grace in the heart of a regenerate person,
is the beginning and first principle of a life of glory, whereof they
must be destitute who hate their brother in their hearts.

[1 John 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 3:16</span></span>

Here is the condescension, the miracle, the mystery of Divine love, that
God would redeem the church with his own blood. Surely we should love
those whom God has loved, and so loved. The Holy Spirit, grieved at
selfishness, will leave the selfish heart without comfort, and full of
darkness and terror. By what can it be known that a man has a true sense
of the love of Christ for perishing sinners, or that the love of God has
been planted in his heart by the Holy Spirit, if the love of the world
and its good overcomes the feelings of compassion to a perishing
brother? Every instance of this selfishness must weaken the evidences of
a man's conversion; when habitual and allowed, it must decide against
him. If conscience condemn us in known sin, or the neglect of known
duty, God does so too. Let conscience therefore be well-informed, be
heard, and diligently attended to.

[1 John 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jo1 3:22</span></span>

When believers had confidence towards God, through the Spirit of
adoption, and by faith in the great High Priest, they might ask what
they would of their reconciled Father. They would receive it, if good
for them. And as good-will to men was proclaimed from heaven, so
good-will to men, particularly to the brethren, must be in the hearts of
those who go to God and heaven. He who thus follows Christ, dwells in
Him as his ark, refuge, and rest, and in the Father through him. This
union between Christ and the souls of believers, is by the Spirit he has
given them. A man may believe that God is gracious before he knows it;
yet when faith has laid hold on the promises, it sets reason to work.
This Spirit of God works a change; in all true Christians it changes
from the power of Satan to the power of God. Consider, believer, how it
changes thy heart. Dost not thou long for peace with God? Wouldst thou
not forego all the world for it? No profit, pleasure, or preferment
shall hinder thee from following Christ. This salvation is built upon
Divine testimony, even the Spirit of God.
