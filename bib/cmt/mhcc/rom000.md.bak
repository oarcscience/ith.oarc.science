The scope or design of the apostle in writing to the Romans appears to
have been, to answer the unbelieving, and to teach the believing Jew; to
confirm the Christian and to convert the idolatrous Gentile; and to show
the Gentile convert as equal with the Jewish, in respect of his
religious condition, and his rank in the Divine favour. These several
designs are brought into on view, by opposing or arguing with the
infidel or unbelieving Jew, in favour of the Christian or believing
Gentile. The way of a sinner's acceptance with God, or justification in
his sight, merely by grace, through faith in the righteousness of
Christ, without distinction of nations, is plainly stated. This doctrine
is cleared from the objections raised by Judaizing Christians, who were
for making terms of acceptance with God by a mixture of the law and the
gospel, and for shutting out the Gentiles from any share in the
blessings of salvation brought in by the Messiah. In the conclusion,
holiness is further enforced by practical exhortations.
