### [Proverbs Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 3:0</span></span>

([Pro 3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001).md) Exhortations to obedience
and faith.

([Pro 3:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007).md) To piety, and to improve
afflictions.

([Pro 3:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013).md) To gain wisdom.

([Pro 3:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021).md) Guidance of Wisdom.

([Pro 3:27-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027).md) The wicked and the
upright.

[Proverbs 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 3:1</span></span>

In the way of believing obedience to God's commandments health and peace
may commonly be enjoyed; and though our days may not be long upon earth,
we shall live for ever in heaven. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee;
God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing: live up to them,
keep up thine interest in them, and take the comfort of them. We must
trust in the Lord with all our hearts, believing he is able and wise to
do what is best. Those who know themselves, find their own
understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail. Do
not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct thee in
every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways that prove
pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge God with
thankfulness. In all our ways that prove uncomfortable, and that are
hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge him with submission. It is
promised, He shall direct thy paths; so that thy way shall be safe and
good, and happy at last.

[Proverbs 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 3:7</span></span>

There is not a greater enemy to the fear of the Lord in the heart, than
self-conceit of our own wisdom. The prudence and sobriety which religion
teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of
the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we
must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have,
shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with
trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us
as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be
it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means
for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves
him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far
from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they
promote their holiness.

[Proverbs 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 3:13</span></span>

No precious jewels or earthly treasures are worthy to be compared with
true wisdom, whether the concerns of time or eternity be considered. We
must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing
to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his
salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for
unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our
ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often
step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom,
by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to
whom he is made of God wisdom. He has wherewithal to make good all his
promises.

[Proverbs 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 3:21</span></span>

Let us not suffer Christ's words to depart from us, but keep sound
wisdom and discretion; then shall we walk safely in his ways. The
natural life, and all that belongs to it, shall be under the protection
of God's providence; the spiritual life, and all its interests, under
the protection of his grace, so that we shall be kept from falling into
sin or trouble.

[Proverbs 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 3:27</span></span>

Our business is to observe the precepts of Christ, and to copy his
example; to do justice, to love mercy, and to beware of covetousness; to
be ready for every good work, avoiding needless strife, and bearing
evils, if possible, rather than seeking redress by law. It will be found
there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors;
far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways.
These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but
everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine
favour is shown to the humble believer.
