### [Malachi Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001.md)

([Mal 1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001).md) The ingratitude of
Israel.

([Mal 1:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006).md) They are careless in
God's institutions.

[Malachi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 1:1</span></span>

All advantages, either as to outward circumstances, or spiritual
privileges, come from the free love of God, who makes one to differ from
another. All the evils sinners feel and fear, are the just recompence of
their crimes, while all their hopes and comforts are from the unmerited
mercy of the Lord. He chose his people that they might be holy. If we
love him, it is because he has first loved us; yet we all are prone to
undervalue the mercies of God, and to excuse our own offences.

[Malachi 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 1:6</span></span>

We may each charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon the priests.
Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to
fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided
reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions.
Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on
them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect
say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in
what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of
the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they
grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to
their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding,
we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are
cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily
exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we
suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the
torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a
great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of
our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter
of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right
manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse
our slothfulness and niggardliness, in our returns of duty to God. A
spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to
God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure
offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped
the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even
this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the
past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing
mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver,
devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men
now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute
his table, and show contempt for his worship.
