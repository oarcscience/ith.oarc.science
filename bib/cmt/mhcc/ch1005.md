[1 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 5:1</span></span>

This chapter gives some account of the two tribes and a half seated on
the east side of Jordan. They were made captives by the king of Assyria,
because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded
concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that
people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the
common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon
him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not
considering that it lay most exposed. The desire of earthly objects
draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and prepares men for
destruction.
