### [Amos Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 6:0</span></span>

([Amo 6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001).md) The danger of luxury and
false security.

([Amo 6:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008).md) Punishments of sins.

[Amos 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 6:1</span></span>

Those are looked upon as doing well for themselves, who do well for
their bodies; but we are here told what their ease is, and what their
woe is. Here is a description of the pride, security, and sensuality,
for which God would reckon. Careless sinners are every where in danger;
but those at ease in Zion, who are stupid, vainly confident, and abusing
their privileges, are in the greatest danger. Yet many fancy themselves
the people of God, who are living in sin, and in conformity to the
world. But the examples of others' ruin forbid us to be secure. Those
who are set upon their pleasures are commonly careless of the troubles
of others, but this is great offence to God. Those who placed their
happiness in the pleasures of sense, and set their hearts upon them,
shall be deprived of those pleasures. Those who try to put the evil day
far from them, find it nearest to them.

[Amos 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 6:8</span></span>

How dreadful, how miserable, is the case of those whose eternal ruin the
Lord himself has sworn; for he can execute his purpose, and none can
alter it! Those hearts are wretchedly hardened that will not be brought
to mention God's name, and to worship him, when the hand of God is gone
out against them, when sickness and death are in their families. Those
that will not be tilled as fields, shall be abandoned as rocks. When our
services of God are soured with sin, his providences will justly be made
bitter to us. Men should take warning not to harden their hearts, for
those who walk in pride, God will destroy.
