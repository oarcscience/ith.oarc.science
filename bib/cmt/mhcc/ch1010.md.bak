### [1 Chronicles Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 10:0</span></span>

The death of Saul.

[1 Chronicles 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 10:1</span></span>

The design chiefly in view in these books of the Chronicles, appears to
be to preserve the records of the house of David. Therefore the writer
repeats not the history of Saul's reign, but only of his death, by which
a way was made for David to the throne. And from the ruin of Saul, we
may learn, 1. That the sin of sinners will certainly find them out,
sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man's
greatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3. Disobedience is a
killing thing. Saul died for not keeping the word of the Lord. May be
delivered from unbelief, impatience, and despair. By waiting on the Lord
we shall obtain a kingdom that cannot be moved.
