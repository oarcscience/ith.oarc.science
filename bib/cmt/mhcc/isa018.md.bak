### [Isaiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 18:0</span></span>

God's care for his people; and the increase of the church.

[Isaiah 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 18:1</span></span>

This chapter is one of the most obscure in Scripture, though more of it
probably was understood by those for whose use it was first intended,
than by us now. Swift messengers are sent by water to a nation marked by
Providence, and measured out, trodden under foot. God's people are
trampled on; but whoever thinks to swallow them up, finds they are cast
down, yet not deserted, not destroyed. All the dwellers on earth must
watch the motions of the Divine Providence, and wait upon the directions
of the Divine will. God gives assurance to his prophet, and by him to be
given to his people. Zion is his rest for ever, and he will look after
it. He will suit to their case the comforts and refreshments he provides
for them; they will be acceptable, because seasonable. He will reckon
with his and their enemies; and as God's people are protected at all
seasons of the year, so their enemies are exposed at all seasons. A
tribute of praise should be brought to God from all this. What is
offered to God, must be offered in the way he has appointed; and we may
expect him to meet us where he records his name. Thus shall the nations
of the earth be convinced that Jehovah is the God, and Israel is his
people, and shall unite in presenting spiritual sacrifices to his glory.
Happy are those who take warning by his judgment on others, and hasten
to join him and his people. Whatever land or people may be intended, we
are here taught not to think that God takes no care of his church, and
has no respect to the affairs of men, because he permits the wicked to
triumph for a season. He has wise reasons for so doing, which we cannot
now understand, but which will appear at the great day of his coming,
when he will bring every work into judgment, and reward every man
according to his works.
