The Vision of the Temple.

[Ezekiel 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 40:1</span></span>

Here is a vision, beginning at ch. 40, and continued to the end of the
book, ch. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the most
difficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to be
satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our
salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain
enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This
chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the
personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not
clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must
look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the
midst of the earth, [Psa 74:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012.md), to be
looked unto from all quarters.
