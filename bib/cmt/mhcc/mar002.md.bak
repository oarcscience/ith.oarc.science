### [Mark Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 2:0</span></span>

([Mar 2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001).md) Christ heals one sick of
the palsy.

([Mar 2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#013).md) Levi's call, and the
entertainment given to Jesus.

([Mar 2:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018).md) Why Christ's disciples
did not fast.

([Mar 2:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023).md) He justifies his
disciples for plucking corn on the sabbath.

[Mark 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 2:1</span></span>

It was this man's misery that he needed to be so carried, and shows the
suffering state of human life; it was kind of those who so carried him,
and teaches the compassion that should be in men, toward their
fellow-creatures in distress. True faith and strong faith may work in
various ways; but it shall be accepted and approved by Jesus Christ. Sin
is the cause of all our pains and sicknesses. The way to remove the
effect, is to take away the cause. Pardon of sin strikes at the root of
all diseases. Christ proved his power to forgive sin, by showing his
power to cure the man sick of the palsy. And his curing diseases was a
figure of his pardoning sin, for sin is the disease of the soul; when it
is pardoned, it is healed. When we see what Christ does in healing
souls, we must own that we never saw the like. Most men think themselves
whole; they feel no need of a physician, therefore despise or neglect
Christ and his gospel. But the convinced, humbled sinner, who despairs
of all help, excepting from the Saviour, will show his faith by applying
to him without delay.

[Mark 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 2:13</span></span>

Matthew was not a good character, or else, being a Jew, he would never
have been a publican, that is, a tax-gatherer for the Romans. However,
Christ called this publican to follow him. With God, through Christ,
there is mercy to pardon the greatest sins, and grace to change the
greatest sinners, and make them holy. A faithful, fair-dealing publican
was rare. And because the Jews had a particular hatred to an office
which proved that they were subject to the Romans, they gave these
tax-gatherers an ill name. But such as these our blessed Lord did not
hesitate to converse with, when he appeared in the likeness of sinful
flesh. And it is no new thing for that which is both well done and well
designed, to be slandered, and turned to the reproach of the wisest and
best of men. Christ would not withdraw, though the Pharisees were
offended. If the world had been righteous, there had been no occasion
for his coming, either to preach repentance, or to purchase forgiveness.
We must not keep company with ungodly men out of love to their vain
conversation; but we are to show love to their souls, remembering that
our good Physician had the power of healing in himself, and was in no
danger of taking the disease; but it is not so with us. In trying to do
good to others, let us be careful we do not get harm to ourselves.

[Mark 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 2:18</span></span>

Strict professors are apt to blame all that do not fully come up to
their own views. Christ did not escape slanders; we should be willing to
bear them, as well as careful not to deserve them; but should attend to
every part of our duty in its proper order and season.

[Mark 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 2:23</span></span>

The sabbath is a sacred and Divine institution; a privilege and benefit,
not a task and drudgery. God never designed it to be a burden to us,
therefore we must not make it so to ourselves. The sabbath was
instituted for the good of mankind, as living in society, having many
wants and troubles, preparing for a state of happiness or misery. Man
was not made for the sabbath, as if his keeping it could be of service
to God, nor was he commanded to keep it outward observances to his real
hurt. Every observance respecting it, is to be interpreted by the rule
of mercy.
