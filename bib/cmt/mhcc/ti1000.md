### [1 Timothy Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti1 0:0</span></span>

The design of the epistle appears to be, that Timothy having been left
at Ephesus, St. Paul wrote to instruct him in the choice of proper
officers in the church, as well as in the exercise of a regular
ministry. Also, to caution against the influence of false teachers, who
by subtle distinctions and endless disputes, corrupted the purity and
simplicity of the gospel. He presses upon him constant regard to the
greatest diligence, faithfulness, and zeal. These subjects occupy the
first four chapters; the fifth chapter instructs respecting particular
classes; in the latter part, controversies and disputes are condemned,
the love of money blamed, and the rich exhorted to good works.
