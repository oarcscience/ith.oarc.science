### [Joshua Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

([Jos 1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)) The Lord appoints Joshua
to succeed Moses.

([Jos 1:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)) God promises to assist
Joshua.

([Jos 1:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010)) Preparation to pass
over Jordan.

([Jos 1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#016)) The people promise to
obey Joshua.

[Joshua 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 1:1</span></span>

Joshua had attended upon Moses. He who was called to honour, had been
long used to business. Our Lord Jesus took upon him the form of a
servant. Joshua was trained up under command. Those are fittest to rule,
who have learned to obey. The removal of useful men should quicken
survivors to be the more diligent in doing good. Arise, go over Jordan.
At this place and at this time the banks were overflowed. Joshua had no
bridge or boats, and yet he must believe that God, having ordered the
people over, would open a way.

[Joshua 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 1:5</span></span>

Joshua is to make the law of God his rule. He is charged to meditate
therein day and night, that he might understand it. Whatever affairs of
this world we have to mind, we must not neglect the one thing needful.
All his orders to the people, and his judgments, must be according to
the law of God. Joshua must himself be under command; no man's dignity
or dominion sets him above the law of God. He is to encourage himself
with the promise and presence of God. Let not the sense of thine own
infirmities dishearten thee; God is all-sufficient. I have commanded,
called, and commissioned thee to do it, and will be sure to bear thee
out in it. When we are in the way of duty, we have reason to be strong
and very bold. Our Lord Jesus, as Joshua here, was borne up under his
sufferings by a regard to the will of God, and the commandment from his
Father.

[Joshua 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 1:10</span></span>

Joshua says to the people, Ye shall pass over Jordan, and shall possess
the land; because God had said so to him. We honour the truth of God,
when we stagger not at the promise of God. The two tribes and a half
were to go over Jordan with their brethren. When God, by his providence,
has given us rest, we ought to consider what service we may do to our
brethren.

[Joshua 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 1:16</span></span>

The people of Israel engage to obey Joshua; All that thou commandest us
to do we will readily do, without murmuring or disputing, and
whithersoever thou sendest us we will go. The best we can ask of God for
our magistrates, is, that they may have the presence of God; that will
make them blessings to us, so that in seeking this for them, we consult
our own interest. May we be enabled to enlist under the banner of the
Captain of our salvation, to be obedient to his commands, and to fight
the good fight of faith, with all that trust in and love his name,
against all who oppose his authority; for whoever refuses to obey him
must be destroyed.
