### [Numbers Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 15:1</span></span>

Full instructions are given about the meat-offerings and
drink-offerings. The beginning of this law is very encouraging, When ye
come into the land of your habitation which I give unto you. This was a
plain intimation that God would secure the promised land to their seed.
It was requisite, since the sacrifices of acknowledgment were intended
as the food of God's table, that there should be a constant supply of
bread, oil, and wine, whatever the flesh-meat was. And the intent of
this law is to direct the proportions of the meat-offering and
drink-offering. Natives and strangers are placed on a level in this as
in other like matters. It was a happy forewarning of the calling of the
Gentiles, and of their admission into the church. If the law made so
little difference between Jew and Gentile, much less would the gospel,
which broke down the partition-wall, and reconciled both to God.

[Numbers 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 15:22</span></span>

Though ignorance will in a degree excuse, it will not justify those who
might have known their Lord's will, yet did it not. David prayed to be
cleansed from his secret faults, those sins which he himself was not
aware of. Sins committed ignorantly, shall be forgiven through Christ
the great Sacrifice, who, when he offered up himself once for all upon
the cross, seemed to explain one part of the intention of his offering,
in that prayer, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. It
looked favourably upon the Gentiles, that this law of atoning for sins
of ignorance, is expressly made to extend to those who were strangers to
Israel.

[Numbers 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 15:30</span></span>

Those are to be reckoned presumptuous sinners, who sin designedly
against God's will and glory. Sins thus committed are exceedingly
sinful. He that thus breaks the commandment reproaches the Lord. He also
despises the word of the Lord. Presumptuous sinners despise it, thinking
themselves too great, too good, and too wise, to be ruled by it. A
particular instance of presumption in the sin of sabbath-breaking is
related. The offence was gathering sticks on the sabbath day, to make a
fire, whereas the people were to bake and seethe what they had occasion
for, the day before, [Exo 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023.md). This
was done as an affront both to the law and to the Lawgiver. God is
jealous for the honour of his sabbaths, and will not hold him guiltless
who profanes them, whatever men may do. God intended this punishment for
a warning to all, to make conscience of keeping holy the sabbath. And we
may be assured that no command was ever given for the punishment of sin,
which, at the judgment day, shall not prove to have come from perfect
love and justice. The right of God to a day of devotion to himself, will
be disputed and denied only by such as listen to the pride and unbelief
of their hearts, rather than to the teaching of the Spirit of truth and
life. Wherein consists the difference between him who was detected
gathering sticks in the wilderness on the day of God, and the man who
turns his back upon the blessings of sabbath appointments, and the
promises of sabbath mercies, to use his time, his cares, and his soul,
in heaping up riches; and waste his hours, his property, and his
strength in sinful pleasure? Wealth may come by the unhallowed effort,
but it will not come alone; it will have its awful reward. Sinful
pursuits lead to ruin.

[Numbers 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">num 15:37</span></span>

The people are ordered by the Lord to make fringes on the borders of
their garments. The Jews were distinguished from their neighbours in
their dress, as well as in their diet, and thus taught not to be
conformed to the way of the heathen in other things. They proclaimed
themselves Jews wherever they were, as not ashamed of God and his law.
The fringes were not appointed for trimming and adorning their clothes,
but to stir up their minds by way of remembrance, [Pe2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md). If they were tempted to sin, the
fringe would warn them not to break God's commandments. We should use
every means of refreshing our memories with the truths and precepts of
God's word, to strengthen and quicken our obedience, and arm our minds
against temptation. Be holy unto your God; cleansed from sin, and
sincerely devoted to his service; and that great reason for all the
commandments is again and again repeated, "I am the Lord your God."
