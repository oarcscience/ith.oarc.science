### [Jeremiah Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 48:0</span></span>

([Jer 48:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001)) Prophecies against Moab
for pride and security.

(v. 14-47) For carnal confidence and contempt of God.

[Jeremiah 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 48:1</span></span>

The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should be thankful that we
are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, and the salvation of
their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall be the more without
excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. The cities shall be laid
in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. There will be great sorrow.
There will be great hurry. If any could give wings to sinners, still
they could not fly out of the reach of Divine indignation. There are
many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yet long enjoy outward
prosperity. They had been long corrupt and unreformed, secure and
sensual in prosperity. They have no changes of their peace and
prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives are unchanged, [Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019).

[Jeremiah 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 48:14</span></span>

The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awaken them by
national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, or by a
personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In reading this
long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will be of
more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and the terror
of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holy awe of
God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures and
expressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapter
ends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latter days.
Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth.
The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captives of the
Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought back by
Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.
