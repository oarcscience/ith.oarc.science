### [Zechariah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 12:0</span></span>

([Zac 12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001).md) Punishment of the
enemies of Judah.

([Zac 12:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009).md) Repentance and sorrow
of the Jews.

[Zechariah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 12:1</span></span>

Here is a Divine prediction, which will be a heavy burden to all the
enemies of the church. But it is for Israel; for their comfort and
benefit. It is promised that God will make foolish the counsels, and
weaken the courage of the enemies of the church. The exact meaning is
not clear; but God often begins by calling the poor and despised; and in
that day even the feeblest will resemble David, and be as eminent in
courage and every thing good. Desirable indeed is it that the examples
and labours of Christians should render them as fire among wood, as a
torch in a sheaf, to kindle the flame of Divine love, to spread religion
on the right hand and on the left.

[Zechariah 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 12:9</span></span>

The day here spoken of, is the day of Jerusalem's defence and
deliverance, that glorious day when God will appear for the salvation of
his people. In Christ's first coming he bruised the serpent's head, and
broke all the powers of darkness that fought against God's kingdom among
men. In his second coming he will complete their destruction, when he
shall put down all opposing rule, principality, and power; and death
itself shall be swallowed up in that victory. The Holy Spirit is
gracious and merciful, and is the Author of all grace or holiness. He,
also, is the Spirit of supplications, and shows men their ignorance,
want, guilt, misery, and danger. At the time here foretold, the Jews
will know who the crucified Jesus was; then they shall look by faith to
him, and mourn with the deepest sorrow, not only in public, but in
private, even each one separately. There is a holy mourning, the effect
of the pouring out of the Spirit; a mourning for sin, which quickens
faith in Christ, and qualifies for joy in God. This mourning is a fruit
of the Spirit of grace, a proof of a work of grace in the soul, and of
the Spirit of supplications. It is fulfilled in all who sorrow for sin
after a godly sort; they look to Christ crucified, and mourn for him.
Looking by faith upon the cross of Christ will cause us to mourn for sin
after a godly sort.
