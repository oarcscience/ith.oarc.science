### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

([Sa2 16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001).md) Ziba's falsehood.

([Sa2 16:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005).md) David cursed by Shimei.

([Sa2 16:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#015).md) Ahithophel's counsel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001.md)

Ziba belied Mephibosheth. Great men ought always to be jealous of
flatterers, and to be careful that they hear both sides.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 16:5</span></span>

David bore Shimei's curses much better than Ziba's flatteries; by these
he was brought to pass a wrong judgment on another, by those to pass a
right judgment on himself: the world's smiles are more dangerous than
its frowns. Once and again David spared Saul's life, while Saul sought
his. But innocence is no defence against malice and falsehood; nor are
we to think it strange, if we are charged with that which we have been
most careful to keep ourselves from. It is well for us, that men are not
to be our judges, but He whose judgment is according to truth. See how
patient David was under this abuse. Let this remind us of Christ, who
prayed for those who reviled and crucified him. A humble spirit will
turn reproaches into reproofs, and get good from them, instead of being
provoked by them. David the hand of God in it, and comforts himself that
God would bring good out of his affliction. We may depend upon God to
repay, not only our services, but our sufferings.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 16:15</span></span>

The wisest counsellors of that age were Ahithophel and Hushai: Absalom
thinks himself sure of success, when he has both; on them he relies, and
consults not the ark, though he had that with him. But miserable
counsellors were they both. Hushai would never counsel him to do wisely.
Ahithophel counselled him to do wickedly; and so did as effectually
betray him, as he did, who was designedly false to him: for they that
advise men to sin, certainly advise them to their hurt. After all,
honesty is the best policy, and will be found so in the long run.
Ahithophel gave wicked counsel to Absalom; to render himself so hateful
to his father, that he would never be reconciled to him; this cursed
policy was of the devil. How desperately wicked is the human heart!
