### [1 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 27:0</span></span>

([Ch1 27:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001)) David's military force.

(v. 16-34) Princes and officers.

[1 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 27:1</span></span>

In the kingdoms of this world readiness for war forms a security for
peace; in like manner, nothing so much encourages Satan's assaults as to
be unwatchful. So long as we stand armed with the whole armour of God,
in the exercise of faith, and preparation of heart for the conflict, we
shall certainly be safe, and probably enjoy inward peace.

[1 Chronicles 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 27:16</span></span>

The officers of the court, or the rulers of the king's substance, had
the oversight and charge of the king's tillage, his vineyards, his
herds, his flocks, which formed the wealth of eastern kings. Much of the
wisdom of princes is seen in the choice of their ministry, and common
persons show it in the choice of their advisers. David, though he had
all these about him, preferred the word of God before them all. Thy
testimonies are my delight and my counsellors.
