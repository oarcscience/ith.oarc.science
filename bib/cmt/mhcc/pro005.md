[Proverbs 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 5:1</span></span>

Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain from fleshly
lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false
doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the
direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these
have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship
of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how
bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments
of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body
and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step
towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's
way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray,
Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It
blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is
destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou
art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced
sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the
frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a
miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences
of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived.
What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal
world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!

[Proverbs 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 5:15</span></span>

Lawful marriage is a means God has appointed to keep from these
destructive vices. But we are not properly united, except as we attend
to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with
affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of
our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord,
who not only sees, but ponders all his goings. Those who are so foolish
as to choose the way of sin, are justly left of God to themselves, to go
on in the way to destruction.
