### [Psalms Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 53:0</span></span>

The corruption of man by nature.

[Psalms 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 53:1</span></span>

This psalm is almost the same as the [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md). The scope of it is to convince
us of our sins. God, by the psalmist, here shows us how bad we are, and
proves this by his own certain knowledge. He speaks terror to
persecutors, the worst of sinners. He speaks encouragement to God's
persecuted people. How comes it that men are so bad? Because there is no
fear of God before their eyes. Men's bad practices flow from their bad
principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, because in
thoughts, they deny him. See the folly of sin; he is a fool, in the
account of God, whose judgment we are sure is right, that harbours such
corrupt thoughts. And see the fruit of sin; to what it brings men, when
their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. See also the
faith of the saints, and their hope and power as to the cure of this
great evil. There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation
from sin. God will save his church from its enemies. He will save all
believers from their own sins, that they may not be led captive by them,
which will be everlasting joy to them. From this work the Redeemer had
his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins, [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md).
