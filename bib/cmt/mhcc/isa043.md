### [Isaiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 43:0</span></span>

([Isa 43:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md) God's unchangeable love
for his people.

([Isa 43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008).md) Apostates and idolaters
addressed.

([Isa 43:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014).md) The deliverance from
Babylon, and the conversion of the Gentiles.

([Isa 43:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022).md) Admonition to repent
of sin.

[Isaiah 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 43:1</span></span>

God's favour and good-will to his people speak abundant comfort to all
believers. The new creature, wherever it is, is of God's forming. All
who are redeemed with the blood of his Son, he has set apart for
himself. Those that have God for them need not fear who or what can be
against them. What are Egypt and Ethiopia, all their lives and
treasures, compared with the blood of Christ? True believers are
precious in God's sight, his delight is in them, above any people.
Though they went as through fire and water, yet, while they had God with
them, they need fear no evil; they should be born up, and brought out.
The faithful are encouraged. They were to be assembled from every
quarter. And with this pleasing object in view, the prophet again
dissuades from anxious fears.

[Isaiah 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 43:8</span></span>

Idolaters are called to appear in defence of their idols. Those who make
them, and trust in them, are like unto them. They have the shape and
faculties of men; but they have not common sense. But God's people know
the power of his grace, the sweetness of his comforts, the kind care of
his providence, and the truth of his promise. All servants of God can
give such an account of what he has wrought in them, and done for them,
as may lead others to know and believe his power, truth, and love.

[Isaiah 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 43:14</span></span>

The deliverance from Babylon is foretold, but there is reference to
greater events. The redemption of sinners by Christ, the conversion of
the Gentiles, and the recall of the Jews, are described. All that is to
be done to rescue sinners, and to bring the believer to glory, is
little, compared with that wondrous work of love, the redemption of man.

[Isaiah 43:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 43:22</span></span>

Those who neglect to call upon God, are weary of him. The Master tired
not the servants with his commands, but they tired him with
disobedience. What were the riches of God's mercy toward them? I, even
I, am he who yet blotteth out thy transgressions. This encourages us to
repent, because there is forgiveness with God, and shows the freeness of
Divine mercy. When God forgives, he forgets. It is not for any thing in
us, but for his mercies' sake, his promise' sake; especially for his
Son's sake. He is pleased to reckon it his honour. Would man justify
himself before God? The attempt is desperate: our first father broke the
covenant, and we all have copied his example. We have no reason to
expect pardon, except we seek it by faith in Christ; and that is always
attended by true repentance, and followed by newness of life, by hatred
of sin, and love to God. Let us then put him in remembrance of the
promises he has made to the penitent, and the satisfaction his Son has
made for them. Plead these with him in wrestling for pardon; and declare
these things, that thou mayest be justified freely by his grace. This is
the only way, and it is a sure way to peace.
