[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

This epistle shows Christ as the end, foundation, body, and truth of the
figures of the law, which of themselves were no virtue for the soul. The
great truth set forth in this epistle is that Jesus of Nazareth is the
true God. The unconverted Jews used many arguments to draw their
converted brethren from the Christian faith. They represented the law of
Moses as superior to the Christian dispensation, and spoke against every
thing connected with the Saviour. The apostle, therefore, shows the
superiority of Jesus of Nazareth, as the Son of God, and the benefits
from his sufferings and death as the sacrifice for sin, so that the
Christian religion is much more excellent and perfect than that of
Moses. And the principal design seems to be, to bring the converted
Hebrews forward in the knowledge of the gospel, and thus to establish
them in the Christian faith, and to prevent their turning from it,
against which they are earnestly warned. But while it contains many
things suitable to the Hebrews of early times, it also contains many
which can never cease to interest the church of God; for the knowledge
of Jesus Christ is the very marrow and kernel of all the Scriptures. The
ceremonial law is full of Christ, and all the gospel is full of Christ;
the blessed lines of both Testaments meet in Him; and how they both
agree and sweetly unite in Jesus Christ, is the chief object of the
epistle to the Hebrews to discover.
