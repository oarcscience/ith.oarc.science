### [Psalms Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 7:0</span></span>

([Psa 7:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001).md) The psalmist prays to God
to plead his cause, and judge for him.

([Psa 7:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010).md) He expresses confidence
in God, and will give him the glory of his deliverance.

[Psalms 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 7:1</span></span>

David flees to God for succour. But Christ alone could call on Heaven to
attest his uprightness in all things. All His works were wrought in
righteousness; and the prince of this world found nothing whereof justly
to accuse him. Yet for our sakes, submitting to be charged as guilty, he
suffered all evils, but, being innocent, he triumphed over them all. The
plea is, "For the righteous God trieth the hearts and the reins." He
knows the secret wickedness of the wicked, and how to bring it to an
end; he is witness to the secret sincerity of the just, and has ways of
establishing it. When a man has made peace with God about all his sins,
upon the terms of grace and mercy, through the sacrifice of the
Mediator, he may, in comparison with his enemies, appeal to God's
justice to decide.

[Psalms 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 7:10</span></span>

David is confident that he shall find God his powerful Saviour. The
destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is
threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be
his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer
of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to
repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to
us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described,
[Psa 7:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014.md), as taking more pains to
ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in
a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our
trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of
tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by
thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our
lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds
and comfort our hearts.
