### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 23:0</span></span>

([Sa1 23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001).md) David rescues Keilah.

([Sa1 23:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#007).md) God warns him to escape
from Keilah.

([Sa1 23:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014).md) Jonathan comforts
David.

([Sa1 23:19-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019).md) He is rescued from
Saul by an invasion of the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 23:1</span></span>

When princes persecute God's people, let them expect vexation on all
sides. The way for any country to be quiet, is to let God's church be
quiet in it: if Saul fight against David, the Philistines fight against
his country. David considered himself the protector of the land. Thus
did the Saviour Jesus, and left us an example. Those are unlike David,
who sullenly decline to do good, if they are not rewarded for services.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 23:7</span></span>

Well might David complain of his enemies, that they rewarded him evil
for good, and that for his love they were his adversaries. Christ was
used thus basely. David applied to his great Protector for direction. No
sooner was the ephod brought him than he made use of it. We have the
Scriptures in our hands, let us take advice from them in doubtful cases.
Say, Bring hither the Bible. David's address to God is very solemn, also
very particular. God allows us to be so in our addresses to him; Lord,
direct me in this matter, about which I am now at a loss. God knows not
only what will be, but what would be, if it were not hindered; therefore
he knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and how to render
to every man according to his works.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 23:14</span></span>

David made no attempt against Saul; he kept God's way, waited God's
time, and was content to secure himself in woods and wildernesses. Let
it make us think the worse of this world, which often gives such bad
treatment to its best men: let it make us long for that kingdom where
goodness shall for ever be in glory, and holiness in honour. We find
Jonathan comforting David. As a pious friend, he directed him to God,
the Foundation of his comfort. As a self-denying friend, he takes
pleasure in the prospect of David's advancement to the throne. As a
constant friend, he renewed his friendship with him. Our covenant with
God should be often renewed, and therein our communion with him kept up.
If the converse of one friend, at one meeting, gives comfort and
strengthens our hearts, what may not be expected from the continual
supports and powerful love of the Saviour of sinners, the covenanted
Friend of believers!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 23:19</span></span>

In the midst of his wickedness, Saul affected to speak the language of
piety. Such expressions, without suitable effects, can only amuse or
deceive those who hear, and those who use them. This mountain was an
emblem of the Divine Providence coming between David and the destroyer.
Let us not be dismayed at the prospect of future difficulties, but stay
ourselves upon Him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working.
Sooner than his promise shall fail, he will commission Philistines to
effect our escape, at the very moment when our case appears most
desperate. God requires entire dependence on him, If ye will not
believe, surely ye shall not be established, [Isa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009.md).
