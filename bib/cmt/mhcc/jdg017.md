### [Judges Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 17:0</span></span>

([Jdg 17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001)) The beginning of
idolatry in Israel, Micah and his mother.

([Jdg 17:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#007)) Micah hires a Levite to
be his priest.

[Judges 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 17:1</span></span>

What is related in this, and the rest of the chapters to the end of this
book, was done soon after the death of Joshua: see chap. [Jdg
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028). That it might appear how happy
the nation was under the Judges, here is showed how unhappy they were
when there was no Judge. The love of money made Micah so undutiful to
his mother as to rob her, and made her so unkind to her son, as to curse
him. Outward losses drive good people to their prayers, but bad people
to their curses. This woman's silver was her god, before it was made
into a graven or a molten image. Micah and his mother agreed to turn
their money into a god, and set up idol worship in their family. See the
cause of this corruption. Every man did that which was right in his own
eyes, and then they soon did that which was evil in the sight of the
Lord.

[Judges 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 17:7</span></span>

Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that
a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with
their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their
hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think
that God is pleased with them.
