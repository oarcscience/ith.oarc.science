### [Genesis Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 43:0</span></span>

([Gen 43:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#001).md) Jacob is persuaded to
send Benjamin into Egypt.

([Gen 43:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#015).md) Joseph's reception of

for his brethren.

[Genesis 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 43:1</span></span>

Jacob urges his sons to go and buy a little food; now, in time of
dearth, a little must suffice. Judah urges that Benjamin should go with
them. It is not against the honour and duty children owe their parents,
humbly to advise them, and when needful, to reason with them. Jacob saw
the necessity of the case, and yielded. His prudence and justice
appeared in three things. 1. He sent back the money they had found in
the sack. Honesty obliges us to restore not only that which comes to us
by our own fault, but that which comes to us by the mistakes of others.
Though we get it by oversight, if we keep it when the oversight is
discovered, it is kept by deceit. 2. He sent as much again as they took
the time before; the price of corn might be risen, or they might have to
pay a ransom for Simeon. 3. He sent a present of such things as the land
afforded, and as were scarce in Egypt, balm, and honey, etc. Providence
dispenses not its gifts to all alike. But honey and spice will never
make up the want of bread-corn. The famine was sore in Canaan, yet they
had balm and myrrh, etc. We may live well enough upon plain food,
without dainties; but we cannot live upon dainties without plain food.
Let us thank God that what is most needful and useful, generally is most
cheap and common. Though men value very highly their gold and silver,
and the luxuries which are counted the best fruits of every land, yet in
a time of famine they willingly barter them for bread. And how little
will earthly good things stand us in stead in the day of wrath! How
ready should we be to renounce them all, as loss, for the excellency of
the knowledge of Jesus Christ! Our way to prevail with man is by first
prevailing with the Lord in fervent prayer. But, Thy will be done,
should close every petition for the mercies of this life, or against the
afflictions of this life.

[Genesis 43:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 43:15</span></span>

Jacob's sons went down the second time into Egypt to buy corn. If we
should ever know what a famine of the word means, let us not think it
much to travel as far for spiritual food, as they did for bodily food.
Joseph's steward had orders from his master to take them to his house.
Even this frightened them. Those that are guilty make the worst of every
thing. But the steward encouraged them. It appears, from what he said,
that by his good master he was brought to the knowledge of the true God,
the God of the Hebrews. Religious servants should take all fit occasions
to speak of God and his providence, with reverence and seriousness.

[Genesis 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 43:26</span></span>

Observe the great respect Joseph's brethren paid to him. Thus were
Joseph's dreams more and more fulfilled. Joseph showed great kindness to
them. He treated them nobly; but see here the early distance between
Jews and gentiles. In a day of famine, it is enough to be fed; but they
were feasted. Their cares and fears were now over, and they ate their
bread with joy, reckoning they were upon good terms with the lord of the
land. If God accept our works, our present, we have reason to be
cheerful. Joseph showed special regard for Benjamin, that he might try
whether his brethren would envy him. It must be our rule, to be content
with what we have, and not to grieve at what others have. Thus Jesus
shows those whom he loves, more and more of their need. He makes them
see that he is their only refuge from destruction. He overcomes their
unwillingness, and brings them to himself. Then, as he sees good, he
gives them some taste of his love, and welcomes them to the provisions
of his house, as an earnest of what he further intends for them.
