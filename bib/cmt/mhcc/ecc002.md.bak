### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 2:0</span></span>

([Ecc 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001).md) The vanity and vexation
of mirth, sensual pleasure, riches, and pomp.

([Ecc 2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012).md) Human wisdom
insufficient.

([Ecc 2:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018).md) This world to be used
according to the will of God.

[Ecclesiastes 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 2:1</span></span>

Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy,
flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's
hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one
thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever.
Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the
costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a
description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all
such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was
vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same
result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith
be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with
great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with
better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before.
Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is
only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.

[Ecclesiastes 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 2:12</span></span>

Solomon found that knowledge and prudence were preferable to ignorance
and folly, though human wisdom and knowledge will not make a man happy.
The most learned of men, who dies a stranger to Christ Jesus, will
perish equally with the most ignorant; and what good can commendations
on earth do to the body in the grave, or the soul in hell? And the
spirits of just men made perfect cannot want them. So that if this were
all, we might be led to hate our life, as it is all vanity and vexation
of spirit.

[Ecclesiastes 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 2:18</span></span>

Our hearts are very loth to quit their expectations of great things from
the creature; but Solomon came to this at length. The world is a vale of
tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who
make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better
than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this
respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to
his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must
use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business.
And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man,
according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To
those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in
the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour,
sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet
afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider
his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the
blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment
even of this present world.
