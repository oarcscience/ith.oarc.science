### [Psalms Chapter 138](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 138:0</span></span>

([Psa 138:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001)) The psalmist praises
God for answering prayer.

([Psa 138:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006)) The Lord's dealing with
the humble and the proud.

[Psalms 138:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 138:1</span></span>

When we can praise God with our whole heart, we need not be unwilling
for the whole world to witness our gratitude and joy in him. Those who
rely on his loving-kindness and truth through Jesus Christ, will ever
find him faithful to his word. If he spared not his own Son, how shall
he not with him freely give us all things? If God gives us strength in
our souls, to bear the burdens, resist the temptations, and to do the
duties of an afflicted state, if he strengthens us to keep hold of
himself by faith, and to wait with patience for the event, we are bound
to be thankful.

[Psalms 138:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 138:6</span></span>

Though the Lord is high, yet he has respect to every lowly, humbled
sinner; but the proud and unbelieving will be banished far from his
blissful presence. Divine consolations have enough in them to revive us,
even when we walk in the midst of troubles. And God will save his own
people that they may be revived by the Holy Spirit, the Giver of life
and holiness. If we give to God the glory of his mercy, we may take to
ourselves the comfort. This confidence will not do away, but quicken
prayer. Whatever good there is in us, it is God works in us both to will
and to do. The Lord will perfect the salvation of every true believer,
and he will never forsake those whom he has created anew in Christ Jesus
unto good works.
