[Song of Solomon (Canticles)](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sol 0:0</span></span>

This book is a Divine allegory, which represents the love between Christ
and his church of true believers, under figures taken from the relation
and affection that subsist between a bridegroom and his espoused bride;
an emblem often employed in Scripture, as describing the nearest,
firmest, and most sure relation: see Psalms 45; [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md), [Isa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006.md); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md); [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md); [Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md); also in Ezekiel, Hosea, and by
our Lord himself, [Mat 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015.md); [Mat
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md); see also [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md), [Rev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009.md); [Eph
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md). There is no character in the
church of Christ, and no situation in which the believer is placed, but
what may be traced in this book, as humble inquirers will find, on
comparing it with other Scriptures, by the assistance of God the Holy
Spirit, in answer to their supplications. Much, however, of the language
has been misunderstood by expositors and translators. The difference
between the customs and manners of Europe, and those of the East, must
especially be kept in view. The little acquaintance with eastern customs
possessed by most of our early expositors and translators, has in many
cases prevented a correct rendering. Also, the changes in our own
language, during the last two or three centuries, affect the manner in
which some expressions are viewed, and they must not be judged by modern
notions. But the great outlines, rightly interpreted, fully accord with
the affections and experience of the sincere Christian.
