### [2 Chronicles Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 24:0</span></span>

([Ch2 24:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001)) Joash, of Judah, The
temple repaired.

([Ch2 24:15-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015)) Joash falls into
idolatry, He is slain by his servants.

[2 Chronicles 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 24:1</span></span>

Joash is more zealous about the repair of the temple than Jehoiada
himself. It is easier to build temples, than to be temples to God. But
the repairing of places for public worship is a good work, which all
should promote. And many a good work would be done that now lies undone,
if active men would put it forward.

[2 Chronicles 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 24:15</span></span>

See what a great judgment on any prince or people, the death of godly,
zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that we act in religion
from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a
friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior
people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a
man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada,
being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people
of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a
lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the
providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the
house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon
it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit
of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or
both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the
end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own
servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him,
for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear.
May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to
persevere in his ways to the end.
