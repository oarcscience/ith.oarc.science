### [Deuteronomy Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 18:0</span></span>

([Deu 18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001).md) A provision respecting
Levites.

([Deu 18:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009).md) The abominations of the
Canaanites to be avoided.

([Deu 18:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015).md) Christ the great
Prophet.

[Deuteronomy 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 18:1</span></span>

Care is taken that the priests entangle not themselves with the affairs
of this life, nor enrich themselves with the wealth of this world; they
have better things to mind. Care is likewise taken that they want not
the comforts and conveniences of this life. The people must provide for
them. He that has the benefit of solemn religious assemblies, ought to
give help for the comfortable support of those that minister in such
assemblies.

[Deuteronomy 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 18:9</span></span>

Was it possible that a people so blessed with Divine institutions,
should ever be in any danger of making those their teachers whom God had
made their captives? They were in danger; therefore, after many like
cautions, they are charged not to do after the abominations of the
nations of Canaan. All reckoning of lucky or unlucky days, all charms
for diseases, all amulets or spells to prevent evil, fortune-telling,
etc. are here forbidden. These are so wicked as to be a chief cause of
the rooting out of the Canaanites. It is amazing to think that there
should be any pretenders of this kind in such a land, and day of light,
as we live in. They are mere impostors who blind and cheat their
followers.

[Deuteronomy 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 18:15</span></span>

It is here promised concerning Christ, that there should come a Prophet,
great above all the prophets; by whom God would make known himself and
his will to the children of men, more fully and clearly than he had ever
done before. He is the Light of the world, [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md). He is the World by whom God
speaks to us, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md). In his birth he should be one of
their nation. In his resurrection he should be raised up at Jerusalem,
and from thence his doctrine should go forth to all the world. Thus God,
having raised up his Son Christ Jesus, sent him to bless us. He should
be like unto Moses, only above him. This prophet is come, even JESUS;
and is "He that should come," and we are to look for no other. The view
of God which he gives, will not terrify or overwhelm, but encourages us.
He speaks with fatherly affection and Divine authority united. Whoever
refuses to listen to Jesus Christ, shall find it is at his peril; the
same that is the Prophet is to be his Judge, [Joh
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#048.md). Woe then to those who refuse to
hearken to His voice, to accept His salvation, or yield obedience to His
sway! But happy they who trust in Him, and obey Him. He will lead them
in the paths of safety and peace, until He brings them to the land of
perfect light, purity, and happiness. Here is a caution against false
prophets. It highly concerns us to have a right touchstone wherewith to
try the word we hear, that we may know what that word is which the Lord
has not spoken. Whatever is against the plain sense of the written word,
or which gives countenance or encouragement to sin, we may be sure is
not that which the Lord has spoken.
