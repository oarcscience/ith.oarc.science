### [2 Chronicles Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 18:0</span></span>

Jehoshaphat's alliance with Ahab.

[2 Chronicles 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 18:1</span></span>

This history we read in 1 Kings 22. Abundant riches and honour give
large opportunities of doing good, but they are attended with many
snares and temptations. Men do not know much of the artifices of Satan
and the deceitfulness of their own hearts, when they covet riches with
the idea of being able to do good with them. What can hurt those whom
God will protect? What can shelter those whom God will destroy?
Jehoshaphat is safe in his robes, Ahab killed in his armour; for the
race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. We should be
cautious of entangling ourselves in the worldly undertakings of evil
men; and still more we should avoid engaging in their sinful projects.
But, when they call upon him, God can and will bring his faithful people
out of the difficulties and dangers into which they have sinfully run
themselves. He has all hearts in his hand, so that he easily rescues
them. Blessed is the man that putteth his trust in the Lord.
