### [Hebrews Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">heb 5:0</span></span>

([Heb 5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001).md) The office and duty of a
high priest abundantly answered in Christ.

([Heb 5:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011).md) The Christian Hebrews
reproved for their little progress in the knowledge of the gospel.

[Hebrews 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 5:1</span></span>

The High Priest must be a man, a partaker of our nature. This shows that
man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him
alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High
Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply
by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede
for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who
has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and
misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with
him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are
called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh,
Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted,
suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to
be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears,
do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight
of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but
to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was
given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto
God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn
humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need
affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature
encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and
comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are
exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author
of eternal salvation to all that obey him. But are we of that number?

[Hebrews 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 5:11</span></span>

Dull hearers make the preaching of the gospel difficult, and even those
who have some faith may be dull hearers, and slow to believe. Much is
looked for from those to whom much is given. To be unskilful, denotes
want of experience in the things of the gospel. Christian experience is
a spiritual sense, taste, or relish of the goodness, sweetness, and
excellence of the truths of the gospel. And no tongue can express the
satisfaction which the soul receives, from a sense of Divine goodness,
grace, and love to it in Christ.
