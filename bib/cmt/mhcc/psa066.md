### [Psalms Chapter 66](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 66:0</span></span>

([Psa 66:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001).md) Praise for God's
sovereign power in the creation.

([Psa 66:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#008).md) For his favour to his
church.

([Psa 66:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013).md) And the psalmist's
praise for his experience of God's goodness.

[Psalms 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 66:1</span></span>

The holy church throughout all the world lifts up her voice, to laud
that Name which is above every name, to make the praise of Jesus
glorious, both by word and deed; that others may be led to glorify him
also. But nothing can bring men to do this aright, unless his effectual
grace create their hearts anew unto holiness; and in the redemption by
the death of Christ, and the glorious deliverances it effects, are more
wondrous works than Israel's deliverance from Egyptian bondage.

[Psalms 66:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 66:8</span></span>

The Lord not only preserves our temporal life, but maintains the
spiritual life which he has given to believers. By afflictions we are
proved, as silver in the fire. The troubles of the church will certainly
end well. Through various conflicts and troubles, the slave of Satan
escapes from his yoke, and obtains joy and peace in believing: through
much tribulation the believer must enter into the kingdom of God.

[Psalms 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 66:13</span></span>

We should declare unto those that fear God, what he has done for our
souls, and how he has heard and answered our prayers, inviting them to
join us in prayer and praise; this will turn to our mutual comfort, and
to the glory of God. We cannot share these spiritual privileges, if we
retain the love of sin in our hearts, though we refrain from the gross
practice, Sin, regarded in the heart, will spoil the comfort and success
of prayer; for the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the
Lord. But if the feeling of sin in the heart causes desires to be rid of
it; if it be the presence of one urging a demand we know we must not,
cannot comply with, this is an argument of sincerity. And when we pray
in simplicity and godly sincerity, our prayers will be answered. This
will excite gratitude to Him who hath not turned away our prayer nor his
mercy from us. It was not prayer that fetched the deliverance, but his
mercy that sent it. That is the foundation of our hopes, the fountain of
our comforts; and ought to be the matter of our praises.
