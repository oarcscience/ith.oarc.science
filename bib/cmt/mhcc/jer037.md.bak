### [Jeremiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 37:0</span></span>

([Jer 37:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001).md) The Chaldean army will
return.

([Jer 37:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011).md) Jeremiah is
imprisoned.

[Jeremiah 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 37:1</span></span>

Numbers witness the fatal effects of other men's sins, yet heedlessly
step into their places, and follow the same destructive course. When in
distress, we ought to desire the prayers of ministers and Christian
friends. And it is common for those to desire to be prayed for, who will
not be advised; yet sinners are often hardened by a pause in judgments.
But if God help us not, no creature can. Whatever instruments God has
determined to use, they shall do the work, though they seem unlikely.

[Jeremiah 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 37:11</span></span>

There are times when it is the wisdom of good men to retire, to enter
into their chambers, and to shut the doors, [Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md). Jeremiah was seized as a
deserter, and committed to prison. But it is no new thing for the best
friends of the church to be belied, as in the interests of her worst
enemies. When thus falsely accused, we may deny the charge, and commit
our cause to Him who judges righteously. Jeremiah obtained mercy of the
Lord to be faithful, and would not, to obtain mercy of man, be
unfaithful to God or to his prince; he tells the king the whole truth.
When Jeremiah delivered God's message, he spake with boldness; but when
he made his own request, he spake submissively. A lion in God's cause
must be a lamb in his own. And God gave Jeremiah favour in the eyes of
the king. The Lord God can make even the cells of a prison become
pastures to his people, and will raise up friends to provide for them,
so that in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
