### [Haggai Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md)

[Haggai](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hag 2:0</span></span>

([Hag 2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001).md) Greater glory promised to
the second temple than to the first.

([Hag 2:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010).md) Their sins hindered the
work.

([Hag 2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020).md) The kingdom of Christ
foretold.

[Haggai 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hag 2:1</span></span>

Those who are hearty in the Lord's service shall receive encouragement
to proceed. But they could not build such a temple then, as Solomon
built. Though our gracious God is pleased if we do as well as we can in
his service, yet our proud hearts will scarcely let us be pleased,
unless we do as well as others, whose abilities are far beyond ours.
Encouragement is given the Jews to go on in the work notwithstanding.
They have God with them, his Spirit and his special presence. Though he
chastens their transgressions, his faithfulness does not fail. The
Spirit still remained among them. And they shall have the Messiah among
them shortly; "He that should come." Convulsions and changes would take
place in the Jewish church and state, but first should come great
revolutions and commotions among the nations. He shall come, as the
Desire of all nations; desirable to all nations, for in him shall all
the earth be blessed with the best of blessings; long expected and
desired by all believers. The house they were building should be filled
with glory, very far beyond Solomon's temple. This house shall be filled
with glory of another nature. If we have silver and gold, we must serve
and honour God with it, for the property is his. If we have not silver
and gold, we must honour him with such as we have, and he will accept
us. Let them be comforted that the glory of this latter house shall be
greater than that of the former, in what would be beyond all the glories
of the first house, the presence of the Messiah, the Son of God, the
Lord of glory, personally, and in human nature. Nothing but the presence
of the Son of God, in human form and nature, could fulfil this. Jesus is
the Christ, is He that should come, and we are to look for no other.
This prophecy alone is enough to silence the Jews, and condemn their
obstinate rejection of Him, concerning whom all their prophets spake. If
God be with us, peace is with us. But the Jews under the latter temple
had much trouble; but this promise is fulfilled in that spiritual peace
which Jesus Christ has by his blood purchased for all believers. All
changes shall make way for Christ to be desired and valued by all
nations. And the Jews shall have their eyes opened to behold how
precious He is, whom they have hitherto rejected.

[Haggai 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hag 2:10</span></span>

Many spoiled this good work, by going about it with unholy hearts and
hands, and were likely to gain no advantage by it. The sum of these two
rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than
holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of
their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is
the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over
ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin
to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso
is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse
the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the
careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who
diligently serve him.

[Haggai 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">hag 2:20</span></span>

The Lord will preserve Zerubbabel and the people of Judah, amidst their
enemies. Here is also foretold the establishment and continuance of the
kingdom of Christ; by union with whom his people are sealed with the
Holy Ghost, sealed with his image, thus distinguished from all others.
Here also is foretold the changes, even to that time when the kingdom of
Christ shall overthrow and occupy the place of all the empires which
opposed his cause. The promise has special reference to Christ, who
descended from Zerubbabel in a direct line, and is the sole Builder of
the gospel temple. Our Lord Jesus is the Signet on God's right hand, for
all power is given to him, and derived from him. By him, and in him, all
the promises of God are yea and amen. Whatever changes take place on
earth, all will promote the comfort, honour, and happiness of his
servants.
