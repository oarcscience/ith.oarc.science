[1 Chronicles 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 6:1</span></span>

We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Levites were
more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent
clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and
privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit
of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the
families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and
ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High
Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through
his atonement.
