### [Numbers Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 12:0</span></span>

([Num 12:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001).md) God rebukes the
murmuring of Aaron and Miriam.

([Num 12:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010).md) Miriam struck with
leprosy, and healed at the prayer of Moses.

[Numbers 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 12:1</span></span>

The patience of Moses was tried in his own family, as well as by the
people. The pretence was, that he had married a foreign wife; but
probably their pride was hurt, and their envy stirred up, by his
superior authority. Opposition from our near relations, and from
religious friends, is most painful. But this is to be looked for, and it
will be well if in such circumstances we can preserve the gentleness and
meekness of Moses. Moses was thus fitted to the work he was called to.
God not only cleared Moses, but praised him. Moses had the spirit of
prophecy in a way which set him far above all other prophets; yet he
that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he; and our Lord
Jesus infinitely excels him, [Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md).
Let Miriam and Aaron consider whom it was they insulted. We have reason
to be afraid of saying or doing any thing against the servants of God.
And those are presumptuous indeed who are not afraid to speak evil of
dignities, [Pe2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md). The removal of
God's presence is the surest and saddest token of God's displeasure. Woe
to us, if he depart! he never departs, till by sin and folly we drive
him from us.

[Numbers 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 12:10</span></span>

The cloud departed, and Miriam became leprous. When God goes, evil
comes: expect no good when God departs. Her foul tongue, as Bishop Hall
says, was justly punished with a foul face. Aaron, as priest, was judge
of the leprosy. He could not pronounce her leprous without trembling,
knowing himself to be equally guilty. But if she was thus punished for
speaking against Moses, what will become of those who sin against
Christ? Aaron, who joined his sister in speaking against Moses, is
forced for himself and his sister, to beseech him, and to speak highly
of him whom he had so lately blamed. Those who trample upon the saints
and servants of God, will one day be glad to make court to them. It is
well when rebukes produce confession of sin and repentance. Such
offenders, though corrected and disgraced, shall be pardoned. Moses made
it appear, that he forgave the injury done him. To this pattern of
Moses, and that of our Saviour, who said, "Father, forgive them," we
must conform. A reason is given for Miriam's being put out of the camp
for seven days; because thus she ought to accept the punishment of her
sin. When under the tokens of God's displeasure for sin, it becomes us
to take shame to ourselves. This hindered the people's progress in their
march forward towards Canaan. Many things oppose us, but nothing so
hinders us in the way to heaven, as sin.
