### [Numbers Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 19:0</span></span>

([Num 19:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001).md) The ashes of a heifer.

([Num 19:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011).md) Used to purify the
unclean.

[Numbers 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 19:1</span></span>

The heifer was to be wholly burned. This typified the painful sufferings
of our Lord Jesus, both in soul and body, as a sacrifice made by fire,
to satisfy God's justice for man's sin. These ashes are said to be laid
up as a purification for sin, because, though they were only to purify
from ceremonial uncleanness, yet they were a type of that purification
for sin which our Lord Jesus made by his death. The blood of Christ is
laid up for us in the word and sacraments, as a fountain of merit, to
which by faith we may have constant recourse, for cleansing our
consciences.

[Numbers 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 19:11</span></span>

Why did the law make a corpse a defiling thing? Because death is the
wages of sin, which entered into the world by it, and reigns by the
power of it. The law could not conquer death, nor abolish it, as the
gospel does, by bringing life and immortality to light, and so
introducing a better hope. As the ashes of the heifer signified the
merit of Christ, so the running water signified the power and grace of
the blessed Spirit, who is compared to rivers of living water; and it is
by his work that the righteousness of Christ is applied to us for our
cleansing. Those who promise themselves benefit by the righteousness of
Christ, while they submit not to the grace and influence of the Holy
Spirit, do but deceive themselves; we cannot be purified by the ashes,
otherwise than in the running water. What use could there be in these
appointments, if they do not refer to the doctrines concerning the
sacrifice of Christ? But comparing them with the New Testament, the
knowledge to be got from them is evident. The true state of fallen man
is shown in these institutions. Here we learn the defiling nature of
sin, and are warned to avoid evil communications.
