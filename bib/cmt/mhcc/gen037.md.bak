### [Genesis Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 37:0</span></span>

[Genesis 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 37:1</span></span>

In Joseph's history we see something of Christ, who was first humbled
and then exalted. It also shows the lot of Christians, who must through
many tribulations enter into the kingdom. It is a history that has none
like it, for displaying the various workings of the human mind, both
good and bad, and the singular providence of God in making use of them
for fulfilling his purposes. Though Joseph was his father's darling, yet
he was not bred up in idleness. Those do not truly love their children,
who do not use them to business, and labour, and hardships. The fondling
of children is with good reason called the spoiling of them. Those who
are trained up to do nothing, are likely to be good for nothing. But
Jacob made known his love, by dressing Joseph finer than the rest of his
children. It is wrong for parents to make a difference between one child
and another, unless there is great cause for it, by the children's
dutifulness, or undutifulness. When parents make a difference, children
soon notice it, and it leads to quarrels in families. Jacob's sons did
that, when they were from under his eye, which they durst not have done
at home with him; but Joseph gave his father an account of their ill
conduct, that he might restrain them. Not as a tale-bearer, to sow
discord, but as a faithful brother.

[Genesis 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 37:5</span></span>

God gave Joseph betimes the prospect of his advancement, to support and
comfort him under his long and grievous troubles. Observe, Joseph
dreamed of his preferment, but he did not dream of his imprisonment.
Thus many young people, when setting out in the world, think of nothing
but prosperity and pleasure, and never dream of trouble. His brethren
rightly interpreted the dream, though they abhorred the interpretation
of it. While they committed crimes in order to defeat it, they were
themselves the instruments of accomplishing it. Thus the Jews understood
what Christ said of his kingdom. Determined that he should not reign
over them, they consulted to put him to death; and by his crucifixion,
made way for the exaltation they designed to prevent.

[Genesis 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 37:12</span></span>

How readily does Joseph wait his father's orders! Those children who are
best beloved by their parents, should be the most ready to obey them.
See how deliberate Joseph's brethren were against him. They thought to
slay him from malice aforethought, and in cold blood. Whosoever hateth
his brother is a murderer, [Jo1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md).
The sons of Jacob hated their brother because their father loved him.
New occasions, as his dreams and the like, drew them on further; but
this laid rankling in their hearts, till they resolved on his death. God
has all hearts in his hands. Reuben had most reason to be jealous of
Joseph, for he was the first-born; yet he proves his best friend. God
overruled all to serve his own purpose, of making Joseph an instrument
to save much people alive. Joseph was a type of Christ; for though he
was the beloved Son of his Father, and hated by a wicked world, yet the
Father sent him out of his bosom to visit us in great humility and love.
He came from heaven to earth to seek and save us; yet then malicious
plots were laid against him. His own not only received him not, but
crucified him. This he submitted to, as a part of his design to redeem
and save us.

[Genesis 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 37:23</span></span>

They threw Joseph into a pit, to perish there with hunger and cold; so
cruel were their tender mercies. They slighted him when he was in
distress, and were not grieved for the affliction of Joseph, see [Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006.md); for when he was pining in the
pit, they sat down to eat bread. They felt no remorse of conscience for
the sin. But the wrath of man shall praise God, and the remainder of
wrath he will restrain, [Psa 76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md).
Joseph's brethren were wonderfully restrained from murdering him, and
their selling him as wonderfully turned to God's praise.

[Genesis 37:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 37:31</span></span>

When Satan has taught men to commit one sin, he teaches them to try to
conceal it with another; to hide theft and murder, with lying and false
oaths: but he that covers his sin shall not prosper long. Joseph's
brethren kept their own and one another's counsel for some time; but
their villany came to light at last, and it is here published to the
world. To grieve their father, they sent him Joseph's coat of colours;
and he hastily thought, on seeing the bloody coat, that Joseph was rent
in pieces. Let those that know the heart of a parent, suppose the agony
of poor Jacob. His sons basely pretended to comfort him, but miserable,
hypocritical comforters were they all. Had they really desired to
comfort him, they might at once have done it, by telling the truth. The
heart is strangely hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Jacob refused
to be comforted. Great affection to any creature prepares for so much
the greater affliction, when it is taken from us, or made bitter to us:
undue love commonly ends in undue grief. It is the wisdom of parents not
to bring up children delicately, they know not to what hardships they
may be brought before they die. From the whole of this chapter we see
with wonder the ways of Providence. The malignant brothers seem to have
gotten their ends; the merchants, who care not what they deal in so that
they gain, have also obtained theirs; and Potiphar, having got a fine
young slave, has obtained his! But God's designs are, by these means, in
train for execution. This event shall end in Israel's going down to
Egypt; that ends in their deliverance by Moses; that in setting up the
true religion in the world; and that in the spread of it among all
nations by the gospel. Thus the wrath of man shall praise the Lord, and
the remainder thereof will he restrain.
