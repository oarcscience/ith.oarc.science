### [Joshua Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 19:0</span></span>

([Jos 19:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001).md) The lot of Simeon.

([Jos 19:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010).md) The lot of Zebulun.

(v. 17-51) The lot of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan.

[Joshua 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 19:1</span></span>

The men of Judah did not oppose taking away the cities within their
border, when convinced that they had more than was right. If a true
believer has obtained an unintended and improper advantage in any thing,
he will give it up without murmuring. Love seeketh not her own, and doth
not behave unseemly; it will induce those in whom it richly dwells, to
part with their own to supply what is lacking to their brethren.

[Joshua 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 19:10</span></span>

In the division to each tribe of Israel, the prophetic blessings of
Jacob were fulfilled. They chose for themselves, or it was divided to
them by lot, in the manner and places that he foresaw. So sure a rule to
go by is the word of prophecy: we see by it what to believe, and it
proves beyond all dispute the things that are of God.

[Joshua 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 19:17</span></span>

Joshua waited till all the tribes were settled, before he asked any
provision for himself. He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them
all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer
the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do
good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be
soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to
their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more
effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring
others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and
dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet
himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not
himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience
to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will
he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in
possession of his heavenly rest.
