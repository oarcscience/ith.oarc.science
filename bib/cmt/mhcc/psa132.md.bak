### [Psalms Chapter 132](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 132:0</span></span>

([Psa 132:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001).md) David's care for the
ark.

([Psa 132:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011).md) The promises of God.

[Psalms 132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 132:1</span></span>

David bound himself to find a place for the Lord, for the ark, the token
of God's presence. When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to
tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for
the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may
bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our
own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that
God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he
would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty.
David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as
a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to
plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us
find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and
has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is,
that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for
his Son's sake.

[Psalms 132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 132:11</span></span>

The Lord never turns from us when we plead the covenant with his
anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. How vast is the love of God to man,
that he should speak thus concerning his church! It is his desire to
dwell with us; yet how little do we desire to dwell with him! He abode
in Zion till the sins of Israel caused him to give them up to the
spoilers. Forsake us not, O God, and deliver us not in like manner,
sinful though we are. God's people have a special blessing on common
enjoyments, and that blessing puts peculiar sweetness into them. Zion's
poor have reason to be content with a little of this world, because they
have better things prepared for them. God will abundantly bless the
nourishment of the new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with the
bread of life. He gives more than we ask, and when he gives salvation,
he will give abundant joy. God would bring to nothing every design
formed to destroy the house of David, until King Messiah should arise
out of it, to sit upon the throne of his Father. In him all the promises
centre. His enemies, who will not have him to reign over them, shall at
the last day be clothed with shame and confusion for ever.
