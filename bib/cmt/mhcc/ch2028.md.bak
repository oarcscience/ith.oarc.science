### [2 Chronicles Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

The wicked reign of Ahaz in Judah.

[2 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 28:1</span></span>

Israel gained this victory because God was wroth with Judah, and made
them the rod of his indignation. He reminds them of their own sins. It
ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God,
if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be
remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow
man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the
word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of
love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage,
without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do
unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they
grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the
prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will
not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by
his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no
real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do
them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are
wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions,
instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass
yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But
no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they
mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of
wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a
sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.
