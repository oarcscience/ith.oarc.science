### [Psalms Chapter 129](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 129:0</span></span>

([Psa 129:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)) Thankfulness for former
deliverances.

([Psa 129:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005)) A believing prospect of
the destruction of the enemies of Zion.

[Psalms 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 129:1</span></span>

The enemies of God's people have very barbarously endeavoured to wear
out the saints of the Most High. But the church has been always
graciously delivered. Christ has built his church upon a rock. And the
Lord has many ways of disabling wicked men from doing the mischief they
design against his church. The Lord is righteous in not suffering Israel
to be ruined; he has promised to preserve a people to himself.

[Psalms 129:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 129:5</span></span>

While God's people shall flourish as the loaded palm-tree, or the green
and fruitful olive, their enemies shall wither as the grass upon the
house-tops, which in eastern countries are flat, and what grows there
never ripens; so it is with the designs of God's enemies. No wise man
will pray the Lord to bless these mowers or reapers. And when we
remember how Jesus arose and reigns; how his people have been supported,
like the burning but unconsumed bush, we shall not fear.
