### [Ezekiel Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 32:0</span></span>

(v. 1-16) The fall of Egypt.

(v. 17-32) It is like that of other nations.

[Ezekiel 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 32:1</span></span>

It becomes us to weep and tremble for those who will not weep and
tremble for themselves. Great oppressors are, in God's account, no
better than beasts of prey. Those who admire the pomp of this world,
will wonder at the ruin of that pomp; which to those who know the vanity
of all things here below, is no surprise. When others are ruined by sin,
we have to fear, knowing ourselves guilty. The instruments of the
desolation are formidable. And the instances of the desolation are
frightful. The waters of Egypt shall run like oil, which signifies there
should be universal sadness and heaviness upon the whole nation. God can
soon empty those of this world's goods who have the greatest fulness of
them. By enlarging the matters of our joy, we increase the occasions of
our sorrow. How weak and helpless, as to God, are the most powerful of
mankind! The destruction of Egypt was a type of the destruction of the
enemies of Christ.

[Ezekiel 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 32:17</span></span>

Divers nations are mentioned as gone down to the grave before Egypt, who
are ready to give her a scornful reception; these nations had been
lately ruined and wasted. But though Judah and Jerusalem were about this
time ruined and laid waste, yet they are not mentioned here. Though they
suffered the same affliction, and by the same hand, yet the kind design
for which they were afflicted, and the mercy God reserved for them,
altered its nature. It was not to them a going down to the pit, as it
was to the heathen. Pharaoh shall see, and be comforted; but the comfort
wicked ones have after death, is poor comfort, not real, but only in
fancy. The view this prophecy gives of ruined states shows something of
this present world, and the empire of death in it. Come and see the
calamitous state of human life. As if men did not die fast enough, they
are ingenious at finding out ways to destroy one another. Also of the
other world; though the destruction of nations as such, seems chiefly
intended, here is plain allusion to the everlasting ruin of impenitent
sinners. How are men deceived by Satan! What are the objects they pursue
through scenes of bloodshed, and their many sins? Surely man disquiets
himself in vain, whether he pursues wealth, fame, power, or pleasure.
The hour cometh, when all that are in their graves shall hear the voice
of Christ, and shall come forth; those that have done good to the
resurrection of life, and those that have done evil to the resurrection
of damnation.
