### [Ezra Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 7:0</span></span>

([Ezr 7:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)) Ezra goes up to
Jerusalem.

(v. 11-26) The commission to Ezra.

([Ezr 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027), [Ezr
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#028)) Ezra blesses God for his favour.

[Ezra 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 7:1</span></span>

Ezra went from Babylon to Jerusalem, for the good of his country. The
king was kind to him; he granted all his requests, whatever Ezra desired
to enable him to serve his country. When he went, many went with him; he
obtained favour from his king, by the Divine favour. Every creature is
that to us, which God makes it to be. We must see the hand of God in the
events that befall us, and acknowledge him with thankfulness.

[Ezra 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 7:11</span></span>

The liberality of heathen kings to support the worship of God,
reproached the conduct of many kings of Judah, and will rise up in
judgment against the covetousness of wealthy professed Christians, who
will not promote the cause of God. But the weapons of Christian
ministers are not carnal. Faithful preaching, holy lives, fervent
prayers, and patient suffering when called to it, are the means to bring
men into obedience to Christ.

[Ezra 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ezr 7:27</span></span>

Two things Ezra blessed God for: 1. For his commission. If any good
appear in our hearts, or in the hearts of others, we must own that God
put it there, and bless him; it is he that worketh in us, both to will
and to do that which is good. 2. For his encouragement: God has extended
mercy to me. Ezra was a man of courage, yet he ascribed this not to his
own heart, but to God's hand. If God give us his hand, we are bold and
cheerful; if he withdraw it, we are weak as water. Whatever we are
enabled to do for God and those around us, God must have all the glory.
