### [Isaiah Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 47:0</span></span>

([Isa 47:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001)) God's judgments on
Babylon.

([Isa 47:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#007)) Carelessness and
confidence shall not prevent the evil.

[Isaiah 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 47:1</span></span>

Babylon is represented under the emblem of a female in deep distress.
She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting
on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowest and most laborious
service. God was righteous in his vengeance, and none should interpose.
The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as the Redeemer and Holy One of
Israel. God often permits wicked men to prevail against his people; but
those who cruelly oppress them will be punished.

[Isaiah 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 47:7</span></span>

Let us beware of acting and speaking as Babylon did; of trusting in
tyranny and oppression; of boasting as to our abilities, relying on
ourselves, and ascribing success to our own prudence and wisdom; lest we
partake of her plagues. Those in the height of prosperity, are apt to
fancy themselves out of the reach of adversity. It is also common for
sinners to think they shall be safe, because they think to be secret in
wicked ways. But their security shall be their ruin. Let us draw from
such passages as the foregoing, those lessons of humility and trust in
God which they convey. If we believe the word of God, we may know how it
will be with the righteous and the wicked to all eternity. We may learn
how to escape the wrath to come, to glorify God, to have peace through
life, hope in death, and everlasting happiness. Let us then stand aloof
from all delusions.
