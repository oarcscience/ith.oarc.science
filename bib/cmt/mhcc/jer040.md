### [Jeremiah Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 40:0</span></span>

([Jer 40:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001)) Jeremiah is directed to
go to Gedaliah.

([Jer 40:7-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007)) A conspiracy against
Gedaliah.

[Jeremiah 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 40:1</span></span>

The captain of the guard seems to glory that he had been God's
instrument to fulfil, what Jeremiah had been God's messenger to
foretell. Many can see God's justice and truth with regard to others,
who are heedless and blind as to themselves and their own sins. But,
sooner or later, all men shall be made sensible that their sin is the
cause of all their miseries. Jeremiah has leave to dispose of himself;
but is advised to go to Gedaliah, governor of the land under the king of
Babylon. It is doubtful whether Jeremiah acted right in this decision.
But those who desire the salvation of sinners, and the good of the
church, are apt to expect better times from slight appearances, and they
will prefer the hope of being useful, to the most secure situations
without it.

[Jeremiah 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 40:7</span></span>

Jeremiah had never in his prophecies spoken of any good days for the
Jews, to come immediately after the captivity; yet Providence seemed to
encourage such an expectation. But how soon is this hopeful prospect
blighted! When God begins a judgment, he will complete it. While pride,
ambition, or revenge, bears rule in the heart, men will form new
projects, and be restless in mischief, which commonly ends in their own
ruin. Who would have thought, that after the destruction of Jerusalem,
rebellion would so soon have sprung up? There can be no thorough change
but what grace makes. And if the miserable, who are kept in everlasting
chains for the judgment of the great day, were again permitted to come
on earth, the sin and evil of their nature would be unchanged. Lord,
give us new hearts, and that new mind in which the new birth consists,
since thou hast said we cannot without it see thy heavenly kingdom.
