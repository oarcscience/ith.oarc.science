### [Psalms Chapter 141](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 141:0</span></span>

([Psa 141:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001).md) David prays for God's
acceptance and assistance.

([Psa 141:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005).md) That God would appear
for his rescue.

[Psalms 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 141:1</span></span>

Make haste unto me. Those that know how to value God's gracious
presence, will be the more fervent in their prayers. When presented
through the sacrifice and intercession of the Saviour, they will be as
acceptable to God as the daily sacrifices and burnings of incense were
of old. Prayer is a spiritual sacrifice, it is the offering up the soul
and its best affections. Good men know the evil of tongue sins. When
enemies are provoking, we are in danger of speaking unadvisedly. While
we live in an evil world, and have such evil hearts, we have need to
pray that we may neither be drawn nor driven to do any thing sinful.
Sinners pretend to find dainties in sin; but those that consider how
soon sin will turn into bitterness, will dread such dainties, and pray
to God to take them out of their sight, and by his grace to turn their
hearts against them. Good men pray against the sweets of sin.

[Psalms 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 141:5</span></span>

We should be ready to welcome the rebuke of our heavenly Father, and
also the reproof of our brethren. It shall not break my head, if it may
but help to break my heart: we must show that we take it kindly. Those
who slighted the word of God before, will be glad of it when in
affliction, for that opens the ear to instruction. When the world is
bitter, the word is sweet. Let us lift our prayer unto God. Let us
entreat him to rescue us from the snares of Satan, and of all the
workers of iniquity. In language like this psalm, O Lord, would we
entreat that our poor prayers should set forth our only hope, our only
dependence on thee. Grant us thy grace, that we may be prepared for this
employment, being clothed with thy righteousness, and having all the
gifts of thy Spirit planted in our hearts.
