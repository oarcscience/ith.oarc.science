### [Joshua Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 12:0</span></span>

([Jos 12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001)) The two kings conquered
by Moses.

(v. 7-24) The kings whom Joshua smote.

[Joshua 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 12:1</span></span>

Fresh mercies must not drown the remembrance of former mercies, nor must
the glory of the present instruments of good to the church diminish the
just honour of those who went before them, since God is the same who
wrought by both. Moses gave to one part of Israel a very rich and
fruitful country, but it was on the outside of Jordan. Joshua gave to
all Israel the holy land, within Jordan. So the law has given to some
few of God's spiritual Israel worldly blessings, earnests of good things
to come; but our Lord Jesus, the true Joshua, provided for all the
children of promise spiritual blessings, and the heavenly Canaan.

[Joshua 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 12:7</span></span>

We have here the limits of the country Joshua conquered. A list is given
of the kings subdued by Israel: thirty-one in all. This shows how
fruitful Canaan then was, in which so many chose to throng together.
This was the land God appointed for Israel; yet in our day it is one of
the most barren and unprofitable countries in the world. Such is the
effect of the curse it lies under, since its possessors rejected Christ
and his gospel, as was foretold by Moses, [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023). The vengeance of a righteous
God, inflicted on all these kings and their subjects, for their
wickedness, should make us dread and hate sin. The fruitful land
bestowed on his chosen people, should fill our hearts with hope and
confidence in his mercy, and with humble gratitude.
