### [Ezekiel Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md)

These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth from
Jerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts and
powers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which is
spread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and he
is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side.
They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the
world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the
motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into
the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood,
as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which
require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and
some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St.
Paul did, adore the depth, Romans 11. It is wisdom to begin with that
which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to
be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of
believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit,
abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls
of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves
serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word,
though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases
of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his
sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is
room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of
that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.
