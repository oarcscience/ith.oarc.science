### [Isaiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 3:0</span></span>

([Isa 3:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001).md) The calamities about to
come upon the land.

([Isa 3:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010).md) The wickedness of the
people.

([Isa 3:16-26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016).md) The distress of the
proud, luxurious women of Zion.

[Isaiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 3:1</span></span>

God was about to deprive Judah of every stay and support. The city and
the land were to be made desolate, because their words and works had
been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. If men do not
stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all other supports, and
then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and the Water of life;
if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part not to be taken
away, [Joh 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md). Here note, 1. That
the condition of sinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is
damaged by sin. 3. Whatever evil befalls sinners, be sure that they
bring it on themselves.

[Isaiah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 3:10</span></span>

The rule was certain; however there might be national prosperity or
trouble, it would be well with the righteous and ill with the wicked.
Blessed be God, there is abundant encouragement to the righteous to
trust in him, and for sinners to repent and return to him. It was time
for the Lord to show his might. He will call men to a strict account for
all the wealth and power intrusted to and abused by them. If it is
sinful to disregard the necessities of the poor, how odious and wicked a
part do they act, who bring men into poverty, and then oppress them!

[Isaiah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 3:16</span></span>

The prophet reproves and warns the daughters of Zion of the sufferings
coming upon them. Let them know that God notices the folly and vanity of
proud women, even of their dress. The punishments threatened answered
the sin. Loathsome diseases often are the just punishment of pride. It
is not material to ask what sort of ornaments they wore; many of these
things, if they had not been in fashion, would have been ridiculed then
as now. Their fashions differed much from those of our times, but human
nature is the same. Wasting time and money, to the neglect of piety,
charity, and even of justice, displease the Lord. Many professors at the
present day, seem to think there is no harm in worldly finery; but were
it not a great evil, would the Holy Spirit have taught the prophet to
expose it so fully? The Jews being overcome, Jerusalem would be levelled
with the ground; which is represented under the idea of a desolate
female seated upon the earth. And when the Romans had destroyed
Jerusalem, they struck a medal, on which was represented a woman sitting
on the ground in a posture of grief. If sin be harboured within the
walls, lamentation and mourning are near the gates.
