### [Ezekiel Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)

In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will
be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their
power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness.
These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs
of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is
sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and
feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery
of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine
justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole
Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth.
