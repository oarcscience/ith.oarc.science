### [Proverbs Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 25:0</span></span>

[Proverbs 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 25:1</span></span>

God needs not search into any thing; nothing can be hid from him. But it
is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to light hidden
works of darkness.

[Proverbs 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 25:4</span></span>

For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to
support his government.

[Proverbs 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 25:6</span></span>

Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory
of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness.

[Proverbs 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 25:8</span></span>

To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must
at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private
quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter.

[Proverbs 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 25:11</span></span>

A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful,
as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets.

[Proverbs 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 25:13</span></span>

See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business;
to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus
acceptable to us.

[Proverbs 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 25:14</span></span>

He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is
like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain.

[Proverbs 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 25:15</span></span>

Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for
persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened
mind.

[Proverbs 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 25:16</span></span>

God has given us leave to use grateful things, but we are cautioned
against excess.

[Proverbs 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 25:17</span></span>

We cannot be upon good terms with our neighbours, without discretion as
well as sincerity. How much better a Friend is God than any other
friend! The oftener we come to him, the more welcome.

[Proverbs 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 25:18</span></span>

A false testimony is dangerous in every thing.

[Proverbs 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 25:19</span></span>

Confidence in an unfaithful man is painful and vexatious; when we put
any stress on him, he not only fails, but makes us feel for it.

[Proverbs 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 25:20</span></span>

We take a wrong course if we think to relieve those in sorrow by
endeavouring to make them merry.

[Proverbs 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 25:21</span></span>

The precept to love even our enemies is an Old Testament commandment.
Our Saviour has shown his own great example in loving us when we were
enemies.

[Proverbs 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 25:23</span></span>

Slanders would not be so readily spoken, if they were not readily heard.
Sin, if it receives any check, becomes cowardly.

[Proverbs 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 25:24</span></span>

It is better to be alone, than to be joined to one who is a hinderance
to the comfort of life.

[Proverbs 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 25:25</span></span>

Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is good news from thence,
in the everlasting gospel, which signifies glad tidings, and in the
witness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children!

[Proverbs 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 25:26</span></span>

When the righteous are led into sin, it is as hurtful as if the public
fountains were poisoned.

[Proverbs 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 25:27</span></span>

We must be, through grace, dead to the pleasures of sense, and also to
the praises of men.

[Proverbs 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 25:28</span></span>

The man who has no command over his anger, is easily robbed of peace.
Let us give up ourselves to the Lord, and pray him to put his Spirit
within us, and cause us to walk in his statutes.
