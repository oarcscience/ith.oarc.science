### [1 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 15:0</span></span>

(v. 1-24) Preparations for the removal of the ark.

([Ch1 15:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025).md) The removal of the
ark.

[1 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 15:1</span></span>

Wise and good men may be guilty of oversights, which they will correct,
as soon as they are aware of them. David does not try to justify what
had been done amiss, nor to lay the blame on others; but he owns himself
guilty, with others, of not seeking God in due order.

[1 Chronicles 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 15:25</span></span>

It is good to notice the assistance of Divine Providence, even in things
which fall within the compass of our natural powers; if God did not help
us, we could not stir a step. If we do our religious duties in any
degree aright, we must own it was God that helped us; had we been left
to ourselves, we should have been guilty of some fatal errors. And every
thing in which we engage, must be done in dependence on the mercy of God
through the sacrifice of the Redeemer.
