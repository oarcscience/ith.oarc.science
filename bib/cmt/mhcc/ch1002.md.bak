[1 Chronicles 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 2:1</span></span>

We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, that
distinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among
the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who
come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him,
their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuable consists
in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent to his glory,
in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.
