[Luke 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 9:1</span></span>

Christ sent his twelve disciples abroad, who by this time were able to
teach others what they had received from the Lord. They must not be
anxious to commend themselves to people's esteem by outward appearance.
They must go as they were. The Lord Jesus is the fountain of power and
authority, to whom all creatures must, in one way or another, be
subject; and if he goes with the word of his ministers in power, to
deliver sinners from Satan's bondage, they may be sure that he will care
for their wants. When truth and love thus go together, and yet the
message of God is rejected and despised, it leaves men without excuse,
and turns to a testimony against them. Herod's guilty conscience was
ready to conclude that John was risen from the dead. He desired to see
Jesus; and why did he not go and see him? Probably, because he thought
it below him, or because he wished not to have any more reprovers of
sin. Delaying it now, his heart was hardened, and when he did see Jesus,
he was as much prejudiced against him as others, [Luk
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011.md).

[Luke 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 9:10</span></span>

The people followed Jesus, and though they came unseasonably, yet he
gave them what they came for. He spake unto them of the kingdom of God.
He healed those who had need of healing. And with five loaves of bread
and two fishes, Christ fed five thousand men. He will not see those that
fear him, and serve him faithfully, want any good thing. When we receive
creature-comforts, we must acknowledge that we receive them from God,
and that we are unworthy to receive them; that we owe them all, and all
the comfort we have in them, to the mediation of Christ, by whom the
curse is taken away. The blessing of Christ will make a little go a
great way. He fills every hungry soul, abundantly satisfies it with the
goodness of his house. Here were fragments taken up: in our Father's
house there is bread enough, and to spare. We are not straitened, nor
stinted in Christ.

[Luke 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 9:18</span></span>

It is an unspeakable comfort that our Lord Jesus is God's Anointed; this
signifies that he was both appointed to be the Messiah, and qualified
for it. Jesus discourses concerning his own sufferings and death. And so
far must his disciples be from thinking how to prevent his sufferings,
that they must prepare for their own. We often meet with crosses in the
way of duty; and though we must not pull them upon our own heads, yet,
when they are laid for us, we must take them up, and carry them after
Christ. It is well or ill with us, according as it is well or ill with
our souls. The body cannot be happy, if the soul be miserable in the
other world; but the soul may be happy, though the body is greatly
afflicted and oppressed in this world. We must never be ashamed of
Christ and his gospel.

[Luke 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 9:28</span></span>

Christ's transfiguration was a specimen of that glory in which he will
come to judge the world; and was an encouragement to his disciples to
suffer for him. Prayer is a transfiguring, transforming duty, which
makes the face to shine. Our Lord Jesus, even in his transfiguration,
was willing to speak concerning his death and sufferings. In our
greatest glories on earth, let us remember that in this world we have no
continuing city. What need we have to pray to God for quickening grace,
to make us lively! Yet that the disciples might be witnesses of this
sign from heaven, after awhile they became awake, so that they were able
to give a full account of what passed. But those know not what they say,
that talk of making tabernacles on earth for glorified saints in heaven.

[Luke 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 9:37</span></span>

How deplorable the case of this child! He was under the power of an evil
spirit. Disease of that nature are more frightful than such as arise
merely from natural causes. What mischief Satan does where he gets
possession! But happy those that have access to Christ! He can do that
for us which his disciples cannot. A word from Christ healed the child;
and when our children recover from sickness, it is comfortable to
receive them as healed by the hand of Christ.

[Luke 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 9:43</span></span>

This prediction of Christ's sufferings was plain enough, but the
disciples would not understand it, because it agreed not with their
notions. A little child is the emblem by which Christ teaches us
simplicity and humility. What greater honour can any man attain to in
this world, than to be received by men as a messenger of God and Christ;
and to have God and Christ own themselves received and welcomed in him!
If ever any society of Christians in this world, had reason to silence
those not of their own communion, the twelve disciples at this time had;
yet Christ warned them not to do the like again. Those may be found
faithful followers of Christ, and may be accepted of him, who do not
follow with us.

[Luke 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 9:51</span></span>

The disciples did not consider that the conduct of the Samaritans was
rather the effect of national prejudices and bigotry, than of enmity to
the word and worship of God; and through they refused to receive Christ
and his disciples, they did not ill use or injure them, so that the case
was widely different from that of Ahaziah and Elijah. Nor were they
aware that the gospel dispensation was to be marked by miracles of
mercy. But above all, they were ignorant of the prevailing motives of
their own hearts, which were pride and carnal ambition. Of this our Lord
warned them. It is easy for us to say, Come, see our zeal for the Lord!
and to think we are very faithful in his cause, when we are seeking our
own objects, and even doing harm instead of good to others.

[Luke 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 9:57</span></span>

Here is one that is forward to follow Christ, but seems to have been
hasty and rash, and not to have counted the cost. If we mean to follow
Christ, we must lay aside the thoughts of great things in the world. Let
us not try to join the profession of Christianity, with seeking after
worldly advantages. Here is another that seems resolved to follow
Christ, but he begs a short delay. To this man Christ first gave the
call; he said to him, Follow me. Religion teaches us to be kind and
good, to show piety at home, and to requite our parents; but we must not
make these an excuse for neglecting our duty to God. Here is another
that is willing to follow Christ, but he must have a little time to talk
with his friends about it, and to set in order his household affairs,
and give directions concerning them. He seemed to have worldly concerns
more upon his heart than he ought to have, and he was willing to enter
into a temptation leading him from his purpose of following Christ. No
one can do any business in a proper manner, if he is attending to other
things. Those who begin with the work of God, must resolve to go on, or
they will make nothing of it. Looking back, leads to drawing back, and
drawing back is to perdition. He only that endures to the end shall be
saved.
