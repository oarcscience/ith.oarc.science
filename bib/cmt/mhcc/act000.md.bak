This book unites the Gospels to the Epistles. It contains many
particulars concerning the apostles Peter and Paul, and of the Christian
church from the ascension of our Saviour to the arrival of St. Paul at
Rome, a space of about thirty years. St. Luke was the writer of this
book; he was present at many of the events he relates, and attended Paul
to Rome. But the narrative does not afford a complete history of the
church during the time to which it refers, nor even of St. Paul's life.
The object of the book has been considered to be, 1. To relate in what
manner the gifts of the Holy Spirit were communicated on the day of
Pentecost, and the miracles performed by the apostles, to confirm the
truth of Christianity, as showing that Christ's declarations were really
fulfilled. 2. To prove the claim of the Gentiles to be admitted into the
church of Christ. This is shown by much of the contents of the book. A
large portion of the Acts is occupied by the discourses or sermons of
various persons, the language and manner of which differ, and all of
which will be found according to the persons by whom they were
delivered, and the occasions on which they were spoken. It seems that
most of these discourses are only the substance of what was actually
delivered. They relate nevertheless fully to Jesus as the Christ, the
anointed Messiah.
