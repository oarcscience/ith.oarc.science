### [Joel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

([Joe 1:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001).md) A plague of locusts.

([Joe 1:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008).md) All sorts of people are
called to lament it.

([Joe 1:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014).md) They are to look to
God.

[Joel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 1:1</span></span>

The most aged could not remember such calamities as were about to take
place. Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of
it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the
country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of
the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command,
and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people,
by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to
take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the
more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more
severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we
make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.

[Joel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joe 1:8</span></span>

All who labour only for the meat that perishes, will, sooner or later,
be ashamed of their labour. Those that place their happiness in the
delights of sense, when deprived of them, or disturbed in the enjoyment,
lose their joy; whereas spiritual joy then flourishes more than ever.
See what perishing, uncertain things our creature-comforts are. See how
we need to live in continual dependence upon God and his providence. See
what ruinous work sin makes. As far as poverty occasions the decay of
piety, and starves the cause of religion among a people, it is a very
sore judgment. But how blessed are the awakening judgments of God, in
rousing his people and calling home the heart to Christ, and his
salvation!

[Joel 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joe 1:14</span></span>

The sorrow of the people is turned into repentance and humiliation
before God. With all the marks of sorrow and shame, sin must be
confessed and bewailed. A day is to be appointed for this purpose; a day
in which people must be kept from their common employments, that they
may more closely attend God's services; and there is to be abstaining
from meat and drink. Every one had added to the national guilt, all
shared in the national calamity, therefore every one must join in
repentance. When joy and gladness are cut off from God's house, when
serious godliness decays, and love waxes cold, then it is time to cry
unto the Lord. The prophet describes how grievous the calamity. See even
the inferior creatures suffering for our transgression. And what better
are they than beasts, who never cry to God but for corn and wine, and
complain of the want of the delights of sense? Yet their crying to God
in those cases, shames the stupidity of those who cry not to God in any
case. Whatever may become of the nations and churches that persist in
ungodliness, believers will find the comfort of acceptance with God,
when the wicked shall be burned up with his indignation.
