### [Psalms Chapter 140](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 140:0</span></span>

([Psa 140:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001).md) David encourages
himself in God.

([Psa 140:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008).md) He prays for, and
prophesies the destruction of, his persecutors.

[Psalms 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 140:1</span></span>

The more danger appears, the more earnest we should be in prayer to God.
All are safe whom the Lord protects. If he be for us, who can be against
us? We should especially watch and pray, that the Lord would hold up our
goings in his ways, that our footsteps slip not. God is as able to keep
his people from secret fraud as from open force; and the experience we
have had of his power and care, in dangers of one kind, may encourage us
to depend upon him in other dangers.

[Psalms 140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 140:8</span></span>

Believers may pray that God would not grant the desires of the wicked,
nor further their evil devices. False accusers will bring mischief upon
themselves, even the burning coals of Divine vengeance. And surely the
righteous shall dwell in God's presence, and give him thanks for
evermore. This is true thanksgiving, even thanks-living: this use we
should make of all our deliverances, we should serve God the more
closely and cheerfully. Those who, though evil spoken of and ill-used by
men, are righteous in the sight of God, being justified by the
righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to them, and received by
faith, as the effect of which, they live soberly and righteously; these
give thanks to the Lord, for the righteousness whereby they are made
righteous, and for every blessing of grace, and mercy of life.
