### [Psalms Chapter 96](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 96:0</span></span>

([Psa 96:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001).md) A call to all people to
praise God.

([Psa 96:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010).md) God's government and
judgment.

[Psalms 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 96:1</span></span>

When Christ finished his work on earth, and was received into his glory
in heaven, the church began to sing a new song unto him, and to bless
his name. His apostles and evangelists showed forth his salvation among
the heathen, his wonders among all people. All the earth is here
summoned to worship the Lord. We must worship him in the beauty of
holiness, as God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. Glorious
things are said of him, both as motives to praise and matter of praise.

[Psalms 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 96:10</span></span>

We are to hope and pray for that time, when Christ shall reign in
righteousness over all nations. He shall rule in the hearts of men, by
the power of truth, and the Spirit of righteousness. His coming draws
nigh; this King, this Judge standeth before the door, but he is not yet
come. The Lord will accept the praises of all who seek to promote the
kingdom of Christ. The sea can but roar, and how the trees of the wood
can show that they rejoice we know not; but He that searches the heart
knows what is the mind of the Spirit, and understands the words, the
broken language of the weakest. Christ will come to judge the earth, to
execute just vengeance on his enemies, and to fulfil his largest
promises to his people. What then are we? Would that day be welcome to
us? If this be not our case, let us now begin to prepare to meet our
God, by seeking the pardon of our sins, and the renewal of our souls to
holiness.
