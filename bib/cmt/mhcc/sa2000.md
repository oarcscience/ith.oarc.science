[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 0:0</span></span>

This book is the history of the reign of king David. It relates his
victories, the growth of the prosperity of Israel, and his reformation
of the state of religion. With these events are recorded the grievous
sins he committed, and the family as well as public troubles with which
he was punished. We here meet with many things worthy of imitation, and
many that are written for our warning. The history of king David is
given in Scripture with much faithfulness, and from it he appears, to
those who fairly balance his many virtues and excellent qualities
against his faults, to have been a great and good man.
