### [Acts Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 14:0</span></span>

[Acts 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 14:1</span></span>

The apostles spake so plainly, with such evidence and proof of the
Spirit, and with such power; so warmly, and with such concern for the
souls of men; that those who heard them could not but say, God was with
them of a truth. Yet the success was not to be reckoned to the manner of
their preaching, but to the Spirit of God who used that means.
Perseverance in doing good, amidst dangers and hardships, is a blessed
evidence of grace. Wherever God's servants are driven, they should seek
to declare the truth. When they went on in Christ's name and strength,
he failed not to give testimony to the word of his grace. He has assured
us it is the word of God, and that we may venture our souls upon it. The
Gentiles and Jews were at enmity with one another, yet united against
Christians. If the church's enemies join to destroy it, shall not its
friends unite for its preservation? God has a shelter for his people in
a storm; he is, and will be their Hiding-place. In times of persecution,
believers may see cause to quit a spot, though they do not quit their
Master's work.

[Acts 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 14:8</span></span>

All things are possible to those that believe. When we have faith, that
most precious gift of God, we shall be delivered from the spiritual
helplessness in which we were born, and from the dominion of sinful
habits since formed; we shall be made able to stand upright and walk
cheerfully in the ways of the Lord. When Christ, the Son of God,
appeared in the likeness of men, and did many miracles, men were so far
from doing sacrifice to him, that they made him a sacrifice to their
pride and malice; but Paul and Barnabas, upon their working one miracle,
were treated as gods. The same power of the god of this world, which
closes the carnal mind against truth, makes errors and mistakes find
easy admission. We do not learn that they rent their clothes when the
people spake of stoning them; but when they spake of worshipping them;
they could not bear it, being more concerned for God's honour than their
own. God's truth needs not the services of man's falsehood. The servants
of God might easily obtain undue honours if they would wink at men's
errors and vices; but they must dread and detest such respect more than
any reproach. When the apostles preached to the Jews, who hated
idolatry, they had only to preach the grace of God in Christ; but when
they had to do with the Gentiles, they must set right their mistakes in
natural religion. Compare their conduct and declaration with the false
opinions of those who think the worship of a God, under any name, or in
any manner, is equally acceptable to the Lord Almighty. The most
powerful arguments, the most earnest and affectionate addresses, even
with miracles, are scarcely enough to keep men from absurdities and
abominations; much less can they, without special grace, turn the hearts
of sinners to God and to holiness.

[Acts 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 14:19</span></span>

See how restless the rage of the Jews was against the gospel of Christ.
The people stoned Paul, in a popular tumult. So strong is the bent of
the corrupt and carnal heart, that as it is with great difficulty that
men are kept back from evil on one side, so it is with great ease they
are persuaded to evil on the other side. If Paul would have been
Mercury, he might have been worshipped; but if he will be a faithful
minister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and thrown out of the city. Thus
men who easily submit to strong delusions, hate to receive the truth in
the love of it. All who are converted need to be confirmed in the faith;
all who are planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work is to establish
saints as well as to awaken sinners. The grace of God, and nothing less,
effectually establishes the souls of the disciples. It is true, we must
count upon much tribulation, but it is encouragement that we shall not
be lost and perish in it. The Person to whose power and grace the
converts and the newly-established churches are commended, clearly was
the Lord Jesus, "on whom they had believed." It was an act of worship.
The praise of all the little good we do at any time, must be ascribed to
God; for it is He who not only worketh in us both to will and to do, but
also worketh with us to make what we do successful. All who love the
Lord Jesus, will rejoice to hear that he has opened the door of faith
wide, to those who were strangers to him and to his salvation. And let
us, like the apostles, abide with those who know and love the Lord.
