### [Numbers Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 7:0</span></span>

([Num 7:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001).md) The offerings of the
princes at the dedication of the tabernacle.

(v. 10-89) The offerings of the princes at the dedication of the altar.

[Numbers 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 7:1</span></span>

The offering of the princes to the service of the tabernacle was not
made till it was fully set up. Necessary observances must always take
place of free-will offerings. The more any are advanced, the greater
opportunity they have of serving God and their generation. No sooner was
the tabernacle set up, than provision is made for the removal of it.
Even when but just settled in the world, we must be preparing for
changes and removes, especially for the great change.

[Numbers 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 7:10</span></span>

The princes and great men were most forward in the service of God. Here
is an example to those in authority, and of the highest rank; they ought
to use their honour and power, their estate and interest, to promote
religion and the service of God in the places where they live. Though it
was a time of joy and rejoicing, yet still, in the midst of their
sacrifices, we find a sin-offering. As, in our best services, we are
conscious that there is sin, there should be repentance, even in our
most joyful services. In all approaches to God we must by faith look to
Christ as the Sin-offering. They brought their offerings each on a day.
God's work should not be done confusedly, or in a hurry; take time, and
we shall have done the sooner, or, at least, we shall have done the
better. If services are to be done for twelve days together, we must not
call it a task and a burden. All their offerings were the same; all the
tribes of Israel had an equal share in the altar, and an equal interest
in the sacrifices offered upon it. He who now spake to Moses, as the
Shechinah or Divine Majesty, from between the Cherubim, was the Eternal
Word, the second Person in the Trinity; for all God's communion with man
is by his Son, by whom he made the world, and rules the church, who is
the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.
