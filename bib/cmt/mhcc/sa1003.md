### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 3:0</span></span>

([Sa1 3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001)) The word of the Lord
first revealed to Samuel.

([Sa1 3:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011)) God tells Samuel the
destruction of Eli's house.

([Sa1 3:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#019)) Samuel established to
be a prophet.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 3:1</span></span>

The call which Divine grace designs shall be made effectual; will be
repeated till it is so, till we come to the call. Eli, perceiving that
it was the voice of God that Samuel heard, instructed him what to say.
Though it was a disgrace to Eli, for God's call to be directed to
Samuel, yet he told him how to meet it. Thus the elder should do their
utmost to assist and improve the younger that are rising up. Let us
never fail to teach those who are coming after us, even such as will
soon be preferred before us, [Joh
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030). Good words should be put into
children's mouths betimes, by which they may be prepared to learn Divine
things, and be trained up to regard them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 3:11</span></span>

What a great deal of guilt and corruption is there in us, concerning
which we may say, It is the iniquity which our own heart knoweth; we are
conscious to ourselves of it! Those who do not restrain the sins of
others, when it is in their power to do it, make themselves partakers of
the guilt, and will be charged as joining in it. In his remarkable
answer to this awful sentence, Eli acknowledged that the Lord had a
right to do as he saw good, being assured that he would do nothing
wrong. The meekness, patience, and humility contained in those words,
show that he was truly repentant; he accepted the punishment of his sin.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 3:19</span></span>

All increase in wisdom and grace, is owing to the presence of God with
us. God will graciously repeat his visits to those who receive them
aright. Early piety will be the greatest honour of young people. Those
who honour God he will honour. Let young people consider the piety of
Samuel, and from him they will learn to remember their Creator in the
days of their youth. Young children are capable of religion. Samuel is a
proof that their waiting upon the Lord will be pleasing to him. He is a
pattern of all those amiable tempers, which are the brightest ornament
of youth, and a sure source of happiness.
