### [Deuteronomy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 3:0</span></span>

([Deu 3:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001).md) The conquest of Og king
of Bashan.

([Deu 3:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012).md) The land of Gilead and
Bashan.

([Deu 3:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#021).md) Moses encourages
Joshua.

[Deuteronomy 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 3:1</span></span>

Og was very powerful, but he did not take warning by the ruin of Sihon,
and desire conditions of peace. He trusted his own strength, and so was
hardened to his destruction. Those not awakened by the judgments of God
on others, ripen for the like judgments on themselves.

[Deuteronomy 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 3:12</span></span>

This country was settled on the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe
of Manasseh: see Numbers 32. Moses repeats the condition of the grant to
which they agreed. When at rest, we should desire to see our brethren at
rest too, and should be ready to do what we can towards it; for we are
not born for ourselves, but are members one of another.

[Deuteronomy 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 3:21</span></span>

Moses encouraged Joshua, who was to succeed him. Thus the aged and
experienced in the service of God, should do all they can to strengthen
the hands of those who are young, and setting out in religion. Consider
what God has done, what God has promised. If God be for us, who can be
against us, so as to prevail? We reproach our Leader if we follow him
trembling. Moses prayed, that, if it were God's will, he might go before
Israel, over Jordan into Canaan. We should never allow any desires in
our hearts, which we cannot in faith offer up to God by prayer. God's
answer to this prayer had a mixture of mercy and judgment. God sees it
good to deny many things we desire. He may accept our prayers, yet not
grant us the very things we pray for. It God does not by his providence
give us what we desire, yet if by his grace he makes us content without,
it comes to much the same. Let it suffice thee to have God for thy
Father, and heaven for thy portion, though thou hast not every thing
thou wouldst have in the world. God promised Moses a sight of Canaan
from the top of Pisgah. Though he should not have the possession of it,
he should have the prospect of it. Even great believers, in this present
state, see heaven but at a distance. God provided him a successor. It is
a comfort to the friends of the church of Christ, to see God's work
likely to be carried on by others, when they are silent in the dust. And
if we have the earnest and prospect of heaven, let these suffice us; let
us submit to the Lord's will, and speak no more to Him of matters which
he sees good to refuse us.
