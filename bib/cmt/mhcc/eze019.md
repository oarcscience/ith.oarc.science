### [Ezekiel Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 19:0</span></span>

([Eze 19:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001).md) A parable lamenting the
ruin of Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim.

([Eze 19:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010).md) Another describing the
desolation of the people.

[Ezekiel 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md)

Ezekiel is to compare the kingdom of Judah to a lioness. He must compare
the kings of Judah to a lion's whelps; they were cruel and oppressive to
their own subjects. The righteousness of God is to be acknowledged, when
those who have terrified and enslaved others, are themselves terrified
and enslaved. When professors of religion form connexions with ungodly
persons, their children usually grow up following after the maxims and
fashions of a wicked world. Advancement to authority discovers the
ambition and selfishness of men's hearts; and those who spend their
lives in mischief, generally end them by violence.

[Ezekiel 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 19:10</span></span>

Jerusalem was a vine, flourishing and fruitful. This vine is now
destroyed, though not plucked up by the roots. She has by wickedness
made herself like tinder to the sparks of God's wrath, so that her own
branches serve as fuel to burn her. Blessed be God, one Branch of the
vine here alluded to, is not only become a strong rod for the sceptre of
those that rule, but is Himself the true and living Vine. This shall be
for a rejoicing to all the chosen people of God throughout all
generations.
