### [Jeremiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 51:0</span></span>

(v. 1-58) Babylon's doom; God's controversy with her; encouragements
from thence to the Israel of God.

([Jer 51:59-64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059).md) The confirming of
this.

[Jeremiah 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 51:1</span></span>

The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed and interwoven, and the
same things left and returned to again. Babylon is abundant in
treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shall secure her.
Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Wherever we are, in the
greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are to remember the Lord
our God; and in the times of the greatest fears and hopes, it is most
needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited by Babylon's fall is
the same with the New Testament Babylon, [Rev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md), [Rev
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#019.md). The ruin of all who support
idolatry, infidelity, and superstition, is needful for the revival of
true godliness; and the threatening prophecies of Scripture yield
comfort in this view. The great seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry,
and superstition, the persecutor of true Christians, is as certainly
doomed to destruction as ancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes
mourn for sin, and seek the Lord. Then will the lost sheep of the house
of Israel be brought back to the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no
more. And the exact fulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us
to faith in all the promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.

[Jeremiah 51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">jer 51:59</span></span>

This prophecy is sent to Babylon, to the captives there, by Seraiah, who
is to read it to his countrymen in captivity. Let them with faith see
the end of these threatening powers, and comfort themselves herewith.
When we see what this world is, how glittering its shows, and how
flattering its proposals, let us read in the book of the Lord that it
shall shortly be desolate. The book must be thrown into the river
Euphrates. The fall of the New Testament Babylon is thus represented,
[Rev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md). Those that sink under the
weight of God's wrath and curse, sink for ever. Babylon, and every
antichrist, will soon sink and rise no more for ever. Let us hope in
God's word, and quietly wait for his salvation; then we shall see, but
shall not share, the destruction of the wicked.
