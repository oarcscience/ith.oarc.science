### [Psalms Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 24:0</span></span>

([Psa 24:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001).md) Concerning the kingdom
of Christ, and the subjects of that kingdom.

([Psa 24:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007).md) Concerning the King of
that kingdom.

[Psalms 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 24:1</span></span>

We ourselves are not our own; our bodies, our souls, are not. Even those
of the children of men are God's, who know him not, nor own their
relation to him. A soul that knows and considers its own nature, and
that it must live for ever, when it has viewed the earth and the fulness
thereof, will sit down unsatisfied. It will think of ascending toward
God, and will ask, What shall I do, that I may abide in that happy, holy
place, where he makes his people holy and happy? We make nothing of
religion, if we do not make heart-work of it. We can only be cleansed
from our sins, and renewed unto holiness, by the blood of Christ and the
washing of the Holy Ghost. Thus we become his people; thus we receive
blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of our salvation.
God's peculiar people shall be made truly and for ever happy. Where God
gives righteousness, he designs salvation. Those that are made meet for
heaven, shall be brought safe to heaven, and will find what they have
been seeking.

[Psalms 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 24:7</span></span>

The splendid entry here described, refers to the solemn bringing in of
the ark into the tent David pitched for it, or the temple Solomon built
for it. We may also apply it to the ascension of Christ into heaven, and
the welcome given to him there. Our Redeemer found the gates of heaven
shut, but having by his blood made atonement for sin, as one having
authority, he demanded entrance. The angels were to worship him, [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md) : they ask with wonder, Who is he?
It is answered, that he is strong and mighty; mighty in battle to save
his people, and to subdue his and their enemies. We may apply it to
Christ's entrance into the souls of men by his word and Spirit, that
they may be his temples. Behold, he stands at the door, and knocks, [Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020.md). The gates and doors of the heart
are to be opened to him, as possession is delivered to the rightful
owner. We may apply it to his second coming with glorious power. Lord,
open the everlasting door of our souls by thy grace, that we may now
receive thee, and be wholly thine; and that, at length, we may be
numbered with thy saints in glory.
