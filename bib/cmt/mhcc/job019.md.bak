### [Job Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 19:0</span></span>

([Job 19:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#001).md) Job complains of unkind
usage.

([Job 19:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#008).md) God was the Author of
his afflictions.

([Job 19:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#023).md) Job's belief in the
resurrection.

[Job 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 19:1</span></span>

Job's friends blamed him as a wicked man, because he was so afflicted;
here he describes their unkindness, showing that what they condemned was
capable of excuse. Harsh language from friends, greatly adds to the
weight of afflictions: yet it is best not to lay it to heart, lest we
harbour resentment. Rather let us look to Him who endured the
contradiction of sinners against himself, and was treated with far more
cruelty than Job was, or we can be.

[Job 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 19:8</span></span>

How doleful are Job's complaints! What is the fire of hell but the wrath
of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do not fear it
now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel it
hereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom God
afflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us which
God makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations and
friends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be our
Friend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we have
to indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseases
it has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of his
friends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing to
one who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and of
inward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, it does
not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir of glory.

[Job 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 19:23</span></span>

The Spirit of God, at this time, seems to have powerfully wrought on the
mind of Job. Here he witnessed a good confession; declared the soundness
of his faith, and the assurance of his hope. Here is much of Christ and
heaven; and he that said such things are these, declared plainly that he
sought the better country, that is, the heavenly. Job was taught of God
to believe in a living Redeemer; to look for the resurrection of the
dead, and the life of the world to come; he comforted himself with the
expectation of these. Job was assured, that this Redeemer of sinners
from the yoke of Satan and the condemnation of sin, was his Redeemer,
and expected salvation through him; and that he was a living Redeemer,
though not yet come in the flesh; and that at the last day he would
appear as the Judge of the world, to raise the dead, and complete the
redemption of his people. With what pleasure holy Job enlarges upon
this! May these faithful sayings be engraved by the Holy Spirit upon our
hearts. We are all concerned to see that the root of the matter be in
us. A living, quickening, commanding principle of grace in the heart, is
the root of the matter; as necessary to our religion as the root of the
tree, to which it owes both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Job and
his friends differed concerning the methods of Providence, but they
agreed in the root of the matter, the belief of another world.
