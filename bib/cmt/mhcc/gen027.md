### [Genesis Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 27:0</span></span>

([Gen 27:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001).md) Isaac sends Esau for
venison.

([Gen 27:6-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#006).md) Rebekah teaches Jacob
to obtain the blessing.

([Gen 27:18-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#018).md) Jacob, pretending to
be Esau, obtains the blessing.

([Gen 27:30-40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#030).md) Isaac's fear, Esau's
importunity.

([Gen 27:41-46](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#041).md) Esau threatens Jacob's
life, Rebekah sends Jacob away.

[Genesis 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 27:1</span></span>

The promises of the Messiah, and of the land of Canaan, had come down to
Isaac. Isaac being now about 135 years of age, and his sons about 75,
and not duly considering the Divine word concerning his two sons, that
the elder should serve the younger, resolved to put all the honour and
power that were in the promise, upon Esau his eldest son. We are very
apt to take measures rather from our own reason than from Divine
revelation, and thereby often miss our way.

[Genesis 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 27:6</span></span>

Rebekah knew that the blessing was intended for Jacob, and expected he
would have it. But she wronged Isaac by putting a cheat on him; she
wronged Jacob by tempting him to wickedness. She put a stumbling-block
in Esau's way, and gave him a pretext for hatred to Jacob and to
religion. All were to be blamed. It was one of those crooked measures
often adopted to further the Divine promises; as if the end would
justify, or excuse wrong means. Thus many have acted wrong, under the
idea of being useful in promoting the cause of Christ. The answer to all
such things is that which God addressed to Abraham, I am God Almighty;
walk before me and be thou perfect. And it was a very rash speech of
Rebekah, "Upon me be thy curse, my son." Christ has borne the curse of
the law for all who take upon them the yoke of the command, the command
of the gospel. But it is too daring for any creature to say, Upon me be
thy curse.

[Genesis 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 27:18</span></span>

Jacob, with some difficulty, gained his point, and got the blessing.
This blessing is in very general terms. No mention is made of the
distinguishing mercies in the covenant with Abraham. This might be owing
to Isaac having Esau in his mind, though it was Jacob who was before
him. He could not be ignorant how Esau had despised the best things.
Moreover, his attachment to Esau, so as to disregard the mind of God,
must have greatly weakened his own faith in these things. It might
therefore be expected, that leanness would attend his blessing, agreeing
with the state of his mind.

[Genesis 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 27:30</span></span>

When Esau understood that Jacob had got the blessing, he cried with a
great and exceeding bitter cry. The day is coming, when those that now
make light of the blessings of the covenant, and sell their title to
spiritual blessings for that which is of no value, will, in vain, ask
urgently for them. Isaac, when made sensible of the deceit practised on
him, trembled exceedingly. Those who follow the choice of their own
affections, rather than the Divine will, get themselves into perplexity.
But he soon recovers, and confirms the blessing he had given to Jacob,
saying, I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed. Those who part with
their wisdom and grace, their faith and a good conscience, for the
honours, wealth, or pleasures of this world, however they feign a zeal
for the blessing, have judged themselves unworthy of it, and their doom
shall be accordingly. A common blessing was bestowed upon Esau. This he
desired. Faint desires of happiness, without right choice of the end,
and right use of the means, deceive many unto their own ruin. Multitudes
go to hell with their mouths full of good wishes. The great difference
is, that there is nothing in Esau's blessing which points at Christ; and
without that, the fatness of the earth, and the plunder of the field,
will stand in little stead. Thus Isaac, by faith, blessed both his sons,
according as their lot should be.

[Genesis 27:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">gen 27:41</span></span>

Esau bore malice to Jacob on account of the blessing he had obtained.
Thus he went in the way of Cain, who slew his brother, because he gained
that acceptance with God of which he had rendered himself unworthy. Esau
aimed to prevent Jacob or his seed from having the dominion, by taking
away his life. Men may fret at God's counsels, but cannot change them.
To prevent mischief, Rebekah warned Jacob of his danger, and advised him
to withdraw for his safety. We must not presume too far upon the wisdom
and resolution, even of the most hopeful and promising children; but
care must be taken to keep them out of the way of evil. When reading
this chapter, we should not fail to observe, that we must not follow
even the best of men further than they act according to the law of God.
We must not do evil that good may come. And though God overruled the bad
actions recorded in this chapter, to fulfil his purposes, yet we see his
judgment of them, in the painful consequences to all the parties
concerned. It was the peculiar privilege and advantage of Jacob to
convey these spiritual blessings to all nations. The Christ, the Saviour
of the world, was to be born of some one family; and Jacob's was
preferred to Esau's, out of the good pleasure of Almighty God, who is
certainly the best judge of what is fit, and has an undoubted right to
dispense his favours as he sees proper, [Rom
9:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012.md).
