[1 Peter](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pe1 0:0</span></span>

The same great doctrines, as in St. Paul's epistles, are here applied to
same practical purposes. And this epistle is remarkable for the
sweetness, gentleness, and humble love, with which it is written. It
gives a short, and yet a very clear summary, both of the consolations
and the instructions needful for the encouragement and direction of a
Christian in his journey to heaven, raising his thoughts and desires to
that happiness, and strengthening him against all opposition in the way,
both from corruption within, and temptations and afflictions without.
