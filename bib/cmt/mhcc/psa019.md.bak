[Psalms 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 19:7</span></span>

The Holy Scripture is of much greater benefit to us than day or night,
than the air we breathe, or the light of the sun. To recover man out of
his fallen state, there is need of the word of God. The word translated
"law," may be rendered doctrine, and be understood as meaning all that
teaches us true religion. The whole is perfect; its tendency is to
convert or turn the soul from sin and the world, to God and holiness. It
shows our sinfulness and misery in departing from God, and the necessity
of our return to him. This testimony is sure, to be fully depended on:
the ignorant and unlearned believing what God saith, become wise unto
salvation. It is a sure direction in the way of duty. It is a sure
fountain of living comforts, and a sure foundation of lasting hopes. The
statues of the Lord are right, just as they should be; and, because they
are right, they rejoice the heart. The commandments of the Lord are
pure, holy, just, and good. By them we discover our need of a Saviour;
and then learn how to adorn his gospel. They are the means which the
Holy Spirit uses in enlightening the eyes; they bring us to a sight and
sense of our sin and misery, and direct us in the way of duty. The fear
of the Lord, that is, true religion and godliness, is clean, it will
cleanse our way; and it endureth for ever. The ceremonial law is long
since done away, but the law concerning the fear of God is ever the
same. The judgments of the Lord, his precepts, are true; they are
righteous, and they are so altogether; there is no unrighteousness in
any of them. Gold is only for the body, and the concerns of time; but
grace is for the soul, and the concerns of eternity. The word of God,
received by faith, is more precious than gold; it is sweet to the soul,
sweeter than honey. The pleasure of sense soon surfeit, yet never
satisfy; but those of religion are substantial and satisfying; there is
no danger of excess.

[Psalms 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 19:11</span></span>

God's word warns the wicked not to go on in his wicked way, and warns
the righteous not to turn from his good way. There is a reward, not only
after keeping, but in keeping God's commandments. Religion makes our
comforts sweet, and our crosses easy, life truly valuable, and death
itself truly desirable. David not only desired to be pardoned and
cleansed from the sins he had discovered and confessed, but from those
he had forgotten or overlooked. All discoveries of sin made to us by the
law, should drive us to the throne of grace, there to pray. His
dependence was the same with that of every Christian who says, Surely in
the Lord Jesus have I righteousness and strength. No prayer can be
acceptable before God which is not offered in the strength of our
Redeemer or Divine Kinsman, through Him who took our nature upon him,
that he might redeem us unto God, and restore the long-lost inheritance.
May our hearts be much affected with the excellence of the word of God;
and much affected with the evil of sin, and the danger we are in of it,
and the danger we are in by it.

[Psalms 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 19:1</span></span>

The heavens so declare the glory of God, and proclaim his wisdom, power,
and goodness, that all ungodly men are left without excuse. They speak
themselves to be works of God's hands; for they must have a Creator who
is eternal, infinitely wise, powerful, and good. The counter-changing of
day and night is a great proof of the power of God, and calls us to
observe, that, as in the kingdom of nature, so in that of providence, he
forms the light, and creates the darkness, [Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md), and sets the one against the
other. The sun in the firmament is an emblem of the Sun of
righteousness, the Bridegroom of the church, and the Light of the world,
diffusing Divine light and salvation by his gospel to the nations of the
earth. He delights to bless his church, which he has espoused to
himself; and his course will be unwearied as that of the sun, till the
whole earth is filled with his light and salvation. Let us pray for the
time when he shall enlighten, cheer, and make fruitful every nation on
earth, with the blessed salvation. They have no speech or language, so
some read it, and yet their voice is heard. All people may hear these
preachers speak in their own tongue the wonderful works of God. Let us
give God the glory of all the comfort and benefit we have by the lights
of heaven, still looking above and beyond them to the Sun of
righteousness.
