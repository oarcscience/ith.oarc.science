Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine
rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations
of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that
the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the
city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped
in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think
to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By
what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each
other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be
brought to Babylon, [Jer 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005.md); [Jer
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003.md); Ezekiel, that he should not see
Babylon, [Eze 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md). He was brought
thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 25:8</span></span>

The city and temple were burnt, and, it is probable, the ark in it. By
this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his
worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of
Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon.
The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified
were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was
righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who
had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many
altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that
sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all
unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him
up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon
guilty nations, churches, or persons.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 25:22</span></span>

The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protector
of the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were so
hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off.
Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of
Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by
their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah ch. 40-45. Jehoiachin was
released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say
that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little
but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give
to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to
the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the
Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks
him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand
for evermore. Sin alone can hurt us; Jesus alone can do good to sinners.
