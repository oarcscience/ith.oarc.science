### [Ezra Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001.md)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 8:0</span></span>

[Ezra 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 8:1</span></span>

Ezra assembles the outcasts of Israel, and the dispersed of Judah. God
raised up the spirits of a small remnant to accompany him. What a pity
that good men should omit a good work, for want of being spoken to!

[Ezra 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 8:21</span></span>

Ezra procured Levites to go with him; but what will that avail, unless
he have God with him? Those who seek God, are safe under the shadow of
his wings, even in their greatest dangers; but those who forsake him,
are always exposed. When entering upon any new state of life, our care
should be, to bring none of the guilt of the sins of our former
condition into it. When we are in any peril, let us be at peace with
God, and then nothing can do us any real hurt. All our concerns about
ourselves, our families, and our estates, it is our wisdom and duty, by
prayer to commit to God, and to leave the care of them with him. And, on
some occasions, we should decline advantages which are within our reach,
lest we should cause others to stumble, and so our God be dishonoured.
Let us ask wisdom of God, that we may know how to use or to refuse
lawful things. We shall be no losers by venturing, suffering, or giving
up for the Lord's sake. Their prayers were answered, and the event
declared it. Never have any that sought God in earnest, found that they
sought him in vain. In times of difficulty and danger, to set a season
apart for secret or for social prayer, is the best method for relief we
can take.

[Ezra 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ezr 8:24</span></span>

Do we expect that God should, by his providence, keep that which belongs
to us, let us, by his grace, keep that which belongs to him. Let God's
honour and interest be our care; and then we may expect that our lives
and comforts will be his.

[Ezra 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ezr 8:31</span></span>

Enemies laid wait for the Jews, but God protected them. Even the common
perils of journeys, call us to go out with prayer, and to return with
praise and thanksgiving. But what shall we render when the Lord has led
us safely through the pilgrimage of life, through the gloomy vale of
death, out of the reach of all our enemies, into everlasting happiness!
Among their sacrifices they had a sin-offering. The atonement sweetens
and secures every mercy to us, which will not be truly comfortable,
unless sin be taken away, and our peace made with God. Then had the
church rest. The expressions here used, direct us to the deliverance of
sinners from spiritual bondage, and their pilgrimage to the heavenly
Jerusalem, under the care and protection of their God and Saviour.
