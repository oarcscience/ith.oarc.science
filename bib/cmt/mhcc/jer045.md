### [Jeremiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 45:0</span></span>

An encouragement sent to Baruch.

[Jeremiah 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 45:1</span></span>

Baruch was employed in writing Jeremiah's prophecies, and reading them,
see Jeremiah 36, and was threatened for it by the king. Young beginners
in religion are apt to be discouraged with little difficulties, which
they commonly meet with at first in the service of God. These complaints
and fears came from his corruptions. Baruch had raised his expectations
too high in this world, and that made the distress and trouble he was in
harder to be borne. The frowns of the world would not disquiet us, if we
did not foolishly flatter ourselves with the hopes of its smiles, and
court and covet them. What a folly is it then to seek great things for
ourselves here, where every thing is little, and nothing certain! The
Lord knows the real cause of our fretfulness and despondency better than
we do, and we should beg of him to examine our hearts, and to repress
every wrong desire in us.
