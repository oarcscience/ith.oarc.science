### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 19:0</span></span>

([Sa2 19:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001)) Joab causes David to
cease mourning.

([Sa2 19:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009)) David returns to
Jordan.

([Sa2 19:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016)) He pardons Shimei.

([Sa2 19:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024)) Mephibosheth excused.

([Sa2 19:31-39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031)) David's parting with
Barzillai.

([Sa2 19:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#040)) Israel quarrels with
Judah.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 19:1</span></span>

To continue to lament for so bad a son as Absalom, was very unwise, and
very unworthy. Joab censures David, but not with proper respect and
deference to his sovereign. A plain case may be fairly pleaded with
those above us, and they may be reproved for what they do amiss, but it
must not be with rudeness and insolence. Yet David took the reproof and
the counsel, prudently and mildly. Timely giving way, usually prevents
the ill effects of mistaken measures.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 19:9</span></span>

God's providence, by the priests' persuasions and Amasa's interest,
brought the people to resolve the recall of the king. David stirred not
till he received this invitation. Our Lord Jesus will rule in those that
invite him to the throne in their hearts, and not till he is invited. He
first bows the heart, and makes it willing in the day of his power, then
rules in the midst of his enemies, [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002), [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 19:16</span></span>

Those who now slight and abuse the Son of David, would be glad to make
their peace when he shall come in his glory; but it will be too late.
Shimei lost no time. His abuse had been personal, and with the usual
right feeling of good men, David could more easily forgive it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 19:24</span></span>

David recalls the forfeiture of Mephibosheth's estate; and he expressed
joy for the king's return. A good man contentedly bears his own losses,
while he sees Israel in peace, and the Son of David exalted.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 19:31</span></span>

Barzillai thought he had done himself honour in doing the king any
service. Thus, when the saints shall be called to inherit the kingdom,
they will be amazed at the recompence being so very far beyond the
service, [Mat 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#037). A good man would
not go any where to be burdensome; or, will rather be so to his own
house than to another's. It is good for all, but especially becomes old
people, to think and speak much of dying. The grave is ready for me, let
me go and get ready for it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">sa2 19:40</span></span>

The men of Israel though themselves despised, and the fiercer words of
the men of Judah produced very bad effects. Much evil might be avoided,
if men would watch against pride, and remember that a soft answer
turneth away wrath. Though we have right and reason on our side, if we
speak it with fierceness, God is displeased.
