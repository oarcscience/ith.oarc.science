The second epistle to the Thessalonians was written soon after the
first. The apostle was told that, from some expressions in his first
letter, many expected the second coming of Christ was at hand, and that
the day of judgment would arrive in their time. Some of these neglected
their worldly duties. St. Paul wrote again to correct their error, which
hindered the spread of the gospel. He had written agreeably to the words
of the prophets of the Old Testament; and he tells them there were many
counsels of the Most High yet to be fulfilled, before that day of the
Lord should come, though, because it is sure, he had spoken of it as
near. The subject led to a remarkable foretelling, of some of the future
events which were to take place in the after-ages of the Christian
church, and which show the prophetic spirit the apostle possessed.
