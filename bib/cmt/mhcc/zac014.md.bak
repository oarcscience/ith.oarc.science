### [Zechariah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 14:0</span></span>

([Zac 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001).md) The sufferings of
Jerusalem.

([Zac 14:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008).md) Encouraging prospects,
and the destruction of her enemies.

([Zac 14:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md) The holiness of the
latter days.

[Zechariah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 14:1</span></span>

The Lord Jesus often stood upon the Mount of Olives when on earth. He
ascended from thence to heaven, and then desolations and distresses came
upon the Jewish nation. Such is the view taken of this figuratively; but
many consider it as a notice of events yet unfulfilled, and that it
relates to troubles of which we cannot now form a full idea. Every
believer, being related to God as his God, may triumph in the
expectation of Christ's coming in power, and speak of it with pleasure.
During a long season, the state of the church would be deformed by sin;
there would be a mixture of truth and error, of happiness and misery.
Such is the experience of God's people, a mingled state of grace and
corruption. But, when the season is at the worst, and most unpromising,
the Lord will turn darkness into light; deliverance comes when God's
people have done looking for it.

[Zechariah 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 14:8</span></span>

Some consider that the progress of the gospel, beginning from Jerusalem,
is referred to by the living waters flowing from that city. Neither
shall the gospel and means of grace, nor the graces of the Spirit
wrought in the hearts of believers by those means, ever fail, by reason
either of the heat of persecution, or storms of temptation, or the
blasts of any other affliction. Tremendous judgments appear to be
foretold, to be sent upon those who should oppose the settlement of the
Jews in their own land. How far they are to be understood literally,
events alone can determine. The furious rage and malice which stir up
men against each other, are faint shadows of the enmity which reigns
among those who have perished in their sins. Even the inferior creatures
often suffer for the sin of man, and in his plagues. Thus God will show
his displeasure against sin.

[Zechariah 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 14:16</span></span>

As it is impossible for all nations literally to come to Jerusalem once
a year, to keep a feast, it is evident that a figurative meaning must
here be applied. Gospel worship is represented by the keeping of the
feast of tabernacles. Every day of a Christian's life is a day of the
feast of tabernacles; every Lord's day especially is the great day of
the feast; therefore every day let us worship the Lord of hosts, and
keep every Lord's day with peculiar solemnity. It is just for God to
withhold the blessings of grace from those who do not attend the means
of grace. It is a sin that is its own punishment; those who forsake the
duty, forfeit the privilege of communion with God. A time of complete
peace and purity of the church will arrive. Men will carry on their
common affairs, and their sacred services, upon the same holy principles
of faith, love and obedience. Real holiness shall be more diffused,
because there shall be a more plentiful pouring forth of the Spirit of
holiness than ever before. There shall be holiness even in common
things. Every action and every enjoyment of the believer, should be so
regulated according to the will of God, that it may be directed to his
glory. Our whole lives should be as one constant sacrifice, or act of
devotion; no selfish motive should prevail in any of our actions. But
how far is the Christian church from this state of purity! Other times,
however, are at hand, and the Lord will reform and enlarge his church,
as he has promised. Yet in heaven alone will perfect holiness and
happiness be found.
