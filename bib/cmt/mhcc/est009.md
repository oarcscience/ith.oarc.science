### [Esther Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001.md)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 9:0</span></span>

(v. 1-19) The success of the Jews.

([Est 9:20-32](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020).md) The feast of Purim in
remembrance of this.

[Esther 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 9:1</span></span>

The enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them by the former
edict. If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, they
would not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together,
strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, and
with one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, who
endeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than our lives.
The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt of wordly
wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothing except their
own preservation. In every case the people of God should manifest
humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantages which
might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festival the day
after they had finished their work. When we have received great mercies
from God, we ought to be speedy in making thankful returns to him.

[Esther 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">est 9:20</span></span>

The observance of the Jewish feasts, is a public declaration of the
truth of the Old Testament Scriptures. And as the Old Testament
Scriptures are true, the Messiah expected by the Jews is come long ago;
and none but Jesus of Nazareth can be that Messiah. The festival was
appointed by authority, yet under the direction of the Spirit of God. It
was called the feast of Purim, from a Persian word, which signifies a
lot. The name of this festival would remind them of the almighty power
of the God of Israel, who served his own purposes by the superstitions
of the heathen. In reviewing our mercies, we should advert to former
fears and distresses. When our mercies are personal, we should not by
forgetfulness lose the comfort of them, or withhold from the Lord the
glory due to his name. May the Lord teach us to rejoice, with that holy
joy which anticipates and prepares for the blessedness of heaven. Every
instance of Divine goodness to ourselves, is a new obligation laid on us
to do good, to those especially who most need our bounty. Above all,
redemption by Christ binds us to be merciful, [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md).
