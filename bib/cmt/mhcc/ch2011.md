### [2 Chronicles Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 11:0</span></span>

([Ch2 11:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001).md) Rehoboam forbidden to
war against Israel.

([Ch2 11:13-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013).md) The priests and
Levites find refuge in Judah.

[2 Chronicles 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 11:1</span></span>

A few good words might have prevented the rebellion of Rehoboam's
subjects; but all the force of his kingdom cannot bring them back. And
it is in vain to contend with the purpose of God, when it is made known
to us. Even those who are destitute of true faith, will at times pay
some regard to the word of God, and be kept by it from wrong actions, to
which they are prone by nature.

[2 Chronicles 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 11:13</span></span>

When the priests and Levites came to Jerusalem, the devout, pious
Israelites followed them. Such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God
of Israel, left the inheritance of their fathers, and went to Jerusalem,
that they might have free access to the altar of God, and be out of the
temptation to worship the calves. That is best for us, which is best for
our souls; in all our choices, religious advantages must be sought
before all outward conveniences. Where God's faithful priests are, his
faithful people should be. And when it has been proved that we are
willing to renounce our worldly interests, so far as we are called to do
so for the sake of Christ and his gospel, we have good evidence that we
are truly his disciples. And it is the interest of a nation to protect
religion and religious people.
