### [Nehemiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 9:0</span></span>

([Neh 9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001).md) A solemn fast.

(v. 4-38) Prayer and confession of sin.

[Nehemiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 9:1</span></span>

The word will direct and quicken prayer, for by it the Spirit helps our
infirmities in prayer. The careful study of God's word will more and
more discover to us our own sinfulness, and the plenteousness of his
salvation; thus it calls us to mourn for sin, and to rejoice in him.
Every discovery of the truth of God, should render us more unwearied in
attendance on his sacred word, and on his worship.

[Nehemiah 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 9:4</span></span>

The summary of their prayers we have here upon record. Much more, no
doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of
duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it.
When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that
we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed
his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The
testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the
prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they
were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received
accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the
feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which
nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a
specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our
own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask
what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be
kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and
obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to
persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to
fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to
pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness,
let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and
find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.
