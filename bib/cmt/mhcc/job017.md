### [Job Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 17:0</span></span>

([Job 17:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001).md) Job appeals from man to
God.

([Job 17:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010).md) His hope is not in
life, but in death.

[Job 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 17:1</span></span>

Job reflects upon the harsh censures his friends had passed upon him,
and, looking on himself as a dying man, he appeals to God. Our time is
ending. It concerns us carefully to redeem the days of time, and to
spend them in getting ready for eternity. We see the good use the
righteous should make of Job's afflictions from God, from enemies, and
from friends. Instead of being discouraged in the service of God, by the
hard usage this faithful servant of God met with, they should be made
bold to proceed and persevere therein. Those who keep their eye upon
heaven as their end, will keep their feet in the paths of religion as
their way, whatever difficulties and discouragements they may meet with.

[Job 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 17:10</span></span>

Job's friends had pretended to comfort him with the hope of his return
to a prosperous estate; he here shows that those do not go wisely about
the work of comforting the afflicted, who fetch their comforts from the
possibility of recovery in this world. It is our wisdom to comfort
ourselves, and others, in distress, with that which will not fail; the
promise of God, his love and grace, and a well-grounded hope of eternal
life. See how Job reconciles himself to the grave. Let this make
believers willing to die; it is but going to bed; they are weary, and it
is time that they were in their beds. Why should not they go willingly
when their Father calls them? Let us remember our bodies are allied to
corruption, the worm and the dust; and let us seek for that lively hope
which shall be fulfilled, when the hope of the wicked shall be put out
in darkness; that when our bodies are in the grave, our souls may enjoy
the rest reserved for the people of God.
