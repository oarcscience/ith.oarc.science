### [Psalms Chapter 76](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 76:0</span></span>

([Psa 76:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001).md) The psalmist speaks of
God's power.

([Psa 76:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007).md) All have to fear and to
trust in him.

[Psalms 76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 76:1</span></span>

Happy people are those who have their land filled with the knowledge of
God! happy persons that have their hearts filled with that knowledge! It
is the glory and happiness of a people to have God among them by his
ordinances. Wherein the enemies of the church deal proudly, it will
appear that God is above them. See the power of God's rebukes. With
pleasure may Christians apply this to the advantages bestowed by the
Redeemer.

[Psalms 76:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 76:7</span></span>

God's people are the meek of the earth, the quiet in the land, that
suffer wrong, but do none. The righteous God seems to keep silence long,
yet, sooner or later, he will make judgment to be heard. We live in an
angry, provoking world; we often feel much, and are apt to fear more,
from the wrath of man. What will not turn to his praise, shall not be
suffered to break out. He can set bounds to the wrath of man, as he does
to the raging sea; hitherto it shall come, and no further. Let all
submit to God. Our prayers and praises, and especially our hearts, are
the presents we should bring to the Lord. His name is glorious, and he
is the proper object of our fear. He shall cut off the spirit of
princes; he shall slip it off easily, as we slip off a flower from the
stalk, or a bunch of grapes from the vine; so the word signifies. He can
dispirit the most daring: since there is no contending with God, it is
our wisdom, as it is our duty, to submit to him. Let us seek his favour
as our portion, and commit all our concerns to him.
