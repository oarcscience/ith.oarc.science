### [Isaiah Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 56:0</span></span>

([Isa 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md), [Isa
56:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#002).md) A charge to keep the Divine
precepts.

([Isa 56:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003).md) Blessings promised.

([Isa 56:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#009).md) Reproof to the careless
watchmen, the teachers and rulers of the Jews.

[Isaiah 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 56:1</span></span>

The Lord tells us what are his expectations of duty from us. Be honest
and just in all dealings. Also strictly observe the sabbath day. To have
the blessing of God upon employments all the week, make conscience of
keeping the sabbath holy. Have nothing to do with sin. Blessed is the
man that keeps his hand from all things displeasing to God and hurtful
to his own soul. Those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of
righteousness by faith, will be found walking in ways of holy obedience.

[Isaiah 56:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 56:3</span></span>

Unbelief often suggests things to discourage believers, against which
God has expressly guarded. Spiritual blessings are unspeakably better
than having sons and daughters; for children are a care, and may prove a
grief and shame, but the blessings we partake of in God's house, are
comforts which cannot be made bitter. Those who love the Lord truly,
will serve him faithfully, and then his commandments are not grievous.
Three things are promised. Assistance: I will not only bid them welcome,
but incline them to come. Acceptance, and comfort: though they came
mourning to the house of prayer, they shall go away rejoicing. They
shall find ease by casting their cares and burdens upon God. Many a
sorrowful spirit has been made joyful in the house of prayer. The
Gentiles shall be one body with the Jews, that, as Christ says, [Joh
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md), there may be one fold and one
Shepherd. Thanks be to God that none are separated from him except by
wilful sin and unbelief; and if we come to him, we shall be accepted
through the sacrifice of our great High Priest.

[Isaiah 56:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 56:9</span></span>

Desolating judgments are called for; and this severe rebuke of the
rulers and teachers of the Jewish church, is applicable to other ages
and places. It is bad with a people when their shepherds slumber, and
are eager after the world. Let us pray the Great Shepherd to send us
pastors after his own heart, who will feed us with knowledge, that we
may rejoice in his holy name, and that believers may be daily added to
the church.
