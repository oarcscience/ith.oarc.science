### [Psalms Chapter 109](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 109:0</span></span>

([Psa 109:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001).md) David complains of his
enemies.

([Psa 109:6-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006).md) He prophesies their
destruction.

([Psa 109:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021).md) Prayers and praises.

[Psalms 109:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 109:1</span></span>

It is the unspeakable comfort of all believers, that whoever is against
them, God is for them; and to him they may apply as to one pleased to
concern himself for them. David's enemies laughed at him for his
devotion, but they could not laugh him out of it.

[Psalms 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 109:6</span></span>

The Lord Jesus may speak here as a Judge, denouncing sentence on some of
his enemies, to warn others. When men reject the salvation of Christ,
even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some
to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to
ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty,
shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous,
destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, "Go, ye
cursed," upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! How it will affect the
senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, with pain, anguish,
horror, and despair! Think on these things, sinners, tremble and repent.

[Psalms 109:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 109:21</span></span>

The psalmist takes God's comforts to himself, but in a very humble
manner. He was troubled in mind. His body was wasted, and almost worn
away. But it is better to have leanness in the body, while the soul
prospers and is in health, than to have leanness in the soul, while the
body is feasted. He was ridiculed and reproached by his enemies. But if
God bless us, we need not care who curses us; for how can they curse
whom God has not cursed; nay, whom he has blessed? He pleads God's
glory, and the honour of his name. Save me, not according to my merit,
for I pretend to none, but according to thy-mercy. He concludes with the
joy of faith, in assurance that his present conflicts would end in
triumphs. Let all that suffer according to the will of God, commit the
keeping of their souls to him. Jesus, unjustly put to death, and now
risen again, is an Advocate and Intercessor for his people, ever ready
to appear on their behalf against a corrupt world, and the great
accuser.
