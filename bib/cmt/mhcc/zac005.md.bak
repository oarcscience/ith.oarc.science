### [Zechariah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 5:0</span></span>

([Zac 5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001).md) The vision of a flying
roll.

([Zac 5:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005).md) The vision of a woman
and an ephah.

[Zechariah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 5:1</span></span>

The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are rolls, in which God has
written the great things of his law and gospel; they are flying rolls.
God's word runs very swiftly, [Psa
147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015.md). This flying roll contains a
declaration of the righteous wrath of God against sinners. Oh that we
saw with an eye of faith the flying roll of God's curse hanging over the
guilty world as a thick cloud, not only keeping off the sunbeams of
God's favour, but big with thunders, lightnings, and storms, ready to
destroy them! How welcome then would the tidings of a Saviour be, who
came to redeem us from the curse of the law, being himself made a curse
for us! Sin is the ruin of houses and families; especially the doing
hurt to others and false witness. Who knows the power of God's anger?
God's curse cannot be kept out by bars or locks. While one part of the
curse of God ruins the substance of the sinner, another part will rest
on the soul, and sink it to everlasting punishment. All are
transgressors of the law, so we cannot escape this wrath of God, except
we flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us in the gospel.

[Zechariah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 5:5</span></span>

In this vision the prophet sees an ephah, something in the shape of a
corn measure. This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling the
measure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be delivered
into the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The woman
sitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church and
nation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon the
sinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seems
to mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure of
their iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel.
Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carried
away to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should be hurried
out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, as they had
been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, and their
sufferings shall continue far longer than in their late captivity.
Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upon their own
unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against the day of
wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measure fills.
