### [Isaiah Chapter 54](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 54:0</span></span>

([Isa 54:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001).md) The increase of the
church by the conversion of the Jews and Gentiles.

([Isa 54:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006).md) Its certain
deliverance.

([Isa 54:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011).md) Its triumphant state
is described.

[Isaiah 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 54:1</span></span>

Observe the low state of religion in the world, for a long time before
Christianity was brought in. But by preaching the gospel, multitudes
were converted from idols to the living God. This is matter of great
rejoicing to the church. The bounds of the church were extended. Though
its state on earth is but mean and movable, like a tent or tabernacle,
it is sometimes a growing state, and must be enlarged as the family
increases. But the more numerous the church grows, the more she must
fortify herself against errors and corruptions. Thy Maker is thy
Husband. Christ is the Holy One of Israel, the Mediator of the covenant
made with the Old Testament church. Long he had been called the God of
Israel; but now he shall be called the God of the whole earth. And he
will cleanse from sin, and cause every true believer to rejoice in this
sacred union. We never can enough admire this mercy, or duly value this
privilege.

[Isaiah 54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 54:6</span></span>

As God is slow to anger, so he is swift to show mercy. And how sweet the
returns of mercy would be, when God should come and comfort them! He
will have mercy on them. God's gathering his people takes rise from his
mercy, not any merit of theirs; and it is with great mercies, with
everlasting kindness. The wrath is little, the mercies great; the wrath
for a moment, the kindness everlasting. We are neither to despond under
afflictions, nor to despair of relief. Mountains have been shaken and
removed, but the promises of God never were broken by any event.
Mountains and hills also signify great men. Creature-confidences shall
fail; but when our friends fail us, our God does not. All this is alike
applicable to the church at large, and to each believer. God will rebuke
and correct his people for sins; but he will not cast them off. Let this
encourage us to give the more diligence to make our calling and election
sure.

[Isaiah 54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 54:11</span></span>

Let the people of God, when afflicted and tossed, think they hear God
speaking comfortably to them by these words, taking notice of their
griefs and fears. The church is all glorious when full of the knowledge
of God; for none teaches like him. It is a promise of the teaching and
gifts of the Holy Spirit. All that are taught of God are taught to love
one another. This seems to relate especially to the glorious times to
succeed the tribulations of the church. Holiness, more than any thing,
is the beauty of the church. God promises protection. There shall be no
fears within; there shall be no fightings without. Military men value
themselves on their splendid titles, but God calls them, "Wasters made
to destroy," for they make wasting and destruction their business. He
created them, therefore he will serve his own designs by them. The day
is coming when God will reckon with wicked men for their hard speeches,
[Jde 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md). Security and final victory
are the heritage of each faithful servant of the Lord. The righteousness
by which they are justified, and the grace by which they are sanctified,
are the gift of God, and the effect of his special love. Let us beseech
him to sanctify our souls, and to employ us in his service.
