### [2 Chronicles Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death.

[2 Chronicles 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 16:1</span></span>

A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord,
for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he is distrusted,
and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness.
It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to
rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of
all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a
powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God
to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts
are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need
drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt
to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof.
What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power
for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further
for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was
diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but
trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from
God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we
need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect
towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.
