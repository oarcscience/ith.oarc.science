### [Mark Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 0:0</span></span>

Mark was a sister's son to Barnabas, [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md); and [Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md) shows that he was the son of
Mary, a pious woman of Jerusalem, at whose house the apostles and first
Christians assembled. From Peter's styling him his son, [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md), the evangelist is supposed to
have been converted by that apostle. Thus Mark was closely united with
the followers of our Lord, if not himself one of the number. Mark wrote
at Rome; some suppose that Peter dictated to him, though the general
testimony is, that the apostle having preached at Rome, Mark, who was
the apostle's companion, and had a clear understanding of what Peter
delivered, was desired to commit the particulars to writing. And we may
remark, that the great humility of Peter is very plain where any thing
is said about himself. Scarcely an action or a work of Christ is
mentioned, at which this apostle was not present, and the minuteness
shows that the facts were related by an eye-witness. This Gospel records
more of the miracles than of the discourses of our Lord, and though in
many things it relates the same things as the Gospel according to St.
Matthew, we may reap advantages from reviewing the same events, placed
by each of the evangelists in that point of view which most affected his
own mind.
