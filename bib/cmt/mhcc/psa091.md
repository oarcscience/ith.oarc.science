### [Psalms Chapter 91](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 91:0</span></span>

([Psa 91:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001).md) The safety of those who
have God for their refuge.

([Psa 91:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009).md) Their favour with Him.

[Psalms 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 91:1</span></span>

He that by faith chooses God for his protector, shall find all in him
that he needs or can desire. And those who have found the comfort of
making the Lord their refuge, cannot but desire that others may do so.
The spiritual life is protected by Divine grace from the temptations of
Satan, which are as the snares of the fowler, and from the contagion of
sin, which is a noisome pestilence. Great security is promised to
believers in the midst of danger. Wisdom shall keep them from being
afraid without cause, and faith shall keep them from being unduly
afraid. Whatever is done, our heavenly Father's will is done; and we
have no reason to fear. God's people shall see, not only God's promises
fulfilled, but his threatenings. Then let sinners come unto the Lord
upon his mercy-seat, through the Redeemer's name; and encourage others
to trust in him also.

[Psalms 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 91:9</span></span>

Whatever happens, nothing shall hurt the believer; though trouble and
affliction befall, it shall come, not for his hurt, but for good, though
for the present it be not joyous but grievous. Those who rightly know
God, will set their love upon him. They by prayer constantly call upon
him. His promise is, that he will in due time deliver the believer out
of trouble, and in the mean time be with him in trouble. The Lord will
manage all his worldly concerns, and preserve his life on earth, so long
as it shall be good for him. For encouragement in this he looks unto
Jesus. He shall live long enough; till he has done the work he was sent
into this world for, and is ready for heaven. Who would wish to live a
day longer than God has some work to do, either by him or upon him? A
man may die young, yet be satisfied with living. But a wicked man is not
satisfied even with long life. At length the believer's conflict ends;
he has done for ever with trouble, sin, and temptation.
