### [Matthew Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 15:0</span></span>

([Mat 15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001).md) Jesus discourses about
human traditions.

([Mat 15:10-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#010).md) He warns against
things which really defile.

([Mat 15:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021).md) He heals the daughter
of a Syrophenician woman.

([Mat 15:29-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#029).md) Jesus heals the sick,
and miraculously feeds four thousand.

[Matthew 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 15:1</span></span>

Additions to God's laws reflect upon his wisdom, as if he had left out
something which was needed, and which man could supply; in one way or
other they always lead men to disobey God. How thankful ought we to be
for the written word of God! Never let us think that the religion of the
Bible can be improved by any human addition, either in doctrine or
practice. Our blessed Lord spoke of their traditions as inventions of
their own, and pointed out one instance in which this was very clear,
that of their transgressing the fifth commandment. When a parent's wants
called for assistance, they pleaded, that they had devoted to the temple
all they could spare, even though they did not part with it, and
therefore their parents must expect nothing from them. This was making
the command of God of no effect. The doom of hypocrites is put in a
little compass; "In vain do they worship me." It will neither please
God, nor profit themselves; they trust in vanity, and vanity will be
their recompence.

[Matthew 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 15:10</span></span>

Christ shows that the defilement they ought to fear, was not from what
entered their mouths as food, but from what came out of their mouths,
which showed the wickedness of their hearts. Nothing will last in the
soul but the regenerating graces of the Holy Spirit; and nothing should
be admitted into the church but what is from above; therefore, whoever
is offended by a plain, seasonable declaration of the truth, we should
not be troubled at it. The disciples ask to be better taught as to this
matter. Where a weak head doubts concerning any word of Christ, an
upright heart and a willing mind seek for instruction. It is the heart
that is desperately wicked, [Jer 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009.md),
for there is no sin in word or deed, which was not first in the heart.
They all come out of the man, and are fruits of that wickedness which is
in the heart, and is wrought there. When Christ teaches, he will show
men the deceitfulness and wickedness of their own hearts; he will teach
them to humble themselves, and to seek to be cleansed in the Fountain
opened for sin and uncleanness.

[Matthew 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 15:21</span></span>

The dark corners of the country, the most remote, shall share Christ's
influences; afterwards the ends of the earth shall see his salvation.
The distress and trouble of her family brought a woman to Christ; and
though it is need that drives us to Christ, yet we shall not therefore
be driven from him. She did not limit Christ to any particular instance
of mercy, but mercy, mercy, is what she begged for: she pleads not
merit, but depends upon mercy. It is the duty of parents to pray for
their children, and to be earnest in prayer for them, especially for
their souls. Have you a son, a daughter, grievously vexed with a proud
devil, an unclean devil, a malicious devil, led captive by him at his
will? this is a case more deplorable than that of bodily possession, and
you must bring them by faith and prayer to Christ, who alone is able to
heal them. Many methods of Christ's providence, especially of his grace,
in dealing with his people, which are dark and perplexing, may be
explained by this story, which teaches that there may be love in
Christ's heart while there are frowns in his face; and it encourages us,
though he seems ready to slay us, yet to trust in him. Those whom Christ
intends most to honour, he humbles to feel their own unworthiness. A
proud, unhumbled heart would not have borne this; but she turned it into
an argument to support her request. The state of this woman is an emblem
of the state of a sinner, deeply conscious of the misery of his soul.
The least of Christ is precious to a believer, even the very crumbs of
the Bread of life. Of all graces, faith honours Christ most; therefore
of all graces Christ honours faith most. He cured her daughter. He
spake, and it was done. From hence let such as seek help from the Lord,
and receive no gracious answer, learn to turn even their unworthiness
and discouragements into pleas for mercy.

[Matthew 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 15:29</span></span>

Whatever our case is, the only way to find ease and relief, is to lay it
at Christ's feet, to submit it to him, and refer it to his disposal.
Those who would have spiritual healing from Christ, must be ruled as he
pleases. See what work sin has made; what various diseases human bodies
are subject to. Here were such diseases as fancy could neither guess the
cause nor the cure of, yet these were subject to the command of Christ.
The spiritual cures that Christ works are wonderful. When blind souls
are made to see by faith, the dumb to speak in prayer, the maimed and
the lame to walk in holy obedience, it is to be wondered at. His power
was also shown to the multitude, in the plentiful provision he made for
them: the manner is much the same as before. All did eat, and were
filled. Those whom Christ feeds, he fills. With Christ there is bread
enough, and to spare; supplies of grace for more than seek it, and for
those that seek for more. Christ sent away the people. Though he had fed
them twice, they must not look for miracles to find their daily bread.
Let them go home to their callings and their own tables. Lord, increase
our faith, and pardon our unbelief, teaching us to live upon thy fulness
and bounty, for all things pertaining to this life, and that which is to
come.
