[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)

Matthew, surnamed Levi, before his conversion was a publican, or
tax-gatherer under the Romans at Capernaum. He is generally allowed to
have written his Gospel before any other of the evangelists. The
contents of this Gospel, and the evidence of ancient writers, show that
it was written primarily for the use of the Jewish nation. The
fulfilment of prophecy was regarded by the Jews as strong evidence,
therefore this is especially dwelt upon by St. Matthew. Here are
particularly selected such parts of our Saviour's history and discourses
as were best suited to awaken the Jewish nation to a sense of their
sins; to remove their erroneous expectations of an earthly kingdom; to
abate their pride and self-conceit; to teach them the spiritual nature
and extent of the gospel; and to prepare them for the admission of the
Gentiles into the church.
