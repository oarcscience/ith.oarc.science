### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 16:0</span></span>

([Kg2 16:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001)) Ahaz, king of Judah, His
wicked reign.

([Kg2 16:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010)) Ahaz takes a pattern
from an idol's altar.

([Kg2 16:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017)) Ahaz spoils the
temple.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 16:1</span></span>

Few and evil were the days of Ahaz. Those whose hearts condemn them,
will go any where in a day of distress, rather than to God. The sin was
its own punishment. It is common for those who bring themselves into
straits by one sin, to try to help themselves out by another.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 16:10</span></span>

God's altar had hitherto been kept in its place, and in use; but Ahaz
put another in the room of it. The natural regard of the mind of man to
some sort of religion, is not easily extinguished; but except it be
regulated by the word, and by the Spirit of God, it produces absurd
superstitions, or detestable idolatries. Or, at best, it quiets the
sinner's conscience with unmeaning ceremonies. Infidels have often been
remarkable for believing ridiculous falsehoods.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 16:17</span></span>

Ahaz put contempt upon the sabbath, and thus opened a wide inlet to all
manner of sin. This he did for the king of Assyria. When those who have
had a ready passage to the house of the Lord, turn it another way to
please their neighbours, they are going down-hill apace to ruin.
