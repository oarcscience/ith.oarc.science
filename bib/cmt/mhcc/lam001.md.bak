### [Lamentations Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

([Lam 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001).md) The miserable state of
Jerusalem, the just consequences of its sins.

([Lam 1:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012).md) Jerusalem represented
as a captive female, lamenting, and seeking the mercy of God.

[Lamentations 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 1:1</span></span>

The prophet sometimes speaks in his own person; at other times
Jerusalem, as a distressed female, is the speaker, or some of the Jews.
The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem
became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins;
and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary,
to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to
have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and
distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and
entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make
ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord
for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows,
lamentations, sickness, and death.

[Lamentations 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 1:12</span></span>

Jerusalem, sitting dejected on the ground, calls on those that passed
by, to consider whether her example did not concern them. Her outward
sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings were harder to bear,
through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must be great sorrow, and
must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin, and may take warning
to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may be learned from the
sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned from the sufferings of
Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every one of us? Does he not
say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Let all our sorrows lead
us to the cross of Christ, lead us to mark his example, and cheerfully
to follow him.
