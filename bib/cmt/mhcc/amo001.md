### [Amos Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

Judgments against the Syrians, Philistines, Tyrians, Edomites, and
Ammonites.

[Amos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 1:1</span></span>

GOD employed a shepherd, a herdsman, to reprove and warn the people.
Those to whom God gives abilities for his services, ought not to be
despised for their origin, or their employment. Judgments are denounced
against the neighbouring nations, the oppressors of God's people. The
number of transgressions does not here mean that exact number, but many:
they had filled the measure of their sins, and were ripe for vengeance.
The method in dealing with these nations is, in part, the same, yet in
each there is something peculiar. In all ages this bitterness has been
shown against the Lord's people. When the Lord reckons with his enemies,
how tremendous are his judgments!
