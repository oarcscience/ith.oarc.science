([Pro 31:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001).md) An exhortation to king

[Proverbs 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 31:1</span></span>

When children are under the mother's eye, she has an opportunity of
fashioning their minds aright. Those who are grown up, should often call
to mind the good teaching they received when children. The many awful
instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vile women,
and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils. Wine is to
be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good, and wine,
though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise and consolation
should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, not administered
to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authority should be more
carefully temperate even than other men; and should be protectors of
those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause. Our blessed
Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup of sorrow put into
his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into the hands of his
people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepest distress.

[Proverbs 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 31:10</span></span>

This is the description of a virtuous woman of those days, but the
general outlines equally suit every age and nation. She is very careful
to recommend herself to her husband's esteem and affection, to know his
mind, and is willing that he rule over her. 1. She can be trusted, and
he will leave such a wife to manage for him. He is happy in her. And she
makes it her constant business to do him good. 2. She is one that takes
pains in her duties, and takes pleasure in them. She is careful to fill
up time, that none be lost. She rises early. She applies herself to the
business proper for her, to women's business. She does what she does,
with all her power, and trifles not. 3. She makes what she does turn to
good account by prudent management. Many undo themselves by buying,
without considering whether they can afford it. She provides well for
her house. She lays up for hereafter. 4. She looks well to the ways of
her household, that she may oblige all to do their duty to God and one
another, as well as to her. 5. She is intent upon giving as upon
getting, and does it freely and cheerfully. 6. She is discreet and
obliging; every word she says, shows she governs herself by the rules of
wisdom. She not only takes prudent measures herself, but gives prudent
advice to others. The law of love and kindness is written in the heart,
and shows itself in the tongue. Her heart is full of another world, even
when her hands are most busy about this world. 7. Above all, she fears
the Lord. Beauty recommends none to God, nor is it any proof of wisdom
and goodness, but it has deceived many a man who made his choice of a
wife by it. But the fear of God reigning in the heart, is the beauty of
the soul; it lasts forever. 8. She has firmness to bear up under crosses
and disappointments. She shall reflect with comfort when she comes to be
old, that she was not idle or useless when young. She shall rejoice in a
world to come. She is a great blessing to her relations. If the fruit be
good, the tree must have our good word. But she leaves it to her own
works to praise her. Every one ought to desire this honour that cometh
from God; and according to this standard we all ought to regulate our
judgments. This description let all women daily study, who desire to be
truly beloved and respected, useful and honourable. This passage is to
be applied to individuals, but may it not also be applied to the church
of God, which is described as a virtuous spouse? God by his grace has
formed from among sinful men a church of true believers, to possess all
the excellences here described.
