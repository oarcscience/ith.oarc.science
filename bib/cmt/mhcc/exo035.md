### [Exodus Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 35:0</span></span>

([Exo 35:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001)) The sabbath to be
observed.

(v. 4-19) The free gifts for the tabernacle.

([Exo 35:20-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#020)) The readiness of the
people in general.

([Exo 35:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030)) Bezaleel and Aholiab
called to the work.

[Exodus 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 35:1</span></span>

The mild and easy yoke of Christ has made our sabbath duties more
delightful, and our sabbath restraints less irksome, than those of the
Jews; but we are the more guilty by neglecting them. Surely God's wisdom
in giving us the sabbath, with all the mercy of its purposes, are
sinfully disregarded. Is it nothing to pour contempt upon the blessed
day, which a bounteous God has given to us for our growth in grace with
the church below, and to prepare us for happiness with the church above?

[Exodus 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 35:4</span></span>

The tabernacle was to be dedicated to the honour of God, and used in his
service; and therefore what was brought for it, was an offering to the
Lord. The rule is, Whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring. All
that were skilful must work. God dispenses his gifts; and as every man
hath received, so he must minister, [Pe1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010). Those that were rich, must bring
in materials to work on; those that were skilful, must serve the
tabernacle with their skill: as they needed one another, so the
tabernacle needed them both, [Co1
12:7-21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007).

[Exodus 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 35:20</span></span>

Without a willing mind, costly offerings would be abhorred; with it, the
smallest will be accepted. Our hearts are willing, when we cheerfully
assist in promoting the cause of God. Those who are diligent and
contented in employments considered mean, are as much accepted of God as
those engaged in splendid services. The women who spun the goats' hair
were wise-hearted, because they did it heartily to the Lord. Thus the
labourer, mechanic, or servant who attends to his work in the faith and
fear of God, may be as wise, for his place, as the most useful minister,
and he equally accepted of the Lord. Our wisdom and duty consist in
giving God the glory and use of our talents, be they many or few.

[Exodus 35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 35:30</span></span>

Here is the Divine appointment of the master-workmen, that there might
be no strife for the office, and that all who were employed in the work
might take direction from, and give account to them. Those whom God
called by name to his service, he filled with the Spirit of God. Skill,
even in worldly employments, is God's gift, and comes from above. But
many are ready enough in cutting out work for other people, and can tell
what this man or that man should do; but the burdens they bind on
others, they themselves will not touch with one of their fingers. Such
will fall under the character of slothful servants. These men were not
only to devise and to work themselves, but they were to teach others.
Those that rule should teach; and those to whom God has given knowledge,
should be willing to make it known for the benefit of others.
