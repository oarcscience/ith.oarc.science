### [Psalms Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 6:0</span></span>

([Psa 6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001).md) The psalmist deprecates
God's wrath, and begs for the return of his favour.

([Psa 6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008).md) He assures himself of an
answer of peace.

[Psalms 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 6:1</span></span>

These verses speak the language of a heart truly humbled, of a broken
and contrite spirit under great afflictions, sent to awaken conscience
and mortify corruption. Sickness brought sin to his remembrance, and he
looked upon it as a token of God's displeasure against him. The
affliction of his body will be tolerable, if he has comfort in his soul.
Christ's sorest complaint, in his sufferings, was of the trouble of his
soul, and the want of his Father's smiles. Every page of Scripture
proclaims the fact, that salvation is only of the Lord. Man is a sinner,
his case can only be reached by mercy; and never is mercy more
illustrious than in restoring backsliders. With good reason we may pray,
that if it be the will of God, and he has any further work for us or our
friends to do in this world, he will yet spare us or them to serve him.
To depart and be with Christ is happiest for the saints; but for them to
abide in the flesh is more profitable for the church.

[Psalms 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 6:8</span></span>

What a sudden change is here! Having made his request known to God, the
psalmist is confident that his sorrow will be turned into joy. By the
workings of God's grace upon his heart, he knew his prayer was accepted,
and did not doubt but it would, in due time, be answered. His prayers
will be accepted, coming up out of the hands of Christ the Mediator. The
word signifies prayer made to God, the righteous Judge, as the God of
his righteousness, who would plead his cause, and right his wrongs. A
believer, through the blood and righteousness of Christ, can go to God
as a righteous God, and plead with him for pardon and cleansing, who is
just and faithful to grant both. He prays for the conversion of his
enemies, or foretells their ruin.
