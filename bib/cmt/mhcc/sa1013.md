### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 13:0</span></span>

([Sa1 13:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001)) The invasion of the
Philistines.

([Sa1 13:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008)) Saul sacrifices, He is
reproved by Samuel.

([Sa1 13:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015)) The policy of the
Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 13:1</span></span>

Saul reigned one year, and nothing particular happened; but in his
second year the events recorded in this chapter took place. For above a
year he gave the Philistine time to prepare for war, and to weaken and
to disarm the Israelites. When men are lifted up in self-sufficiency,
they are often led into folly. The chief advantages of the enemies of
the church are derived from the misconduct of its professed friends.
When Saul at length sounded an alarm, the people, dissatisfied with his
management, or terrified by the power of the enemy, did not come to him,
or speedily deserted him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 13:8</span></span>

Saul broke the order expressly given by Samuel, see [Sa1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008), as to what should be done in
cases of extremity. Saul offered sacrifice without Samuel, and did it
himself, though he was neither priest nor prophet. When charged with
disobedience, he justified himself in what he had done, and gave no sign
of repentance for it. He would have this act of disobedience pass for an
instance of his prudence, and as a proof of his piety. Men destitute of
inward piety, often lay great stress on the outward performances of
religion. Samuel charges Saul with being an enemy to himself. Those that
disobey the commandments of God, do foolishly for themselves. Sin is
folly, and the greatest sinners are the greatest fools. Our disposition
to obey or disobey God, will often be proved by our behaviour in things
which appear small. Men see nothing but Saul's outward act, which seems
small; but God saw that he did this with unbelief and distrust of his
providence, with contempt of his authority and justice, and with
rebellion against the light of his own conscience. Blessed Saviour, may
we never, like Saul, bring our poor offerings, or fancied
peace-offerings, without looking to thy precious, thy all-sufficient
sacrifice! Thou only, O Lord, canst make, or hast made, our peace in the
blood of the cross.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 13:15</span></span>

See how politic the Philistines were when they had power; they not only
prevented the people of Israel from making weapons of war, but obliged
them to depend upon their enemies, even for instruments of husbandry.
How impolitic Saul was, who did not, in the beginning of his reign, set
himself to redress this. Want of true sense always accompanies want of
grace. Sins which appear to us very little, have dangerous consequences.
Miserable is a guilty, defenceless nation; much more those who are
destitute of the whole armour of God.
