[Mark 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 13:1</span></span>

See how little Christ values outward pomp, where there is not real
purity of heart. He looks with pity upon the ruin of precious souls, and
weeps over them, but we do not find him look with pity upon the ruin of
a fine house. Let us then be reminded how needful it is for us to have a
more lasting abode in heaven, and to be prepared for it by the
influences of the Holy Spirit, sought in the earnest use of all the
means of grace.

[Mark 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 13:5</span></span>

Our Lord Jesus, in reply to the disciples' question, does not so much
satisfy their curiosity as direct their consciences. When many are
deceived, we should thereby be awakened to look to ourselves. And the
disciples of Christ, if it be not their own fault, may enjoy holy
security and peace of mind, when all around is in disorder. But they
must take heed that they are not drawn away from Christ and their duty
to him, by the sufferings they will meet with for his sake. They shall
be hated of all men: trouble enough! Yet the work they were called to
should be carried on and prosper. Though they may be crushed and borne
down, the gospel cannot be. The salvation promised is more than
deliverance from evil, it is everlasting blessedness.

[Mark 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 13:14</span></span>

The Jews in rebelling against the Romans, and in persecuting the
Christians, hastened their own ruin apace. Here we have a prediction of
that ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this.
Such destruction and desolation, that the like cannot be found in any
history. Promises of power to persevere, and cautions against falling
away, well agree with each other. But the more we consider these things,
the more we shall see abundant cause to flee without delay for refuge to
Christ, and to renounce every earthly object, for the salvation of our
souls.

[Mark 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 13:24</span></span>

The disciples had confounded the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of
the world. This mistake Christ set right, and showed that the day of
Christ's coming, and the day of judgment, shall be after that
tribulation. Here he foretells the final dissolution of the present
frame and fabric of the world. Also, the visible appearance of the Lord
Jesus coming in the clouds, and the gathering together of all the elect
to him.

[Mark 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 13:28</span></span>

We have the application of this prophetic sermon. As to the destruction
of Jerusalem, expect it to come very shortly. As to the end of the
world, do not inquire when it will come, for of that day and that hour
knoweth no man. Christ, as God, could not be ignorant of anything; but
the Divine wisdom which dwelt in our Saviour, communicated itself to his
human soul according to the Divine pleasure. As to both, our duty is to
watch and pray. Our Lord Jesus, when he ascended on high, left something
for all his servants to do. We ought to be always upon our watch, in
expectation of his return. This applies to Christ's coming to us at our
death, as well as to the general judgment. We know not whether our
Master will come in the days of youth, or middle age, or old age; but,
as soon as we are born, we begin to die, and therefore we must expect
death. Our great care must be, that, whenever our Lord comes, he may not
find us secure, indulging in ease and sloth, mindless of our work and
duty. He says to all, Watch, that you may be found in peace, without
spot, and blameless.
