### [1 Timothy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti1 3:0</span></span>

([Ti1 3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001).md) The qualifications and
behaviour of gospel bishops.

([Ti1 3:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008).md) And of deacons and their
wives.

([Ti1 3:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014).md) The reason of writing
about these, and other church affairs.

[1 Timothy 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 3:1</span></span>

If a man desired the pastoral office, and from love to Christ, and the
souls of men, was ready to deny himself, and undergo hardships by
devoting himself to that service, he sought to be employed in a good
work, and his desire should be approved, provided he was qualified for
the office. A minister must give as little occasion for blame as can be,
lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober, temperate,
moderate in all his actions, and in the use of all creature-comforts.
Sobriety and watchfulness are put together in Scripture, they assist one
the other. The families of ministers ought to be examples of good to all
other families. We should take heed of pride; it is a sin that turned
angels into devils. He must be of good repute among his neighbours, and
under no reproach from his former life. To encourage all faithful
ministers, we have Christ's gracious word of promise, Lo, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world, [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md). And he will fit his ministers
for their work, and carry them through difficulties with comfort, and
reward their faithfulness.

[1 Timothy 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 3:8</span></span>

The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the
church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were
among them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be
grave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should be
lodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the business
with which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers,
must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.

[1 Timothy 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 3:14</span></span>

The church is the house of God; he dwells there. The church holds forth
the Scripture and the doctrine of Christ, as a pillar holds forth a
proclamation. When a church ceases to be the pillar and ground of truth,
we may and ought to forsake her; for our regard to truth should be first
and greatest. The mystery of godliness is Christ. He is God, who was
made flesh, and was manifest in the flesh. God was pleased to manifest
himself to man, by his own Son taking the nature of man. Though
reproached as a sinner, and put to death as a malefactor, Christ was
raised again by the Spirit, and so was justified from all the false
charges with which he was loaded. Angels ministered to him, for he is
the Lord of angels. The Gentiles welcomed the gospel which the Jews
rejected. Let us remember that God was manifest in the flesh, to take
away our sins, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify unto
himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These doctrines must
be shown forth by the fruits of the Spirit in our lives.
