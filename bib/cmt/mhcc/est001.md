### [Esther Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

([Est 1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)) The royal feast of
Ahasuerus.

([Est 1:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#010)) Vashti's refusal to
appear, The king's decree.

[Esther 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 1:1</span></span>

The pride of Ahasuerus's heart rising with the grandeur of his kingdom,
he made an extravagant feast. This was vain glory. Better is a dinner of
herbs with quietness, than this banquet of wine, with all the noise and
tumult that must have attended it. But except grace prevails in the
heart, self-exaltation and self-indulgence, in one form or another, will
be the ruling principle. Yet none did compel; so that if any drank to
excess, it was their own fault. This caution of a heathen prince, even
when he would show his generosity, may shame many called Christians,
who, under pretence of sending the health round, send sin round, and
death with it. There is a woe to them that do so; let them read it, and
tremble, [Hab 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015), [Hab
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016).

[Esther 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 1:10</span></span>

Ahasuerus's feast ended in heaviness, by his own folly. Seasons of
peculiar festivity often end in vexation. Superiors should be careful
not to command what may reasonably be disobeyed. But when wine is in,
men's reason departs from them. He that had rule over 127 provinces, had
no rule over his own spirit. But whether the passion or the policy of
the king was served by this decree, God's providence made way for Esther
to the crown, and defeated Haman's wicked project, even before it had
entered into his heart, and he arrived at his power. Let us rejoice that
the Lord reigns, and will overrule the madness or folly of mankind to
promote his own glory, and the safety and happiness of his people.
