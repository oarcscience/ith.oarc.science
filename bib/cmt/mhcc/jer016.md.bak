### [Jeremiah Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 16:0</span></span>

([Jer 16:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001).md) Prohibitions given to
the prophet.

([Jer 16:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010).md) The justice of God in
these judgments.

([Jer 16:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014).md) Future restoration of
the Jews, and the conversion of the Gentiles.

[Jeremiah 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 16:1</span></span>

The prophet must conduct himself as one who expected to see his country
ruined very shortly. In the prospect of sad times, he is to abstain from
marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those who would convince
others of the truths of God, must make it appear by their self-denial,
that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward and outward, family and
public, is wholly the work of God, and from his loving-kindness and
mercy. When He takes his peace from any people, distress must follow.
There may be times when it is proper to avoid things otherwise our duty;
and we should always sit loose to the pleasures and concerns of this
life.

[Jeremiah 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 16:10</span></span>

Here seems to be the language of those who quarrel at the word of God,
and instead of humbling and condemning themselves, justify themselves,
as though God did them wrong. A plain and full answer is given. They
were more obstinate in sin than their fathers, walking every one after
the devices of his heart. Since they will not hearken, they shall be
hurried away into a far country, a land they know not. If they had God's
favour, that would make even the land of their captivity pleasant.

[Jeremiah 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 16:14</span></span>

The restoration from the Babylonish captivity would be remembered in
place of the deliverance from Egypt; it also typified spiritual
redemption, and the future deliverance of the church from antichristian
oppression. But none of the sins of sinners can be hidden from God, or
shall be overlooked by him. He will find out and raise up instruments of
his wrath, that shall destroy the Jews, by fraud like fishers, by force
like hunters. The prophet, rejoicing at the hope of mercy to come,
addressed the Lord as his strength and refuge. The deliverance out of
captivity shall be a figure of the great salvation to be wrought by the
Messiah. The nations have often known the power of Jehovah in his wrath;
but they shall know him as the strength of his people, and their refuge
in time of trouble.
