### [Psalms Chapter 133](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 133:0</span></span>

The excellency of brotherly love.

[Psalms 133:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 133:1</span></span>

We cannot say too much, it were well if enough could be said, to
persuade people to live together in peace. It is good for us, for our
honour and comfort; and brings constant delight to those who live in
unity. The pleasantness of this is likened to the holy anointing oil.
This is the fruit of the Spirit, the proof of our union with Christ, and
adorns his gospel. It is profitable as well as pleasing; it brings
blessings numerous as the drops of dew. It cools the scorching heat of
men's passions, as the dews cool the air and refresh the earth. It
moistens the heart, and makes it fit to receive the good seed of the
word, and to make it fruitful. See the proof of the excellency of
brotherly love: where brethren dwell together in unity, the Lord
commands the blessing. God commands the blessing; man can but beg a
blessing. Believers that live in love and peace, shall have the God of
love and peace with them now, and they shall shortly be with him for
ever, in the world of endless love and peace. May all who love the Lord
forbear and forgive one another, as God, for Christ's sake, hath
forgiven them.
