### [1 Chronicles Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

The divisions of the priests and Levites.

[1 Chronicles 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 24:1</span></span>

When every one has, knows, and keeps his place and work, the more there
are the better. In the mystical body of Christ, every member has its
use, for the good of the whole. Christ is High Priest over the house of
God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection.
In Christ, no difference is made between bond and free, elder and
younger. The younger brethren, if faithful and sincere, shall be no less
acceptable to Christ than the fathers. May we all be children of the
Lord, fitted to sing his praises for ever in his temple above.
