### [2 John Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)

[2 John](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jo2 0:0</span></span>

This epistle is like an abridgement of the first; it touches, in few
words, on the same points. The Lady Electa is commended for her virtuous
and religious education of her children; is exhorted to abide in the
doctrine of Christ, to persevere in the truth, and carefully to avoid
the delusions of false teachers. But chiefly the apostle beseeches her
to practise the great commandment of Christian love and charity.

The apostle salutes the elect lady and her children. ([Jo1
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)) Express his joy in their faith
and love. ([Jo1 1:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004)) Cautions them
against deceivers. (7-11) And concludes. (12, 13)
