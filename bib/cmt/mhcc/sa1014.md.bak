[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 14:1</span></span>

Saul seems to have been quite at a loss, and unable to help himself.
Those can never think themselves safe who see themselves out of God's
protection. Now he sent for a priest and the ark. He hopes to make up
matters with the Almighty by a partial reformation, as many do whose
hearts are unhumbled and unchanged. Many love to have ministers who
prophesy smooth things to them. Jonathan felt a Divine impulse and
impression, putting him upon this bold adventure. God will direct the
steps of those that acknowledge him in all their ways, and seek to him
for direction, with full purpose of heart to follow his guidance.
Sometimes we find most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and
into which we have been led by the unexpected but well-observed turns of
Divine providence. There was trembling in the host. It is called a
trembling of God, signifying, not only a great trembling they could not
resist, nor reason themselves out of, but that it came at once from the
hand of God. He that made the heart, knows how to make it tremble.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 14:16</span></span>

The Philistines were, by the power of God, set against one another. The
more evident it was that God did all, the more reason Saul had to
inquire whether God would give him leave to do any thing. But he was in
such haste to fight a fallen enemy, that he would not stay to end his
devotions, nor hear what answer God would give him. He that believeth,
will not make such haste, nor reckon any business so urgent, as not to
allow time to take God with him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 14:24</span></span>

Saul's severe order was very unwise; if it gained time, it lost strength
for the pursuit. Such is the nature of our bodies, that daily work
cannot be done without daily bread, which therefore our Father in heaven
graciously gives. Saul was turning aside from God, and now he begins to
build altars, being then most zealous, as many are, for the form of
godliness when he was denying the power of it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa1 14:36</span></span>

If God turns away our prayer, we have reason to suspect it is for some
sin harboured in our hearts, which we should find out, that we may put
it away, and put it to death. We should always first suspect and examine
ourselves; but an unhumbled heart suspects every other person, and looks
every where but at home for the sinful cause of calamity. Jonathan was
discovered to be the offender. Those most indulgent to their own sins
are most severe upon others; those who most disregard God's authority,
are most impatient when their own commands are slighted. Such as cast
abroad curses, endanger themselves and their families. What do we
observe in the whole of Saul's behaviour on this occasion, but an
impetuous, proud, malignant, impious disposition? And do we not in every
instance perceive that man, left to himself, betrays the depravity of
his nature, and is enslaved to the basest tempers.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">sa1 14:47</span></span>

Here is a general account of Saul's court and camp. He had little reason
to be proud of his royal dignity, nor had any of his neighbours cause to
envy him, for he had but little enjoyment after he took the kingdom. And
often men's earthly glory makes a blaze just before the dark night of
disgrace and woe comes on them.
