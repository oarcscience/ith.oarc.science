### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles)](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sol 8:0</span></span>

([Sol 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001).md) Desire for communion with
Christ.

([Sol 8:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005).md) The vehemence of this
desire.

([Sol 8:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008).md) The church pleads for
others.

([Sol 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#013.md), [Sol
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014).md) And prays for Christ's coming.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 8:1</span></span>

The church wishes for the constant intimacy and freedom with the Lord
Jesus that a sister has with a brother. That they might be as his
brethren, which they are, when by grace they are made partakers of a
Divine nature. Christ is become as our Brother; wherever we find him,
let us be ready to own our relation to him, and affection for him, and
not fear being despised for it. Is there in us an ardent wish to serve
Christ more and better? What then have we laid up in store, to show our
affection to the Beloved of our souls? What fruit unto holiness? The
church charges all her children that they never provoke Christ to
withdraw. We should reason with ourselves, when tempted to do what would
grieve the Spirit.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 8:5</span></span>

The Jewish church came up from the wilderness, supported by Divine power
and favour. The Christian church was raised from a low, desolate
condition, by the grace of Christ relied on. Believers, by the power of
grace, are brought up from the wilderness. A sinful state is a
wilderness in which there is no true comfort; it is a wandering, wanting
state: There is no coming out of this wilderness, but leaning on Christ
as our Beloved, by faith; not leaning to our own understanding, nor
trusting in any righteousness of our own; but in the strength of him,
who is the Lord our Righteousness. The words of the church to Christ
which follow, entreat an abiding place in his love, and protection by
his power. Set me as a seal upon thine heart; let me always have a place
in thine heart; let me have an impression of love upon thine heart. Of
this the soul would be assured, and without a sense thereof no rest is
to be found. Those who truly love Christ, are jealous of every thing
that would draw them from him; especially of themselves, lest they
should do any thing to provoke him to withdraw from them. If we love
Christ, the fear of coming short of his love, or the temptations to
forsake him, will be most painful to us. No waters can quench Christ's
love to us, nor any floods drown it. Let nothing abate our love to him.
Nor will life, and all its comforts, entice a believer from loving
Christ. Love of Christ, will enable us to repel and triumph over
temptations from the smiles of the world, as well as from its frowns.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 8:8</span></span>

The church pleads for the Gentiles, who then had not the word of God,
nor the means of grace. Those who are brought to Christ themselves,
should contrive what they may do to help others to him. Babes in Christ
are always seen among Christians, and the welfare of their weak brethren
is an object of continual prayer with the stronger believers. If the
beginning of this work were likened to a wall built upon Him the
precious Foundation and Corner-stone, then the Gentile church would
become as a palace for the great King, built of solid silver. If the
first preaching of the gospel were as the making a door through the wall
of partition, that door should be lasting, as cased with boards of
durable cedar. She shall be carefully and effectually protected,
enclosed so as to receive no damage. The church is full of care for
those yet uncalled. Christ says, I will do all that is necessary to be
done for them. See with what satisfaction we should look back upon the
times and seasons, when we were in his eyes as those that find favour.
Our hearts are our vineyards, which we must keep with all diligence. To
Christ, and to his praise, all our fruits must be dedicated. All that
work for Christ, work for themselves, and shall be unspeakable gainers
by it.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 8:13</span></span>

These verses close the conference between Christ and his church. He
first addresses her as dwelling in the gardens, the assemblies and
ordinances of his saints. He exhorts her to be constant and frequent in
prayers, supplications, and praises, in which he delights. She replies,
craving his speedy return to take her to be wholly with Him. The
heavens, those high mountains of sweet spices, must contain Christ, till
the times come, when every eye shall see him, in all the glory of the
better world. True believers as they are looking for, so they are
hastening to the coming of that day of the Lord. Let every Christian
endeavour to perform the duties of his station, that men may see his
good works, and glorify his heavenly Father. Continuing earnest in
prayer for what we want, our thanksgivings will abound, and our joy will
be full; our souls will be enriched, and our labours prospered. We shall
be enabled to look forward to death and judgment without fear. Even so,
come, Lord Jesus.
