### [Ezekiel Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 23:0</span></span>

A history of the apostacy of God's people from him, and the aggravation
thereof.

[Ezekiel 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 23:1</span></span>

In this parable, Samaria and Israel bear the name Aholah, "her own
tabernacle;" because the places of worship those kingdoms had, were of
their own devising. Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, "my
tabernacle is in her," because their temple was the place which God
himself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures are
according to those times. Will not such humbling representations of
nature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hiding
pride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it not
also prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by his
Holy Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holy
conversation and godliness?
