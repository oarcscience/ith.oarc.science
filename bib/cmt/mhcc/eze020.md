### [Ezekiel Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 20:0</span></span>

([Eze 20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001)) The elders of Israel are
reminded of the idolatry in Egypt.

(v. 10-26) In the wilderness.

([Eze 20:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#027)) In Canaan.

([Eze 20:33-44](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#033)) God promises to pardon
and restore them.

([Eze 20:45-49](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#045)) Prophecy against
Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 20:1</span></span>

Those hearts are wretchedly hardened which ask God leave to go on in
sin, and that even when suffering for it; see [Eze
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#032). God is justly angry with those
who are resolved to go on still in their trespasses. Cause the people to
know the evil deeds of their fathers, that they may see how righteous it
was with God to cut them off.

[Ezekiel 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 20:10</span></span>

The history of Israel in the wilderness is referred to in the new
Testament as well as in the Old, for warning. God did great things for
them. He gave them the law, and revived the ancient keeping of the
sabbath day. Sabbaths are privileges; they are signs of our being his
people. If we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to our comfort, it
is the Lord that makes us holy, that is, truly happy, here; and prepares
us to be happy, that is, perfectly holy, hereafter. The Israelites
rebelled, and were left to the judgments they brought upon themselves.
God sometimes makes sin to be its own punishment, yet he is not the
Author of sin: there needs no more to make men miserable, than to give
them up to their own evil desires and passions.

[Ezekiel 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 20:27</span></span>

The Jews persisted in rebellion after they settled in the land of
Canaan. And these elders seem to have thought of uniting with the
heathen. We make nothing by our profession if it be but a profession.
There is nothing got by sinful compliances; and the carnal projects of
hypocrites will stand them in no stead.

[Ezekiel 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">eze 20:33</span></span>

The wicked Israelites, notwithstanding they follow the sinful ways of
other nations, shall not mingle with them in their prosperity, but shall
be separated from them for destruction. There is no shaking off God's
dominion; and those who will not yield to the power of his grace, shall
sink under the power of his wrath. But not one of God's jewels shall be
lost in the lumber of this world. He will bring the jews to the land of
Israel again; and will give them true repentance. They will be overcome
with his kindness: the more we know of God's holiness, the more we see
the hateful nature of sin. Those who remain unaffected amidst means of
grace, and would live without Christ, like the world around them, may be
sure it is the way to destruction.

[Ezekiel 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">eze 20:45</span></span>

Judah and Jerusalem had been full of people, as a forest of trees, but
empty of fruit. God's word prophesies against those who bring not forth
the fruits of righteousness. When He will ruin a nation, who or what can
save it? The plainest truths were as parables to the people. It is
common for those who will not be wrought upon by the word, to blame it.
