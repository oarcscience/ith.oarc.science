### [Psalms Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 43:0</span></span>

David endeavours to still his spirit, with hope and confidence in God.

[Psalms 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 43:1</span></span>

As to the quarrel God had with David for sin, he prays, Enter not into
judgment with me, if Thou doest so I shall be condemned; but as to the
quarrel his enemies had with him, he prays, Lord, judge me, and in thy
providence appear on my behalf. If we cannot comfort ourselves in God,
we may stay ourselves upon him, and may have spiritual supports, when we
want spiritual delights. He never cast off any that trusted in him,
whatever fears they may have had of their own state. We need desire no
more to make us happy, than the good that flow from God's favour, and is
included in his promise. Those whom God leads, he leads to his holy
hill; those, therefore, who pretend to be led by the Spirit, and yet
turn their backs upon ordinance, deceive themselves. We are still to
pray for the Spirit of light and truth, who supplies the want of
Christ's bodily presence, to guide us in the way to heaven. Whatever we
rejoice or triumph in, the Lord must be the joy of it. David applies to
God as his never-failing hope. Let us pray earnestly, that the Lord
would send forth the truth of his word, and the light of his Spirit, to
guide us into the way of holiness, peace, and salvation. The desire of
the Christian, like that of the prophet in distress, is to be saved from
sin as well as sorrow; to be taught in the way of righteousness by the
light of heavenly wisdom, shining in Jesus Christ, and to be led by this
light and truth to the New Jerusalem.
