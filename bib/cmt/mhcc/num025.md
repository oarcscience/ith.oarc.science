### [Numbers Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 25:0</span></span>

([Num 25:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001).md) The Israelites enticed
by the daughters of Moab and Midian.

([Num 25:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#006).md) Phinehas puts Zimri and
Cozbi to death.

([Num 25:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#016).md) The Midianites to be
punished.

[Numbers 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 25:1</span></span>

The friendship of the wicked is more dangerous than their enmity; for
none can prevail against God's people if they are not overcome by their
inbred lusts; nor can any enchantment hurt them, but the enticements of
worldly interests and pleasures. Here is the sin of Israel, to which
they are enticed by the daughters of Moab and Midian. Those are our
worst enemies who draw us to sin, for that is the greatest mischief any
man can do us. Israel's sin did that which all Balaam's enchantments
could not do; it set God against them. Diseases are the fruits of God's
anger, and the just punishments of prevailing sins; one infection
follows the other. Ringleaders in sin ought to be made examples of
justice.

[Numbers 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 25:6</span></span>

Phinehas, in the courage of zeal and faith, executed vengeance on Zimri
and Cozbi. This act can never be an example for private revenge, or
religious persecution, or for irregular public vengeance.

[Numbers 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 25:16</span></span>

We read not that any Midianites died of the plague; God punished them
with the sword of an enemy, not with the rod of a father. We must set
ourselves against whatever is an occasion of sin to us, [Mat
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md), [Mat
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#030.md). Whatever draws us to sin, should
be a vexation to us, as a thorn in the flesh. And none will be more
surely and severely punished than those who, after Satan's example, and
with his subtlety, tempt others to sin.
