### [Exodus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 18:0</span></span>

([Exo 18:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001).md) Jethro brings to Moses
his wife and two sons.

([Exo 18:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#007).md) Moses entertains
Jethro.

([Exo 18:13-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#013).md) Jethro's counsel to
Moses.

[Exodus 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 18:1</span></span>

Jethro came to rejoice with Moses in the happiness of Israel, and to
bring his wife and children to him. Moses must have his family with him,
that while he ruled the church of God, he might set a good example in
family government, [Ti1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005.md).

[Exodus 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 18:7</span></span>

Conversation concerning God's wondrous works is good, and edifies.
Jethro not only rejoiced in the honour done to his son-in-law, but in
all the goodness done to Israel. Standers-by were more affected with the
favours God had showed to Israel, than many were who received them.
Jethro gave the glory to Israel's God. Whatever we have the joy of, God
must have the praise. They joined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Mutual
friendship is sanctified by joint worship. It is very good for relations
and friends to join in the spiritual sacrifice of prayer and praise, as
those that meet in Christ. This was a temperate feast; they did eat
bread, manna. Jethro must see and taste that bread from heaven, and
though a gentile, is welcome: the gentiles are welcomed to Christ the
Bread of life.

[Exodus 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 18:13</span></span>

Here is the great zeal and the toil of Moses as a magistrate. Having
been employed to redeem Israel out of the house of bondage, he is a
further type of Christ, that he is employed as a lawgiver and a judge
among them. If the people were as quarrelsome one with another as they
were with God, no doubt Moses had many causes brought before him. This
business Moses was called to; it appears that he did it with great care
and kindness. The meanest Israelite was welcome to bring his cause
before him. Moses kept to his business from morning to night. Jethro
thought it was too much for him to undertake alone; also it would make
the administration of justice tiresome to the people. There may be
over-doing even in well-doing. Wisdom is profitable to direct, that we
may neither content ourselves with less than our duty, nor task
ourselves beyond our strength. Jethro advised Moses to a better plan.
Great men should not only study to be useful themselves, but contrive to
make others useful. Care must be taken in the choice of the persons
admitted into such a trust. They should be men of good sense, that
understood business, and that would not be daunted by frowns or
clamours, but abhorred the thought of a bribe. Men of piety and
religion; such as fear God, who dare not to do a base thing, though they
could do it secretly and securely. The fear of God will best fortify a
man against temptations to injustice. Moses did not despise this advice.
Those are not wise, who think themselves too wise to be counselled.
