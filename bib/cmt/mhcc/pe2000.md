### [2 Peter Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001)

[2 Peter](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pe2 0:0</span></span>

This epistle clearly is connected with the former epistle of Peter. The
apostle having stated the blessings to which God has called Christians,
exhorts those who had received these precious gifts, to endeavour to
improve in graces and virtues. They are urged to this from the
wickedness of false teachers. They are guarded against impostors and
scoffers, by disproving their false assertions, [Pe2
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001), and by showing why the great
day of Christ's coming was delayed, with a description of its awful
circumstances and consequences; and suitable exhortations to diligence
and holiness are given.
