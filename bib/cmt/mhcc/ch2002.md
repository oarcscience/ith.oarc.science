### [2 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 2:0</span></span>

Solomon's message to Huram respecting the temple, His treaty with Huram.

[2 Chronicles 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 2:1</span></span>

Solomon informs Huram of the particular services to be performed in the
temple. The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile
superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess
Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not
be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and
to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and
service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship
of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in
the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of
their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of
their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's
special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his
believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and
their Saviour.
