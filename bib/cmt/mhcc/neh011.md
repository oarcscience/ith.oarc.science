[Nehemiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 11:1</span></span>

In all ages, men have preferred their own ease and advantage to the
public good. Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their
own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy
things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet
surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and
opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this
love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our
communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to
be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the
carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still
harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek
first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient,
contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful
hope, for admission into the holy city of God.
