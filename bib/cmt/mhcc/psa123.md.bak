### [Psalms Chapter 123](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

Confidence in God under contempt.

[Psalms 123:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 123:1</span></span>

Our Lord Jesus has taught us to look unto God in prayer as our Father in
heaven. In every prayer a good man lifts up his soul to God; especially
when in trouble. We desire mercy from him; we hope he will show us
mercy, and we will continue waiting on him till it come. The eyes of a
servant are to his master's directing hand, expecting that he will
appoint him his work. And also to his supplying hand. Servants look to
their master or their mistress for their portion of meat in due season.
And to God we must look for daily bread, for grace sufficient; from him
we must receive it thankfully. Where can we look for help but to our
Master? And, further, to his protecting hand. If the servant is wronged
and injured in his work, who should right him, but his master? And to
his correcting hand. Whither should sinners turn but to him that smote
them? They humble themselves under God's mighty hand. And lastly, to his
rewarding hand. Hypocrites look to the world's hand, thence they have
their reward; but true Christians look to God as their Master and their
Rewarder. God's people find little mercy with men; but this is their
comfort, that with the Lord there is mercy. Scorning and contempt have
been, are, and are likely to be, the lot of God's people in this world.
It is hard to bear; but the servants of God should not complain if they
are treated as his beloved Son was. Let us then, when ready to faint
under trials, look unto Jesus, and by faith and prayer cast ourselves
upon the mercy of God.
