The Book of Exodus relates the forming of the children of Israel into a
church and a nation. We have hitherto seen true religion shown in
domestic life, now, we begin to trace its effects upon the concerns of
kingdoms and nations. Exodus signifies "the departure;" the chief event
therein recorded is the departure of Israel from Egypt and Egyptian
bondage; it plainly points out the fulfilling of several promises and
prophecies to Abraham respecting his seed, and shadows forth the state
of the church, in the wilderness of this world, until her arrival at the
heavenly Canaan, an eternal rest.
