### [Nehemiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

Nehemiah's distress for the misery of Jerusalem, His prayer.

[Nehemiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 1:1</span></span>

Nehemiah was the Persian king's cup-bearer. When God has work to do, he
will never want instruments to do it with. Nehemiah lived at ease, and
in honour, but does not forget that he is an Israelite, and that his
brethren are in distress. He was ready to do them all the good offices
he could; and that he might know how best to do them a kindness, he
makes inquiries about them. We should inquire especially concerning the
state of the church and religion. Every Jerusalem on this side the
heavenly one will have some defect, which will require the help and
services of its friends. Nehemiah's first application was to God, that
he might have the fuller confidence in his application to the king. Our
best pleas in prayer are taken from the promise of God, the word on
which he has caused us to hope. Other means must be used, but the
effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails most. Communion with
God will best prepare us for our dealings with men. When we have
intrusted our concerns to God, the mind is set at liberty; it feels
satisfaction and composure, and difficulties vanish. We know that if the
affair be hurtful, he can easily hinder it; and if it be good for us, he
can as easily forward it.
