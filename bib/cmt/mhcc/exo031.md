### [Exodus Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 31:0</span></span>

([Exo 31:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001)) Bezaleel and Aholiab
are appointed and qualified for the work of the tabernacle.

([Exo 31:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#012)) The observance of the
sabbath.

([Exo 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018)) Moses receives the tables
of the law.

[Exodus 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 31:1</span></span>

The Israelites, who had been masons and bricklayers in Egypt, were not
qualified for curious workmanship; but the Spirit who gave the apostles
utterance in divers tongues, miraculously gave Bezaleel and Aholiab the
skill that was wanting. The honour which comes from God, is always
attended with a work to be done; to be employed for God is high honour.
Those whom God calls to any service, he will find or make fit for it.
The Lord gives different gifts to different persons; let each mind his
proper work, diligently remembering that whatever wisdom any one
possesses, the Lord put it in the heart, to do his commandments.

[Exodus 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 31:12</span></span>

Orders were now given that a tabernacle should be set up for the service
of God. But they must not think that the nature of the work, and the
haste that was required, would justify them in working at it on sabbath
days. The Hebrew word shabath signifies rest, or ceasing from labour.
The thing signified by the sabbath is that rest in glory which remains
for the people of God; therefore the moral obligation of the sabbath
must continue, till time is swallowed up in eternity.

[Exodus 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 31:18</span></span>

The law was written in tables of stone, to show how lasting it is: to
denote likewise the hardness of our hearts; one might more easily write
on stone, than write any thing good on our corrupt natural hearts. It
was written with the finger of God; by his will and power. God only can
write his law in the heart: he gives a heart of flesh; then, by his
Spirit, which is the finger of God, writes his will in the heart, [Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003).
