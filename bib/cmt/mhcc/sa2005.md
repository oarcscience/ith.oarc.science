### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 5:0</span></span>

([Sa2 5:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006).md) He takes the strong-hold

([Sa2 5:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011).md) David's kingdom

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 5:1</span></span>

David was anointed king a third time. His advances were gradual, that
his faith might be tried, and that he might gain experience. Thus his
kingdom typified that of the Messiah, which was to come to its height by
degrees. Thus Jesus became our Brother, took upon him our nature, dwelt
in it that he might become our Prince and Saviour: thus the humbled
sinner takes encouragement from the endearing relation, applies for his
salvation, submits to his authority, and craves his protection.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 5:6</span></span>

The enemies of God's people are often very confident of their own
strength, and most secure when their day to fall draws nigh. But the
pride and insolence of the Jebusites animated David, and the Lord God of
hosts was with him. Thus in the day of God's power, Satan's strong-hold,
the human heart, is changed into a habitation of God through the Spirit,
and into a throne on which the Son of David rules, and brings every
thought into obedience to himself. May He thus come, and claim, and
cleanse, each of our hearts; and, destroying every idol, may he reign
there for ever!

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 5:11</span></span>

David's house was not the worse, nor the less fit to be dedicated to
God, for being built by the sons of the stranger. It is prophesied of
the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and
their kings shall minister unto thee, [Isa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010.md). David's government was rooted
and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and
all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had
the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have
the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the
comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is
happiness. David owned it was for his people's sake God had done great
things for him; that he might be a blessing to them, and that they might
be happy under him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 5:17</span></span>

The Philistines considered not that David had the presence of God with
him, which Saul had forfeited and lost. The kingdom of the Messiah, as
soon as it was set up in the world, was thus attacked by the powers of
darkness. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselves
to oppose it; but all in vain, etc. The destruction will turn, as this
did, upon Satan's own kingdom. David owns dependence on God for victory;
and refers himself to the good pleasure of God, Wilt thou do it? The
assurance God has given us of victory over our spiritual enemies, should
encourage us in our spiritual conflicts. David waited till God moved; he
stirred then, but not till then. He was trained up in dependence on God
and his providence. God performed his promise, and David failed not to
improve his advantages. When the kingdom of the Messiah was to be set
up, the apostles, who were to beat down the devil's kingdom, must not
attempt any thing till they received the promise of the Spirit; who came
with a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, [Act
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md).
