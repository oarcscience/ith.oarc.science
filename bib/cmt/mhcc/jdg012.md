### [Judges Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 12:0</span></span>

([Jdg 12:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001).md) Ephraimites quarrel with
Jephthah.

([Jdg 12:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008).md) Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon
judge Israel.

[Judges 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 12:1</span></span>

The Ephraimites had the same quarrel with Jephthah as with Gideon. Pride
was at the bottom of the quarrel; only by that comes contention. It is
ill to fasten names of reproach upon persons or countries, as is common,
especially upon those under outward disadvantages. It often occasions
quarrels that prove of ill consequence, as it did here. No contentions
are so bitter as those between brethren or rivals for honour. What need
we have to watch and pray against evil tempers! May the Lord incline all
his people to follow after things which make for peace!

[Judges 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 12:8</span></span>

We have here a short account of three more of the judges of Israel. The
happiest life of individuals, and the happiest state of society, is that
which affords the fewest remarkable events. To live in credit and quiet,
to be peacefully useful to those around us, to possess a clear
conscience; but, above all, and without which nothing can avail, to
enjoy communion with God our Saviour while we live, and to die at peace
with God and man, form the substance of all that a wise man can desire.
