### [Matthew Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 2:0</span></span>

[Matthew 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 2:1</span></span>

Those who live at the greatest distance from the means of grace often
use most diligence, and learn to know the most of Christ and his
salvation. But no curious arts, or mere human learning, can direct men
unto him. We must learn of Christ by attending to the word of God, as a
light that shineth in a dark place, and by seeking the teaching of the
Holy Spirit. And those in whose hearts the day-star is risen, to give
them any thing of the knowledge of Christ, make it their business to
worship him. Though Herod was very old, and never had shown affection
for his family, and was not himself likely to live till a new-born
infant had grown up to manhood, he began to be troubled with the dread
of a rival. He understood not the spiritual nature of the Messiah's
kingdom. Let us beware of a dead faith. A man may be persuaded of many
truths, and yet may hate them, because they interfere with his ambition,
or sinful indulgences. Such a belief will make him uneasy, and the more
resolved to oppose the truth and the cause of God; and he may be foolish
enough to hope for success therein.

[Matthew 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 2:9</span></span>

What joy these wise men felt upon this sight of the star, none know so
well as those who, after a long and melancholy night of temptation and
desertion, under the power of a spirit of bondage, at length receive the
Spirit of adoption, witnessing with their spirits that they are the
children of God. We may well think what a disappointment it was to them,
when they found a cottage was his palace, and his own poor mother the
only attendant he had. However, these wise men did not think themselves
baffled; but having found the King they sought, they presented their
gifts to him. The humble inquirer after Christ will not be stumbled at
finding him and his disciples in obscure cottages, after having in vain
sought them in palaces and populous cities. Is a soul busy, seeking
after Christ? Would it worship him, and does it say, Alas! I am a
foolish and poor creature, and have nothing to offer? Nothing! Hast thou
not a heart, though unworthy of him, dark, hard, and foul? Give it to
him as it is, and be willing that he use and dispose of it as it pleases
him; he will take it, and will make it better, and thou shalt never
repent having given it to him. He shall frame it to his own likeness,
and will give thee himself, and be thine for ever. The gifts the wise
men presented were gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Providence sent these
as a seasonable relief to Joseph and Mary in their present poor
condition. Thus our heavenly Father, who knows what his children need,
uses some as stewards to supply the wants of others, and can provide for
them, even from the ends of the earth.

[Matthew 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 2:13</span></span>

Egypt had been a house of bondage to Israel, and particularly cruel to
the infants of Israel; yet it is to be a place of refuge to the holy
Child Jesus. God, when he pleases, can make the worst of places serve
the best of purposes. This was a trial of the faith of Joseph and Mary.
But their faith, being tried, was found firm. If we and our infants are
at any time in trouble, let us remember the straits in which Christ was
when an infant.

[Matthew 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 2:16</span></span>

Herod killed all the male children, not only in Bethlehem, but in all
the villages of that city. Unbridled wrath, armed with an unlawful
power, often carries men to absurd cruelties. It was no unrighteous
thing with God to permit this; every life is forfeited to his justice as
soon as it begins. The diseases and deaths of little children are proofs
of original sin. But the murder of these infants was their martyrdom.
How early did persecution against Christ and his kingdom begin! Herod
now thought that he had baffled the Old Testament prophecies, and the
efforts of the wise men in finding Christ; but whatever crafty, cruel
devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand.

[Matthew 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 2:19</span></span>

Egypt may serve to sojourn in, or take shelter in, for awhile, but not
to abide in. Christ was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,
to them he must return. Did we but look upon the world as our Egypt, the
place of our bondage and banishment, and heaven only as our Canaan, our
home, our rest, we should as readily arise and depart thither, when we
are called for, as Joseph did out of Egypt. The family must settle in
Galilee. Nazareth was a place held in bad esteem, and Christ was
crucified with this accusation, Jesus the Nazarene. Wherever Providence
allots the bounds of our habitation, we must expect to share the
reproach of Christ; yet we may glory in being called by his name, sure
that if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him.
