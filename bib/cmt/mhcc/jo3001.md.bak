[3 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo3 1:1</span></span>

Those who are beloved of Christ, will love the brethren for his sake.
Soul prosperity is the greatest blessing on this side heaven. Grace and
health are rich companions. Grace will employ health. A rich soul may be
lodged in a weak body; and grace must then be exercised in submitting to
such a dispensation. But we may wish and pray that those who have
prosperous souls, may have healthful bodies; that their grace may shine
where there is still more room for activity. How many professors there
are, about whom the apostle's words must be reversed, and we must
earnestly wish and pray that their souls might prosper, as their health
and circumstances do! True faith will work by love. A good report is due
from those who receive good; they could not but testify to the church,
what they found and felt. Good men will rejoice in the soul prosperity
of others; and they are glad to hear of the grace and goodness of
others. And as it is a joy to good parents, it will be a joy to good
ministers, to see their people adorn their profession. Gaius overlooked
petty differences among serious Christians, and freely helped all who
bore the image, and did the work of Christ. He was upright in what he
did, as a faithful servant. Faithful souls can hear their own praises
without being puffed up; the commendation of what is good in them, lays
them at the foot of the cross of Christ. Christians should consider not
only what they must do, but what they may do; and should do even the
common actions of life, and of good-will, after a godly sort, serving
God therein, and designing his glory. Those who freely make known
Christ's gospel, should be helped by others to whom God gives the means.
Those who cannot themselves proclaim it, may yet receive, help, and
countenance those who do so.

[3 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo3 1:9</span></span>

Both the heart and mouth must be watched. The temper and spirit of
Diotrephes was full of pride and ambition. It is bad not to do good
ourselves; but it is worse to hinder those who would do good. Those
cautions and counsels are most likely to be accepted, which are seasoned
with love. Follow that which is good, for he that doeth good, as
delighting therein, is born of God. Evil-workers vainly pretend or boast
acquaintance with God. Let us not follow that which is proud, selfish,
and of bad design, though the example may be given by persons of rank
and power; but let us be followers of God, and walk in love, after the
example of our Lord.

[3 John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo3 1:13</span></span>

Here is the character of Demetrius. A name in the gospel, or a good
report in the churches, is better than worldly honour. Few are well
spoken of by all; and sometimes it is ill to be so. Happy those whose
spirit and conduct commend them before God and men. We must be ready to
bear our testimony to them; and it is well when those who commend, can
appeal to the consciences of such as know most of those who are
commended. A personal conversation together often spares time and
trouble, and mistakes which rise from letters; and good Christians may
well be glad to see one another. The blessing is, Peace be to you; all
happiness attend you. Those may well salute and greet one another on
earth, who hope to live together in heaven. By associating with and
copying the example of such Christians, we shall have peace within, and
live at peace with the brethren; our communications with the Lord's
people on earth will be pleasing, and we shall be numbered with them in
glory everlasting.
