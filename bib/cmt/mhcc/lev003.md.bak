### [Leviticus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 3:0</span></span>

([Lev 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001).md) The peace-offering of the
herd.

([Lev 3:6-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#006).md) The peace-offering of
the flock.

[Leviticus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 3:1</span></span>

The peace-offerings had regard to God as the giver of all good things.
These were divided between the altar, the priest, and the owner. They
were called peace-offering, because in them God and his people did, as
it were, feast together, in token of friendship. The peace-offerings
were offered by way of supplication. If a man were in pursuit of any
mercy, he would add a peace-offering to his prayer for it. Christ is our
Peace, our Peace-offering; for through him alone it is that we can
obtain an answer of peace to our prayers. Or, the peace-offering was
offered by way of thanksgiving for some mercy received. We must offer to
God the sacrifice of praise continually, by Christ our Peace; and then
this shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock.

[Leviticus 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 3:6</span></span>

Here is a law that they should eat neither fat nor blood. As for the
fat, it means the fat of the inwards, the suet. The blood was forbidden
for the same reason; because it was God's part of every sacrifice. God
would not permit the blood that made atonement to be used as a common
thing, [Heb 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md); nor will he allow
us, though we have the comfort of the atonement made, to claim for
ourselves any share in the honour of making it. This taught the Jews to
observe distinction between common and sacred things; it kept them
separate from idolaters. It would impress them more deeply with the
belief of some important mystery in the shedding of the blood and the
burning the fat of their solemn sacrifices. Christ, as the Prince of
peace, "made peace with the blood of his cross." Through him the
believer is reconciled to God; and having the peace of God in his heart,
he is disposed to follow peace with all men. May the Lord multiply
grace, mercy, and peace, to all who desire to bear the Christian
character.
