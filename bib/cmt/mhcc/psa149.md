### [Psalms Chapter 149](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 149:0</span></span>

([Psa 149:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001).md) Joy to all the people
of God.

([Psa 149:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006).md) Terror to their
enemies.

[Psalms 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 149:1</span></span>

New mercies continually demand new songs of praise, upon earth and in
heaven. And the children of Zion have not only to bless the God who made
them, but to rejoice in him, as having created them in Christ Jesus unto
good works, and formed them saints as well as men. The Lord takes
pleasure in his people; they should rejoice in Him. When the Lord has
made sinners feel their wants and unworthiness, he will adorn them with
the graces of his Spirit, and cause them to bear his image, and rejoice
in his happiness for ever. Let his saints employ their waking hours upon
their beds in songs of praise. Let them rejoice, even upon the bed of
death, assured that they are going to eternal rest and glory.

[Psalms 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 149:6</span></span>

Some of God's servants of old were appointed to execute vengeance
according to his word. They did not do it from personal revenge or
earthly politics, but in obedience to God's command. And the honour
intended for all the saints of God, consists in their triumphs over the
enemies of their salvation. Christ never intended his gospel should be
spread by fire and sword, or his righteousness by the wrath of man. But
let the high praises of God be in our mouths, while we wield the sword
of the word of God, with the shield of faith, in warfare with the world,
the flesh, and the devil. The saints shall be more than conquerors over
the enemies of their souls, through the blood of the Lamb and the word
of his testimony. The completing of this will be in the judgement of the
great day. Then shall the judgement be executed. Behold Jesus, and his
gospel church, chiefly in her millennial state. He and his people
rejoice in each other; by their prayers and efforts they work with him,
while he goes forth in the chariots of salvation, conquering sinners by
grace, or in chariots of vengeance, to destroy his enemies.
