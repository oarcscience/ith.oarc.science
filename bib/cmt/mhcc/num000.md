This book is called NUMBERS from the several numberings of the people
contained in it. It extends from the giving of the law at Sinai, till
their arrival in the plains of Jordan. An account is given of their
murmuring and unbelief, for which they were sentenced to wander in the
wilderness nearly forty years; also some laws, both, moral and
ceremonial. Their trials greatly tended to distinguish the wicked and
hypocrites from the faithful and true servants of God, who served him
with a pure heart.
