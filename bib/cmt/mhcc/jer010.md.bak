### [Jeremiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 10:0</span></span>

(v. 1-16) The absurdity of idolatry.

([Jer 10:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017).md) Destruction denounced
against Jerusalem.

[Jeremiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 10:1</span></span>

The prophet shows the glory of Israel's God, and exposes the folly of
idolaters. Charms and other attempts to obtain supernatural help, or to
pry into futurity, are copied from the wicked customs of the heathen.
Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God, by giving that glory to
another which is due to him alone. He is ready to forgive, and save all
who repent and believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. Faith learns
these blessed truths from the word of God; but all knowledge not from
that source, leads to doctrines of vanity.

[Jeremiah 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 10:17</span></span>

The Jews who continued in their own land, felt secure. But, sooner or
later, sinners will find all things as the word of God has declared, and
that its threatenings are not empty terrors. Submission will support the
believer under every grief allotted to him; but what can render the load
of Divine vengeance easy to be borne by those who fall under it in
sullen despair? Those cannot expect to prosper, who do not, by faith and
prayer, take God with them in all their ways. The report of the enemy's
approach was very dreadful. Yet the designs which men lay deep, and
think well formed, are dashed to pieces in a moment. Events are often
overruled, so as to be quite contrary to what we intended and expected.
If the Lord has directed our steps into the ways of peace and
righteousness, let us entreat him to enable us to walk therein. Say not,
Lord, do not correct me; but, Lord, do not correct me in anger. We may
bear the smart of God's rod, but we cannot bear the weight of his wrath.
Those who restrain prayer, prove that they know not God; for those who
know him will seek him, and seek his favour. If even severe corrections
lead sinners to be convinced of wholesome truths, they will have
abundant cause for gratitude. And they will then humble themselves
before the Lord.
