### [Numbers Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 3:0</span></span>

([Num 3:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001).md) The sons of Aaron, The
Levites taken instead of the first-born.

(v. 14-39) The Levites numbered by their families, Their duties.

([Num 3:40-51](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040).md) The first-born are
numbered.

[Numbers 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 3:1</span></span>

There was much work belonging to the priests' office, and there were now
only Aaron and his two sons to do it; God appoints the Levites to attend
them. Those whom God finds work for, he will find help for. The Levites
were taken instead of the first-born. When He that made us, saves us, as
the first-born of Israel were saved, we are laid under further
obligations to serve him faithfully. God's right to us by redemption,
confirms the right he has to us by creation.

[Numbers 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 3:14</span></span>

The Levites were in three classes, according to the sons of Levi;
Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; and these were subdivided into families.
The posterity of Moses were not at all honoured or privileged, but stood
upon the level with other Levites; thus it was plain, that Moses did not
seek the advancement of his own family, or to secure any honours to it.
The tribe of Levi was by much the least of all the tribes. God's chosen
are but a little flock in comparison with the world.

[Numbers 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">num 3:40</span></span>

The number of the first-born, and that of the Levites, came near to each
other. Known unto God are all his works beforehand; there is an exact
proportion between them, and so it will appear, when they are compared
together. The small number of first-born, over and above the number of
the Levites, were to be redeemed, and the redemption-money given to
Aaron. The church is called the church of the first-born, which is
redeemed, not as they were, with silver and gold; but, being devoted by
sin to the justice of God, is ransomed with the precious blood of the
Son of God. All men are the Lord's by creation, and all true Christians
are his by redemption. Each should know his own post and duty; nor can
any service required by such a Master be rightly accounted mean or hard.
