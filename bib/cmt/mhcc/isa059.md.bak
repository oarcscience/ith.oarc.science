### [Isaiah Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 59:0</span></span>

([Isa 59:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001).md) Reproofs of sin and
wickedness.

([Isa 59:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009).md) Confession of sin, and
lamentation for the consequences.

([Isa 59:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016).md) Promises of
deliverance.

[Isaiah 59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 59:1</span></span>

If our prayers are not answered, and the salvation we wait for is not
wrought for us, it is not because God is weary of hearing prayer, but
because we are weary of praying. See here sin in true colours,
exceedingly sinful; and see sin in its consequences, exceedingly
hurtful, separating from God, and so separating us, not only from all
good, but to all evil. Yet numbers feed, to their own destruction, on
infidel and wicked systems. Nor can their skill or craft, in devising
schemes, as the spider weaves its web, deliver or save them. No schemes
of self-wrought salvation shall avail those who despise the Redeemer's
robe of righteousness. Every man who is destitute of the Spirit of
Christ, runs swiftly to evil of some sort; but those regardless of
Divine truth and justice, are strangers to peace.

[Isaiah 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 59:9</span></span>

If we shut our eyes against the light of Divine truth, it is just with
God to hide from our eyes the things that belong to our peace. The sins
of those who profess themselves God's people, are worse than the sins of
others. And the sins of a nation bring public judgments, when not
restrained by public justice. Men may murmur under calamities, but
nothing will truly profit while they reject Christ and his gospel.

[Isaiah 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 59:16</span></span>

This passage is connected with the following chapters. It is generally
thought to describe the coming of the Messiah, as the Avenger and
Deliverer of his church. There was none to intercede with God to turn
away his wrath; none to interpose for the support of justice and truth.
Yet He engaged his own strength and righteousness for his people. God
will make his justice upon the enemies of his church and people plainly
appear. When the enemy threatens to bear down all without control, then
the Spirit of the Lord shall stop him, put him to flight. He that has
delivered, will still deliver. A far more glorious salvation is promised
to be wrought out by the Messiah in the fulness of time, which all the
prophets had in view. The Son of God shall come to us to be our
Redeemer; the Spirit of God shall come to be our Sanctifier: thus the
Comforter shall abide with the church for ever, [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md). The word of Christ will always
continue in the mouths of the faithful; and whatever is pretended to be
the mind of the Spirit, must be tried by the Scriptures. We must lament
the progress of infidelity and impiety. But the cause of the Redeemer
shall gain a complete victory even on earth, and the believer will be
more than conqueror when the Lord receives him to his glory in heaven.
