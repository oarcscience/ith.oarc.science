### [Isaiah Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md)

([Isa 38:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001).md) Hezekiah's sickness and
recovery.

([Isa 38:9-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009).md) His thanksgiving.

[Isaiah 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 38:1</span></span>

When we pray in our sickness, though God send not to us such an answer
as he here sent to Hezekiah, yet, if by his Spirit he bids us be of good
cheer, assures us that our sins are forgiven, and that, whether we live
or die, we shall be his, we do not pray in vain. See [Kg2
20:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#001.md).

[Isaiah 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 38:9</span></span>

We have here Hezekiah's thanksgiving. It is well for us to remember the
mercies we receive in sickness. Hezekiah records the condition he was
in. He dwells upon this; I shall no more see the Lord. A good man wishes
not to live for any other end than that he may serve God, and have
communion with him. Our present residence is like that of a shepherd in
his hut, a poor, mean, and cold lodging, and with a trust committed to
our charge, as the shepherd has. Our days are compared to the weaver's
shuttle, [Job 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#006.md), passing and
repassing very swiftly, every throw leaving a thread behind it; and when
finished, the piece is cut off, taken out of the loom, and showed to our
Master to be judged of. A good man, when his life is cut off, his cares
and fatigues are cut off with it, and he rests from his labours. But our
times are in God's hand; he has appointed what shall be the length of
the piece. When sick, we are very apt to calculate our time, but are
still at uncertainty. It should be more our care how we shall get safe
to another world. And the more we taste of the loving-kindness of God,
the more will our hearts love him, and live to him. It was in love to
our poor perishing souls that Christ delivered them. The pardon does not
make the sin not to have been sin, but not to be punished as it
deserves. It is pleasant to think of our recoveries from sickness, when
we see them flowing from the pardon of sin. Hezekiah's opportunity to
glorify God in this world, he made the business, and pleasure, and end
of life. Being recovered, he resolves to abound in praising and serving
God. God's promises are not to do away, but to quicken and encourage the
use of means. Life and health are given that we may glorify God and do
good.
