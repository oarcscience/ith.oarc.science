### [Leviticus Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 8:0</span></span>

([Lev 8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001).md) The consecration of
Aaron and his sons.

(v. 14-36) The offerings of consecration.

[Leviticus 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 8:1</span></span>

The consecration of Aaron and his sons had been delayed until the
tabernacle had been prepared, and the laws of the sacrifices given.
Aaron and his sons were washed with water, to signify that they ought to
purify themselves from all sinful dispositions, and ever after to keep
themselves pure. Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood
whom he makes kings and priests to our God, [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md), [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md); and those that draw near to God
must be washed in pure water, [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md). The anointing of Aaron was to
typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by
measure to him. All believers have received the anointing.

[Leviticus 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 8:14</span></span>

In these types we see our great High Priest, even Christ Jesus, solemnly
appointed, anointed, and invested with his sacred office, by his own
blood, and the influences of his Holy Spirit. He sanctifies the
ordinances of religion, to the benefit of his people and the honour of
God the Father; who for his sake accepts our worship, though it is
polluted with sin. We may also rejoice, that he is a merciful and
faithful High Priest, full of compassion to the feeble-minded and
tempest-tossed soul. All true Christians are consecrated to be spiritual
priests. We should seriously ask ourselves, whether in our daily walk we
study to maintain this character? and abound in spiritual sacrifices,
acceptable to God through Christ? If so, still there is no cause for
boasting. Let us not despise our fellow-sinners; but remembering what we
have done, and how we are saved, let us seek and pray for their
salvation.
