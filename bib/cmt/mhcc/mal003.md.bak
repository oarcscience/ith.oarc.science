[Malachi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 3:1</span></span>

The first words of this chapter seem an answer to the scoffers of those
days. Here is a prophecy of the appearing of John the Baptist. He is
Christ's harbinger. He shall prepare the way before him, by calling men
to repentance. The Messiah had been long called, "He that should come,"
and now shortly he will come. He is the Messenger of the covenant. Those
who seek Jesus, shall find pleasure in him, often when not looked for.
The Lord Jesus, prepares the sinner's heart to be his temple, by the
ministry of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, and he enters it
as the Messenger of peace and consolation. No hypocrite or formalist can
endure his doctrine, or stand before his tribunal. Christ came to
distinguish men, to separate between the precious and the vile. He shall
sit as a Refiner. Christ, by his gospel, shall purify and reform his
church, and by his Spirit working with it, shall regenerate and cleanse
souls. He will take away the dross found in them. He will separate their
corruptions, which render their faculties worthless and useless. The
believer needs not fear the fiery trial of afflictions and temptations,
by which the Saviour refines his gold. He will take care it is not more
intense or longer than is needful for his good; and this trial will end
far otherwise than that of the wicked. Christ will, by interceding for
them, make them accepted. Where no fear of God is, no good is to be
expected. Evil pursues sinners. God is unchangeable. And though the
sentence against evil works be not executed speedily, yet it will be
executed; the Lord is as much an enemy to sin as ever. We may all apply
this to ourselves. Because we have to do with a God that changes not,
therefore it is that we are not consumed; because his compassions fail
not.

[Malachi 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mal 3:7</span></span>

The men of that generation turned away from God, they had not kept his
ordinances. God gives them a gracious call. But they said, Wherein shall
we return? God notices what returns our hearts make to the calls of his
word. It shows great perverseness in sin, when men make afflictions
excuses for sin, which are sent to part between them and their sins.
Here is an earnest exhortation to reform. God must be served in the
first place; and the interest of our souls ought to be preferred before
that of our bodies. Let them trust God to provide for their comfort. God
has blessings ready for us, but through the weakness of our faith and
the narrowness of our desires, we have not room to receive them. He who
makes trial will find nothing is lost by honouring the Lord with his
substance.

[Malachi 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mal 3:13</span></span>

Among the Jews at this time, some plainly discovered themselves to be
children of the wicked one. The yoke of Christ is easy. But those who
work wickedness, tempt God by presumptuous sins. Judge of things as they
will appear when the doom of these proud sinners comes to be executed.
Those that feared the Lord, spake kindly, for preserving and promoting
mutual love, when sin thus abounded. They spake one to another, in the
language of those that fear the Lord, and think on his name. As evil
communications corrupt good minds and manners, so good communications
confirm them. A book of remembrance was written before God. He will take
care that his children perish not with those that believe not. They
shall be vessels of mercy and honour, when the rest are made vessels of
wrath and dishonour. The saints are God's jewels; they are dear to him.
He will preserve them as his jewels, when the earth is burned up like
dross. Those who now own God for theirs, he will then own for his. It is
our duty to serve God with the disposition of children; and he will not
have his children trained up in idleness; they must do him service from
a principle of love. Even God's children stand in need of sparing mercy.
All are righteous or wicked, such as serve God, or such as serve him
not: all are going to heaven or to hell. We are often deceived in our
opinions concerning both the one and the other; but at the bar of
Christ, every man's character will be known. As to ourselves, we have
need to think among which we shall have our lot; and, as to others, we
must judge nothing before the time. But in the end all the world will
confess that those alone were wise and happy, who served the Lord and
trusted in Him.
