[Amos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 7:1</span></span>

God bears long, but he will not bear always with a provoking people. The
remembrance of the mercies we formerly received, like the produce of the
earth of the former growth, should make us submissive to the will of
God, when we meet with disappointments in the latter growth. The Lord
has many ways of humbling a sinful nation. Whatever trouble we are
under, we should be most earnest with God for the forgiveness of sin.
Sin will soon make a great people small. What will become of Israel, if
the hand that should raise him be stretched out against him? See the
power of prayer. See what a blessing praying people are to a land. See
how ready, how swift God is to show mercy; how he waits to be gracious.
Israel was a wall, a strong wall, which God himself reared as a defence
to his sanctuary. The Lord now seems to stand upon this wall. He
measures it; it appears to be a bowing, bulging wall. Thus God would
bring the people of Israel to the trial, would discover their
wickedness; and the time will come, when those who have been spared
often, shall be spared no longer. But the Lord still calls Israel his
people. The repeated prayer and success of the prophet should lead us to
seek the Saviour.

[Amos 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 7:10</span></span>

It is no new thing for the accusers of the brethren, to misrepresent
them as enemies to the king and kingdom, as traitors to their prince,
and troublers of the land, when they are the best friends to both. Those
who make gain their godliness, and are governed by the hopes of wealth
and preferment, are ready to think these the most powerful motives with
others also. But those who have a warrant from God, like Amos, ought not
to fear the face of man. If God, that sent him, had not strengthened
him, he could not thus have set his face as a flint. The Lord often
chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the wise
and mighty. But no fervent prayers, or self-denying labours, can bring
proud sinners to bear faithful reproofs and warnings. And all who oppose
or despise the Divine word, must expect fatal effects to their souls,
unless they repent.
