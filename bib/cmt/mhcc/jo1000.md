[1 John](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jo1 0:0</span></span>

This epistle is a discourse upon the principles of Christianity, in
doctrine and practice. The design appears to be, to refute and guard
against erroneous and unholy tenets, principles, and practices,
especially such as would lower the Godhead of Christ, and the reality
and power of his sufferings and death, as an atoning sacrifice; and
against the assertion that believers being saved by grace, are not
required to obey the commandments. This epistle also stirs up all who
profess to know God, to have communion with him, and to believe in him,
and that they walk in holiness, not in sin, showing that a mere outward
profession is nothing, without the evidence of a holy life and conduct.
It also helps forward and excites real Christians to communion with God
and the Lord Jesus Christ, to constancy in the true faith, and to purity
of life.
