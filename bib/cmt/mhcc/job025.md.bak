### [Job Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 25:0</span></span>

Bildad shows that man cannot be justified before God.

[Job 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 25:1</span></span>

Bildad drops the question concerning the prosperity of wicked men; but
shows the infinite distance there is between God and man. He represents
to Job some truths he had too much overlooked. Man's righteousness and
holiness, at the best, are nothing in comparison with God's, [Psa
89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006.md). As God is so great and glorious,
how can man, who is guilty and impure, appear before him? We need to be
born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, and to be bathed again and
again in the blood of Christ, that Fountain opened, [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md). We should be humbled as mean,
guilty, polluted creatures, and renounce self-dependence. But our
vileness will commend Christ's condescension and love; the riches of his
mercy and the power of his grace will be magnified to all eternity by
every sinner he redeems.
