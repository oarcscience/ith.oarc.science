[Matthew 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 5:1</span></span>

None will find happiness in this world or the next, who do not seek it
from Christ by the rule of his word. He taught them what was the evil
they should abhor, and what the good they should seek and abound in.

[Matthew 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 5:3</span></span>

Our Saviour here gives eight characters of blessed people, which
represent to us the principal graces of a Christian. 1. The poor in
spirit are happy. These bring their minds to their condition, when it is
a low condition. They are humble and lowly in their own eyes. They see
their want, bewail their guilt, and thirst after a Redeemer. The kingdom
of grace is of such; the kingdom of glory is for them. 2. Those that
mourn are happy. That godly sorrow which worketh true repentance,
watchfulness, a humble mind, and continual dependence for acceptance on
the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, with constant seeking the Holy Spirit,
to cleanse away the remaining evil, seems here to be intended. Heaven is
the joy of our Lord; a mountain of joy, to which our way is through a
vale of tears. Such mourners shall be comforted by their God. 3. The
meek are happy. The meek are those who quietly submit to God; who can
bear insult; are silent, or return a soft answer; who, in their
patience, keep possession of their own souls, when they can scarcely
keep possession of anything else. These meek ones are happy, even in
this world. Meekness promotes wealth, comfort, and safety, even in this
world. 4. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are happy.
Righteousness is here put for all spiritual blessings. These are
purchased for us by the righteousness of Christ, confirmed by the
faithfulness of God. Our desires of spiritual blessings must be earnest.
Though all desires for grace are not grace, yet such a desire as this,
is a desire of God's own raising, and he will not forsake the work of
his own hands. 5. The merciful are happy. We must not only bear our own
afflictions patiently, but we must do all we can to help those who are
in misery. We must have compassion on the souls of others, and help
them; pity those who are in sin, and seek to snatch them as brands out
of the burning. 6. The pure in heart are happy; for they shall see God.
Here holiness and happiness are fully described and put together. The
heart must be purified by faith, and kept for God. Create in me such a
clean heart, O God. None but the pure are capable of seeing God, nor
would heaven be happiness to the impure. As God cannot endure to look
upon their iniquity, so they cannot look upon his purity. 7. The
peace-makers are happy. They love, and desire, and delight in peace; and
study to be quiet. They keep the peace that it be not broken, and
recover it when it is broken. If the peace-makers are blessed, woe to
the peace-breakers! 8. Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake
are happy. This saying is peculiar to Christianity; and it is more
largely insisted upon than any of the rest. Yet there is nothing in our
sufferings that can merit of God; but God will provide that those who
lose for him, though life itself, shall not lose by him in the end.
Blessed Jesus! how different are thy maxims from those of men of this
world! They call the proud happy, and admire the gay, the rich, the
powerful, and the victorious. May we find mercy from the Lord; may we be
owned as his children, and inherit his kingdom. With these enjoyments
and hopes, we may cheerfully welcome low or painful circumstances.

[Matthew 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 5:13</span></span>

Ye are the salt of the earth. Mankind, lying in ignorance and
wickedness, were as a vast heap, ready to putrify; but Christ sent forth
his disciples, by their lives and doctrines to season it with knowledge
and grace. If they are not such as they should be, they are as salt that
has lost its savour. If a man can take up the profession of Christ, and
yet remain graceless, no other doctrine, no other means, can make him
profitable. Our light must shine, by doing such good works as men may
see. What is between God and our souls, must be kept to ourselves; but
that which is of itself open to the sight of men, we must study to make
suitable to our profession, and praiseworthy. We must aim at the glory
of God.

[Matthew 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 5:17</span></span>

Let none suppose that Christ allows his people to trifle with any
commands of God's holy law. No sinner partakes of Christ's justifying
righteousness, till he repents of his evil deeds. The mercy revealed in
the gospel leads the believer to still deeper self-abhorrence. The law
is the Christian's rule of duty, and he delights therein. If a man,
pretending to be Christ's disciple, encourages himself in any allowed
disobedience to the holy law of God, or teaches others to do the same,
whatever his station or reputation among men may be, he can be no true
disciple. Christ's righteousness, imputed to us by faith alone, is
needed by every one that enters the kingdom of grace or of glory; but
the new creation of the heart to holiness, produces a thorough change in
a man's temper and conduct.

[Matthew 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 5:21</span></span>

The Jewish teachers had taught, that nothing except actual murder was
forbidden by the sixth commandment. Thus they explained away its
spiritual meaning. Christ showed the full meaning of this commandment;
according to which we must be judged hereafter, and therefore ought to
be ruled now. All rash anger is heart murder. By our brother, here, we
are to understand any person, though ever so much below us, for we are
all made of one blood. "Raca," is a scornful word, and comes from pride:
"Thou fool," is a spiteful word, and comes from hatred. Malicious
slanders and censures are poison that kills secretly and slowly. Christ
told them that how light soever they made of these sins, they would
certainly be called into judgment for them. We ought carefully to
preserve Christian love and peace with all our brethren; and if at any
time there is a quarrel, we should confess our fault, humble ourselves
to our brother, making or offering satisfaction for wrong done in word
or deed: and we should do this quickly; because, till this is done, we
are unfit for communion with God in holy ordinances. And when we are
preparing for any religious exercises, it is good for us to make that an
occasion of serious reflection and self-examination. What is here said
is very applicable to our being reconciled to God through Christ. While
we are alive, we are in the way to his judgement-seat; after death, it
will be too late. When we consider the importance of the case, and the
uncertainty of life, how needful it is to seek peace with God, without
delay!

[Matthew 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 5:27</span></span>

Victory over the desires of the heart, must be attended with painful
exertions. But it must be done. Every thing is bestowed to save us from
our sins, not in them. All our senses and powers must be kept from those
things which lead to transgression. Those who lead others into
temptation to sin, by dress or in other ways, or leave them in it, or
expose them to it, make themselves guilty of their sin, and will be
accountable for it. If painful operations are submitted to, that our
lives may be saved, what ought our minds to shrink from, when the
salvation of our souls is concerned? There is tender mercy under all the
Divine requirements, and the grace and consolations of the Spirit will
enable us to attend to them.

[Matthew 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 5:33</span></span>

There is no reason to consider that solemn oaths in a court of justice,
or on other proper occasions, are wrong, provided they are taken with
due reverence. But all oaths taken without necessity, or in common
conversation, must be sinful, as well as all those expressions which are
appeals to God, though persons think thereby to evade the guilt of
swearing. The worse men are, the less they are bound by oaths; the
better they are, the less there is need for them. Our Lord does not
enjoin the precise terms wherein we are to affirm or deny, but such a
constant regard to truth as would render oaths unnecessary.

[Matthew 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 5:38</span></span>

The plain instruction is, Suffer any injury that can be borne, for the
sake of peace, committing your concerns to the Lord's keeping. And the
sum of all is, that Christians must avoid disputing and striving. If any
say, Flesh and blood cannot pass by such an affront, let them remember,
that flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and those who
act upon right principles will have most peace and comfort.

[Matthew 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 5:43</span></span>

The Jewish teachers by "neighbour" understood only those who were of
their own country, nation, and religion, whom they were pleased to look
upon as their friends. The Lord Jesus teaches that we must do all the
real kindness we can to all, especially to their souls. We must pray for
them. While many will render good for good, we must render good for
evil; and this will speak a nobler principle than most men act by.
Others salute their brethren, and embrace those of their own party, and
way, and opinion, but we must not so confine our respect. It is the duty
of Christians to desire, and aim at, and press towards perfection in
grace and holiness. And therein we must study to conform ourselves to
the example of our heavenly Father, [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md), [Pe1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#016.md). Surely more is to be expected
from the followers of Christ than from others; surely more will be found
in them than in others. Let us beg of God to enable us to prove
ourselves his children.
