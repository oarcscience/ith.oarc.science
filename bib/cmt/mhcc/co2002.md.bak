### [2 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 2:0</span></span>

([Co2 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001).md) Reasons for the apostle
not coming to Corinth.

([Co2 2:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005).md) Directions about
restoring the repentant offender.

([Co2 2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012).md) An account of his
labours and success in spreading the gospel of Christ.

[2 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 2:1</span></span>

The apostle desired to have a cheerful meeting with them; and he had
written in confidence of their doing what was to their benefit and his
comfort; and that therefore they would be glad to remove every cause of
disquiet from him. We should always give pain unwillingly, even when
duty requires that it must be given.

[2 Corinthians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 2:5</span></span>

The apostle desires them to receive the person who had done wrong, again
into their communion; for he was aware of his fault, and much afflicted
under his punishment. Even sorrow for sin should not unfit for other
duties, and drive to despair. Not only was there danger last Satan
should get advantage, by tempting the penitent to hard thoughts of God
and religion, and so drive him to despair; but against the churches and
the ministers of Christ, by bringing an evil report upon Christians as
unforgiving; thus making divisions, and hindering the success of the
ministry. In this, as in other things, wisdom is to be used, that the
ministry may not be blamed for indulging sin on the one hand, or for too
great severity towards sinners on the other hand. Satan has many plans
to deceive, and knows how to make a bad use of our mistakes.

[2 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 2:12</span></span>

A believer's triumphs are all in Christ. To him be the praise and glory
of all, while the success of the gospel is a good reason for a
Christian's joy and rejoicing. In ancient triumphs, abundance of
perfumes and sweet odours were used; so the name and salvation of Jesus,
as ointment poured out, was a sweet savour diffused in every place. Unto
some, the gospel is a savour of death unto death. They reject it to
their ruin. Unto others, the gospel is a savour of life unto life: as it
quickened them at first when they were dead in trespasses and sins, so
it makes them more lively, and will end in eternal life. Observe the
awful impressions this matter made upon the apostle, and should also
make upon us. The work is great, and of ourselves we have no strength at
all; all our sufficiency is of God. But what we do in religion, unless
it is done in sincerity, as in the sight of God, is not of God, does not
come from him, and will not reach to him. May we carefully watch
ourselves in this matter; and seek the testimony of our consciences,
under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, that as of sincerity, so speak we
in Christ and of Christ.
