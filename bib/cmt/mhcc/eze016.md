### [Ezekiel Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 16:0</span></span>

A parable showing the first low estate of the Jewish nation, its
prosperity, idolatries, and punishment.

[Ezekiel 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 16:1</span></span>

In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation, and their conduct
towards him, are described, and their punishment through the surrounding
nations, even those they most trusted in. This is done under the parable
of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly
provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and
punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her
base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas,
but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many
of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred
to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.

[Ezekiel 16:59](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">eze 16:59</span></span>

After a full warning of judgments, mercy is remembered, mercy is
reserved. These closing verses are a precious promise, in part fulfilled
at the return of the penitent and reformed Jews out of Babylon, but to
have fuller accomplishment in gospel times. The Divine mercy should be
powerful to melt our hearts into godly sorrow for sin. Nor will God ever
leave the sinner to perish, who is humbled for his sins, and comes to
trust in His mercy and grace through Jesus Christ; but will keep him by
his power, through faith unto salvation.
