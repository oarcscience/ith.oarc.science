### [Daniel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 2:0</span></span>

([Dan 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001).md) Nebuchadnezzar's dream.

([Dan 2:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#014).md) It is revealed to
Daniel.

([Dan 2:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#024).md) He obtains admission to
the king.

([Dan 2:31-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#031).md) The dream and the
interpretation.

([Dan 2:46-49](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#046).md) Honours to Daniel and
his friends.

[Daniel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 2:1</span></span>

The greatest men are most open to cares and troubles of mind, which
disturb their repose in the night, while the sleep of the labouring man
is sweet and sound. We know not the uneasiness of many who live in great
pomp, and, as others vainly think, in pleasure also. The king said that
his learned men must tell him the dream itself, or they should all be
put to death as deceivers. Men are more eager to ask as to future
events, than to learn the way of salvation or the path of duty; yet
foreknowledge of future events increases anxiety and trouble. Those who
deceived, by pretending to do what they could not do, were sentenced to
death, for not being able to do what they did not pretend to.

[Daniel 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 2:14</span></span>

Daniel humbly prayed that God would discover to him the king's dream,
and the meaning of it. Praying friends are valuable friends; and it well
becomes the greatest and best men to desire the prayers of others. Let
us show that we value our friends, and their prayers. They were
particular in prayer. And whatever we pray for, we can expect nothing
but as the gift of God's mercies. God gives us leave in prayer to tell
our wants and burdens. Their plea with God was, the peril they were in.
The mercy Daniel and his fellows prayed for, was bestowed. The fervent
prayers of righteous men avail much. Daniel was thankful to God for
making known that to him, which saved the lives of himself and his
fellows. How much more should we be thankful to God, for making known
the great salvation of the soul to those who are not among the worldly
wise and prudent!

[Daniel 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 2:24</span></span>

Daniel takes away the king's opinion of his magicians and soothsayers.
The insufficiency of creatures should drive us to the all-sufficiency of
the Creator. There is One who can do that for us, and make known that to
us, which none on earth can, particularly the work of redemption, and
the secret designs of God's love to us therein. Daniel confirmed the
king in his opinion, that the dream was of great consequence, relating
to the affairs and changes of this lower world. Let those whom God has
highly favoured and honoured, lay aside all opinion of their own wisdom
and worthiness, that the Lord alone may be praised for the good they
have and do.

[Daniel 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">dan 2:31</span></span>

This image represented the kingdoms of the earth, that should
successively rule the nations, and influence the affairs of the Jewish
church. 1. The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, then in
being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of the
Medes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified the
Grecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of iron
signified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into ten kingdoms,
as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, others strong as
iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, for strengthening
the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands, represented
the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the
kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in them. This
was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was not cut out by
their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner. Of the
increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end. The
Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time and days
shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling this
prophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shall
witness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.

[Daniel 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">dan 2:46</span></span>

It is our business to direct attention to the Lord, as the Author and
Giver of every good gift. Many have thoughts of the Divine power and
majesty, who do not think of serving God themselves. But all should
strive, that God may be glorified, and the best interests of mankind
furthered.
