### [1 Chronicles Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 28:0</span></span>

([Ch1 28:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001).md) David exhorts the
people to the fear of the Lord.

([Ch1 28:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011).md) He gives instructions
for the temple.

[1 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 28:1</span></span>

During David's last sickness, many chief priests and Levites were at
Jerusalem. Finding himself able, David spoke of his purpose to build a
temple for God, and of God's disallowing that purpose. He opened to them
God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon. David charged them to cleave
stedfastly to God and their duty. We cannot do our work as we should,
unless we put on resolution, and fetch in strength from Divine grace.
Religion or piety has two distinct parts. The first is knowledge of God,
the second is worship of God. David says, Know thou the God of thy
father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. God is
made known by his works and word. Revelation alone shows the whole
character of God, in his providence, his holy law, his condemnation of
sinners, his blessed gospel, and the ministration of the Spirit to all
true believers. The natural man cannot receive this knowledge of God.
But thus we learn the value of the Saviour's atonement, and of the
sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and are influenced to walk in all his
commandments. It brings a sinner to his proper place at the foot of the
cross, as a poor, guilty, helpless worm, deserving wrath, yet expecting
every thing needful from the free mercy and grace of God our Father, and
the Lord Jesus Christ. Having been forgiven much, the pardoned sinner
learns to love much.

[1 Chronicles 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 28:11</span></span>

The temple must be a sacred thing, and a type of Christ; it must be
framed by Divine teaching. Christ is the true temple, the church is the
gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framed
according to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divine
wisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. David
gave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials were
provided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions were
given which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be not
dismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first
place. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried them
through the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leave us,
while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely to go
on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope in God's
mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.
