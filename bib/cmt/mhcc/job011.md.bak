### [Job Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 11:0</span></span>

([Job 11:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#001).md) Zophar reproves Job.

([Job 11:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007).md) God's perfections and
almighty power.

([Job 11:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#013).md) Zophar assures Job of
blessings if he repented.

[Job 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 11:1</span></span>

Zophar attacked Job with great vehemence. He represented him as a man
that loved to hear himself speak, though he could say nothing to the
purpose, and as a man that maintained falsehoods. He desired God would
show Job that less punishment was exacted than he deserved. We are
ready, with much assurance, to call God to act in our quarrels, and to
think that if he would but speak, he would take our part. We ought to
leave all disputes to the judgment of God, which we are sure is
according to truth; but those are not always right who are most forward
to appeal to the Divine judgment.

[Job 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 11:7</span></span>

Zophar speaks well concerning God and his greatness and glory,
concerning man and his vanity and folly. See here what man is; and let
him be humbled. God sees this concerning vain man, that he would be
wise, would be thought so, though he is born like a wild ass's colt, so
unteachable and untameable. Man is a vain creature; empty, so the word
is. Yet he is a proud creature, and self-conceited. He would be wise,
would be thought so, though he will not submit to the laws of wisdom. He
would be wise, he reaches after forbidden wisdom, and, like his first
parents, aiming to be wise above what is written, loses the tree of life
for the tree of knowledge. Is such a creature as this fit to contend
with God?

[Job 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 11:13</span></span>

Zophar exhorts Job to repentance, and gives him encouragement, yet mixed
with hard thoughts of him. He thought that worldly prosperity was always
the lot of the righteous, and that Job was to be deemed a hypocrite
unless his prosperity was restored. Then shalt thou lift up thy face
without spot; that is, thou mayst come boldly to the throne of grace,
and not with the terror and amazement expressed in [Job
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034.md). If we are looked upon in the
face of the Anointed, our faces that were cast down may be lifted up;
though polluted, being now washed with the blood of Christ, they may be
lifted up without spot. We may draw near in full assurance of faith,
when we are sprinkled from an evil conscience, [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md).
