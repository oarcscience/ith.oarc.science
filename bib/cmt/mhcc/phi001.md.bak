[Philippians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 1:1</span></span>

The highest honour of the most eminent ministers is, to be servants of
Christ. And those who are not really saints on earth, never will be
saints in heaven. Out of Christ, the best saints are sinners, and unable
to stand before God. There is no peace without grace. Inward peace
springs from a sense of Divine favour. And there is no grace and peace
but from God our Father, the fountain and origin of all blessings. At
Philippi the apostle was evil entreated, and saw little fruit of his
labour; yet he remembers Philippi with joy. We must thank our God for
the graces and comforts, gifts and usefulness of others, as we receive
the benefit, and God receives the glory. The work of grace will never be
perfected till the day of Jesus Christ, the day of his appearance. But
we may always be confident God will perform his good work, in every soul
wherein he has really begun it by regeneration; though we must not trust
in outward appearances, nor in any thing but a new creation to holiness.
People are dear to their ministers, when they receive benefit by their
ministry. Fellow-sufferers in the cause of God should be dear one to
another.

[Philippians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 1:8</span></span>

Shall not we pity and love those souls whom Christ loves and pities?
Those who abound in any grace, need to abound more. Try things which
differ; that we may approve the things which are excellent. The truths
and laws of Christ are excellent; and they recommend themselves as such
to any attentive mind. Sincerity is that in which we should have our
conversation in the world, and it is the glory of all our graces.
Christians should not be apt to take offence, and should be very careful
not to offend God or the brethren. The things which most honour God will
most benefit us. Let us not leave it doubtful whether any good fruit is
found in us or not. A small measure of Christian love, knowledge, and
fruitfulness should not satisfy any.

[Philippians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 1:12</span></span>

The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the
cross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. These
things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known;
and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false
friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who
preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the
bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst
of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to
rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ;
and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest
expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape
the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction.
Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his
glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by
living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in
suffering for him.

[Philippians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 1:21</span></span>

Death is a great loss to a carnal, worldly man, for he loses all his
earthly comforts and all his hopes; but to a true believer it is gain,
for it is the end of all his weakness and misery. It delivers him from
all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The
apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in
heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving
Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil
things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with
him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing
to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ,
we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But
those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to
remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the
more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be
seen in them.

[Philippians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">phi 1:27</span></span>

Those who profess the gospel of Christ, should live as becomes those who
believe gospel truths, submit to gospel laws, and depend upon gospel
promises. The original word "conversation" denotes the conduct of
citizens who seek the credit, safety, peace, and prosperity of their
city. There is that in the faith of the gospel, which is worth striving
for; there is much opposition, and there is need of striving. A man may
sleep and go to hell; but he who would go to heaven, must look about him
and be diligent. There may be oneness of heart and affection among
Christians, where there is diversity of judgment about many things.
Faith is God's gift on the behalf of Christ; the ability and disposition
to believe are from God. And if we suffer reproach and loss for Christ,
we are to reckon them a gift, and prize them accordingly. Yet salvation
must not be ascribed to bodily afflictions, as though afflictions and
worldly persecutions deserved it; but from God only is salvation: faith
and patience are his gifts.
