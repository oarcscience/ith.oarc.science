### [Mark Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 8:0</span></span>

([Mar 8:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001)) Four thousand fed by a
miracle.

([Mar 8:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011)) Christ cautions against
the Pharisees and Herodians.

([Mar 8:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022)) A blind man healed.

([Mar 8:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027)) Peter's testimony to
Christ.

([Mar 8:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034)) Christ must be
followed.

[Mark 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 8:1</span></span>

Our Lord Jesus encouraged the meanest to come to him for life and grace.
Christ knows and considers our frames. The bounty of Christ is always
ready; to show that, he repeated this miracle. His favours are renewed,
as our wants and necessities are. And those need not fear want, who have
Christ to live upon by faith, and do so with thanksgiving.

[Mark 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 8:11</span></span>

Obstinate unbelief will have something to say, though ever so
unreasonable. Christ refused to answer their demand. If they will not be
convinced, they shall not. Alas! what cause we have to lament for those
around us, who destroy themselves and others by their perverse and
obstinate unbelief, and enmity to the gospel! When we forget the works
of God, and distrust him, we should chide ourselves severely, as Christ
here reproves his disciples. How is it that we so often mistake his
meaning, disregard his warnings, and distrust his providence?

[Mark 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 8:22</span></span>

Here is a blind man brought to Christ by his friends. Therein appeared
the faith of those that brought him. If those who are spiritually blind,
do not pray for themselves, yet their friends and relations should pray
for them, that Christ would be pleased to touch them. The cure was
wrought gradually, which was not usual in our Lord's miracles. Christ
showed in what method those commonly are healed by his grace, who by
nature are spiritually blind. At first, their knowledge is confused;
but, like the light of the morning, it shines more and more to the
perfect day, and then they see all things clearly. Slighting Christ's
favours is forfeiting them; and he will make those who do so know the
worth of privileges by the want of them.

[Mark 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 8:27</span></span>

These things are written, that we may believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God. These miracles of our Lord assure us that he was not
conquered, but a Conqueror. Now the disciples are convinced that Jesus
is the Christ; they may bear to hear of his sufferings, of which Christ
here begins to give them notice. He sees that amiss in what we say and
do, of which we ourselves are not aware, and knows what manner of spirit
we are of, when we ourselves do not. The wisdom of man is folly, when it
pretends to limit the Divine counsels. Peter did not rightly understand
the nature of Christ's kingdom.

[Mark 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 8:34</span></span>

Frequent notice is taken of the great flocking there was to Christ for
help in various cases. All are concerned to know this, if they expect
him to heal their souls. They must not indulge the ease of the body. As
the happiness of heaven with Christ, is enough to make up for the loss
of life itself for him, so the gain of all the world in sin, will not
make up for the ruin of the soul by sin. And there is a day coming, when
the cause of Christ will appear as glorious, as some now think it mean
and contemptible. May we think of that season, and view every earthly
object as we shall do at that great day.
