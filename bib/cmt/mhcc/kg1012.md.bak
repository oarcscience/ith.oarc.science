### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

([Kg1 12:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001).md) Rehoboam's accession,
The people's petition, His rough answer.

([Kg1 12:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016).md) Ten tribes revolt.

([Kg1 12:25-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025).md) Jeroboam's idolatry.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 12:1</span></span>

The tribes complained not to Rehoboam of his father's idolatry, and
revolt from God. That which was the greatest grievance, was none to
them; so careless were they in matters of religion, if they might live
at case, and pay no taxes. Factious spirits will never want something to
complain of. And when we see the Scripture account of Solomon's reign;
the peace, wealth, and prosperity Israel then enjoyed; we cannot doubt
but that their charges were false, or far beyond the truth. Rehoboam
answered the people according to the counsel of the young men. Never was
man more blinded by pride, and desire of arbitrary power, than which
nothing is more fatal. God's counsels were hereby fulfilled. He left
Rehoboam to his own folly, and hid from his eyes the things which
belonged to his peace, that the kingdom might be rent from him. God
serves his own wise and righteous purposes by the imprudences and sins
of men. Those that lose the kingdom of heaven, throw it away, as
Rehoboam, by wilfulness and folly.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 12:16</span></span>

The people speak unbecomingly of David. How soon are good men, and their
good services to the public, forgotten! These considerations should
reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them,
and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge. Rehoboam
and his people hearkened to the word of the Lord. When we know God's
mind, we must submit, how much soever it crosses our own mind. If we
secure the favour of God, not all the universe can hurt us.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 12:25</span></span>

Jeroboam distrusted the providence of God; he would contrive ways and
means, and sinful ones too, for his own safety. A practical disbelief of
God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom of all our departures from him.
Though it is probable he meant his worship for Jehovah the God of
Israel, it was contrary to the Divine law, and dishonourable to the
Divine majesty to be thus represented. The people might be less shocked
at worshipping the God of Israel under an image, than if they had at
once been asked to worship Baal; but it made way for that idolatry.
Blessed Lord, give us grace to reverence thy temple, thine ordinances,
thine house of prayer, thy sabbaths, and never more, like Jeroboam, to
set up in our hearts any idol of abomination. Be thou to us every thing
precious; do thou reign and rule in our hearts, the hope of glory.
