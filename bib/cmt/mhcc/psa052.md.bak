### [Psalms Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 52:0</span></span>

([Psa 52:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001).md) The enemies of the truth
and the church described, Their destruction.

([Psa 52:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006).md) The righteous rejoice.

[Psalms 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 52:1</span></span>

Those that glory in sin, glory in their shame. The patience and
forbearance of God are abused by sinners, to the hardening of their
hearts in their wicked ways. But the enemies in vain boast in their
mischief, while we have God's mercy to trust in. It will not save us
from the guilt of lying, to be able to say, there was some truth in what
we said, if we make it appear otherwise than it was. The more there is
of craft and contrivance in any wickedness, the more there is of Satan
in it. When good men die, they are transplanted from the land of the
living on earth, to heaven, the garden of the Lord, where they shall
take root for ever; but when wicked men die, they are rooted out, to
perish for ever. The believer sees that God will destroy those who make
not him their strength.

[Psalms 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 52:6</span></span>

Those wretchedly deceive themselves, who think to support themselves in
power and wealth without God. The wicked man trusted in the abundance of
his riches; he thought his wickedness would help him to keep his wealth.
Right or wrong, he would get what he could, and keep what he had, and
ruin any one that stood in his way; this he thought would strengthen
him; but see what it comes to! Those who by faith and love dwell in the
house of God, shall be like green olive-trees there. And that we may be
as green olive-trees, we must live a life of faith and holy confidence
in God and his grace. It adds much to the beauty of our profession, and
to fruitfulness in every grace, to be much in praising God; and we never
can want matter for praise. His name alone can be our refuge and strong
tower. It is very good for us to wait on that saving name; there is
nothing better to calm and quiet our spirits, when disturbed, and to
keep us in the way of duty, when tempted to use any crooked courses for
our relief, than to hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of the
Lord. None ever followed his guidance but it ended well.
