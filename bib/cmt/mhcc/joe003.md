### [Joel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001)

[Joel](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joe 3:0</span></span>

([Joe 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001)) God's judgments in the
latter days.

([Joe 3:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009)) The extent of these
judgments.

([Joe 3:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018)) The blessings the
church shall enjoy.

[Joel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 3:1</span></span>

The restoration of the Jews, and the final victory of true religion over
all opposers, appear to be here foretold. The contempt and scorn with
which the Jews have often been treated as a people, and the little value
set upon them, are noticed. None ever hardened his heart against God or
his church, and prospered long.

[Joel 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joe 3:9</span></span>

Here is a challenge to all the enemies of God's people. There is no
escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall
be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the
same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the
wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a
joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to
glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the
Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable
vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee
from the wrath to come.

[Joel 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joe 3:18</span></span>

There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread
speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. These events are
predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every
thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the
house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his
sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful.
Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to
the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of
righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly
temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.
