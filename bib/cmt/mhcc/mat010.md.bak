### [Matthew Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 10:0</span></span>

([Mat 10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001).md) The apostles called.

([Mat 10:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005).md) The apostles instructed
and sent forth.

(v. 16-42) Directions to the apostles.

[Matthew 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 10:1</span></span>

The word "apostle" signifies messenger; they were Christ's messengers,
sent forth to proclaim his kingdom. Christ gave them power to heal all
manner of sickness. In the grace of the gospel there is a slave for
every sore, a remedy for every malady. There is no spiritual disease,
but there is power in Christ for the cure of it. There names are
recorded, and it is their honour; yet they had more reason to rejoice
that their names were written in heaven, while the high and mighty names
of the great ones of the earth are buried in the dust.

[Matthew 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 10:5</span></span>

The Gentiles must not have the gospel brought them, till the Jews have
refused it. This restraint on the apostles was only in their first
mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is
at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate
the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the
contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it
without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of
their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is
come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to
heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In
proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's
souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an
hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The
servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is
sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to
find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily
for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed
how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must
be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must
be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to
heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to
increase their condemnation.

[Matthew 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 10:16</span></span>

Our Lord warned his disciples to prepare for persecution. They were to
avoid all things which gave advantage to their enemies, all meddling
with worldly or political concerns, all appearance of evil or
selfishness, and all underhand measures. Christ foretold troubles, not
only that the troubles might not be a surprise, but that they might
confirm their faith. He tells them what they should suffer, and from
whom. Thus Christ has dealt fairly and faithfully with us, in telling us
the worst we can meet with in his service; and he would have us deal so
with ourselves, in sitting down and counting the cost. Persecutors are
worse than beasts, in that they prey upon those of their own kind. The
strongest bonds of love and duty, have often been broken through from
enmity against Christ. Sufferings from friends and relations are very
grievous; nothing cuts more. It appears plainly, that all who will live
godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution; and we must expect to
enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations. With these
predictions of trouble, are counsels and comforts for a time of trial.
The disciples of Christ are hated and persecuted as serpents, and their
ruin is sought, and they need the serpent's wisdom. Be ye harmless as
doves. Not only, do nobody any hurt, but bear nobody any ill-will.
Prudent care there must be, but not an anxious, perplexing thought; let
this care be cast upon God. The disciples of Christ must think more how
to do well, than how to speak well. In case of great peril, the
disciples of Christ may go out of the way of danger, though they must
not go out of the way of duty. No sinful, unlawful means may be used to
escape; for then it is not a door of God's opening. The fear of man
brings a snare, a perplexing snare, that disturbs our peace; an
entangling snare, by which we are drawn into sin; and, therefore, it
must be striven and prayed against. Tribulation, distress, and
persecution cannot take away God's love to them, or theirs to him. Fear
Him, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. They must
deliver their message publicly, for all are deeply concerned in the
doctrine of the gospel. The whole counsel of God must be made known,
[Act 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md). Christ shows them why they
should be of good cheer. Their sufferings witnessed against those who
oppose his gospel. When God calls us to speak for him, we may depend on
him to teach us what to say. A believing prospect of the end of our
troubles, will be of great use to support us under them. They may be
borne to the end, because the sufferers shall be borne up under them.
The strength shall be according to the day. And it is great
encouragement to those who are doing Christ's work, that it is a work
which shall certainly be done. See how the care of Providence extends to
all creatures, even to the sparrows. This should silence all the fears
of God's people; Ye are of more value than many sparrows. And the very
hairs of your head are all numbered. This denotes the account God takes
and keeps of his people. It is our duty, not only to believe in Christ,
but to profess that faith, in suffering for him, when we are called to
it, as well as in serving him. That denial of Christ only is here meant
which is persisted in, and that confession only can have the blessed
recompence here promised, which is the real and constant language of
faith and love. Religion is worth every thing; all who believe the truth
of it, will come up to the price, and make every thing else yield to it.
Christ will lead us through sufferings, to glory with him. Those are
best prepared for the life to come, that sit most loose to this present
life. Though the kindness done to Christ's disciples be ever so small,
yet if there be occasion for it, and ability to do no more, it shall be
accepted. Christ does not say that they deserve a reward; for we cannot
merit any thing from the hand of God; but they shall receive a reward
from the free gift of God. Let us boldly confess Christ, and show love
to him in all things.
