### [Matthew Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 26:1</span></span>

Our Lord had often told of his sufferings as at a distance, now he
speaks of them as at hand. At the same time the Jewish council consulted
how they might put him to death secretly. But it pleased God to defeat
their intention. Jesus, the true paschal Lamb, was to be sacrificed for
us at that very time, and his death and resurrection rendered public.

[Matthew 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 26:6</span></span>

The pouring ointment upon the head of Christ was a token of the highest
respect. Where there is true love in the heart to Jesus Christ, nothing
will be thought too good to bestow upon him. The more Christ's servants
and their services are cavilled at, the more he manifests his
acceptance. This act of faith and love was so remarkable, that it would
be reported, as a memorial of Mary's faith and love, to all future ages,
and in all places where the gospel should be preached. This prophecy is
fulfilled.

[Matthew 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 26:14</span></span>

There were but twelve called apostles, and one of them was like a devil;
surely we must never expect any society to be quite pure on this side
heaven. The greater profession men make of religion, the greater
opportunity they have of doing mischief, if their hearts be not right
with God. Observe, that Christ's own disciple, who knew so well his
doctrine and manner of his life, and was false to him, could not charge
him with any thing criminal, though it would have served to justify his
treachery. What did Judas want? Was not he welcome wherever his Master
was? Did he not fare as Christ fared? It is not the lack, but the love
of money, that is the root of all evil. After he had made that wicked
bargain, Judas had time to repent, and to revoke it; but when lesser
acts of dishonesty have hardened the conscience men do without
hesitation that which is more shameful.

[Matthew 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 26:17</span></span>

Observe, the place for their eating the passover was pointed out by
Christ to the disciples. He knows those hidden ones who favour his
cause, and will graciously visit all who are willing to receive him. The
disciples did as Jesus had appointed. Those who would have Christ's
presence in the gospel passover, must do what he says. It well becomes
the disciples of Christ always to be jealous over themselves, especially
in trying times. We know not how strongly we may be tempted, nor how far
God may leave us to ourselves, therefore we have reason not to be
high-minded, but to fear. Heart-searching examination and fervent prayer
are especially proper before the Lord's supper, that, as Christ our
Passover is now sacrificed for us, we may keep this feast, renewing our
repentance, our faith in his blood, and surrendering ourselves to his
service.

[Matthew 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 26:26</span></span>

This ordinance of the Lord's supper is to us the passover supper, by
which we commemorate a much greater deliverance than that of Israel out
of Egypt. Take, eat; accept of Christ as he is offered to you; receive
the atonement, approve of it, submit to his grace and his government.
Meat looked upon, be the dish ever so well garnished, will not nourish;
it must be fed upon: so must the doctrine of Christ. This is my body;
that is, spiritually, it signifies and represents his body. We partake
of the sun, not by having the sun put into our hands, but the beams of
it darted down upon us; so we partake of Christ by partaking of his
grace, and the blessed fruits of the breaking of his body. The blood of
Christ is signified and represented by the wine. He gave thanks, to
teach us to look to God in every part of the ordinance. This cup he gave
to the disciples with a command, Drink ye all of it. The pardon of sin
is that great blessing which is, in the Lord's supper, conferred on all
true believers; it is the foundation of all other blessings. He takes
leave of such communion; and assures them of a happy meeting again at
last; "Until that day when I drink it new with you", may be understood
of the joys and glories of the future state, which the saints shall
partake with the Lord Jesus. That will be the kingdom of his Father; the
wine of consolation will there be always new. While we look at the
outward signs of Christ's body broken and his blood shed for the
remission of our sins, let us recollect that the feast cost him as much
as though he had literally given his flesh to be eaten and his blood for
us to drink.

[Matthew 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 26:31</span></span>

Improper self-confidence, like that of Peter, is the first step to a
fall. There is a proneness in all of us to be over-confident. But those
fall soonest and foulest, who are the most confident in themselves.
Those are least safe, who think themselves most secure. Satan is active
to lead such astray; they are most off their guard: God leaves them to
themselves, to humble them.

[Matthew 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 26:36</span></span>

He who made atonement for the sins of mankind, submitted himself in a
garden of suffering, to the will of God, from which man had revolted in
a garden of pleasure. Christ took with him into that part of the garden
where he suffered his agony, only those who had witnessed his glory in
his transfiguration. Those are best prepared to suffer with Christ, who
have by faith beheld his glory. The words used denote the most entire
dejection, amazement, anguish, and horror of mind; the state of one
surrounded with sorrows, overwhelmed with miseries, and almost swallowed
up with terror and dismay. He now began to be sorrowful, and never
ceased to be so till he said, It is finished. He prayed that, if
possible, the cup might pass from him. But he also showed his perfect
readiness to bear the load of his sufferings; he was willing to submit
to all for our redemption and salvation. According to this example of
Christ, we must drink of the bitterest cup which God puts into our
hands; though nature struggle, it must submit. It should be more our
care to get troubles sanctified, and our hearts satisfied under them,
than to get them taken away. It is well for us that our salvation is in
the hand of One who neither slumbers nor sleeps. All are tempted, but we
should be much afraid of entering into temptation. To be secured from
this, we should watch and pray, and continually look unto the Lord to
hold us up that we may be safe. Doubtless our Lord had a clear and full
view of the sufferings he was to endure, yet he spoke with the greatest
calmness till this time. Christ was a Surety, who undertook to be
answerable for our sins. Accordingly he was made sin for us, and
suffered for our sins, the Just for the unjust; and Scripture ascribes
his heaviest sufferings to the hand of God. He had full knowledge of the
infinite evil of sin, and of the immense extent of that guilt for which
he was to atone; with awful views of the Divine justice and holiness,
and the punishment deserved by the sins of men, such as no tongue can
express, or mind conceive. At the same time, Christ suffered being
tempted; probably horrible thoughts were suggested by Satan that tended
to gloom and every dreadful conclusion: these would be the more hard to
bear from his perfect holiness. And did the load of imputed guilt so
weigh down the soul of Him of whom it is said, He upholdeth all things
by the word of his power? into what misery then must those sink whose
sins are left upon their own heads! How will those escape who neglect so
great salvation?

[Matthew 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mat 26:47</span></span>

No enemies are so much to be abhorred as those professed disciples that
betray Christ with a kiss. God has no need of our services, much less of
our sins, to bring about his purposes. Though Christ was crucified
through weakness, it was voluntary weakness; he submitted to death. If
he had not been willing to suffer, they could not conquer him. It was a
great sin for those who had left all to follow Jesus; now to leave him
for they knew not what. What folly, for fear of death to flee from Him,
whom they knew and acknowledged to be the Fountain of life!

[Matthew 26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">mat 26:57</span></span>

Jesus was hurried into Jerusalem. It looks ill, and bodes worse, when
those who are willing to be Christ's disciples, are not willing to be
known to be so. Here began Peter's denying him: for to follow Christ
afar off, is to begin to go back from him. It is more our concern to
prepare for the end, whatever it may be, than curiously to ask what the
end will be. The event is God's, but the duty is ours. Now the
Scriptures were fulfilled, which said, False witnesses are risen up
against me. Christ was accused, that we might not be condemned; and if
at any time we suffer thus, let us remember we cannot expect to fare
better than our Master. When Christ was made sin for us, he was silent,
and left it to his blood to speak. Hitherto Jesus had seldom professed
expressly to be the Christ, the Son of God; the tenor of his doctrine
spoke it, and his miracles proved it; but now he would not omit to make
an open confession of it. It would have looked like declining his
sufferings. He thus confessed, as an example and encouragement to his
followers, to confess him before men, whatever hazard they ran. Disdain,
cruel mocking, and abhorrence, are the sure portion of the disciple as
they were of the Master, from such as would buffet and deride the Lord
of glory. These things were exactly foretold in the fiftieth chapter of
Isaiah. Let us confess Christ's name, and bear the reproach, and he will
confess us before his Father's throne.

[Matthew 26:69](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">mat 26:69</span></span>

Peter's sin is truly related, for the Scriptures deal faithfully. Bad
company leads to sin: those who needlessly thrust themselves into it,
may expect to be tempted and insnared, as Peter. They scarcely can come
out of such company without guilt or grief, or both. It is a great fault
to be shy of Christ; and to dissemble our knowledge of him, when we are
called to own him, is, in effect, to deny him. Peter's sin was
aggravated; but he fell into the sin by surprise, not as Judas, with
design. But conscience should be to us as the crowing of the cock, to
put us in mind of the sins we had forgotten. Peter was thus left to
fall, to abate his self-confidence, and render him more modest, humble,
compassionate, and useful to others. The event has taught believers many
things ever since, and if infidels, Pharisees, and hypocrites stumble at
it or abuse it, it is at their peril. Little do we know how we should
act in very difficult situations, if we were left to ourselves. Let him,
therefore, that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall; let us all
distrust our own hearts, and rely wholly on the Lord. Peter wept
bitterly. Sorrow for sin must not be slight, but great and deep. Peter,
who wept so bitterly for denying Christ, never denied him again, but
confessed him often in the face of danger. True repentance for any sin
will be shown by the contrary grace and duty; that is a sign of our
sorrowing not only bitterly, but sincerely.
