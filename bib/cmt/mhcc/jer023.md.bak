[Jeremiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 23:1</span></span>

Woe be to those who are set to feed God's people, but take no concern to
do them good! Here is a word of comfort to the neglected sheep. Though
only a remnant of God's flock is left, he will find them out, and they
shall be brought to their former habitations. Christ is spoken of as a
branch from David's family. He is righteous himself, and through him all
his people are made righteous. Christ shall break the usurped power of
Satan. All the spiritual seed of believing Abraham and praying Jacob
shall be protected, and shall be saved from the guilt and dominion of
sin. In the days of Christ's government in the soul, the soul dwells at
ease. He is here spoken of as "the Lord our Righteousness." He is so our
Righteousness as no creature could be. His obedience unto death is the
justifying righteousness of believers, and their title to heavenly
happiness. And their sanctification, as the source of all their personal
obedience is the effect of their union with him, and of the supply of
this Spirit. By this name every true believer shall call him, and call
upon him. We have nothing to plead but this, Christ has died, yea,
rather is risen again; and we have taken him for our Lord. This
righteousness which he has wrought out to the satisfaction of law and
justice, becomes ours; being a free gift given to us, through the Spirit
of God, who puts it upon us, clothes us with it, enables us to lay hold
upon it, and claim an interest in it. "The Lord our Righteousness" is a
sweet name to a convinced sinner; to one that has felt the guilt of sin
in his conscience; seen his need of that righteousness, and the worth of
it. This great salvation is far more glorious than all former
deliverances of his church. May our souls be gathered to Him, and be
found in him.

[Jeremiah 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 23:9</span></span>

The false prophets of Samaria had deluded the Israelites into
idolatries; yet the Lord considered the false prophets of Jerusalem as
guilty of more horrible wickedness, by which the people were made bold
in sin. These false teachers would be compelled to suffer the most
bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They made themselves believe that
there was no harm in sin, and practised accordingly; then they made
others believe so. Those who are resolved to go on in evil ways, will
justly be given up to believe strong delusions. But which of them had
received any revelation of God, or understood any thing of his word?
There was a time coming when they would reflect on their folly and
unbelief with remorse. The teaching and example of the true prophets led
men to repentance, faith, and righteousness. The false prophets led men
to rest in forms and notions, and to be quiet in their sins. Let us take
heed that we do not follow unrighteousness.

[Jeremiah 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 23:23</span></span>

Men cannot be hidden from God's all-seeing eye. Will they never see what
judgments they prepare for themselves? Let them consider what a vast
difference there is between these prophecies and those delivered by the
true prophets of the Lord. Let them not call their foolish dreams Divine
oracles. The promises of peace these prophets make are no more to be
compared to God's promises than chaff to wheat. The unhumbled heart of
man is like a rock; if not melted by the word of God as a fire, it will
be broken to pieces by it as a hammer. How can they be long safe, or at
all easy, who have a God of almighty power against them? The word of God
is no smooth, lulling, deceitful message. And by its faithfulness it may
certainly be distinguished from false doctrines.

[Jeremiah 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 23:33</span></span>

Those are miserable indeed who are forsaken and forgotten of God; and
men's jesting at God's judgments will not baffle them. God had taken
Israel to be a people near to him, but they shall now be cast out of his
presence. It is a mark of great and daring impiety for men to jest with
the words of God. Every idle and profane word will add to the sinner's
burden in the day of judgment, when everlasting shame will be his
portion.
