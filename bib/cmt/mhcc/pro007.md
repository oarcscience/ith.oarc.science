### [Proverbs Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 7:0</span></span>

([Pro 7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001).md) Invitations to learn
wisdom.

(v. 6-27) The arts of seducers, with warnings against them.

[Proverbs 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 7:1</span></span>

We must lay up God's commandments safely. Not only, Keep them, and you
shall live; but, Keep them as those that cannot live without them. Those
that blame strict and careful walking as needless and too precise,
consider not that the law is to be kept as the apple of the eye; indeed
the law in the heart is the eye of the soul. Let the word of God dwell
in us, and so be written where it will be always at hand to be read.
Thus we shall be kept from the fatal effects of our own passions, and
the snares of Satan. Let God's word confirm our dread of sin, and
resolutions against it.

[Proverbs 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 7:6</span></span>

Here is an affecting example of the danger of youthful lusts. It is a
history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to
venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set
before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even
going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a
lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same
place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's
blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from
running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to
spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of
sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous,
because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against
repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it.
Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in
the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and
tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.
