### [2 Peter Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Peter](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pe2 3:0</span></span>

([Pe2 3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001).md) The design here is to
remind of Christ's final coming to judgement.

([Pe2 3:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005).md) He will appear
unexpectedly, when the present frame of nature will be dissolved by
fire.

([Pe2 3:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011).md) From thence is inferred
the need for holiness, and stedfastness in the faith.

[2 Peter 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe2 3:1</span></span>

The purified minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may be
active and lively in the work of holiness. There will be scoffers in the
last days, under the gospel, men who make light of sin, and mock at
salvation by Jesus Christ. One very principal article of our faith
refers to what only has a promise to rest upon, and scoffers will attack
it till our Lord is come. They will not believe that he will come.
Because they see no changes, therefore they fear not God, [Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md). What he never has done, they
fancy he never can do, or never will do.

[2 Peter 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe2 3:5</span></span>

Had these scoffers considered the dreadful vengeance with which God
swept away a whole world of ungodly men at once, surely they would not
have scoffed at his threatening an equally terrible judgment. The
heavens and the earth which now are, by the same word, it is declared,
will be destroyed by fire. This is as sure to come, as the truth and the
power of God can make it. Christians are here taught and established in
the truth of the coming of the Lord. Though, in the account of men,
there is a vast difference between one day and a thousand years, yet, in
the account of God, there is no difference. All things past, present,
and future, are ever before him: the delay of a thousand years cannot be
so much to him, as putting off any thing for a day or for an hour is to
us. If men have no knowledge or belief of the eternal God, they will be
very apt to think him such as themselves. How hard is it to form any
thoughts of eternity! What men count slackness, is long-suffering, and
that to us-ward; it is giving more time to his own people, to advance in
knowledge and holiness, and in the exercise of faith and patience, to
abound in good works, doing and suffering what they are called to, that
they may bring glory to God. Settle therefore in your hearts that you
shall certainly be called to give an account of all things done in the
body, whether good or evil. And let a humble and diligent walking before
God, and a frequent judging of yourselves, show a firm belief of the
future judgment, though many live as if they were never to give any
account at all. This day will come, when men are secure, and have no
expectation of the day of the Lord. The stately palaces, and all the
desirable things wherein wordly-minded men seek and place their
happiness, shall be burned up; all sorts of creatures God has made, and
all the works of men, must pass through the fire, which shall be a
consuming fire to all that sin has brought into the world, though a
refining fire to the works of God's hand. What will become of us, if we
set our affections on this earth, and make it our portion, seeing all
these things shall be burned up? Therefore make sure of happiness beyond
this visible world.

[2 Peter 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe2 3:11</span></span>

From the doctrine of Christ's second coming, we are exhorted to purity
and godliness. This is the effect of real knowledge. Very exact and
universal holiness is enjoined, not resting in any low measure or
degree. True Christians look for new heavens and a new earth; freed from
the vanity to which things present are subject, and the sin they are
polluted with. Those only who are clothed with the righteousness of
Christ, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, shall be admitted to dwell in
this holy place. He is faithful, who has promised. Those, whose sins are
pardoned, and their peace made with God, are the only safe and happy
people; therefore follow after peace, and that with all men; follow
after holiness as well as peace. Never expect to be found at that day of
God in peace, if you are lazy and idle in this your day, in which we
must finish the work given us to do. Only the diligent Christian will be
the happy Christian in the day of the Lord. Our Lord will suddenly come
to us, or shortly call us to him; and shall he find us idle? Learn to
make a right use of the patience of our Lord, who as yet delays his
coming. Proud, carnal, and corrupt men, seek to wrest some things into a
seeming agreement with their wicked doctrines. But this is no reason why
St. Paul's epistles, or any other part of the Scriptures, should be laid
aside; for men, left to themselves, pervert every gift of God. Then let
us seek to have our minds prepared for receiving things hard to be
understood, by putting in practice things which are more easy to be
understood. But there must be self-denial and suspicion of ourselves,
and submission to the authority of Christ Jesus, before we can heartily
receive all the truths of the gospel, therefore we are in great danger
of rejecting the truth. And whatever opinions and thoughts of men are
not according to the law of God, and warranted by it, the believer
disclaims and abhors. Those who are led away by error, fall from their
own stedfastness. And that we may avoid being led away, we must seek to
grow in all grace, in faith, and virtue, and knowledge. Labour to know
Christ more clearly, and more fully; to know him so as to be more like
him, and to love him better. This is the knowledge of Christ, which the
apostle Paul reached after, and desired to attain; and those who taste
this effect of the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, will,
upon receiving such grace from him, give thanks and praise him, and join
in ascribing glory to him now, in the full assurance of doing the same
hereafter, for ever.
