There are some ceremonial precepts in this chapter, but most of these
precepts are binding on us, for they are explanations of the ten
commandments. It is required that Israel be a holy people, because the
God of Israel is a holy God, [Lev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002.md). To teach real separation from
the world and the flesh, and entire devotedness to God. This is now the
law of Christ; may the Lord bring every thought within us into obedience
to it! Children are to be obedient to their parents, [Lev
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#003.md). The fear here required includes
inward reverence and esteem, outward respect and obedience, care to
please them and to make them easy. God only is to be worshipped, [Lev
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#004.md). Turn not from the true God to
false ones, from the God who will make you holy and happy, to those that
will deceive you, and make you for ever miserable. Turn not your eyes to
them, much less your heart. They should leave the gleanings of their
harvest and vintage for the poor, [Lev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009.md). Works of piety must be always
attended with works of charity, according to our ability. We must not be
covetous, griping, and greedy of every thing we can lay claim to, nor
insist upon our right in all things. We are to be honest and true in all
our dealings, [Lev 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#011.md). Whatever we
have in the world, we must see that we get it honestly, for we cannot be
truly rich, or long rich, with that which is not so. Reverence to the
sacred name of God must be shown, [Lev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012.md). We must not detain what belongs
to another, particularly the wages of the hireling, [Lev
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#013.md). We must be tender of the credit
and safety of those that cannot help themselves, [Lev
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014.md). Do no hurt to any, because they
are unwilling or unable to avenge themselves. We ought to take heed of
doing any thing which may occasion our weak brother to fall. The fear of
God should keep us from doing wrong things, though they will not expose
us to men's anger. Judges, and all in authority, are commanded to give
judgment without partiality, [Lev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015.md). To be a tale-bearer, and to sow
discord among neighbours, is as bad an office as a man can put himself
into. We are to rebuke our neighbour in love, [Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017.md). Rather rebuke him than hate
him, for an injury done to thyself. We incur guilt by not reproving; it
is hating our brother. We should say, I will do him the kindness to tell
him of his faults. We are to put off all malice, and to put on brotherly
love, [Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md). We often wrong
ourselves, but we soon forgive ourselves those wrongs, and they do not
at all lessen our love to ourselves; in like manner we should love our
neighbour. We must in many cases deny ourselves for the good of our
neighbour. [Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031.md) : For Christians
to have their fortunes told, to use spells and charms, or the like, is a
sad affront to God. They must be grossly ignorant who ask, "What harm is
there in these things?" Here is a charge to young people to show respect
to the aged, [Lev 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032.md). Religion
teaches good manners, and obliges us to honour those to whom honour is
due. A charge was given to the Israelites to be very tender of
strangers, [Lev 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#033.md). Strangers, and
the widows and fatherless, are God's particular care. It is at our
peril, if we do them any wrong. Strangers shall be welcome to God's
grace; we should do what we can to recommend religion to them. Justice
in weights and measures is commanded, [Lev
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035.md). We must make conscience of
obeying God's precepts. We are not to pick and choose our duty, but must
aim at standing complete in all the will of God. And the nearer our
lives and tempers are to the precepts of God's law, the happier shall we
be, and the happier shall we make all around us, and the better shall we
adorn the gospel.
