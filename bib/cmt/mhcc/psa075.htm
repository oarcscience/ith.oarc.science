<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001">Psa 75:1-5</A>) The psalmist declares his resolution of executing judgment.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006">Psa 75:6-10</A>) He rebukes the wicked, and concludes with resolutions to praise God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001">Psalms 75:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 75:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We often pray for mercy, when in pursuit of it; and shall we only once or twice give thanks, when we obtain it? God shows that he is nigh to us in what we call upon him for. Public trusts are to be managed uprightly. This may well be applied to Christ and his government. Man's sin threatened to destroy the whole creation; but Christ saved the world from utter ruin. He who is made of God to us wisdom, bids us be wise. To the proud, daring sinners he says, Boast not of your power, persist not in contempt. All the present hopes and future happiness of the human race spring from the Son of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006">Psalms 75:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 75:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>No second causes will raise men to preferment without the First Cause. It comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. He mentions not the north; the same word that signifies the north, signifies the secret place; and from the secret of God's counsel it does come. From God alone all must receive their doom. There are mixtures of mercy and grace in the cup of affliction, when it is put into the hands of God's people; mixtures of the curse, when it is put into the hands of the wicked. God's people have their share in common calamities, but the dregs of the cup are for the wicked. The exaltation of the Son of David will be the subject of the saints' everlasting praises. Then let sinners submit to the King of righteousness, and let believers rejoice in and obey him.
