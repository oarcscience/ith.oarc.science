Jeroboam's house.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001.md)

"At that time," when Jeroboam did evil, his child sickened. When
sickness comes into our families, we should inquire whether there may
not be some particular sin harboured in our houses, which the affliction
is sent to convince us of, and reclaim us from. It had been more pious
if he had desired to know wherefore God contended with him; had begged
the prophet's prayers, and cast away his idols from him; but most people
would rather be told their fortune, than their faults or their duty. He
sent to Ahijah, because he had told him he should be king. Those who by
sin disqualify themselves for comfort, yet expect that their ministers,
because they are good men, should speak peace and comfort to them,
greatly wrong themselves and their ministers. He sent his wife in
disguise, that the prophet might only answer her question concerning her
son. Thus some people would limit their ministers to smooth things, and
care not for having the whole counsel of God declared to them, lest it
should prophesy no good concerning them, but evil. But she shall know,
at the first word, what she has to trust to. Tidings of a portion with
hypocrites will be heavy tidings. God will judge men according to what
they are, not by what they seem to be.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 14:7</span></span>

Whether we keep an account of God's mercies to us or not, he does; and
he will set them in order before us, if we are ungrateful, to our
greater confusion. Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then
sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection
for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To
show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the
worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of
Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world,
to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a
family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never
can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family
and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells
the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for
conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the
house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but
one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined
by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the
guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who
must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been
drawn into, and kept in, by them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 14:21</span></span>

Here is no good said of Rehoboam, and much said to the disadvantage of
his subjects. The abounding of the worst crimes, of the worst of the
heathen, in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen for his temple and
his worship, shows that nothing can mend the hearts of fallen men but
the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. On this alone may we depend;
for this let us daily pray, in behalf of ourselves and all around us.
The splendour of their temple, the pomp of their priesthood, and all the
advantages with which their religion was attended, could not prevail to
keep them close to it; nothing less than the pouring out the Spirit will
keep God's Israel in their allegiance to him. Sin exposes, makes poor,
and weakens any people. Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took away the
treasures. Sin makes the gold become dim, changes the most fine gold,
and turns it into brass.
