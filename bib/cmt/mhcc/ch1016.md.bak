### [1 Chronicles Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 16:0</span></span>

([Ch1 16:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001).md) The solemnity with which
the ark was fixed.

(v. 7-36) David's psalm of praise.

([Ch1 16:37-43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037).md) Setting in order the
worship of God.

[1 Chronicles 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 16:1</span></span>

Though God's word and ordinances may be clouded and eclipsed for a time,
they shall shine out of obscurity. This was but a tent, a humble
dwelling, yet this was the tabernacle which David, in his psalms, often
speaks of with so much affection. David showed himself generous to his
subjects, as he had found God gracious to him. Those whose hearts are
enlarged with holy joy, should show it by being open-handed.

[1 Chronicles 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 16:7</span></span>

Let God be glorified in our praises. Let others be edified and taught,
that strangers to him may be led to adore him. Let us ourselves triumph
and trust in God. Those that give glory to God's name are allowed to
glory in it. Let the everlasting covenant be the great matter of our joy
his people of old, be remembered by us with thankfulness to him. Show
forth from day to day his salvation, his promised salvation by Christ.
We have reason to celebrate that from day to day; for we daily receive
the benefit, and it is a subject that can never be exhausted. In the
midst of praises, we must not forget to pray for the servants of God in
distress.

[1 Chronicles 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">ch1 16:37</span></span>

The worship of God ought to be the work of every day. David put it into
order. At Jerusalem, where the ark was, Asaph and his brethren were to
minister before the ark continually, with songs of praise. No sacrifices
were offered there, nor incense burnt, because the altars were not
there; but David's prayers were directed as incense, and the lifting up
of his hands as the evening sacrifice. So early did spiritual worship
take place of ceremonial. Yet the ceremonial worship, being of Divine
institution, must by no means be omitted; therefore at Gibeon, at the
altars, the priests attended; for their work was to sacrifice and burn
incense; and that they did continually, morning and evening, according
to the law of Moses. As the ceremonies were types of the mediation of
Christ, the observance of them was of great consequence. The attendance
of his appointed ministers is right in itself, and encourages the
people.
