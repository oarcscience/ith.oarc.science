### [Psalms Chapter 102](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 102:0</span></span>

([Psa 102:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001).md) A sorrowful complaint
of great afflictions.

([Psa 102:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012).md) Encouragement by
expecting the performances of God's promises to his church.

([Psa 102:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023).md) The unchangeableness
of God.

[Psalms 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 102:1</span></span>

The whole word of God is of use to direct us in prayer; but here, is
often elsewhere, the Holy Ghost has put words into our mouths. Here is a
prayer put into the hands of the afflicted; let them present it to God.
Even good men may be almost overwhelmed with afflictions. It is our duty
and interest to pray; and it is comfort to an afflicted spirit to
unburden itself, by a humble representation of its griefs. We must say,
Blessed be the name of the Lord, who both gives and takes away. The
psalmist looked upon himself as a dying man; My days are like a shadow.

[Psalms 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 102:12</span></span>

We are dying creatures, but God is an everlasting God, the protector of
his church; we may be confident that it will not be neglected. When we
consider our own vileness, our darkness and deadness, and the manifold
defects in our prayers, we have cause to fear that they will not be
received in heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for we have
an Advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under the law.
Redemption is the subject of praise in the Christian church; and that
great work is described by the temporal deliverance and restoration of
Israel. Look down upon us, Lord Jesus; and bring us into the glorious
liberty of thy children, that we may bless and praise thy name.

[Psalms 102:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 102:23</span></span>

Bodily distempers soon weaken our strength, then what can we expect but
that our months should be cut off in the midst; and what should we do
but provide accordingly? We must own God's hand in it; and must
reconcile this to his love, for often those that have used their
strength well, have it weakened; and those who, as we think, can very
ill be spared, have their days shortened. It is very comfortable, in
reference to all the changes and dangers of the church, to remember that
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. And in
reference to the death of our bodies, and the removal of friends, to
remember that God is an everlasting God. Do not let us overlook the
assurance this psalm contains of a happy end to all the believer's
trials. Though all things are changing, dying, perishing, like a vesture
folding up and hastening to decay, yet Jesus lives, and thus all is
secure, for he hath said, Because I live ye shall live also.
