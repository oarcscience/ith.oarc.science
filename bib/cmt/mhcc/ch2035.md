### [2 Chronicles Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 35:0</span></span>

(v. 1-19) The passover kept by Josiah.

([Ch2 35:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020).md) Josiah slain in
battle.

[2 Chronicles 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 35:1</span></span>

The destruction Josiah made of idolatry, was more largely related in the
book of Kings. His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's
supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish
festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of
growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy,
and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging
to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 35:20</span></span>

The Scripture does not condemn Josiah's conduct in opposing Pharaoh. Yet
Josiah seems to deserve blame for not inquiring of the Lord after he was
warned; his death might be a rebuke for his rashness, but it was a
judgment on a hypocritical and wicked people. He that lives a life of
repentance, faith, and obedience, cannot be affected by the sudden
manner in which he is removed. The people lamented him. Many mourn over
sufferings, who will not forsake the sins that caused God to send them.
Yet this alone can turn away judgments. If we blame Josiah's conduct, we
should be watchful, lest we be cut down in a way dishonourable to our
profession.
