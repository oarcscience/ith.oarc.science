### [Ezekiel Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 29:0</span></span>

(v. 1-16) The desolation of Egypt.

([Eze 29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017).md) Also a promise of
mercy to Israel.

[Ezekiel 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 29:1</span></span>

Worldly, carnal minds pride themselves in their property, forgetting
that whatever we have, we received it from God, and should use it for
God. Why, then, do we boast? Self is the great idol which all the world
worships, in contempt of God and his sovereignty. God can force men out
of that in which they are most secure and easy. Such a one, and all that
cleave to him, shall perish together. Thus end men's pride, presumption,
and carnal security. The Lord is against those who do harm to his
people, and still more against those who lead them into sin. Egypt shall
be a kingdom again, but it shall be the basest of the kingdoms; it shall
have little wealth and power. History shows the complete fulfilment of
this prophecy. God, not only in justice, but in wisdom and goodness to
us, breaks the creature-stays on which we lean, that they may be no more
our confidence.

[Ezekiel 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 29:17</span></span>

The besiegers of Tyre obtained little plunder. But when God employs
ambitious or covetous men, he will recompense them according to the
desires of their hearts; for every man shall have his reward. God had
mercy in store for the house of Israel soon after. The history of
nations best explains ancient prophecies. All events fulfil the
Scriptures. Thus, in the deepest scenes of adversity, the Lord sows the
seed of our future prosperity. Happy are those who desire his favour,
grace, and image; they will delight in his service, and not covet any
earthly recompence; and the blessings they have chosen shall be sure to
them for ever.
