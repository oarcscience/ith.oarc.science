### [Ezekiel Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 33:0</span></span>

([Eze 33:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#001)) Ezekiel's duty as a
watchman.

([Eze 33:10-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#010)) He is to vindicate the
Divine government.

([Eze 33:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021)) The desolation of
Judea.

([Eze 33:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030)) Judgments on the
mockers of the prophets.

[Ezekiel 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 33:1</span></span>

The prophet is a watchman to the house of Israel. His business is to
warn sinners of their misery and danger. He must warn the wicked to turn
from their way, that they may live. If souls perish through his neglect
of duty, he brings guilt upon himself. See what those have to answer
for, who make excuses for sin, flatter sinners, and encourage them to
believe they shall have peace, though they go on. How much wiser are men
in their temporal than in their spiritual concerns! They set watchmen to
guard their houses, and sentinels to warn of the enemies' approach, but
where the everlasting happiness or misery of the soul is at stake, they
are offended if ministers obey their Master's command, and give a
faithful warning; they would rather perish, listening to smooth things.

[Ezekiel 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 33:10</span></span>

Those who despaired of finding mercy with God, are answered with a
solemn declaration of God's readiness to show mercy. The ruin of the
city and state was determined, but that did not relate to the final
state of persons. God says to the righteous, that he shall surely live.
But many who have made profession, have been ruined by proud confidence
in themselves. Man trusts to his own righteousness, and presuming on his
own sufficiency, he is brought to commit iniquity. If those who have
lived a wicked life repent and forsake their wicked ways, they shall be
saved. Many such amazing and blessed changes have been wrought by the
power of Divine grace. When there is a settled separation between a man
and sin, there shall no longer be a separation between him and God.

[Ezekiel 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 33:21</span></span>

Those are unteachable indeed, who do not learn their dependence upon
God, when all creature-comforts fail. Many claim an interest in the
peculiar blessings to true believers, while their conduct proves them
enemies of God. They call this groundless presumption strong faith, when
God's testimony declares them entitled to his threatenings, and nothing
else.

[Ezekiel 33:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 33:30</span></span>

Unworthy and corrupt motives often lead men to the places where the word
of God is faithfully preached. Many come to find somewhat to oppose: far
more come of curiosity or mere habit. Men may have their hearts changed.
But whether men hear or forbear, they will know by the event that a
servant of God has been among them. All who will not know the worth of
mercies by the improvement of them, will justly be made to know their
worth by the want of them.
