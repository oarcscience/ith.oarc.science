### [Genesis Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 42:0</span></span>

([Gen 42:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001).md) Jacob sends ten sons to
buy corn.

([Gen 42:7-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#007).md) Joseph's treatment of
his brethren.

([Gen 42:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021).md) Their remorse, Simeon
detained.

([Gen 42:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#025).md) The rest return with
corn.

([Gen 42:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#029).md) Jacob refuses to send
Benjamin to Egypt.

[Genesis 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 42:1</span></span>

Jacob saw the corn his neighbours had bought in Egypt, and brought home.
It is a spur to exertion to see others supplied. Shall others get food
for their souls, and shall we starve while it is to be had? Having
discovered where help is to be had, we should apply for it without
delay, without shrinking from labour, or grudging expense, especially as
regards our never-dying souls. There is provision in Christ; but we must
come to him, and seek it from him.

[Genesis 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 42:7</span></span>

Joseph was hard upon his brethren, not from a spirit of revenge, but to
bring them to repentance. Not seeing his brother Benjamin, he suspected
that they had made away with him, and he gave them occasion to speak of
their father and brother. God, in his providence, sometimes seems harsh
with those he loves, and speaks roughly to those for whom yet he has
great mercy in store. Joseph settled at last, that one of them should be
left, and the rest go home and fetch Benjamin. It was a very encouraging
word he said to them, "I fear God;" as if he had said, You may be
assured I will do you no wrong; I dare not, for I know there is one
higher than I. With those that fear God, we may expect fair dealing.

[Genesis 42:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 42:21</span></span>

The office of conscience is to bring to mind things long since said and
done. When the guilt of this sin of Joseph's brethren was fresh, they
made light of it, and sat down to eat bread; but now, long afterward,
their consciences accused them of it. See the good of afflictions; they
often prove the happy means of awakening conscience, and bringing sin to
our remembrance. Also, the evil of guilt as to our brethren. Conscience
now reproached them for it. Whenever we think we have wrong done us, we
ought to remember the wrong we have done to others. Reuben alone
remembered with comfort, that he had done what he could to prevent the
mischief. When we share with others in their sufferings, it will be a
comfort if we have the testimony of our consciences for us, that we did
not share in their evil deeds, but in our places witnessed against them.
Joseph retired to weep. Though his reason directed that he should still
carry himself as a stranger, because they were not as yet humbled
enough, yet natural affection could not but work.

[Genesis 42:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 42:25</span></span>

The brethren came for corn, and corn they had: not only so, but every
man had his money given back. Thus Christ, like Joseph, gives out
supplies without money and without price. The poorest are invited to
buy. But guilty consciences are apt to take good providences in a bad
sense; to put wrong meanings even upon things that make for them.

[Genesis 42:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 42:29</span></span>

Here is the report Jacob's sons made to their father. It troubled the
good man. Even the bundles of money Joseph returned, in kindness, to his
father, frightened him. He laid the fault upon his sons; knowing them,
he feared they had provoked the Egyptians, and wrongfully brought home
their money. Jacob plainly distrusted his sons, remembering that he
never saw Joseph since he had been with them. It is bad with a family,
when children behave so ill that their parents know not how to trust
them. Jacob gives up Joseph for gone, and Simeon and Benjamin as in
danger; and concludes, All these things are against me. It proved
otherwise, that all these things were for him, were working together for
his good, and the good of his family. We often think that to be against
us, which is really for us. We are afflicted in body, estate, name, and
in our relations; and think all these things are against us, whereas
they are really working for us a weight of glory. Thus does the Lord
Jesus conceal himself and his favour, thus he rebukes and chastens those
for whom he has purposes of love. By sharp corrections and humbling
convictions he will break the stoutness and mar the pride of the heart,
and bring to true repentance. Yet before sinners fully know him, or
taste that he is gracious, he consults their good, and sustains their
souls, to wait for him. May we do thus, never yielding to
discouragement, determining to seek no other refuge, and humbling
ourselves more and more under his mighty hand. In due time he will
answer our petitions, and do for us more than we can expect.
