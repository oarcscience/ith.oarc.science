### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 23:0</span></span>

([Kg2 23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001)) Josiah reads the law,
and renews the covenant.

([Kg2 23:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004)) He destroys idolatry.

([Kg2 23:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015)) The reformation
extended to Israel, A passover kept.

([Kg2 23:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#025)) Josiah slain by
Pharaoh-nechoh.

([Kg2 23:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031)) Wicked reigns of
Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 23:1</span></span>

Josiah had received a message from God, that there was no preventing the
ruin of Jerusalem, but that he should only deliver his own soul; yet he
does his duty, and leaves the event to God. He engaged the people in the
most solemn manner to abolish idolatry, and to serve God in
righteousness and true holiness. Though most were formal or hypocritical
herein, yet much outward wickedness would be prevented, and they were
accountable to God for their own conduct.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 23:4</span></span>

What abundance of wickedness in Judah and Jerusalem! One would not have
believed it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel,
where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-place
was, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteen
years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up
religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for
idolatry, the depth and extent were very great. Both common history, and
the records of God's word, teach, that all the real godliness or
goodness ever found on earth, is derived from the new-creating Spirit of
Jesus Christ.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 23:15</span></span>

Josiah's zeal extended to the cities of Israel within his reach. He
carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from
Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had
cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied
themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a
passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected
ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in
destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. We
have reason to think that during the remainder of Josiah's reign,
religion flourished.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 23:25</span></span>

Upon reading these verses, we must say, Lord, though thy righteousness
be as the great mountains, evident, plainly to be seen, and past
dispute; yet thy judgments are a great deep, unfathomable, and past
finding out. The reforming king is cut off in the midst of his
usefulness, in mercy to him, that he might not see the evil coming upon
his kingdom: but in wrath to his people, for his death was an inlet to
their desolations.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 23:31</span></span>

After Josiah was laid in his grave, one trouble came on another, till,
in twenty-two years, Jerusalem was destroyed. The wicked perished in
great numbers, the remnant were purified, and Josiah's reformation had
raised up some to join the few who were the precious seed of their
future church and nation. A little time, and slender abilities, often
suffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years,
been labouring to effect. But, blessed be God, the good work which he
begins by his regenerating Spirit, cannot be done away, but withstands
all changes and temptations.
