<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001">Sa1 26:1-12</A>) Saul goes after David, who again spares Saul's life.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#013">Sa1 26:13-20</A>) David exhorts Saul.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021">Sa1 26:21-25</A>) Saul acknowledges his sin.

<p>How soon do unholy hearts lose the good impressions convictions have made upon them! How helpless were Saul and all his men! All as though disarmed and chained, yet nothing is done to them; they are only asleep. How easily can God weaken the strongest, befool the wisest, and baffle the most watchful! David still resolved to wait till God thought fit to avenge him on Saul. He will by no means force his way to the promised crown by any wrong methods. The temptation was very strong; but if he yielded, he would sin against God, therefore he resisted the temptation, and trusted God with the event. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#013">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">sa1 26:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>David reasoned seriously and affectionately with Saul. Those who forbid our attendance on God's ordinances, do what they can to estrange us from God, and to make us heathens. We are to reckon that which exposes us to sin the greatest injury that can be done us. If the Lord stirred thee up against me, either in displeasure to me, taking this way to punish me for my sins against him, or in displeasure to thee, if it be the effect of that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee; let Him accept an offering from us both. Let us join in seeking peace, and to be reconciled with God by sacrifice. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">sa1 26:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Saul repeated his good words and good wishes. But he showed no evidence of true repentance towards God. David and Saul parted to meet no more. No reconciliation among men is firm, which is not founded in an cemented by peace with God through Jesus Christ. In sinning against God, men play the fool, and err exceedingly. Many obtain a passing view of these truths, who hate and close their eyes against the light. Fair professions do not entitle those to confidence who have long sinned against the light, yet the confessions of obstinate sinners may satisfy us that we are in the right way, and encourage us to persevere, expecting our recompence from the Lord alone.
