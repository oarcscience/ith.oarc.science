### [Exodus Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 30:0</span></span>

([Exo 30:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001)) The altar of incense.

([Exo 30:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011)) The ransom of souls.

([Exo 30:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017)) The brazen laver.

(v. 22-38) The holy anointing oil, The perfume.

[Exodus 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 30:1</span></span>

The altar of incense represented the Son of God in his human nature, and
the incense burned thereon typified his pleading for his people. The
continual intercession of Christ was represented by the daily burning of
incense thereon, morning and evening. Once every year the blood of the
atonement was to be applied to it, denoting that the intercession of
Christ has all its virtue from his sufferings on earth, and that we need
no other sacrifice or intercessor but Christ alone.

[Exodus 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 30:11</span></span>

The tribute was half a shekel, about fifteen pence of our money. The
rich were not to give more, nor the poor less; the souls of the rich and
poor are alike precious, and God is no respecter of persons, [Act
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034); [Job
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019). In other offerings men were to
give according to their wordly ability; but this, which was the ransom
of the soul, must be alike for all. The souls of all are of equal value,
equally in danger, and all equally need a ransom. The money raised was
to be used in the service of the tabernacle. Those who have the benefit,
must not grudge the necessary charges of God's public worship. Money
cannot make atonement for the soul, but it may be used for the honour of
Him who has made the atonement, and for the maintenance of the gospel by
which the atonement is applied.

[Exodus 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 30:17</span></span>

A large vessel of brass, holding water, was to be set near the door of
the tabernacle. Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and feet at
this laver, every time they went in to minister. This was to teach them
purity in all their services, and to dread the pollution of sin. They
must not only wash and be made clean, when first made priests, but must
wash and be kept clean, whenever they went to minister. It teaches us
daily to attend upon God, daily to renew our repentance for sin, and our
looking to the blood of Christ for remission; for in many things we
daily offend.

[Exodus 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 30:22</span></span>

Directions are here given for making the holy anointing oil, and the
incense to be used in the service of the tabernacle. To show the
excellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle,
which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is as
ointment poured forth, [Sol 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003), and
the good name of Christians is like precious ointment, [Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001). The incense burned upon the
golden altar was prepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to
be beaten very small; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer,
when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The
like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the
people's minds reverence for his own services, and teach us not to
profane or abuse any thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a
great affront to God to jest with sacred things, and to make sport with
his word and ordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use
professions of the gospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.
