### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 3:0</span></span>

([Kg1 3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001)) Solomon's marriage.

([Kg1 3:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005)) His vision, His prayer
for wisdom.

([Kg1 3:16-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016)) The judgment of
Solomon.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 3:1</span></span>

He that loved the Lord, should, for his sake, have fixed his love upon
one of the Lord's people. Solomon was a wise man, a rich man, a great
man; yet the brightest praise of him, is that which is the character of
all the saints, even the poorest, "He loved the Lord." Where God sows
plentifully, he expects to reap accordingly; and those that truly love
God and his worship, will not grudge the expenses of their religion. We
must never think that wasted which is laid out in the service of God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 3:5</span></span>

Solomon's dream was not a common one. While his bodily powers were
locked up in sleep, the powers of his soul were strengthened; he was
enabled to receive the Divine vision, and to make a suitable choice.
God, in like manner, puts us in the ready way to be happy, by assuring
us we shall have what we need, and pray for. Solomon's making such a
choice when asleep, and the powers of reason least active, showed it
came from the grace of God. Having a humble sense of his own wants and
weakness, he pleads, Lord, I am but a little child. The more wise and
considerate men are, the better acquainted they are with their own
weakness, and the more jealous of themselves. Solomon begs of God to
give him wisdom. We must pray for it, [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005), that it may help us in our
particular calling, and the various occasions we have. Those are
accepted of God, who prefer spiritual blessings to earthly good. It was
a prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked. God gave him
wisdom, such as no other prince was ever blessed with; and also gave him
riches and honour. If we make sure of wisdom and grace, these will bring
outward prosperity with them, or sweeten the want of it. The way to get
spiritual blessings, is to wrestle with God in prayer for them. The way
to get earthly blessings, is to refer ourselves to God concerning them.
Solomon has wisdom given him, because he did ask it, and wealth, because
he did not.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 3:16</span></span>

An instance of Solomon's wisdom is given. Notice the difficulty of the
case. To find out the true mother, he could not try which the child
loved best, and therefore tried which loved the child best: the mother's
sincerity will be tried, when the child is in danger. Let parents show
their love to their children, especially by taking care of their souls,
and snatching them as brands out of the burning. By this and other
instances of the wisdom with which God endued him, Solomon had great
reputation among his people. This was better to him than weapons of war;
for this he was both feared and loved.
