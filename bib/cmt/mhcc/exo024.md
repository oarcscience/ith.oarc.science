### [Exodus Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 24:0</span></span>

([Exo 24:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001)) Moses is called up into
the mountain, The people promise obedience.

([Exo 24:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009)) The glory of the Lord
appears.

([Exo 24:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012)) Moses goes up into the
mountain.

[Exodus 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 24:1</span></span>

A solemn covenant was made between God and Israel. Very solemn it was,
typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, through
Christ. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, he
governed them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God's
covenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for our
good, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fully
they are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them.
The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, and
on the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, nor
religious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, except
through the shedding and sprinkling of blood. Also the blessings granted
unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with them in
kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renders
willing and acceptable obedience.

[Exodus 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 24:9</span></span>

The elders saw the God of Israel; they had some glimpse of his glory,
though whatever they saw, it was something of which no image or picture
could be made, yet enough to satisfy them that God was with them of a
truth. Nothing is described but what was under his feet. The sapphires
are the pavement under his feet; let us put all the wealth of this world
under our feet, and not in our hearts. Thus the believer sees in the
face of Jesus Christ, far clearer discoveries of the glorious justice
and holiness of God, than ever he saw under terrifying convictions; and
through the Saviour, holds communion with a holy God.

[Exodus 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 24:12</span></span>

A cloud covered the mount six days; a token of God's special presence
there. Moses was sure that he who called him up would protect him. Even
those glorious attributes of God which are most terrible to the wicked,
the saints with humble reverence rejoice in. And through faith in the
atoning Sacrifice, we hope for greater honour than Moses ever enjoyed on
earth. Now we see through a glass darkly, but when he shall appear, then
face to face. This vision of God will continue with equal, if not
increasing brightness of joy; not for a few days only, but through
eternity.
