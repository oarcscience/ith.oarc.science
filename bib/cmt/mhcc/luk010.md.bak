### [Luke Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 10:0</span></span>

(v. 1-16) Seventy disciples sent forth.

([Luk 10:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017).md) The blessedness of
Christ's disciples.

([Luk 10:25-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025).md) The good Samaritan.

([Luk 10:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#038).md) Jesus at the house of

[Luke 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 10:1</span></span>

Christ sent the seventy disciples, two and two, that they might
strengthen and encourage one another. The ministry of the gospel calls
men to receive Christ as a Prince and a Saviour; and he will surely come
in the power of his Spirit to all places whither he sends his faithful
servants. But the doom of those who receive the grace of God in vain,
will be very fearful Those who despise the faithful ministers of Christ,
who think meanly of them, and look scornfully upon them, will be
reckoned as despisers of God and Christ.

[Luke 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 10:17</span></span>

All our victories over Satan, are obtained by power derived from Jesus
Christ, and he must have all the praise. But let us beware of spiritual
pride, which has been the destruction of many. Our Lord rejoiced at the
prospect of the salvation of many souls. It was fit that particular
notice should be taken of that hour of joy; there were few such, for He
was a man of sorrows: in that hour in which he saw Satan fall, and heard
of the good success of his ministers, in that hour he rejoiced. He has
ever resisted the proud, and given grace to the humble. The more simply
dependent we are on the teaching, help, and blessing of the Son of God,
the more we shall know both of the Father and of the Son; the more
blessed we shall be in seeing the glory, and hearing the words of the
Divine Saviour; and the more useful we shall be made in promoting his
cause.

[Luke 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 10:25</span></span>

If we speak of eternal life, and the way to it, in a careless manner, we
take the name of God in vain. No one will ever love God and his
neighbour with any measure of pure, spiritual love, who is not made a
partaker of converting grace. But the proud heart of man strives hard
against these convictions. Christ gave an instance of a poor Jew in
distress, relieved by a good Samaritan. This poor man fell among
thieves, who left him about to die of his wounds. He was slighted by
those who should have been his friends, and was cared for by a stranger,
a Samaritan, of the nation which the Jews most despised and detested,
and would have no dealings with. It is lamentable to observe how
selfishness governs all ranks; how many excuses men will make to avoid
trouble or expense in relieving others. But the true Christian has the
law of love written in his heart. The Spirit of Christ dwells in him;
Christ's image is renewed in his soul. The parable is a beautiful
explanation of the law of loving our neighbour as ourselves, without
regard to nation, party, or any other distinction. It also sets forth
the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward sinful, miserable men.
We were like this poor, distressed traveller. Satan, our enemy, has
robbed us, and wounded us: such is the mischief sin has done us. The
blessed Jesus had compassion on us. The believer considers that Jesus
loved him, and gave his life for him, when an enemy and a rebel; and
having shown him mercy, he bids him go and do likewise. It is the duty
of us all, in our places, and according to our ability, to succour,
help, and relieve all that are in distress and necessity.

[Luke 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 10:38</span></span>

A good sermon is not the worse for being preached in a house; and the
visits of our friends should be so managed, as to make them turn to the
good of their souls. Sitting at Christ's feet, signifies readiness to
receive his word, and submission to the guidance of it. Martha was
providing for the entertainment of Christ, and those that came with him.
Here were respect to our Lord Jesus and right care of her household
affairs. But there was something to be blamed. She was for much serving;
plenty, variety, and exactness. Worldly business is a snare to us, when
it hinders us from serving God, and getting good to our souls. What
needless time is wasted, and expense often laid out, even in
entertaining professors of the gospel! Though Martha was on this
occasion faulty, yet she was a true believer, and in her general conduct
did not neglect the one thing needful. The favour of God is needful to
our happiness; the salvation of Christ is needful to our safety. Where
this is attended to, all other things will be rightly pursued. Christ
declared, Mary hath chosen the good part. For one thing is needful, this
one thing that she has done, to give up herself to the guidance of
Christ. The things of this life will be taken away from us, at the
furthest, when we shall be taken away from them; but nothing shall
separate from the love of Christ, and a part in that love. Men and
devils cannot take it away from us, and God and Christ will not. Let us
mind the one thing needful more diligently.
