[1 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th1 0:0</span></span>

This epistle is generally considered to have been the first of those
written by St. Paul. The occasion seems to have been the good report of
the stedfastness of the church at Thessalonica in the faith of the
gospel. It is full of affection and confidence, and more consolatory and
practical, and less doctrinal, than some of the other epistles.
