### [Leviticus Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 12:0</span></span>

Ceremonial purification.

[Leviticus 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 12:1</span></span>

After the laws concerning clean and unclean food, come the laws
concerning clean and unclean persons. Man imparts his depraved nature to
his offspring, so that, excepting as the atonement of Christ and the
sanctification of the Spirit prevent, the original blessing, "Increase
and multiply," [Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028.md), is become to
the fallen race a direful curse, and communicates sin and misery. Let
those women who have received mercy from God in child-bearing, with all
thankfulness own God's goodness to them; and this shall please the Lord
better than sacrifices.
