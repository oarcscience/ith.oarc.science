Genesis is a name taken from the Greek, and signifies "the book of
generation or production;" it is properly so called, as containing an
account of the origin of all things. There is no other history so old.
There is nothing in the most ancient book which exists that contradicts
it; while many things recorded by the oldest heathen writers, or to be
traced in the customs of different nations, confirm what is related in
the book of Genesis.
