### [Daniel Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 7:0</span></span>

([Dan 7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001).md) Daniel's vision of the
four beasts.

([Dan 7:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009).md) And of Christ's kingdom.

([Dan 7:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#015).md) The interpretation.

[Daniel 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 7:1</span></span>

This vision contains the same prophetic representations with
Nebuchadnezzar's dream. The great sea agitated by the winds, represented
the earth and the dwellers on it troubled by ambitious princes and
conquerors. The four beasts signified the same four empires, as the four
parts of Nebuchadnezzar's image. Mighty conquerors are but instruments
of God's vengeance on a guilty world. The savage beast represents the
hateful features of their characters. But the dominion given to each has
a limit; their wrath shall be made to praise the Lord, and the remainder
of it he will restrain.

[Daniel 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 7:9</span></span>

These verses are for the comfort and support of the people of God, in
reference to the persecutions that would come upon them. Many New
Testament predictions of the judgment to come, have plain allusion to
this vision; especially [Rev 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md),
[Rev 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md). The Messiah is here called
the Son of man; he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh, and was
found in fashion as a man, but he is the Son of God. The great event
foretold in this passage, is Christ's glorious coming, to destroy every
antichristian power, and to render his own kingdom universal upon earth.
But ere the solemn time arrives, for manifesting the glory of God to all
worlds in his dealings with his creatures, we may expect that the doom
of each of us will be determined at the hour of our death; and before
the end shall come, the Father will openly give to his incarnate Son,
our Mediator and Judge, the inheritance of the nations as his willing
subjects.

[Daniel 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 7:15</span></span>

It is desirable to obtain the right and full sense of what we see and
hear from God; and those that would know, must ask by faithful and
fervent prayer. The angel told Daniel plainly. He especially desired to
know respecting the little horn, which made war with the saints, and
prevailed against them. Here is foretold the rage of papal Rome against
true Christians. St. John, in his visions and prophecies, which point in
the first place at Rome, has plain reference to these visions. Daniel
had a joyful prospect of the prevalence of God's kingdom among men. This
refers to the second coming of our blessed Lord, when the saints shall
triumph in the complete fall of Satan's kingdom. The saints of the Most
High shall possess the kingdom for ever. Far be it from us to infer from
hence, that dominion is founded on grace. It promises that the gospel
kingdom shall be set up; a kingdom of light, holiness, and love; a
kingdom of grace, the privileges and comforts of which shall be the
earnest and first-fruits of the kingdom of glory. But the full
accomplishment will be in the everlasting happiness of the saints, the
kingdom that cannot be moved. The gathering together the whole family of
God will be a blessedness of Christ's coming.
