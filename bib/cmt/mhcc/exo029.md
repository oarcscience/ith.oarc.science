### [Exodus Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 29:0</span></span>

(v. 1-37) The sacrifice and ceremony for the consecration of the
priests.

([Exo 29:38-46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038).md) The continual
burnt-offerings, God's promise to dwell among Israel.

[Exodus 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 29:1</span></span>

Aaron and his sons were to be set apart for the priest's office, with
ceremony and solemnity. Our Lord Jesus is the great High Priest of our
profession, called of God to be so; anointed with the Spirit, whence he
is called Messiah, the Christ; clothed with glory and beauty; sanctified
by his own blood; made perfect, or consecrated through sufferings, [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md). All believers are spiritual
priests, to offer spiritual sacrifices, [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md), washed in the blood of Christ,
and so made to our God priests, [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md), [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md). They also are clothed with the
beauty of holiness, and have received the anointing, [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md). The Spirit of God is called the
finger of God, ( [Luk 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020.md), compared
with [Mat 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028),.md) and by him the merit
of Christ is applied to our souls. This consecration signifies the
admission of a sinner into the spiritual priesthood, to offer spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

[Exodus 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">exo 29:38</span></span>

A lamb was to be offered upon the altar every morning, and a lamb every
evening. This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever
lives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once for
all, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This also
teaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise
every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the most needful
of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our daily comforts.
Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Those starve their own
souls, who keep not up constant attendance on the throne of grace;
constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.
