### [Hosea Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 7:0</span></span>

([Hos 7:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001).md) The manifold sins of
Israel.

([Hos 7:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#008).md) Their senselessness and
hypocrisy.

[Hosea 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 7:1</span></span>

A practical disbelief of God's government was at the bottom of all
israel's wickedness; as if God could not see it or did not heed it.
Their sins appear on every side of them. Their hearts were inflamed by
evil desires, like a heated oven. In the midst of their troubles as a
nation, the people never thought of seeking help from God. The actual
wickedness of men's lives bears a very small proportion to what is in
their hearts. But when lust is inwardly cherished, it will break forth
into outward sin. Those who tempt others to drunkenness never can be
their real friends, and often design their ruin. Thus men execute the
Divine vengeance on each other. Those are not only heated with sin, but
hardened in sin, who continue to live without prayer, even when in
trouble and distress.

[Hosea 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 7:8</span></span>

Israel was as a cake not turned, half burnt and half dough, none of it
fit for use; a mixture of idolatry and of the worship of Jehovah. There
were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they
noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to
self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which
obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth
their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their
hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their
lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to
another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we
by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves. Create in us a
clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.
