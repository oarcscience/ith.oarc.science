### [Psalms Chapter 101](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 101:0</span></span>

David's vow and profession of godliness.

[Psalms 101:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 101:1</span></span>

In this psalm we have David declaring how he intended to regulate his
household, and to govern his kingdom, that he might stop wickedness, and
encourage godliness. It is also applicable to private families, and is
the householder's psalm. It teaches all that have any power, whether
more or less, to use it so as to be a terror to evil-doers, and a praise
to them that do well. The chosen subject of the psalm is God's mercy and
judgment. The Lord's providences concerning his people are commonly
mixed; mercy and judgment. God has set the one over against the other,
both to do good, like showers and sunshine. When, in his providence, he
exercises us with the mixture of mercy and judgment, we must make
suitable acknowledgments to him for both. Family mercies and family
afflictions are both calls to family religion. Those who are in public
stations are not thereby excused from care in governing their families;
they are the more concerned to set a good example of ruling their own
houses well. Whenever a man has a house of his own, let him seek to have
God to dwell with him; and those may expect his presence, who walk with
a perfect heart, in a perfect way. David resolves to practise no evil
himself. He further resolves not to keep bad servants, nor to employ
those about him that are wicked. He will not admit them into his family,
lest they spread the infection of sin. A froward heart, one that
delights to be cross and perverse, is not fit for society, the bond of
which is Christian love. Nor will he countenance slanderers, those who
take pleasure in wounding their neighbour's reputation. Also, God
resists the proud, and false, deceitful people, who scruple not to tell
lies, or commit frauds. Let every one be zealous and diligent to reform
his own heart and ways, and to do this early; ever mindful of that
future, most awful morning, when the King of righteousness shall cut off
all wicked doers from the heavenly Jerusalem.
