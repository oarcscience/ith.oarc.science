### [Jeremiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 42:0</span></span>

([Jer 42:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001)) Johanan desires Jeremiah
to ask counsel of God.

(v. 7-22) They are assured of safety in Judea, but of destruction in
Egypt.

[Jeremiah 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 42:1</span></span>

To serve a turn, Jeremiah is sought out, and the captains ask for his
assistance. In every difficult, doubtful case, we must look to God for
direction; and we may still, in faith, pray to be guided by a spirit of
wisdom in our hearts, and the leadings of Providence. We do not truly
desire to know the mind of God, if we do not fully resolve to comply
with it when we know it. Many promise to do what the Lord requires,
while they hope to have their pride flattered, and their favourite lusts
spared. Yet something betrays the state of their hearts.

[Jeremiah 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 42:7</span></span>

If we would know the mind of the Lord in doubtful cases, we must wait as
well as pray. God is ever ready to return in mercy to those he has
afflicted; and he never rejects any who rely on his promises. He has
declared enough to silence even the causeless fears of his people, which
discourage them in the way of duty. Whatever loss or suffering we may
fear from obedience, is provided against in God's word; and he will
protect and deliver all who trust in him and serve him. It is folly to
quit our place, especially to quit a holy land, because we meet with
trouble in it. And the evils we think to escape by sin, we certainly
bring upon ourselves. We may apply this to the common troubles of life;
and those who think to avoid them by changing their place, will find
that the grievances common to men will meet them wherever they go.
Sinners who dissemble with God in solemn professions especially should
be rebuked with sharpness; for their actions speak more plainly than
words. We know not what is good for ourselves; and what we are most fond
of, and have our hearts most set upon, often proves hurtful, and
sometimes fatal.
