[Psalms 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 38:1</span></span>

Nothing will disquiet the heart of a good man so much as the sense of
God's anger. The way to keep the heart quiet, is to keep ourselves in
the love of God. But a sense of guilt is too heavy to bear; and would
sink men into despair and ruin, unless removed by the pardoning mercy of
God. If there were not sin in our souls, there would be no pain in our
bones, no illness in our bodies. The guilt of sin is a burden to the
whole creation, which groans under it. It will be a burden to the
sinners themselves, when they are heavy-laden under it, or a burden of
ruin, when it sinks them to hell. When we perceive our true condition,
the Good Physician will be valued, sought, and obeyed. Yet many let
their wounds rankle, because they delay to go to their merciful Friend.
When, at any time, we are distempered in our bodies, we ought to
remember how God has been dishonoured in and by our bodies. The
groanings which cannot be uttered, are not hid from Him that searches
the heart, and knows the mind of the Spirit. David, in his troubles, was
a type of Christ in his agonies, of Christ on his cross, suffering and
deserted.

[Psalms 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 38:12</span></span>

Wicked men hate goodness, even when they benefit by it. David, in the
complaints he makes of his enemies, seems to refer to Christ. But our
enemies do us real mischief only when they drive us from God and our
duty. The true believer's trouble will be made useful; he will learn to
wait for his God, and will not seek relief from the world or himself.
The less we notice the unkindness and injuries that are done us, the
more we consult the quiet of our own minds. David's troubles were the
chastisement and the consequence of his transgressions, whilst Christ
suffered for our sins and ours only. What right can a sinner have to
yield to impatience or anger, when mercifully corrected for his sins?
David was very sensible of the present workings of corruption in him.
Good men, by setting their sorrow continually before them, have been
ready to fall; but by setting God always before them, they have kept
their standing. If we are truly penitent for sin, that will make us
patient under affliction. Nothing goes nearer to the heart of a believer
when in affliction, than to be under the apprehension of God's deserting
him; nor does any thing come more feelingly from his heart than this
prayer, "Be not far from me." The Lord will hasten to help those who
trust in him as their salvation.
