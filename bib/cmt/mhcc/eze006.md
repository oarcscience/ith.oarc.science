### [Ezekiel Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 6:0</span></span>

([Eze 6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001).md) The Divine judgments for
idolatry.

([Eze 6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008).md) A remnant shall be
saved.

([Eze 6:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011).md) The calamities are to
be lamented.

[Ezekiel 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 6:1</span></span>

War desolates persons, places, and things esteemed most sacred. God
ruins idolatries even by the hands of idolaters. It is just with God to
make that a desolation, which we make an idol. The superstitions to
which many trust for safety, often cause their ruin. And the day is at
hand, when idols and idolatry will be as thoroughly destroyed from the
professedly Christian church as they were from among the Jews.

[Ezekiel 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 6:8</span></span>

A remnant of Israel should be left; at length they should remember the
Lord, their obligations to him, and rebellion against him. True
penitents see sin to be that abominable thing which the Lord hates.
Those who truly loathe sin, loathe themselves because of sin. They give
glory to God by their repentance. Whatever brings men to remember Him,
and their sins against him, should be regarded as a blessing.

[Ezekiel 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 6:11</span></span>

It is our duty to be affected, not only with our own sins and
sufferings, but to look with compassion upon the miseries wicked people
bring upon themselves. Sin is a desolating thing; therefore, stand in
awe, and sin not. If we know the worth of souls, and the danger to which
unbelievers are exposed, we shall deem every sinner who takes refuge in
Jesus from the wrath to come, an abundant recompence for all contempt or
opposition we may meet with.
