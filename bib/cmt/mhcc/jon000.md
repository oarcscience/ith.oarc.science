### [Jonah Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001)

[Jonah](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jon 0:0</span></span>

Jonah was a native of Galilee, [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025). His miraculous deliverance from
out of the fish, rendered him a type of our blessed Lord, who mentions
it, so as to show the certain truth of the narrative. All that was done
was easy to the almighty power of the Author and Sustainer of life. This
book shows us, by the example of the Ninevites, how great are the Divine
forbearance and long-suffering towards sinners. It shows a most striking
contrast between the goodness and mercy of God, and the rebellion,
impatience, and peevishness of his servant; and it will be best
understood by those who are most acquainted with their own hearts.
