### [Isaiah Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 22:0</span></span>

([Isa 22:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001).md) The siege and taking of
Jerusalem.

([Isa 22:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008).md) The wicked conduct of
its inhabitants.

([Isa 22:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015).md) The displacing of
Shebna, and the promotion of Eliakim, applied to the Messiah.

[Isaiah 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 22:1</span></span>

Why is Jerusalem in such terror? Her slain men are not slain with the
sword, but with famine; or, slain with fear, disheartened. Their rulers
fled, but were overtaken. The servants of God, who foresee and warn
sinners of coming miseries, are affected by the prospect. But all the
horrors of a city taken by storm, faintly shadow forth the terrors of
the day of wrath.

[Isaiah 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 22:8</span></span>

The weakness of Judah now appeared more than ever. Now also they
discovered their carnal confidence and their carnal security. They
looked to the fortifications. They made sure of water for the city. But
they were regardless of God in all these preparations. They did not care
for his glory in what they did. They did not depend upon him for a
blessing on their endeavours. For every creature is to us what God makes
it to be; and we must bless him for it, and use it for him. There was
great contempt of God's wrath and justice, in contending with them.
God's design was to humble them, and bring them to repentance. They
walked contrary to this. Actual disbelief of another life after this, is
at the bottom of the carnal security and brutish sensuality, which are
the sin, the shame, and ruin of so great a part of mankind. God was
displeased at this. It is a sin against the remedy, and it is not likely
they should ever repent of it. Whether this unbelief works by
presumption or despair, it produces the same contempt of God, and is a
token that a man will perish wilfully.

[Isaiah 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 22:15</span></span>

This message to Shebna is a reproof of his pride, vanity, and security;
what vanity is all earthly grandeur, which death will so soon end! What
will it avail, whether we are laid in a magnificent tomb, or covered
with the green sod? Those who, when in power, turn and toss others, will
be justly turned and tossed themselves. Eliakim should be put into
Shebna's place. Those called to places of trust and power, should seek
to God for grace to enable them to do their duty. Eliakim's advancement
is described. Our Lord Jesus describes his own power as Mediator, [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md), that he has the key of David. His
power in the kingdom of heaven, and in ordering all the affairs of that
kingdom, is absolute. Rulers should be fathers to those under their
government; and the honour men bring unto their families, by their piety
and usefulness, is more to be valued than what they derive from them by
their names and titles. The glory of this world gives a man no real
worth or excellence; it is but hung upon him, and it will soon drop from
him. Eliakim was compared to a nail in a sure place; all his family are
said to depend upon him. In eastern houses, rows of large spikes were
built up in the walls. Upon these the moveables and utensils were hung.
Our Lord Jesus is as a nail in a sure place. That soul cannot perish,
nor that concern fall to the ground, which is by faith hung upon Christ.
He will set before the believer an open door, which no man can shut, and
bring both body and soul to eternal glory. But those who neglect so
great salvation will find, that when he shutteth none can open, whether
it be shutting out from heaven, or shutting up in hell for ever.
