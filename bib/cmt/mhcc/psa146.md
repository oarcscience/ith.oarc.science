### [Psalms Chapter 146](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 146:0</span></span>

([Psa 146:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001)) Why we should not trust
in men.

([Psa 146:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005)) Why we should trust in
God.

[Psalms 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 146:1</span></span>

If it is our delight to praise the Lord while we live, we shall
certainly praise him to all eternity. With this glorious prospect before
us, how low do worldly pursuits seem! There is a Son of man in whom
there is help, even him who is also the Son of God, who will not fail
those that trust in him. But all other sons of men are like the man from
whom they sprung, who, being in honour, did not abide. God has given the
earth to the children of men, but there is great striving about it. Yet,
after a while, no part of the earth will be their own, except that in
which their dead bodies are laid. And when man returns to his earth, in
that very day all his plans and designs vanish and are gone: what then
comes of expectations from him?

[Psalms 146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 146:5</span></span>

The psalmist encourages us to put confidence in God. We must hope in the
providence of God for all we need as to this life, and in the grace of
God for that which is to come. The God of heaven became a man that he
might become our salvation. Though he died on the cross for our sins,
and was laid in the grave, yet his thoughts of love to us did not
perish; he rose again to fulfil them. When on earth, his miracles were
examples of what he is still doing every day. He grants deliverance to
captives bound in the chains of sin and Satan. He opens the eyes of the
understanding. He feeds with the bread of life those who hunger for
salvation; and he is the constant Friend of the poor in spirit, the
helpless: with him poor sinners, that are as fatherless, find mercy; and
his kingdom shall continue for ever. Then let sinners flee to him, and
believers rejoice in him. And as the Lord shall reign for ever, let us
stir up each other to praise his holy name.
