### [Genesis Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 20:0</span></span>

([Gen 20:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001).md) Abraham's sojourn at
Gerar, Sarah is taken by Abimelech.

([Gen 20:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#009).md) Abimelech's rebuke to
Abraham.

([Gen 20:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#014).md) Abimelech restores
Sarah.

[Genesis 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 20:1</span></span>

Crooked policy will not prosper: it brings ourselves and others into
danger. God gives Abimelech notice of his danger of sin, and his danger
of death for his sin. Every wilful sinner is a dead man, but Abimelech
pleads ignorance. If our consciences witness, that, however we may have
been cheated into a snare, we have not knowingly sinned against God, it
will be our rejoicing in the day of evil. It is matter of comfort to
those who are honest, that God knows their honesty, and will acknowledge
it. It is a great mercy to be hindered from committing sin; of this God
must have the glory. But if we have ignorantly done wrong, that will not
excuse us, if we knowingly persist in it. He that does wrong, whoever he
is, prince or peasant, shall certainly receive for the wrong which he
has done, unless he repent, and, if possible, make restitution.

[Genesis 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 20:9</span></span>

See here much to blame, even in the father of the faithful. Mark his
distrust of God, his undue care about life, his intent to deceive. He
also threw temptation in the way of others, caused affliction to them,
exposed himself and Sarah to just rebukes, and yet attempted an excuse.
These things are written for our warning, not for us to imitate. Even
Abraham hath not whereof to glory. He cannot be justified by his works,
but must be indebted for justification, to that righteousness which is
upon all and unto all them that believe. We must not condemn all as
hypocrites who fall into sin, if they do not continue in it. But let the
unhumbled and impenitent take heed that they do not sin on, thinking
that grace may abound. Abimelech, being warned of God, takes the
warning; and being truly afraid of sin and its consequences, he rose
early to pursue the directions given him.

[Genesis 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 20:14</span></span>

We often trouble ourselves, and even are led into temptation and sin, by
groundless suspicions; and find the fear of God where we expected it
not. Agreements to deceive generally end in shame and sorrow; and
restraints from sin, though by suffering, should be thankfully
acknowledged. Though the Lord rebuke, yet he will pardon and deliver his
people, and he will give them favour in the sight of those with whom
they sojourn; and overrule their infirmities, when they are humbled for
them, so that they shall prove useful to themselves and others.
