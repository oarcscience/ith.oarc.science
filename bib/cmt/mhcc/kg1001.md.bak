### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

([Kg1 1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001).md) David's declining age.

([Kg1 1:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005).md) Adonijah aspires to the
throne.

(v. 11-31) David makes Solomon king.

(v. 32-53) Solomon is anointed king, and Adonijah's usurpation stopped.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 1:1</span></span>

We have David sinking under infirmities. He was chastised for his recent
sins, and felt the effects of his former toils and hardships.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 1:5</span></span>

Indulgent parents are often chastised with disobedient children, who are
anxious to possess their estates. No worldly wisdom, nor experience, nor
sacredness of character, can insure the continuance in any former course
of those who remain under the power of self-love. But we may well wonder
by what arts Joab and Abiathar could be drawn aside.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 1:11</span></span>

Observe Nathan's address to Bathsheba. Let me give thee counsel how to
save thy own life, and the life of thy son. Such as this is the counsel
Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only
that no man take our crown, [Rev 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011.md),
but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a
solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that
Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses
from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his
hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the
approach of death.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 1:32</span></span>

The people expressed great joy and satisfaction in the elevation of
Solomon. Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of
David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved,
when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds
expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon
dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the
Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his
enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and
therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of
his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar,
nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who
will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if
their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.
