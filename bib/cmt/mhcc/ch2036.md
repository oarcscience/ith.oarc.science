### [2 Chronicles Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 36:0</span></span>

(v. 1-21) The destruction of Jerusalem.

([Ch2 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022.md), [Ch2
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#023).md) The proclamation of Cyrus.

[2 Chronicles 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 36:1</span></span>

The ruin of Judah and Jerusalem came on by degrees. The methods God
takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by
providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his
unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin
makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly
blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many
times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should
have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven
years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of
men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What
place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If
that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be
high-minded, but fear.

[2 Chronicles 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 36:22</span></span>

God had promised the restoring of the captives, and the rebuilding of
Jerusalem, at the end of seventy years; and that time to favour Zion,
that set time, came at last. Though God's church be cast down, it is not
cast off; though his people be corrected, they are not abandoned; though
thrown into the furnace, they are not lost there, nor left there any
longer than till the dross be separated. Though God contend long, he
will not contend always. Before we close the books of the Chronicles,
which contain a faithful register of events, think what desolation sin
introduced into the world, nay, even into the church of God. Let us
tremble at what is here recorded, while in the character of some few
gracious souls, we discover that the Lord left not himself without
witness. And when we have looked at this faithful portrait of man by
nature, let us contrast with it that same nature, when recovered by
Almighty grace, through the justifying and soul-adorning righteousness
of Christ our Saviour.
