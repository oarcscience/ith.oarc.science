<p>(v. 1-51) Numbering of Israel in the plains of Moab.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052">Num 26:52-56</A>) The division of the land.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#057">Num 26:57-62</A>) Number of the Levites.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#063">Num 26:63-65</A>) None remaining of the first numbering. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001">Numbers 26:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">num 26:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Moses did not number the people but when God commanded him. We have here the families registered, as well as the tribes. The total was nearly the same as when numbered at mount Sinai. Notice is here taken of the children of Korah; they died not, as the children of Dathan and Abiram; they seem not to have joined even their own father in rebellion. If we partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall not partake of their plagues. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052">Numbers 26:52</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_052">num 26:52</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In distributing these tribes, the general rule of equity is prescribed; that to many should be given more, and to fewer less. Though it seems left to the prudence of their prince, the matter at last must be settled by the providence of God, with which all must be satisfied. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#057">Numbers 26:57</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_057">num 26:57</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Levi was God's tribe; therefore it was not numbered with the rest, but alone. It came not under the sentence, that none of them should enter Canaan excepting Caleb and Joshua. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#063">Numbers 26:63</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_063">num 26:63</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The execution of the sentence passed on the murmurers, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029">Num 14:29</A>, is observable. There was not one man numbered now, who was numbered then, but Caleb and Joshua. Here appeared the righteousness of God, and his faithfulness to his threatenings. Especially observe the truth of God, in performing his promise to Caleb and Joshua. Death makes awful havoc of the human species, and causes surprising changes in families and nations; yet all is appointed in perfect wisdom, justice, and truth, by the Lord himself. This should stir us up to think upon the hateful nature of sin, the cause of all these devastations. We should renew our repentance, seek forgiveness, value the salvation of Christ, remember how frail we are, prepare for the summons of death, and fill up our days in serving our generation according to the will of God.
