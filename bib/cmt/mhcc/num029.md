### [Numbers Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 29:0</span></span>

([Num 29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001)) The offering at the
feast of trumpets, and on the day of atonement.

(v. 12-40) Offerings at the feast of tabernacles.

[Numbers 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 29:1</span></span>

There were more sacred solemnities in the seventh month than in any
other. It was the space between harvest and seed-time. The more leisure
we have from the pressing occupations of this life, the more time we
should spend in the immediate service of God. The blowing of the
trumpets was appointed, [Lev 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#024).
Here they are directed what sacrifices to offer on that day. Those who
would know the mind of God in the Scriptures, must compare one part with
another. The latter discoveries of Divine light explain what was dark,
and supply what was wanting, in the former, that the man of God may be
perfect.

[Numbers 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 29:12</span></span>

Soon after the day of atonement, the day in which men were to afflict
their souls, followed the feast of Tabernacles, in which they were to
rejoice before the Lord. Their days of rejoicing were to be days of
sacrifices. A disposition to be cheerful does us good, when it
encourages our hearts in the duties of God's service. All the days of
dwelling in booths they must offer sacrifices; while we are here in a
tabernacle state, it is our interest, as well as our duty, constantly to
keep up communion with God. The sacrifices for each of the seven days
are appointed. Every day there must be a sin-offering, as in the other
feasts. Our burnt-offerings of praise cannot be accepted of God, unless
we have an interest in the great sacrifice which Christ offered, when he
made himself a Sin-offering for us. And no extraordinary services should
put aside stated devotions. Every thing here reminds us of our
sinfulness. The life that we live in the flesh must be by the faith of
the Son of God; until we go to be with him, to behold his glory, and
praise his mercy, who hath loved us and washed us from our sins in his
own blood. To whom be honour and glory for ever. Amen.
