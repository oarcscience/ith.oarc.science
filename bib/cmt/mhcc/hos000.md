### [Hosea Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 0:0</span></span>

Hosea is supposed to have been of the kingdom of Israel. He lived and
prophesied during a long period. The scope of his predictions appears to
be, to detect, reprove, and convince the Jewish nation in general, and
the Israelites in particular, of their many sins, particularly their
idolatry: the corrupt state of the kingdom is also noticed. But he
invites them to repentance, with promises of mercy, and gospel
predictions of the future restoration of the Israelites and of the Jews,
and their final conversion to Christianity.
