### [Psalms Chapter 104](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 104:0</span></span>

([Psa 104:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001).md) God's majesty in the
heavens, The creation of the sea, and the dry land.

([Psa 104:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010).md) His provision for all
creatures.

([Psa 104:19-30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#019).md) The regular course of
day and night, and God's sovereign power over all the creatures.

([Psa 104:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031).md) A resolution to
continue praising God.

[Psalms 104:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 104:1</span></span>

Every object we behold calls on us to bless and praise the Lord, who is
great. His eternal power and Godhead are clearly shown by the things
which he hath made. God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. The
Lord Jesus, the Son of his love, is the Light of the world.

[Psalms 104:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 104:10</span></span>

When we reflect upon the provision made for all creatures, we should
also notice the natural worship they render to God. Yet man, forgetful
ungrateful man, enjoys the largest measure of his Creator's kindness.
the earth, varying in different lands. Nor let us forget spiritual
blessings; the fruitfulness of the church through grace, the bread of
everlasting life, the cup of salvation, and the oil of gladness. Does
God provide for the inferior creatures, and will he not be a refuge to
his people?

[Psalms 104:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 104:19</span></span>

We are to praise and magnify God for the constant succession of day and
night. And see how those are like to the wild beasts, who wait for the
twilight, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.
Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenous
creatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language
of grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings which
cannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be done
in its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he must
continue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night
comes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works of
God. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the more
rough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. They
are all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designed
to serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a new
world rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alone
lives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soul enters
on another state, and his body will be raised, either to glory or to
misery. May the Lord send forth his Spirit, and new-create our souls to
holiness.

[Psalms 104:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 104:31</span></span>

Man's glory is fading; God's glory is everlasting: creatures change, but
with the Creator there is no variableness. And if mediation on the
glories of creation be so sweet to the soul, what greater glory appears
to the enlightened mind, when contemplating the great work of
redemption! There alone can a sinner perceive ground of confidence and
joy in God. While he with pleasure upholds all, governs all, and
rejoices in all his works, let our souls, touched by his grace, meditate
on and praise him.
