### [2 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001.md)

The furniture of the temple.

[2 Chronicles 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 4:1</span></span>

Here is a further account of the furniture of God's house. Both without
doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel,
and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ.
There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the
book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it
sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see
the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great
Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and
put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not
possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might
ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our
devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture
of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's
church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be
God, there is enough in Christ for all.
