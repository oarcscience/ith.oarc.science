### [Judges Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 21:0</span></span>

The Israelites lament for the Benjamites.

[Judges 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 21:1</span></span>

Israel lamented for the Benjamites, and were perplexed by the oath they
had taken, not to give their daughters to them in marriage. Men are more
zealous to support their own authority than that of God. They would have
acted better if they had repented of their rash oaths, brought
sin-offerings, and sought forgiveness in the appointed way, rather than
attempt to avoid the guilt of perjury by actions quite as wrong. That
men can advise others to acts of treachery or violence, out of a sense
of duty, forms a strong proof of the blindness of the human mind when
left to itself, and of the fatal effects of a conscience under ignorance
and error.
