### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 15:0</span></span>

([Sa2 15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001).md) Absalom's ambition.

([Sa2 15:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007).md) His conspiracy.

([Sa2 15:13-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#013).md) David leaves
Jerusalem.

([Sa2 15:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024).md) David sends back the
ark.

([Sa2 15:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031).md) He prays against
Ahithophel's counsel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 15:1</span></span>

David allows Absalom's pomp. Those parents know not what they do, who
indulge a proud humour in their children: many young people are ruined
by pride. And those commonly are most eager for authority who least
understand its duties.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 15:7</span></span>

See how willing tender parents are to believe the best concerning their
children. But how easy and how wicked is it, for children to take
advantage of good parents, and to deceive them with the show of
religion! The principal men of Jerusalem joined Absalom's feast upon his
sacrifice. Pious persons are glad to see others appear religious, and
this gives occasion for deceptions. The policy of wicked men, and the
subtlety of Satan, are exerted to draw good persons to countenance base
designs.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 15:13</span></span>

David determined to quit Jerusalem. He took this resolve, as a penitent
submitting to the rod. Before unrighteous Absalom he could justify
himself, and stand out; but before the righteous God he must condemn
himself, and yield to his judgments. Thus he accepts the punishment of
his sin. And good men, when they themselves suffer, are anxious that
others should not be led to suffer with them. He compelled none; those
whose hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let them go, and so shall
their doom be. Thus Christ enlists none but willing followers. David
cannot bear to think that Ittai, a stranger and an exile, a proselyte
and a new convert, who ought to be encouraged and made easy, should meet
with hard usage. But such value has Ittai for David's wisdom and
goodness, that he will not leave him. He is a friend indeed, who loves
at all times, and will adhere to us in adversity. Let us cleave to the
Son of David, with full purpose of heart, and neither life nor death
shall separate us from his love.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 15:24</span></span>

David is very careful for the safety of the ark. It is right to be more
concerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer the
success of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety.
Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of the Divine
disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully to
acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God's hand
in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us
see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, [Psa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003.md); but never so plain, nor ever
appearing so black as now. He never wept thus when Saul hunted him, but
a wounded conscience makes troubles lie heavy, [Psa
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 15:31</span></span>

David prays not against Ahithophel's person, but against his counsel. He
prayed this, in firm belief that God has all hearts in his hand, and
tongues also. But we must second our prayers with endeavours, and David
did so, else we tempt God. But we do not find wisdom and simplicity so
united in any mere man, that we can perceive nothing which needs
forgiveness. Yet, when the Son of David was treated with all possible
treachery and cruelty, his wisdom, meekness, candour, and patience, were
perfect. Him let us follow, cleave to, and serve, in life and in death.
