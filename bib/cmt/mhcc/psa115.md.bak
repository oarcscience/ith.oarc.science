### [Psalms Chapter 115](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 115:0</span></span>

([Psa 115:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001).md) Glory to be ascribed to
God.

([Psa 115:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009).md) By trusting in him and
praising him.

[Psalms 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 115:1</span></span>

Let no opinion of our own merits have any place in our prayers or in our
praises. All the good we do, is done by the power of his grace; and all
the good we have, is the gift of his mere mercy, and he must have all
the praise. Are we in pursuit of any mercy, and wrestling with God for
it, we must take encouragement in prayer from God only. Lord, do so for
us; not that we may have the credit and comfort of it, but that they
mercy and truth may have the glory of it. The heathen gods are senseless
things. They are the works of men's hands: the painter, the carver, the
statuary, can put no life into them, therefore no sense. The psalmist
hence shows the folly of the worshippers of idols.

[Psalms 115:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 115:9</span></span>

It is folly to trust in dead images, but it is wisdom to trust in the
living God, for he is a help and a shield to those that trust in him.
Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him;
those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found
faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to
the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially
in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is
large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use.
The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of
the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God:
death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and
conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service,
therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it
ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are
gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to
praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first
and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our
souls for ever.
