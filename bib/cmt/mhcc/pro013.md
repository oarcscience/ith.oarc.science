### [Proverbs Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 13:1</span></span>

There is great hope of those that reverence their parents. There is
little hope of any who will not hear those that deal faithfully with
them.

[Proverbs 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 13:2</span></span>

By our words we must be justified or condemned, [Mat
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#037.md).

[Proverbs 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 13:3</span></span>

He that thinks before he speaks, that suppresses evil if he have thought
it, keeps his soul from a great deal both of guilt and grief. Many a one
is ruined by an ungoverned tongue.

[Proverbs 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 13:4</span></span>

The slothful desire the gains the diligent get, but hate the pains the
diligent take; therefore they have nothing. This is especially true as
to the soul.

[Proverbs 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 13:5</span></span>

Where sin reigns, the man is loathsome. If his conscience were awake, he
would abhor himself, and repent in dust and ashes.

[Proverbs 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 13:6</span></span>

An honest desire to do right, preserves a man from fatal mistakes,
better than a thousand fine-drawn distinctions.

[Proverbs 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 13:7</span></span>

Some who are really poor, trade and spend as if they were rich: this is
sin, and will be shame, and it will end accordingly. Some that are
really rich, would be thought to be poor: in this there is want of
gratitude to God, want of justice and charity to others. There are many
hypocrites, empty of grace, who will not be convinced of their poverty.
There are many fearing Christians, who are spiritually rich, yet think
themselves poor; by their doubts, and complaints, and griefs, they make
themselves poor.

[Proverbs 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 13:8</span></span>

Great riches often tempt to violence against those that possess them;
but the poor are free from such perils.

[Proverbs 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 13:9</span></span>

The light of the righteous is as that of the sun, which may be eclipsed
and clouded, but will continue: the Spirit is their Light, he gives a
fulness of joy: that of the wicked is as a lamp of their own kindling,
easily put out.

[Proverbs 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 13:10</span></span>

All contentions, whether between private persons, families, churches, or
nations, are begun and carried forward by pride. Disputes would be
easily prevented or ended, if it were not for pride.

[Proverbs 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 13:11</span></span>

Wealth gotten by dishonesty or vice, has a secret curse, which will
speedily waste it.

[Proverbs 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 13:12</span></span>

The delay of what is anxiously hoped for, is very painful to the mind;
obtaining it is very pleasant. But spiritual blessings are chiefly
intended.

[Proverbs 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 13:13</span></span>

He that stands in awe of God, and reverences his word, shall escape
destruction, and be rewarded for his godly fear.

[Proverbs 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 13:14</span></span>

The rule by which the wise regulate their conduct, is a fountain
yielding life and happiness.

[Proverbs 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 13:15</span></span>

The way of sinners is hard upon others, and hard to the sinner himself.
The service of sin is slavery; the road to hell is strewed with the
thorns and thistles that followed the curse.

[Proverbs 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 13:16</span></span>

It is folly to talk of things of which we know nothing, and to undertake
what we are no way fit for.

[Proverbs 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 13:17</span></span>

Those that are wicked, and false to Christ and to the souls of men, do
mischief, and fall into mischief; but those that are faithful, find
sound words healing to others and to themselves.

[Proverbs 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 13:18</span></span>

He that scorns to be taught, will certainly be brought down.

[Proverbs 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 13:19</span></span>

There are in man strong desires after happiness; but never let those
expect any thing truly sweet to their souls, who will not be persuaded
to leave their sins.

[Proverbs 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 13:20</span></span>

Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company. And all that make
themselves wicked will be destroyed.

[Proverbs 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 13:21</span></span>

When God pursues sinners he is sure to overtake them; and he will reward
the righteous.

[Proverbs 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 13:22</span></span>

The servant of God who is not anxious about riches, takes the best
method of providing for his children.

[Proverbs 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 13:23</span></span>

The poor, yet industrious, thrive, though in a homely manner, while
those who have great riches are often brought to poverty for want of
judgment.

[Proverbs 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 13:24</span></span>

He acts as if he hated his child, who, by false indulgence, permits
sinful habits to gather strength, which will bring sorrow here, and
misery hereafter.

[Proverbs 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 13:25</span></span>

It is the misery of the wicked, that even their sensual appetites are
always craving. The righteous feeds on the word and ordinances, to the
satisfying of his soul with the promises of the gospel, and the Lord
Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of life.
