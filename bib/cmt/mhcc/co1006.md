### [1 Corinthians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co1 6:0</span></span>

([Co1 6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001).md) Cautions against going to
law in heathen courts.

([Co1 6:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009).md) Sins which, if lived and
died in, shut out from the kingdom of God.

([Co1 6:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012).md) Our bodies, which are
the members of Christ, and temples of the Holy Ghost, must not be
defiled.

[1 Corinthians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 6:1</span></span>

Christians should not contend with one another, for they are brethren.
This, if duly attended to, would prevent many law-suits, and end many
quarrels and disputes. In matters of great damage to ourselves or
families, we may use lawful means to right ourselves, but Christians
should be of a forgiving temper. Refer the matters in dispute, rather
than go to law about them. They are trifles, and may easily be settled,
if you first conquer your own spirits. Bear and forbear, and the men of
least skill among you may end your quarrels. It is a shame that little
quarrels should grow to such a head among Christians, that they cannot
be determined by the brethren. The peace of a man's own mind, and the
calm of his neighbourhood, are worth more than victory. Lawsuits could
not take place among brethren, unless there were faults among them.

[1 Corinthians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 6:9</span></span>

The Corinthians are warned against many great evils, of which they had
formerly been guilty. There is much force in these inquiries, when we
consider that they were addressed to a people puffed up with a fancy of
their being above others in wisdom and knowledge. All unrighteousness is
sin; all reigning sin, nay, every actual sin, committed with design, and
not repented of, shuts out of the kingdom of heaven. Be not deceived.
Men are very much inclined to flatter themselves that they may live in
sin, yet die in Christ, and go to heaven. But we cannot hope to sow to
the flesh, and reap everlasting life. They are reminded what a change
the gospel and grace of God had made in them. The blood of Christ, and
the washing of regeneration, can take away all guilt. Our justification
is owing to the suffering and merit of Christ; our sanctification to the
working of the Holy Spirit; but both go together. All who are made
righteous in the sight of God, are made holy by the grace of God.

[1 Corinthians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 6:12</span></span>

Some among the Corinthians seem to have been ready to say, All things
are lawful for me. This dangerous conceit St. Paul opposes. There is a
liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, in which we must stand fast.
But surely a Christian would never put himself into the power of any
bodily appetite. The body is for the Lord; is to be an instrument of
righteousness to holiness, therefore is never to be made an instrument
of sin. It is an honour to the body, that Jesus Christ was raised from
the dead; and it will be an honour to our bodies, that they will be
raised. The hope of a resurrection to glory, should keep Christians from
dishonouring their bodies by fleshly lusts. And if the soul be united to
Christ by faith, the whole man is become a member of his spiritual body.
Other vices may be conquered in fight; that here cautioned against, only
by flight. And vast multitudes are cut off by this vice in its various
forms and consequences. Its effects fall not only directly upon the
body, but often upon the mind. Our bodies have been redeemed from
deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by the atoning sacrifice of
Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted for our Master's use.
Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought with a price of
unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself as wholly the
Lord's, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business, to the
latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with our bodies, and
with our spirits which are his.
