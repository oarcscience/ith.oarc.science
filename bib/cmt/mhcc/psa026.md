### [Psalms Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 26:0</span></span>

David, in this psalm, appeals to God touching his integrity.

[Psalms 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 26:1</span></span>

David here, by the Spirit of prophecy, speaks of himself as a type of
Christ, of whom what he here says of his spotless innocence was fully
and eminently true, and of Christ only, and to Him we may apply it. We
are complete in him. The man that walks in his integrity, yet trusting
wholly in the grace of God, is in a state of acceptance, according to
the covenant of which Jesus was the Mediator, in virtue of his spotless
obedience even unto death. This man desires to have his inmost soul
searched and proved by the Lord. He is aware of the deceitfulness of his
own heart; he desires to detect and mortify every sin; and he longs to
be satisfied of his being a true believer, and to practise the holy
commands of God. Great care to avoid bad company, is both a good
evidence of our integrity, and a good means to keep us in it. Hypocrites
and dissemblers may be found attending on God's ordinances; but it is a
good sign of sincerity, if we attend upon them, as the psalmist here
tells us he did, in the exercise of repentance and conscientious
obedience. He feels his ground firm under him; and, as he delights in
blessing the Lord with his congregations on earth, he trusts that
shortly he shall join the great assembly in heaven, in singing praises
to God and to the Lamb for evermore.
