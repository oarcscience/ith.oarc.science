### [Ruth Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#001.md)

[Ruth](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rut 3:0</span></span>

([Rut 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#001).md) The directions given to
Ruth by Naomi.

([Rut 3:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#006).md) Boaz acknowledges the
duty of a kinsman.

([Rut 3:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#014).md) Ruth's return to her
mother-in-law.

[Ruth 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 3:1</span></span>

The married state should be a rest, as much as any thing upon earth can
be so, as it ought to fix the affections and form a connexion for life.
Therefore it should be engaged in with great seriousness, with earnest
prayers for direction, for the blessing of God, and with regard to his
precepts. Parents should carefully advise their children in this
important concern, that it may be well with them as to their souls. Be
it always remembered, That is best for us which is best for our souls.
The course Naomi advised appears strange to us; but it was according to
the laws and usages of Israel. If the proposed measure had borne the
appearance of evil, Naomi would not have advised it. Law and custom gave
Ruth, who was now proselyted to the true religion, a legal claim upon
Boaz. It was customary for widows to assert this claim, [Deu
25:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md). But this is not recorded for
imitation in other times, and is not to be judged by modern rules. And
if there had been any evil in it, Ruth was a woman of too much virtue
and too much sense to have listened to it.

[Ruth 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rut 3:6</span></span>

What in one age or nation would be improper, is not always so in another
age or another nation. Being a judge of Israel, Boaz would tell Ruth
what she should do; also whether he had the right of redemption, and
what methods must be taken, and what rites used, in order to
accomplishing her marriage with him or another person. The conduct of
Boaz calls for the highest praise. He attempted not to take advantage of
Ruth; he did not disdain her as a poor, destitute stranger, nor suspect
her of any ill intentions. He spoke honourably of her as a virtuous
woman, made her a promise, and as soon as the morning arrived, sent her
away with a present to her mother-in-law. Boaz made his promise
conditional, for there was a kinsman nearer than he, to whom the right
of redemption belonged.

[Ruth 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rut 3:14</span></span>

Ruth had done all that was fit for her to do, she must patiently wait
the event. Boaz, having undertaken this matter, would be sure to manage
it well. Much more reason have true believers to cast their care on God,
because he has promised to care for them. Our strength is to sit still,
[Isa 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md). This narrative may
encourage us to lay ourselves by faith at the feet of Christ: He is our
near Kinsman; having taken our nature upon him. He has the right to
redeem. Let us seek to receive from him his directions: Lord, what wilt
thou have me to do? [Act 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006.md). He will
never blame us as doing this unseasonably. And let us earnestly desire
and seek the same rest for our children and friends, that it may be well
with them also.
