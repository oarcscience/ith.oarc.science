### [Leviticus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

([Lev 7:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001).md) Concerning the
trespass-offering.

(v. 11-27) Concerning the peace-offering.

([Lev 7:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#028).md) The wave and heave
offerings.

([Lev 7:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035).md) The conclusion of these
institutions.

[Leviticus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 7:1</span></span>

In the sin-offering and the trespass-offering, the sacrifice was divided
between the altar and the priest; the offerer had no share, as he had in
the peace-offerings. The former expressed repentance and sorrow for sin,
therefore it was more proper to fast than feast; the peace-offerings
denoted communion with a reconciled God in Christ, the joy and gratitude
of a pardoned sinner, and the privileges of a true believer.

[Leviticus 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 7:11</span></span>

As to the peace-offerings, in the expression of their sense of mercy,
God left them more at liberty, than in the expression of their sense of
sin; that their sacrifices, being free-will offerings, might be the more
acceptable, while, by obliging them to bring the sacrifices of
atonement, God shows the necessity of the great Propitiation. The main
reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had
appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its
end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices
to cease. Therefore this law is not now in force on believers.

[Leviticus 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 7:28</span></span>

The priest who offered, was to have the breast and the right shoulder.
When the sacrifice was killed, the offerer himself must present God's
part of it; that he might signify his cheerfully giving it up to God. He
was with his own hands to lift it up, in token of his regard to God as
the God of heaven; and then to wave it to and fro, in token of his
regard to God as the Lord of the whole earth. Be persuaded and
encouraged to feed and feast upon Christ, our Peace-offering. This
blessed Peace-offering is not for the priests only, for saints of the
highest rank and greatest eminence, but for the common people also. Take
heed of delay. Many think to repent and return to God when they are
dying and dropping into hell; but they should eat the peace-offering,
and eat it now. Stay not till the day of the Lord's patience be run out,
for eating the third day will not be accepted, nor will catching at
Christ when thou art gone to hell!

[Leviticus 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 7:35</span></span>

Solemn acts of religious worship are not things which we may do or not
do at our pleasure; it is at our peril if we omit them. An observance of
the laws of Christ cannot be less necessary than of the laws of Moses.
