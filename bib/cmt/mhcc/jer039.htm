<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001">Jer 39:1-10</A>) The taking of Jerusalem.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011">Jer 39:11-14</A>) Jeremiah used well.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015">Jer 39:15-18</A>) Promises of safety to Ebed-melech. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001">Jeremiah 39:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 39:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Jerusalem was so strong, that the inhabitants believed the enemy could never enter it. But sin provoked God to withdraw his protection, and then it was as weak as other cities. Zedekiah had his eyes put out; so he was condemned to darkness who had shut his eyes against the clear light of God's word. Those who will not believe God's words, will be convinced by the event. Observe the wonderful changes of Providence, how uncertain are earthly possessions; and see the just dealings of Providence: but whether the Lord makes men poor or rich, nothing will profit them while they cleave to their sins. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011">Jeremiah 39:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 39:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The servants of God alone are prepared for all events; and they are delivered and comforted, while the wicked suffer. They often meet with more kindness from the profane, than from hypocritical professors of godliness. The Lord will raise them up friends, do them good, and perform all his promises. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015">Jeremiah 39:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 39:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Here is a message to assure Ebed-melech of a recompence for his great kindness to Jeremiah. Because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord. God recompenses men's services according to their principles. Those who trust God in the way of duty, as this good man did, will find that their hope shall not fail in times of the greatest danger.
