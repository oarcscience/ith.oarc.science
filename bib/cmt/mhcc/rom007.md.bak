### [Romans Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

Christ, that they may bring forth fruit unto God.

([Rom 7:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007).md) The use and excellence
of the law.

([Rom 7:14-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).md) The spiritual conflicts
between corruption and grace in a believer.

[Romans 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 7:1</span></span>

So long as a man continues under the law as a covenant, and seeks
justification by his own obedience, he continues the slave of sin in
some form. Nothing but the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, can make any
sinner free from the law of sin and death. Believers are delivered from
that power of the law, which condemns for the sins committed by them.
And they are delivered from that power of the law which stirs up and
provokes the sin that dwells in them. Understand this not of the law as
a rule, but as a covenant of works. In profession and privilege, we are
under a covenant of grace, and not under a covenant of works; under the
gospel of Christ, not under the law of Moses. The difference is spoken
of under the similitude or figure of being married to a new husband. The
second marriage is to Christ. By death we are freed from obligation to
the law as a covenant, as the wife is from her vows to her husband. In
our believing powerfully and effectually, we are dead to the law, and
have no more to do with it than the dead servant, who is freed from his
master, has to do with his master's yoke. The day of our believing, is
the day of being united to the Lord Jesus. We enter upon a life of
dependence on him, and duty to him. Good works are from union with
Christ; as the fruitfulness of the vine is the product of its being
united to its roots; there is no fruit to God, till we are united to
Christ. The law, and the greatest efforts of one under the law, still in
the flesh, under the power of corrupt principles, cannot set the heart
right with regard to the love of God, overcome worldly lusts, or give
truth and sincerity in the inward parts, or any thing that comes by the
special sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit. Nothing more than a
formal obedience to the outward letter of any precept, can be performed
by us, without the renewing, new-creating grace of the new covenant.

[Romans 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 7:7</span></span>

There is no way of coming to that knowledge of sin, which is necessary
to repentance, and therefore to peace and pardon, but by trying our
hearts and lives by the law. In his own case the apostle would not have
known the sinfulness of his thoughts, motives, and actions, but by the
law. That perfect standard showed how wrong his heart and life were,
proving his sins to be more numerous than he had before thought, but it
did not contain any provision of mercy or grace for his relief. He is
ignorant of human nature and the perverseness of his own heart, who does
not perceive in himself a readiness to fancy there is something
desirable in what is out of reach. We may perceive this in our children,
though self-love makes us blind to it in ourselves. The more humble and
spiritual any Christian is, the more clearly will he perceive that the
apostle describes the true believer, from his first convictions of sin
to his greatest progress in grace, during this present imperfect state.
St. Paul was once a Pharisee, ignorant of the spirituality of the law,
having some correctness of character, without knowing his inward
depravity. When the commandment came to his conscience by the
convictions of the Holy Spirit, and he saw what it demanded, he found
his sinful mind rise against it. He felt at the same time the evil of
sin, his own sinful state, that he was unable to fulfil the law, and was
like a criminal when condemned. But though the evil principle in the
human heart produces sinful motions, and the more by taking occasion of
the commandment; yet the law is holy, and the commandment holy, just,
and good. It is not favourable to sin, which it pursues into the heart,
and discovers and reproves in the inward motions thereof. Nothing is so
good but a corrupt and vicious nature will pervert it. The same heat
that softens wax, hardens clay. Food or medicine when taken wrong, may
cause death, though its nature is to nourish or to heal. The law may
cause death through man's depravity, but sin is the poison that brings
death. Not the law, but sin discovered by the law, was made death to the
apostle. The ruinous nature of sin, and the sinfulness of the human
heart, are here clearly shown.

[Romans 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 7:14</span></span>

Compared with the holy rule of conduct in the law of God, the apostle
found himself so very far short of perfection, that he seemed to be
carnal; like a man who is sold against his will to a hated master, from
whom he cannot set himself at liberty. A real Christian unwillingly
serves this hated master, yet cannot shake off the galling chain, till
his powerful and gracious Friend above, rescues him. The remaining evil
of his heart is a real and humbling hinderance to his serving God as
angels do and the spirits of just made perfect. This strong language was
the result of St. Paul's great advance in holiness, and the depth of his
self-abasement and hatred of sin. If we do not understand this language,
it is because we are so far beneath him in holiness, knowledge of the
spirituality of God's law, and the evil of our own hearts, and hatred of
moral evil. And many believers have adopted the apostle's language,
showing that it is suitable to their deep feelings of abhorrence of sin,
and self-abasement. The apostle enlarges on the conflict he daily
maintained with the remainder of his original depravity. He was
frequently led into tempers, words, or actions, which he did not approve
or allow in his renewed judgement and affections. By distinguishing his
real self, his spiritual part, from the self, or flesh, in which sin
dwelt, and by observing that the evil actions were done, not by him, but
by sin dwelling in him, the apostle did not mean that men are not
accountable for their sins, but he teaches the evil of their sins, by
showing that they are all done against reason and conscience. Sin
dwelling in a man, does not prove its ruling, or having dominion over
him. If a man dwells in a city, or in a country, still he may not rule
there.

[Romans 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 7:18</span></span>

The more pure and holy the heart is, it will have the more quick feeling
as to the sin that remains in it. The believer sees more of the beauty
of holiness and the excellence of the law. His earnest desires to obey,
increase as he grows in grace. But the whole good on which his will is
fully bent, he does not do; sin ever springing up in him, through
remaining corruption, he often does evil, though against the fixed
determination of his will. The motions of sin within grieved the
apostle. If by the striving of the flesh against the Spirit, was meant
that he could not do or perform as the Spirit suggested, so also, by the
effectual opposition of the Spirit, he could not do what the flesh
prompted him to do. How different this case from that of those who make
themselves easy with regard to the inward motions of the flesh prompting
them to evil; who, against the light and warning of conscience, go on,
even in outward practice, to do evil, and thus, with forethought, go on
in the road to perdition! For as the believer is under grace, and his
will is for the way of holiness, he sincerely delights in the law of
God, and in the holiness which it demands, according to his inward man;
that new man in him, which after God is created in true holiness.

[Romans 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 7:23</span></span>

This passage does not represent the apostle as one that walked after the
flesh, but as one that had it greatly at heart, not to walk so. And if
there are those who abuse this passage, as they also do the other
Scriptures, to their own destruction, yet serious Christians find cause
to bless God for having thus provided for their support and comfort. We
are not, because of the abuse of such as are blinded by their own lusts,
to find fault with the scripture, or any just and well warranted
interpretation of it. And no man who is not engaged in this conflict,
can clearly understand the meaning of these words, or rightly judge
concerning this painful conflict, which led the apostle to bemoan
himself as a wretched man, constrained to what he abhorred. He could not
deliver himself; and this made him the more fervently thank God for the
way of salvation revealed through Jesus Christ, which promised him, in
the end, deliverance from this enemy. So then, says he, I myself, with
my mind, my prevailing judgement, affections, and purposes, as a
regenerate man, by Divine grace, serve and obey the law of God; but with
the flesh, the carnal nature, the remains of depravity, I serve the law
of sin, which wars against the law of my mind. Not serving it so as to
live in it, or to allow it, but as unable to free himself from it, even
in his very best state, and needing to look for help and deliverance out
of himself. It is evident that he thanks God for Christ, as our
deliverer, as our atonement and righteousness in himself, and not
because of any holiness wrought in us. He knew of no such salvation, and
disowned any such title to it. He was willing to act in all points
agreeable to the law, in his mind and conscience, but was hindered by
indwelling sin, and never attained the perfection the law requires. What
can be deliverance for a man always sinful, but the free grace of God,
as offered in Christ Jesus? The power of Divine grace, and of the Holy
Spirit, could root out sin from our hearts even in this life, if Divine
wisdom had not otherwise thought fit. But it is suffered, that
Christians might constantly feel, and understand thoroughly, the
wretched state from which Divine grace saves them; might be kept from
trusting in themselves; and might ever hold all their consolation and
hope, from the rich and free grace of God in Christ.
