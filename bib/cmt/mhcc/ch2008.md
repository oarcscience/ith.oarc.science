### [2 Chronicles Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

Solomon's buildings and trade.

[2 Chronicles 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 8:1</span></span>

It sometimes requires more wisdom and resolution to govern a family in
the fear of God, than to govern a kingdom with reputation. The
difficulty is increased, when a man has a hinderance instead of a help
meet in the wife of his bosom. Solomon kept up the holy sacrifices,
according to the law of Moses. In vain had the altar been built, in vain
had fire come down from heaven, if sacrifices had not been constantly
brought. Spiritual sacrifices are required of us, which we are to bring
daily and weekly; it is good to be in a settled method of devotion. When
the service of the temple was put into good order, it is said, The house
of the Lord was perfected. The work was the main matter, not the place;
the temple was unfinished till all this was done. Canaan was a rich
country, and yet must send to Ophir for gold The Israelites were a wise
people, but must be beholden to the king of Tyre for men that had
knowledge of the seas. Grace, and not gold, is the best riches, and
acquaintance with God and his law, the best knowledge. Leaving the
children of this world to scramble for the toys of this world, may we,
as the children of God, lay up our treasure in heaven, that where our
treasure is, our hearts also may be.
