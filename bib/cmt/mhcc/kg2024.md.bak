### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 24:0</span></span>

([Kg2 24:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md) Jehoiakim subdued by
Nebuchadnezzar.

([Kg2 24:8-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008).md) Jehoiachin captive in
Babylon.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 24:1</span></span>

If Jehoiakim had served the Lord, he had not been servant to
Nebuchadnezzar. If he had been content with his servitude, and true to
his word, his condition had been no worse; but, rebelling against
Babylon, he plunged himself into more trouble. See what need nations
have to lament the sins of their fathers, lest they smart for them.
Threatenings will be fulfilled as certainly as promises, if the sinner's
repentance prevent not.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 24:8</span></span>

Jehoiachin reigned but three months, yet long enough to show that he
justly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he trod in their steps. His
uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of
the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings
before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them.
When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and
against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God
in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the
things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret
purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness
of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual
approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and
believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows
the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.
