[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 14:1</span></span>

Amaziah began well, but did not go on so. It is not enough to do that
which our pious predecessors did, merely to keep up the common usage,
but we must do it as they did, from the same principle of faith and
devotion, and with the same sincerity and resolution.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 14:8</span></span>

For some time after the division of the kingdoms, Judah suffered much
from the enmity of Israel. After Asa's time, it suffered more by the
friendship of Israel, and by the alliance made with them. Now we meet
with hostility between them again. How may a humble man smile to hear
two proud and scornful men set their wits on work, to vilify and
undervalue one another! Unholy success excites pride; pride excites
contentions. The effects of pride in others, are insufferable to those
who are proud themselves. These are the sources of trouble and sin in
private life; but when they arise between princes, they become the
misery of their whole kingdoms. Jehoash shows Amaziah the folly of his
challenge; Thine heart has lifted thee up. The root of all sin is in the
heart, thence it flows. It is not Providence, the event, the occasion,
whatever it is, that makes men proud, secure, discontented, or the like,
but their own hearts do it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 14:15</span></span>

Amaziah survived his conqueror fifteen years. He was slain by his own
subjects. Azariah, or Uzziah, seems to have been very young when his
father was slain. Though the years of his reign are reckoned from that
event, he was not fully made king till eleven years afterwards.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 14:23</span></span>

God raised up the prophet Jonah, and by him declared the purposes of his
favour to Israel. It is a sign that God has not cast off his people, if
he continues faithful ministers among them. Two reasons are given why
God blessed them with those victories: 1. Because the distress was very
great, which made them objects of his compassion. 2. Because the decree
was not yet gone forth for their destruction. Many prophets there had
been in Israel, but none left prophecies in writing till this age, and
their prophecies are part of the Bible. Hosea began to prophesy in the
reign of this Jeroboam. At the same time Amos prophesied; soon after
Micah, then Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah. Thus God, in the
darkest and most degenerate ages of the church, raised up some to be
burning and shining lights in it; to their own age, by their preaching
and living, and a few by their writings, to reflect light upon us in the
last times.
