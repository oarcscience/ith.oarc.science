### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 0:0</span></span>

In this book we have an account of Eli, and the wickedness of his sons;
also of Samuel, his character and actions. Then of the advancement of
Saul to be the king of Israel, and his ill behaviour, until his death
made way for David's succession to the throne, who was an eminent type
of Christ. David's patience, modesty, constancy, persecution by open
enemies and feigned friends, are a pattern and example to the church,
and to every member of it. Many things in this book encourage the faith,
hope, and patience of the suffering believer. It contains also many
useful cautions and awful warnings.
