### [Hosea Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 3:0</span></span>

The prophet enters into a new contract, representing the gracious manner
in which God will again restore Israel under a new covenant.

[Hosea 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 3:1</span></span>

The dislike of men to true religion is because they love objects and
forms, which allow them to indulge, instead of mortifying their lusts.
How wonderful that a holy God should have good-will to those whose
carnal mind is enmity against Him! Here is represented God's gracious
dealings with the fallen race of mankind, that had gone from him. This
is the covenant of grace he is willing to enter into with them, they
must be to him a people, and he will be to them a God. They must accept
the punishment of their sin, and must not return to folly. And it is a
certain sign that our afflictions are means of good to us, when we are
kept from being overcome by the temptations of an afflicted state.

[Hosea 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 3:4</span></span>

Here is the application of the parable to Israel. They must long sit
like a widow, stripped of all joys and honours; but shall at length be
received again. Those that would seek the Lord so as to find him, must
apply to Christ, and become his willing people. Not only are we to fear
the Lord and his greatness, but the Lord and his goodness; not only his
majesty, but his mercy. Even Jewish writers apply this passage to the
promised Messiah; doubtless it foretold their future conversion to
Christ, for which they are kept a separate people. Though the first fear
of God arise from a view of his holy majesty and righteous vengeance,
yet the experience of mercy and grace through Jesus Christ, will lead
the heart to reverence so kind and glorious a Friend and Father, and to
fear offending him.
