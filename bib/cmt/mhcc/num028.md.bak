### [Numbers Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 28:0</span></span>

([Num 28:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#001).md) Offerings, The daily
sacrifice.

([Num 28:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009).md) The offering on the
sabbath and new moons.

(v. 16-31) Offerings at the passover, and on the day of first-fruits.

[Numbers 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 28:1</span></span>

God saw fit now to repeat the law of sacrifices. This was a new
generation of men; and they were concerned to keep their peace with God
when at war with their enemies. The daily sacrifice is called a
continual burnt-offering; when we are bid to pray always, at least every
morning and evening we should offer up solemn prayers and praises to
God. Nothing is added here but that the wine poured out in the
drink-offering is to be strong wine, to teach us to serve God with the
best we have. It was a figure of the blood of Christ, the memorial of
which is still left to the church in wine; and of the blood of the
martyrs, which was poured out as a drink-offering on the sacrifice and
service of our faith, [Phi 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md).

[Numbers 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 28:9</span></span>

Every sabbath day, beside the two lambs offered for the daily
burnt-offering, there must be two more offered. This teaches us to
double our devotions on sabbath days, for so the duty of the day
requires. The sabbath rest is to be observed, in order more closely to
apply ourselves to the sabbath work, which ought to fill up the sabbath
time. The offerings in the new moons showed thankfulness for the
renewing of earthly blessings: when we rejoice in the gifts of
providence, we must make the sacrifice of Christ, that great gift of
special grace, the fountain and spring-head of our joy. And the worship
performed in the new moons is made typical of gospel solemnities, [Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023.md). As the moon borrows light from
the sun, and is renewed by its influences; so the church borrows her
light from Jesus Christ, who is the Sun of righteousness, renewing the
state of the church, especially under the gospel.

[Numbers 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 28:16</span></span>

By the sacrifices enjoined in this chapter, we are reminded of the
continued power of the sacrifice of Christ, and of our continual need to
depend thereon. No hurrying employments, or perilous situations, or
prosperous circumstances, should cause slackness in our religious
exercises; but should rather stir us up to greater diligence in seeking
help from, or giving thanks to the Lord. And all is to be accompanied
with repentance, faith is the Lord Jesus, and love to him, and to
produce true holiness in our conduct towards all men; otherwise God will
abhor our most solemn services and abundant devotions. And Christ is
able to supply the wants of every day, every week, every month, every
year, every ordinance, every case.
