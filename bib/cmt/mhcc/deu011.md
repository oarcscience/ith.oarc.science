### [Deuteronomy Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 11:0</span></span>

([Deu 11:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001)) The great work God
wrought for Israel.

([Deu 11:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#008)) Promises and
threatenings.

([Deu 11:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018)) Careful study of God's
word requisite.

([Deu 11:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#026)) The blessings and the
curse set forth.

[Deuteronomy 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 11:1</span></span>

Observe the connexion of these two; Thou shalt love the Lord, and keep
his charge. Love will work in obedience, and that only is acceptable
obedience which flows from a principle of love, [Jo1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003). Moses recounts some of the great
and terrible works of God which their eyes had seen. What our eyes have
seen, especially in our early days, should affect us, and make us better
long afterwards.

[Deuteronomy 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 11:8</span></span>

Moses sets before them, for the future, life and death, the blessing and
the curse, according as they did or did not keep God's commandment. Sin
tends to shorten the days of all men, and to shorten the days of a
people's prosperity. God will bless them with an abundance of all good
things, if they would love him and serve him. Godliness has the promise
of the life that now is; but the favour of God shall put gladness into
the heart, more than the increase of corn, and wine, and oil. Revolt
from God to idols would certainly be their ruin. Take heed that your
hearts be not deceived. All who forsake God to set their affection upon
any creature, will find themselves wretchedly deceived, to their own
destruction; and this will make it worse, that it was for want of taking
heed.

[Deuteronomy 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 11:18</span></span>

Let all be directed by the three rules here given. 1. Let our hearts be
filled with the word of God. There will not be good practices in the
life, unless there be good thoughts, good affections, and good
principles in the heart. 2. Let our eyes be fixed upon the word of God,
having constant regard to it as the guide of our way, as the rule of our
work, [Psa 119:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#030). 3. Let our tongues
be employed about the word of God. Nor will any thing do more to cause
prosperity, and keeping up religion in a nation, than the good education
of children.

[Deuteronomy 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 11:26</span></span>

Moses sums up all the arguments for obedience in two words, the blessing
and the curse. He charged the people to choose which they would have.
Moses then appointed a public and solemn proclamation of the blessing
and curse, to be made upon the two mountains of Gerizim and Ebal. We
have broken the law, and are under its curse, without remedy from
ourselves. In mercy, the gospel again sets before us a blessing and a
curse. A blessing, if we obey the call to repentance, to faith in
Christ, and newness of heart and life through him; an awful curse, if we
neglect so great salvation. Let us thankfully welcome these glad tidings
of great joy; and let us not harden our hearts, but hear this voice of
God while it is called to-day, and while he invites us to come to him
upon a mercy-seat. Let us be diligent to make our calling and election
sure.
