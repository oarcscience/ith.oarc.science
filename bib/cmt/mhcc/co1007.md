### [1 Corinthians Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co1 7:0</span></span>

([Co1 7:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001).md) The apostle answers
several questions about marriage.

([Co1 7:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010).md) Married Christians
should not seek to part from their unbelieving consorts.

([Co1 7:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017).md) Persons, in any fixed
station, should usually abide in that.

([Co1 7:25-35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025).md) It was most desirable,
on account of the then perilous days, for people to sit loose to this
world.

([Co1 7:36-40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#036).md) Great prudence be used
in marriage; it should be only in the Lord.

[1 Corinthians 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 7:1</span></span>

The apostle tells the Corinthians that it was good, in that juncture of
time, for Christians to keep themselves single. Yet he says that
marriage, and the comforts of that state, are settled by Divine wisdom.
Though none may break the law of God, yet that perfect rule leaves men
at liberty to serve him in the way most suited to their powers and
circumstances, of which others often are very unfit judges. All must
determine for themselves, seeking counsel from God how they ought to
act.

[1 Corinthians 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 7:10</span></span>

Man and wife must not separate for any other cause than what Christ
allows. Divorce, at that time, was very common among both Jews and
Gentiles, on very slight pretexts. Marriage is a Divine institution; and
is an engagement for life, by God's appointment. We are bound, as much
as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men, [Rom
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018.md), therefore to promote the peace
and comfort of our nearest relatives, though unbelievers. It should be
the labour and study of those who are married, to make each other as
easy and happy as possible. Should a Christian desert a husband or wife,
when there is opportunity to give the greatest proof of love? Stay, and
labour heartily for the conversion of thy relative. In every state and
relation the Lord has called us to peace; and every thing should be done
to promote harmony, as far as truth and holiness will permit.

[1 Corinthians 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 7:17</span></span>

The rules of Christianity reach every condition; and in every state a
man may live so as to be a credit to it. It is the duty of every
Christian to be content with his lot, and to conduct himself in his rank
and place as becomes a Christian. Our comfort and happiness depend on
what we are to Christ, not what we are in the world. No man should think
to make his faith or religion, an argument to break through any natural
or civil obligations. He should quietly and contentedly abide in the
condition in which he is placed by Divine Providence.

[1 Corinthians 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 7:25</span></span>

Considering the distress of those times, the unmarried state was best.
Notwithstanding, the apostle does not condemn marriage. How opposite are
those to the apostle Paul who forbid many to marry, and entangle them
with vows to remain single, whether they ought to do so or not! He
exhorts all Christians to holy indifference toward the world. As to
relations; they must not set their hearts on the comforts of the state.
As to afflictions; they must not indulge the sorrow of the world: even
in sorrow the heart may be joyful. As to worldly enjoyments; here is not
their rest. As to worldly employment; those that prosper in trade, and
increase in wealth, should hold their possessions as though they held
them not. As to all worldly concerns; they must keep the world out of
their hearts, that they may not abuse it when they have it in their
hands. All worldly things are show; nothing solid. All will be quickly
gone. Wise concern about worldly interests is a duty; but to be full of
care, to have anxious and perplexing care, is a sin. By this maxim the
apostle solves the case whether it were advisable to marry. That
condition of life is best for every man, which is best for his soul, and
keeps him most clear of the cares and snares of the world. Let us
reflect on the advantages and snares of our own condition in life; that
we may improve the one, and escape as far as possible all injury from
the other. And whatever cares press upon the mind, let time still be
kept for the things of the Lord.

[1 Corinthians 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">co1 7:36</span></span>

The apostle is thought to give advice here about the disposal of
children in marriage. In this view, the general meaning is plain.
Children should seek and follow the directions of their parents as to
marriage. And parents should consult their children's wishes; and not
reckon they have power to do with them, and dictate just as they please,
without reason. The whole is closed with advice to widows. Second
marriages are not unlawful, so that it is kept in mind, to marry in the
Lord. In our choice of relations, and change of conditions, we should
always be guided by the fear of God, and the laws of God, and act in
dependence on the providence of God. Change of condition ought only to
be made after careful consideration, and on probable grounds, that it
will be to advantage in our spiritual concerns.
