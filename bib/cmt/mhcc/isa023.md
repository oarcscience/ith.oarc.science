### [Isaiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 23:0</span></span>

([Isa 23:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001).md) The overthrow of Tyre.

([Isa 23:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015).md) It is established
again.

[Isaiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 23:1</span></span>

Tyre was the mart of the nations. She was noted for mirth and
diversions; and this made her loth to consider the warnings God gave by
his servants. Her merchants were princes, and lived like princes. Tyre
being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants should abandon her. Flee
to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place,
will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they
will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a
destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the
vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory. Let the ruin of Tyre warn
all places and persons to take heed of pride; for he who exalts himself
shall be abased. God will do it, who has all power in his hand; but the
Chaldeans shall be the instruments.

[Isaiah 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 23:15</span></span>

The desolations of Tyre were not to be for ever. The Lord will visit
Tyre in mercy. But when set at liberty, she will use her old arts of
temptation. The love of worldly wealth is spiritual idolatry; and
covetousness is spiritual idolatry. This directs those that have wealth,
to use it in the service of God. When we abide with God in our worldly
callings, when we do all in our power to further the gospel, then our
merchandise and hire are holiness to the Lord, if we look to his glory.
Christians should carry on business as God's servants, and use riches as
his stewards.
