<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001">Sa2 4:1-7</A>) Ishbosheth murdered.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008">Sa2 4:8-12</A>) David puts to death the murderers.

<p>See how Ishbosheth was murdered! When those difficulties dispirit us, which should sharpen our endeavours, we betray both our heavenly crowns and our earthly lives. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty and ruin. The idle soul is an easy prey to the destroyer. We know not when and where death will meet us. When we lie down to sleep, we are not sure that we may not sleep the sleep of death before we awake; nor do we know from what hand the death-blow may come. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa2 4:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A person may be glad to obtain his just wishes, and yet really regret the means by which he receives them. He may be sorry for the death of a person by which he is a gainer. These men shed innocent blood, from the basest motives. David justly executed vengeance upon them. He would not be beholden to any to help him by unlawful practices. God had helped him over many a difficulty, and through many a danger, therefore he depended upon him to crown and complete his own work. He speaks of his redemption from all adversity, as a thing done; though he had many storms yet before him, he knew that He who had delivered, would deliver.
