### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

([Sa2 1:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001).md) Tidings brought to David
of the death of Saul.

([Sa2 1:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#011).md) The Amalekite is put to
death.

([Sa2 1:17-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#017).md) David's lamentation for
Saul and Jonathan.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 1:1</span></span>

The blow which opened David's way to the throne was given about the time
he had been sorely distressed. Those who commit their concerns to the
Lord, will quietly abide his will. It shows that he desired not Saul's
death, and he was not impatient to come to the throne.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 1:11</span></span>

David was sincere in his mourning for Saul; and all with him humbled
themselves under the hand of God, laid so heavily upon Israel by this
defeat. The man who brought the tidings, David put to death, as a
murderer of his prince. David herein did not do unjustly; the Amalekite
confessed the crime. If he did as he said, he deserved to die for
treason; and his lying to David, if indeed it were a lie, proved, as
sooner or later that sin will prove, lying against himself. Hereby David
showed himself zealous for public justice, without regard to his own
private interest.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 1:17</span></span>

Kasheth, or "the bow," probably was the title of this mournful, funeral
song. David does not commend Saul for what he was not; and says nothing
of his piety or goodness. Jonathan was a dutiful son, Saul an
affectionate father, therefore dear to each other. David had reason to
say, that Jonathan's love to him was wonderful. Next to the love between
Christ and his people, that affection which springs form it, produces
the strongest friendship. The trouble of the Lord's people, and triumphs
of his enemies, will always grieve true believers, whatever advantages
they may obtain by them.
