### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 8:0</span></span>

([Sa1 8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001).md) The evil government of
Samuel's sons.

([Sa1 8:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#004).md) The Israelites ask for a
king.

([Sa1 8:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#010).md) The manner of a king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 8:1</span></span>

It does not appear that Samuel's sons were so profane and vicious as
Eli's sons; but they were corrupt judges, they turned aside after lucre.
Samuel took no bribes, but his sons did, and then they perverted
judgment. What added to the grievance of the people was, that they were
threatened by an invasion from Nahash, king of the Ammonites.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 8:4</span></span>

Samuel was displeased; he could patiently bear what reflected on
himself, and his own family; but it displeased him when they said, Give
us a king to judge us, because that reflected upon God. It drove him to
his knees. When any thing disturbs us, it is our interest, as well as
our duty, to show our trouble before God. Samuel is to tell them that
they shall have a king. Not that God was pleased with their request, but
as sometimes he opposes us from loving-kindness, so at other times he
gratifies us in wrath; he did so here. God knows how to bring glory to
himself, and serves his own wise purposes, even by men's foolish
counsels.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 8:10</span></span>

If they would have a king to rule them, as the eastern kings ruled their
subjects, they would find the yoke exceedingly heavy. Those that submit
to the government of the world and the flesh, are told plainly, what
hard masters they are, and what tyranny the dominion of sin is. The law
of God and the manner of men widely differ from each other; the former
should be our rule in the several relations of life; the latter should
be the measure of our expectations from others. These would be their
grievances, and, when they complained to God, he would not hear them.
When we bring ourselves into distress by our own wrong desires and
projects, we justly forfeit the comfort of prayer, and the benefit of
Divine aid. The people were obstinate and urgent in their demand. Sudden
resolves and hasty desires make work for long and leisurely repentance.
Our wisdom is, to be thankful for the advantages, and patient under the
disadvantages of the government we may live under; and to pray
continually for our rulers, that they may govern us in the fear of God,
and that we may live under them in all godliness and honesty. And it is
a hopeful symptom when our desires of worldly objects can brook delay;
and when we can refer the time and manner of their being granted to
God's providence.
