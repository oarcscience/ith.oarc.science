### [Ezekiel Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 27:0</span></span>

(v. 1-25) The merchandise of Tyre.

([Eze 27:26-36](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#026).md) Its fall and ruin.

[Ezekiel 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 27:1</span></span>

Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for
trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they
are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's
eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at
church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and
selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of
offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound
in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity
or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade
and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God.
Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by
custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are
apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power
to get wealth.

[Ezekiel 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 27:26</span></span>

The most mighty and magnificent kingdoms and states, sooner or later,
come down. Those who make creatures their confidence, and rest their
hopes upon them, will fall with them: happy are those who have the God
of Jacob for their Help, and whose hope is in the Lord their God, who
lives for ever. Those who engage in trade should learn to conduct their
business according to God's word. Those who possess wealth should
remember they are the Lord's stewards, and should use his goods in doing
good to all. Let us seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
