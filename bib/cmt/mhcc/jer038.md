### [Jeremiah Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 38:0</span></span>

([Jer 38:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001).md) Jeremiah is cast into a
dungeon, from whence he is delivered by an Ethiopian.

([Jer 38:14-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014).md) He advises the king to
surrender to the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 38:1</span></span>

Jeremiah went on in his plain preaching. The princes went on in their
malice. It is common for wicked people to look upon God's faithful
ministers as enemies, because they show what enemies the wicked are to
themselves while impenitent. Jeremiah was put into a dungeon. Many of
God's faithful witnesses have been privately made away in prisons.
Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian; yet he spoke to the king faithfully, These
men have done ill in all they have done to Jeremiah. See how God can
raise up friends for his people in distress. Orders were given for the
prophet's release, and Ebed-melech saw him drawn up. Let this encourage
us to appear boldly for God. Special notice is taken of his tenderness
for Jeremiah. What do we behold in the different characters then, but
the same we behold in the different characters now, that the Lord's
children are conformed to his example, and the children of Satan to
their master?

[Jeremiah 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 38:14</span></span>

Jeremiah was not forward to repeat the warnings, which seemed only to
endanger his own life, and to add to the king's guilt, but asked whether
he feared to do the will of God. The less men fear God, the more they
fear men; often they dare not act according to their own judgments and
consciences.
