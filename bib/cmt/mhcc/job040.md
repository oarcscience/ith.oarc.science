### [Job Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 40:0</span></span>

([Job 40:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001).md) Job humbles himself to
God.

([Job 40:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#006).md) The Lord reasons with
Job to show his righteousness, power, and wisdom.

([Job 40:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015).md) God's power shown in
Behemoth.

[Job 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 40:1</span></span>

Communion with the Lord effectually convinces and humbles a saint, and
makes him glad to part with his most beloved sins. There is need to be
thoroughly convinced and humbled, to prepare us for remarkable
deliverances. After God had shown Job, by his manifest ignorance of the
works of nature, how unable he was to judge of the methods and designs
of Providence, he puts a convincing question to him; Shall he that
contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? Now Job began to melt into
godly sorrow: when his friends reasoned with him, he did not yield; but
the voice of the Lord is powerful. When the Spirit of truth is come, he
shall convince. Job yields himself to the grace of God. He owns himself
an offender, and has nothing to say to justify himself. He is now
sensible that he has sinned; and therefore he calls himself vile.
Repentance changes men's opinion of themselves. Job is now convinced of
his error. Those who are truly sensible of their own sinfulness and
vileness, dare not justify themselves before God. He perceived that he
was a poor, mean, foolish, and sinful creature, who ought not to have
uttered one word against the Divine conduct. One glimpse of God's holy
nature would appall the stoutest rebel. How, then will the wicked bear
the sight of his glory at the day of judgment? But when we see this
glory revealed in Jesus Christ, we shall be humbled without being
terrified; self-abasement agrees with filial love.

[Job 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 40:6</span></span>

Those who profit by what they have heard from God, shall hear more from
him. And those who are truly convinced of sin, yet need to be more
thoroughly convinced and more humbled. No doubt God, and he only, has
power to humble and bring down proud men; he has wisdom to know when and
how to do it, and it is not for us to teach him how to govern the world.
Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace, much
less rescuing us from his justice; and therefore into his hand we must
commit ourselves. The renewal of a believer proceeds in the same way of
conviction, humbling, and watchfulness against remaining sin, as his
first conversion. When convinced of many evils in our conduct, we still
need convincing of many more.

[Job 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 40:15</span></span>

God, for the further proving of his own power, describes two vast
animals, far exceeding man in bulk and strength. Behemoth signifies
beasts. Most understand it of an animal well known in Egypt, called the
river-horse, or hippopotamus. This vast animal is noticed as an argument
to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created this vast
animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whatever strength
this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. He that made the
soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make the sword of
justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it. Every godly man has
spiritual weapons, the whole armour of God, to resist, yea, to overcome
the tempter, that his never-dying soul may be safe, whatever becomes of
his frail flesh and mortal body.
