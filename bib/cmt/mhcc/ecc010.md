### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 10:0</span></span>

([Ecc 10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001)) To preserve a character
for wisdom.

([Ecc 10:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004)) Respecting subjects and
rulers.

([Ecc 10:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011)) Of foolish talk.

([Ecc 10:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016)) Duties of rulers and
subjects.

[Ecclesiastes 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 10:1</span></span>

Those especially who make a profession of religion, should keep from all
appearances of evil. A wise man has great advantage over a fool, who is
always at a loss when he has anything to do. Sin is the reproach of
sinners, wherever they go, and shows their folly.

[Ecclesiastes 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 10:4</span></span>

Solomon appears to caution men not to seek redress in a hasty manner,
nor to yield to pride and revenge. Do not, in a passion, quit thy post
of duty; wait awhile, and thou wilt find that yielding pacifies great
offences. Men are not preferred according to their merit. And those are
often most forward to offer help, who are least aware of the
difficulties, or the consequences. The same remark is applied to the
church, or the body of Christ, that all the members should have the same
care one for another.

[Ecclesiastes 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 10:11</span></span>

There is a practice in the East, of charming serpents by music. The
babbler's tongue is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison; and
contradiction only makes it the more violent. We must find the way to
keep him gentle. But by rash, unprincipled, or slanderous talk, he
brings open or secret vengeance upon himself. Would we duly consider our
own ignorance as to future events, it would cut off many idle words
which we foolishly multiply. Fools toil a great deal to no purpose. They
do not understand the plainest things, such as the entrance into a great
city. But it is the excellency of the way to the heavenly city, that it
is a high-way, in which the simplest wayfaring men shall not err, [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008). But sinful folly makes men miss
that only way to happiness.

[Ecclesiastes 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 10:16</span></span>

The happiness of a land depends on the character of its rulers. The
people cannot be happy when their princes are childish, and lovers of
pleasure. Slothfulness is of ill consequence both to private and public
affairs. Money, of itself, will neither feed nor clothe, though it
answers the occasions of this present life, as what is to be had, may
generally be had for money. But the soul, as it is not redeemed, so it
is not maintained with corruptible things, as silver and gold. God sees
what men do, and hears what they say in secret; and, when he pleases,
brings it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. If there be hazard
in secret thoughts and whispers against earthly rulers, what must be the
peril from every deed, word, or thought of rebellion against the King of
kings, and Lord of lords! He seeth in secret. His ear is ever open.
Sinner! curse not THIS KING in thy inmost thought. Your curses cannot
affect Him; but his curse, coming down upon you, will sink you to the
lowest hell.
