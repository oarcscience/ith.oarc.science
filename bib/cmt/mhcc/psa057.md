### [Psalms Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 57:0</span></span>

([Psa 57:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001).md) David begins with prayer
and complaint.

([Psa 57:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007).md) He concludes with joy
and praise.

[Psalms 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 57:1</span></span>

All David's dependence is upon God. The most eminent believers need
often repeat the publican's prayer, "God be merciful to me a sinner."
But if our souls trust in the Lord, this may assure us, in our utmost
dangers, that our calamities will at length be overpast, and in the mean
time, by faith and prayer, we must make him our refuge. Though God be
most high, yet he condescends so low, as to take care that all things
are made to work for good to his people. This is a good reason why we
should pray earnestly. Look which way we will on this earth, refuge
fails, no help appears; but we may look for it from heaven. If we have
fled from the wrath to come, unto Jesus Christ, he that performed all
things needful to purchase the salvation of his people, will do for us
and in us all things needful for our enjoyment of it. It made David
droop to think there should be those that bore him so much ill-will. But
the mischief they designed against him, returned on themselves. And when
David was in the greatest distress and disgrace, he did not pray, Lord,
exalt me, but, Lord, exalt thine own name. Our best encouragement in
prayer, is taken from the glory of God, and to that, more than to our
own comfort, we should have regard in all our petitions for mercy.

[Psalms 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 57:7</span></span>

By lively faith, David's prayers and complaints are at once turned into
praises. His heart is fixed; it is prepared for every event, being
stayed upon God. If by the grace of God we are brought into this even,
composed frame of mind, we have great reason to be thankful. Nothing is
done to purpose, in religion, unless it is done with the heart. The
heart must be fixed for the duty, put in frame for it; fixed in the duty
by close attention. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when
praising God; dull and sleepy devotions will never be acceptable to God.
Let us awake early in the morning, to begin the day with God; early in
the beginning of a mercy. When God comes toward us with his favours, let
us go forth to meet him with our praises. David desired to bring others
to join in praising God; and in his psalms, he is still praising God
among the people, singing to Him among the nations. Let us seek to have
our hearts fixed to praise his boundless mercy and unfailing
faithfulness; and to glorify him with body, soul, and spirit, which are
his. Let us earnestly pray that the blessings of the gospel may be sent
through every land.
