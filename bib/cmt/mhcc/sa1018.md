### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 18:0</span></span>

([Sa1 18:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001).md) Jonathan's friendship
for David.

([Sa1 18:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006).md) Saul seeks to kill
David.

(v. 12-30) Saul's fear of David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 18:1</span></span>

The friendship of David and Jonathan was the effect of Divine grace,
which produces in true believers one heart and one soul, and causes them
to love each other. This union of souls is from partaking in the Spirit
of Christ. Where God unites hearts, carnal matters are too weak to
separate them. Those who love Christ as their own souls, will be willing
to join themselves to him in an everlasting covenant. It was certainly a
great proof of the power of God's grace in David, that he was able to
bear all this respect and honour, without being lifted up above measure.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 18:6</span></span>

David's troubles not only immediately follow his triumphs, but arise
from them; such is the vanity of that which seems greatest in this
world. It is a sign that the Spirit of God is departed from men, if,
like Saul, they are peevish, envious, suspicious, and ill-natured.
Compare David, with his harp in his hand, aiming to serve Saul, and
Saul, with his javelin in his hand, aiming to slay David; and observe
the sweetness and usefulness of God's persecuted people, and the
barbarity of their persecutors. But David's safety must be ascribed to
God's providence.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 18:12</span></span>

For a long time David was kept in continual apprehension of falling by
the hand of Saul, yet he persevered in meek and respectful behaviour
towards his persecutor. How uncommon is such prudence and discretion,
especially under insults and provocations! Let us inquire if we imitate
this part of the exemplary character before us. Are we behaving wisely
in all our ways? Is there no sinful omission, no rashness of spirit,
nothing wrong in our conduct? Opposition and perverseness in others,
will not excuse wrong tempers in us, but should increase our care, and
attention to the duties of our station. Consider Him that endured
contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in
your minds, [Heb 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003.md). If David
magnified the honour of being son-in-law to king Saul, how should we
magnify the honour of being sons to the King of kings!
