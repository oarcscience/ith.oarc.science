### [Jeremiah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 13:0</span></span>

([Jer 13:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001).md) The glory of the Jews
should be marred.

([Jer 13:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#012).md) All ranks should
suffer misery, An earnest exhortation to repentance.

([Jer 13:18-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#018).md) An awful message to
Jerusalem and its king.

[Jeremiah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 13:1</span></span>

It was usual with the prophets to teach by signs. And we have the
explanation, [Jer 13:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#009.md). The people
of Israel had been to God as this girdle. He caused them to cleave to
him by the law he gave them, the prophets he sent among them, and the
favours he showed them. They had by their idolatries and sins buried
themselves in foreign earth, mingled among the nations, and were so
corrupted that they were good for nothing. If we are proud of learning,
power, and outward privileges, it is just with God to wither them. The
minds of men should be awakened to a sense of their guilt and danger;
yet nothing will be effectual without the influences of the Spirit.

[Jeremiah 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 13:12</span></span>

As the bottle was fitted to hold the wine, so the sins of the people
made them vessels of wrath, fitted for the judgments of God; with which
they should be filled till they caused each other's destruction. The
prophet exhorts them to give glory to God, by confessing their sins,
humbling themselves in repentance, and returning to his service.
Otherwise they would be carried into other countries in all the darkness
of idolatry and wickedness. All misery, witnessed or foreseen, will
affect a feeling mind, but the pious heart must mourn most over the
afflictions of the Lord's flock.

[Jeremiah 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 13:18</span></span>

Here is a message sent to king Jehoiakim, and his queen. Their sorrows
would be great indeed. Do they ask, Wherefore come these things upon us?
Let them know, it is for their obstinacy in sin. We cannot alter the
natural colour of the skin; and so is it morally impossible to reclaim
and reform these people. Sin is the blackness of the soul; it is the
discolouring of it; we were shapen in it, so that we cannot get clear of
it by any power of our own. But Almighty grace is able to change the
Ethiopian's skin. Neither natural depravity, nor strong habits of sin,
form an obstacle to the working of God, the new-creating Spirit. The
Lord asks of Jerusalem, whether she is determined not be made clean. If
any poor slave of sin feels that he could as soon change his nature as
master his headstrong lusts, let him not despair; for things impossible
to men are possible with God. Let us then seek help from Him who is
mighty to save.
