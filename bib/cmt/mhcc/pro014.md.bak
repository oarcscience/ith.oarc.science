### [Proverbs Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 14:1</span></span>

A woman who has no fear of God, who is wilful and wasteful, and indulges
her ease, will as certainly ruin her family, as if she plucked her house
down.

[Proverbs 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 14:2</span></span>

Here are grace and sin in their true colours. Those that despise God's
precepts and promises, despise God and all his power and mercy.

[Proverbs 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 14:3</span></span>

Pride grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart. The root
must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch. The prudent words
of wise men get them out of difficulties.

[Proverbs 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 14:4</span></span>

There can be no advantage without something which, though of little
moment, will affright the indolent.

[Proverbs 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 14:5</span></span>

A conscientious witness will not dare to represent anything otherwise
than according to his knowledge.

[Proverbs 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 14:6</span></span>

A scorner treats Divine things with contempt. He that feels his
ignorance and unworthiness will search the Scriptures in a humble
spirit.

[Proverbs 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 14:7</span></span>

We discover a wicked man if there is no savour of piety in his
discourse.

[Proverbs 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 14:8</span></span>

We are travellers, whose concern is, not to spy out wonders, but to get
to their journey's end; to understand the rules we are to walk by, also
the ends we are to walk toward. The bad man cheats himself, and goes on
in his mistake.

[Proverbs 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 14:9</span></span>

Foolish and profane men consider sin a mere trifle, to be made light of
rather than mourned over. Fools mock at the sin-offering; but those that
make light of sin, make light of Christ.

[Proverbs 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 14:10</span></span>

We do not know what stings of conscience, or consuming passions, torment
the prosperous sinner. Nor does the world know the peace of mind a
serious Christian enjoys, even in poverty and sickness.

[Proverbs 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 14:11</span></span>

Sin ruins many great families; whilst righteousness often raises and
strengthens even mean families.

[Proverbs 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 14:12</span></span>

The ways of carelessness, of worldliness, and of sensuality, seem right
to those that walk in them; but self-deceivers prove self-destroyers.
See the vanity of carnal mirth.

[Proverbs 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 14:14</span></span>

Of all sinners backsliders will have the most terror when they reflect
on their own ways.

[Proverbs 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 14:15</span></span>

Eager readiness to believe what others say, has ever proved mischievous.
The whole world was thus ruined at first. The man who is spiritually
wise, depends on the Saviour alone for acceptance. He is watchful
against the enemies of his salvation, by taking heed to God's word.

[Proverbs 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#016.md)

[Proverbs 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 14:17</span></span>

An angry man is to be pitied as well as blamed; but the revengeful is
more hateful.

[Proverbs 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#018.md)

Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people.

[Proverbs 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 14:20</span></span>

Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have
God our Friend; he will not desert us.

[Proverbs 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 14:21</span></span>

[Proverbs 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#022.md)

if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to
nothing.

An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring
truth to light.

[Proverbs 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 14:26</span></span>

Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong
ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this
Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death.

[Proverbs 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 14:32</span></span>

has given them.

tempers.
