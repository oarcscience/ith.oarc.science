### [Ezekiel Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 30:0</span></span>

(v. 1-19) A prophecy against Egypt.

([Eze 30:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020)) Another.

[Ezekiel 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 30:1</span></span>

The prophecy of the destruction of Egypt is very full. Those who take
their lot with God's enemies, shall be with them in punishment. The king
of Babylon and his army shall be instruments of this destruction. God
often makes one wicked man a scourge to another. No place in the land of
Egypt shall escape the fury of the Chaldeans. The Lord is known by the
judgments he executes. Yet these are only present effects of the Divine
displeasure, not worthy of our fear, compared with the wrath to come,
from which Jesus delivers his people.

[Ezekiel 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 30:20</span></span>

Egypt shall grow weaker and weaker. If lesser judgments do not prevail
to humble and reform sinners, God will send greater. God justly breaks
that power which is abused, either to put wrongs upon people, or to put
cheats upon them. Babylon shall grow stronger. In vain do men endeavour
to bind up the arm the Lord is pleased to break, and to strengthen those
whom he will bring down. Those who disregard the discoveries of his
truth and mercy, shall know his power and justice, in the punishment for
their sins.
