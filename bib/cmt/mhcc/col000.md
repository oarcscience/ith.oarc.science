[Colossians](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md)

This epistle was sent because of some difficulties which arose among the
Colossians, probably from false teachers, in consequence of which they
sent to the apostle. The scope of the epistle is to show, that all hope
of man's redemption is founded on Christ, in whom alone are all complete
fulness, perfections, and sufficiency. The Colossians are cautioned
against the devices of judaizing teachers, and also against the notions
of carnal wisdom, and human inventions and traditions, as not consistent
with full reliance on Christ. In the first two chapters the apostle
tells them what they must believe, and in the two last what they must
do; the doctrine of faith, and the precepts of life for salvation.
