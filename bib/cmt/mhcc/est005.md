### [Esther Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 5:0</span></span>

([Est 5:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001)) Esther's application
received.

([Est 5:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009)) Haman prepares to hang
Mordecai.

[Esther 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 5:1</span></span>

Esther having had power with God, and prevailing, like Jacob, had power
with men too. He that will lose his life for God, shall save it, or find
it in a better life. The king encouraged her. Let us from this be
encouraged to pray always to our God, and not to faint. Esther came to a
proud, imperious man; but we come to the God of love and grace. She was
not called, but we are; the Spirit says, Come, and the Bride says, Come.
She had a law against her, we have a promise, many a promise, in favour
of us; Ask, and it shall be given you. She had no friend to go with her,
or to plead for her; on the contrary, he that was then the king's
favourite, was her enemy; but we have an Advocate with the Father, in
whom he is well pleased. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of
grace. God put it into Esther's heart to delay her petition a day
longer; she knew not, but God did, what was to happen in that very
night.

[Esther 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 5:9</span></span>

This account of Haman is a comment upon [Pro
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024). Self-admirers and
self-flatterers are really self-deceivers. Haman, the higher he is
lifted up, the more impatient he is of contempt, and the more enraged at
it. The affront from Mordecai spoiled all. A slight affront, which a
humble man would scarcely notice, will torment a proud man, even to
madness, and will mar all his comforts. Those disposed to be uneasy,
will never want something to be uneasy at. Such are proud men; though
they have much to their mind, if they have not all to their mind, it is
as nothing to them. Many call the proud happy, who display pomp and make
a show; but this is a mistaken thought. Many poor cottagers feel far
less uneasiness than the rich, with all their fancied advantages around
them. The man who knows not Christ, is poor though he be rich, because
he is utterly destitute of that which alone is true riches.
