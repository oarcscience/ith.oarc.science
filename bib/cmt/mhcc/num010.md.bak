### [Numbers Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001.md)

Here are directions concerning the public notices to be given the people
by sound of trumpet. Their laws in every case were to be Divine,
therefore, even in this matter Moses is directed. These trumpets typify
the preached gospel. It sounds an alarm to sinners, calls them to
repent, proclaims liberty to the captives and slaves of Satan, and
collects the worshippers of God. It directs and encourages their
heavenly journey; stirs them up to combat against the world and sin,
encouraging them with the assurance of victory. It leads their attention
to the sacrifice of Christ, and shows the Lord's presence for their
protection. It is also necessary that the gospel trumpet give a distinct
sound, according to the persons addressed, or the end proposed; whether
to convince, humble, console, exhort, reprove, or teach. The sounding of
the trumpet of the gospel is God's ordinance, and demands the attention
of all to whom it is sent.

[Numbers 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 10:11</span></span>

After the Israelites had continued nearly a year at mount Sinai, and all
was settled respecting their future worship, they began their march to
Canaan. True religion begins with the knowledge of the holy law of God,
and humiliation for sin, but we must go on towards perfection, in
acquaintance with Christ and his gospel, and those effectual
encouragements, motives, and assistances to holiness, which it proposes.
They took their journey according to the commandment of the Lord, [Deu
1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#006.md), and as the cloud led them.
Those who give themselves to the direction of God's word and Spirit,
steer a steady course, even when they seem bewildered. While they are
sure they cannot lose their God and Guide, they need not fear losing
their way. They went out of the wilderness of Sinai, and rested in the
wilderness of Paran. All our removes in this world are but from one
wilderness to another. The changes we think will be for the better do
not always prove so. We shall never be at rest, never at home, till we
come to heaven, but all will be well there.

[Numbers 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 10:29</span></span>

Moses invites his kindred to go to Canaan. Those that are bound for the
heavenly Canaan, should ask and encourage their friends to go with them:
we shall have none the less of the joys of heaven, for others coming to
share with us. It is good having fellowship with those who have
fellowship with God. But the things of this world, which are seen, draw
strongly from the pursuit of the things of the other world, which are
not seen. Moses urges that Hobab might be serviceable to them. Not to
show where they must encamp, nor what way they must march, the cloud was
to direct that; but to show the conveniences of the place they marched
through, and encamped in. It well consists with our trust in God's
providence, to use the help of our friends.

[Numbers 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 10:33</span></span>

Their going out and coming in, gives an example to us to begin and end
every day's journey and every day's work with prayer. Here is Moses's
prayer when the ark set forward, "Rise up, and let thine enemies be
scattered." There are those in the world who are enemies to God and
haters of him; secret and open enemies; enemies to his truths, his laws,
his ordinances, his people. But for the scattering and defeating of
God's enemies, there needs no more than God's arising. Observe also the
prayer of Moses when the ark rested, that God would cause his people to
rest. The welfare and happiness of the Israel of God, consist in the
continual presence of God among them. Their safety is not in their
numbers, but in the favour of God, and his gracious return to them, and
resting with them. Upon this account, Happy art thou, O Israel! who is
like unto thee, O people! God will go before them, to find them
resting-places by the way. His promise is, and their prayers are, that
he will never leave them nor forsake them.
