### [Revelation Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001.md)

[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 9:0</span></span>

([Rev 9:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001).md) The fifth trumpet is
followed by a representation of another star as falling from heaven and
opening the bottomless pit, out of which come swarms of locusts.

([Rev 9:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#013).md) The sixth trumpet is
followed by the loosing of four angels bound in the great river
Euphrates.

[Revelation 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 9:1</span></span>

Upon sounding the fifth trumpet, a star fell from heaven to the earth.
Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by this
star becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers of
hell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomless
pit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs by
blinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, and
promoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm of
locusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition,
idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the true
believers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But a
secret poison and infection in the soul, should rob many others of
purity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt those
who had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace will
keep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited to a
short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithful
share the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they might
and would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were to
try and prove the Christians, [Co1
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019.md). And early writers plainly refer
this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread the Christian
church.

[Revelation 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 9:13</span></span>

The sixth angel sounded, and here the power of the Turks seems the
subject. Their time is limited. They not only slew in war, but brought a
poisonous and ruinous religion. The antichristian generation repented
not under these dreadful judgments. From this sixth trumpet learn that
God can make one enemy of the church a scourge and a plague to another.
The idolatry in the remains of the eastern church and elsewhere, and the
sins of professed Christians, render this prophecy and its fulfilment
more wonderful. And the attentive reader of Scripture and history, may
find his faith and hope strengthened by events, which in other respects
fill his heart with anguish and his eyes with tears, while he sees that
men who escape these plagues, repent not of their evil works, but go on
with idolatries, wickedness, and cruelty, till wrath comes upon them to
the utmost.
