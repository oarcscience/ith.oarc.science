### [Jeremiah Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 49:0</span></span>

([Jer 49:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001)) Prophecies relative to
the Ammonites.

(v. 7-22) The Edomites.

([Jer 49:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023)) The Syrians.

([Jer 49:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028)) The Kedarenes.

([Jer 49:34-39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034)) The Elamites.

[Jeremiah 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 49:1</span></span>

Might often prevails against right among men, yet that might shall be
controlled by the Almighty, who judges aright; and those will find
themselves mistaken, who, like the Ammonites, think every thing their
own on which they can lay their hands. The Lord will call men to account
for every instance of dishonesty, especially to the destitute.

[Jeremiah 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 49:7</span></span>

The Edomites were old enemies to the Israel of God. But their day is now
at hand; it is foretold, not only to warn them, but for the sake of the
Israel of God, whose afflictions were aggravated by them. Thus Divine
judgments go round from nation to nation; the earth is full of
commotion, and nothing can escape the ministers of Divine vengeance. The
righteousness of God is to be observed amidst the violence of men.

[Jeremiah 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 49:23</span></span>

How easily God can dispirit those nations that have been most celebrated
for valour! Damascus waxes feeble. It was a city of joy, having all the
delights of the sons of men. But those deceive themselves who place
their happiness in carnal joys.

[Jeremiah 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 49:28</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar would make desolation among the people of Kedar, who
dwelt in the deserts of Arabia. He who conquered many strong cities,
will not leave those unconquered that dwell in tents. He will do this to
gratify his own covetousness and ambition; but God orders it for
correcting an unthankful people, and for warning a careless world to
expect trouble when they seem most safe. They shall flee, get far off,
and dwell deep in the deserts; they shall be dispersed. But privacy and
obscurity are not always protection and security.

[Jeremiah 49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 49:34</span></span>

The Elamites were the Persians; they acted against God's Israel, and
must be reckoned with. Evil pursues sinners. God will make them know
that he reigns. Yet the destruction of Elam shall not be for ever. But
this promise was to have its full accomplishment in the days of the
Messiah. In reading the Divine assurance of the destruction of all the
enemies of the church, the believer sees that the issue of the holy war
is not doubtful. It is blessed to recollect, that He who is for us, is
more than all against us. And he will subdue the enemies of our souls.
