### [Exodus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 27:0</span></span>

([Exo 27:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)) The altar of burnt
offerings.

([Exo 27:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009)) The court of the
tabernacle.

([Exo 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020), [Exo
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021)) The oil for the lamps.

[Exodus 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 27:1</span></span>

In the court before the tabernacle, where the people attended, was an
altar, to which they must bring their sacrifices, and on which their
priests must offer them to God. It was of wood overlaid with brass. A
grate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middle of
which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made of
net-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fall
through. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement
for our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if it
had not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christ
have borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divine
power.

[Exodus 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 27:9</span></span>

The tabernacle was enclosed in a court, about sixty yards long and
thirty broad, formed by curtains hung upon brazen pillars, fixed in
brazen sockets. Within this enclosure the priests and Levites offered
the sacrifices, and thither the Jewish people were admitted. These
distinctions represented the difference between the visible nominal
church, and the true spiritual church, which alone has access to God,
and communion with him.

[Exodus 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 27:20</span></span>

The pure oil signified the gifts and graces of the Spirit, which all
believers receive from Christ, the good Olive, and without which our
light cannot shine before men. The priests were to light the lamps, and
tend them. It is the work of ministers, by preaching and expounding the
Scriptures, which are as a lamp, to enlighten the church, God's
tabernacle upon earth. Blessed be God, this light is not now confined to
the Jewish tabernacle, but is a light to lighten the gentiles, and for
salvation unto the ends of the earth.
