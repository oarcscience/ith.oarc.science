### [Daniel Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 10:0</span></span>

([Dan 10:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001).md) Daniel's vision near the
river Hiddekel.

([Dan 10:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010).md) He is to expect a
discovery of future events.

[Daniel 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md)

This chapter relates the beginning of Daniel's last vision, which is
continued to the end of the book. The time would be long before all
would be accomplished; and much of it is not yet fulfilled. Christ
appeared to Daniel in a glorious form, and it should engage us to think
highly and honourably of him. Let us admire his condescension for us and
our salvation. There remained no strength in Daniel. The greatest and
best of men cannot bear the full discoveries of the Divine glory; for no
man can see it, and live; but glorified saints see Christ as he is, and
can bear the sight. How dreadful soever Christ may appear to those under
convictions of sin, there is enough in his word to quiet their spirits.

[Daniel 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 10:10</span></span>

Whenever we enter into communion with God, it becomes us to have a due
sense of the infinite distance between us and the holy God. How shall
we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more
likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the
saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first
day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us
in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel
had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose
the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are
employed as God's ministering servants, [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md). Though much was done against the
Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would
have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show
what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and
we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth,
for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels,
and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we
may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act
against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in
this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and
let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt
be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of
judgment, and for evermore.
