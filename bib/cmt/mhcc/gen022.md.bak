[Genesis 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 22:1</span></span>

We never are secure from trials In Hebrew, to tempt, and to try, or to
prove, are expressed by the same word. Every trial is indeed a
temptation, and tends to show the dispositions of the heart, whether
holy or unholy. But God proved Abraham, not to draw him to sin, as Satan
tempts. Strong faith is often exercised with strong trials, and put upon
hard services. The command to offer up his son, is given in such
language as makes the trial more grievous; every word here is a sword.
Observe, 1. The person to be offered: Take thy son; not thy bullocks and
thy lambs. How willingly would Abraham have parted with them all to
redeem Isaac! Thy son; not thy servant. Thine only son; thine only son
by Sarah. Take Isaac, that son whom thou lovest. 2. The place: three
days' journey off; so that Abraham might have time to consider, and
might deliberately obey. 3. The manner: Offer him for a burnt-offering;
not only kill his son, his Isaac, but kill him as a sacrifice; kill him
with all that solemn pomp and ceremony, with which he used to offer his
burnt-offerings.

[Genesis 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 22:3</span></span>

Never was any gold tried in so hot a fire. Who but Abraham would not
have argued with God? Such would have been the thought of a weak heart;
but Abraham knew that he had to do with a God, even Jehovah. Faith had
taught him not to argue, but to obey. He is sure that what God commands
is good; that what he promises cannot be broken. In matters of God,
whoever consults with flesh and blood, will never offer up his Isaac to
God. The good patriarch rises early, and begins his sad journey. And now
he travels three days, and Isaac still is in his sight! Misery is made
worse when long continued. The expression, We will come again to you,
shows that Abraham expected that Isaac, being raised from the dead,
would return with him. It was a very affecting question that Isaac asked
him, as they were going together: "My father," said Isaac; it was a
melting word, which, one would think, should strike deeper in the heart
of Abraham, than his knife could in the heart of Isaac. Yet he waits for
his son's question. Then Abraham, where he meant not, prophesies: "My
son, God will provide a lamb for a burnt-offering." The Holy Spirit, by
his mouth, seems to predict the Lamb of God, which he has provided, and
which taketh away the sin of the world. Abraham lays the wood in order
for his Isaac's funeral pile, and now tells him the amazing news: Isaac,
thou art the lamb which God has provided! Abraham, no doubt, comforting
him with the same hopes with which he himself by faith was comforted.
Yet it is necessary that the sacrifice be bound. The great Sacrifice,
which, in the fulness of time, was to be offered up, must be bound, and
so must Isaac. This being done, Abraham takes the knife, and stretches
out his hand to give the fatal blow. Here is an act of faith and
obedience, which deserves to be a spectacle to God, angels, and men.
God, by his providence, calls us to part with an Isaac sometimes, and we
must do it with cheerful submission to his holy will, [Sa1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#018.md).

[Genesis 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 22:11</span></span>

It was not God's intention that Isaac should actually be sacrificed, yet
nobler blood than that of animals, in due time, was to be shed for sin,
even the blood of the only begotten Son of God. But in the mean while
God would not in any case have human sacrifices used. Another sacrifice
is provided. Reference must be had to the promised Messiah, the blessed
Seed. Christ was sacrificed in our stead, as this ram instead of Isaac,
and his death was our discharge. And observe, that the temple, the place
of sacrifice, was afterwards built upon this same mount Moriah; and
Calvary, where Christ was crucified, was near. A new name was given to
that place, for the encouragement of all believers, to the end of the
world, cheerfully to trust in God, and obey him. Jehovah-jireh, the Lord
will provide; probably alluding to what Abraham had said, God will
provide himself a lamb. The Lord will always have his eye upon his
people, in their straits and distresses, that he may give them
seasonable help.

[Genesis 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 22:15</span></span>

There are high declarations of God's favour to Abraham in this
confirmation of the covenant with him, exceeding any he had yet been
blessed with. Those that are willing to part with any thing for God,
shall have it made up to them with unspeakable advantage. The promise,
[Gen 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md), doubtless points at the
Messiah, and the grace of the gospel. Hereby we know the loving-kindness
of God our Saviour towards sinful man, in that he hath not withheld his
Son, his only Son, from us. Hereby we perceive the love of Christ, in
that he gave himself a sacrifice for our sins. Yet he lives, and calls
to sinners to come to him, and partake of his blood-bought salvation. He
calls to his redeemed people to rejoice in him, and to glorify him. What
then shall we render for all his benefits? Let his love constrain us to
live not to ourselves, but to Him who died for us, and rose again.
Admiring and adoring His grace, let us devote our all to his service,
who laid down his life for our salvation. Whatever is dearest to us upon
earth is our Isaac. And the only way for us to find comfort in an
earthly thing, is to give it by faith into the hands of God. Yet
remember that Abraham was not justified by his readiness to obey, but by
the infinitely more noble obedience of Jesus Christ; his faith receiving
this, relying on this, rejoicing in this, disposed and made him able for
such wonderful self-denial and duty.

[Genesis 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 22:20</span></span>

This chapter ends with some account of Nahor's family, who had settled
at Haran. This seems to be given for the connexion which it had with the
church of God. From thence Isaac and Jacob took wives; and before the
account of those events this list is recorded. It shows that though
Abraham saw his own family highly honoured with privileges, admitted
into covenant, and blessed with the assurance of the promise, yet he did
not look with disdain upon his relations, but was glad to hear of the
increase and welfare of their families.
