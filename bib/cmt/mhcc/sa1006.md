### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 6:0</span></span>

([Sa1 6:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#001)) The Philistines consult
how to send back the ark.

([Sa1 6:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#010)) They bring it to
Bethshemesh.

([Sa1 6:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#019)) The people smitten for
looking into the ark.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 6:1</span></span>

Seven months the Philistines were punished with the presence of the ark;
so long it was a plague to them, because they would not send it home
sooner. Sinners lengthen out their own miseries by refusing to part with
their sins. The Israelites made no effort to recover the ark. Alas!
where shall we find concern for religion prevail above all other
matters? In times of public calamity we fear for ourselves, for our
families, and for our country; but who cares for the ark of God? We are
favoured with the gospel, but it is treated with neglect or contempt. We
need not wonder if it should be taken from us; to many persons this,
though the heavies of calamities, would occasion no grief. There are
multitudes whom any profession would please as well as that of
Christianity. But there are those who value the house, the word, and the
ministry of God above their richest possessions, who dread the loss of
these blessings more than death. How willing bad men are to shift off
their convictions, and when they are in trouble, to believe it is a
chance that happens; and that the rod has no voice which they should
hear or heed!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 6:10</span></span>

These two kine knew their owner, their great Owner, whom Hophni and
Phinehas knew not. God's providence takes notice even of brute
creatures, and serves its own purposes by them. When the reapers saw the
ark, they rejoiced; their joy for that was greater than the joy of
harvest. The return of the ark, and the revival of holy ordinances,
after days of restraint and trouble, are matters of great joy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 6:19</span></span>

It is a great affront to God, for vain men to pry into, and meddle with
the secret things which belong not to them, [Deu
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029); [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018). Man was ruined by desiring
forbidden knowledge. God will not suffer his ark to be profaned. Be not
deceived, God is not mocked. Those that will not fear his goodness, and
reverently use the tokens of his grace, shall be made to feel his
justice. The number smitten is expressed in an unusual manner in the
original, and it is probable that it means 1170. They desire to be rid
of the ark. Foolish men run from one extreme to the other. They should
rather have asked, How may we have peace with God, and recover his
favor? [Mic 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006), [Mic
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007). Thus, when the word of God works
with terror on sinners' consciences, they, instead of taking the blame
and shame to themselves, quarrel with the word, and put that from them.
Many stifle their convictions, and put salvation away from them.
