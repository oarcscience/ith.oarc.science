### [Jeremiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 8:0</span></span>

([Jer 8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001)) The remains of the dead
exposed.

([Jer 8:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004)) The stupidity of the
people, compared with the instinct of the brute creation.

([Jer 8:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014)) The alarm of the
invasion, and lamentation.

[Jeremiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 8:1</span></span>

Though no real hurt can be done to a dead body, yet disgrace to the
remains of wicked persons may alarm those yet alive; and this reminds us
that the Divine justice and punishments extend beyond the grave.
Whatever befalls us here, let us humble ourselves before God, and seek
his mercy.

[Jeremiah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 8:4</span></span>

What brought this ruin? 1. The people would not attend to reason; they
would not act in the affairs of their souls with common prudence. Sin is
backsliding; it is going back from the way that leads to life, to that
which leads to destruction. 2. They would not attend to the warning of
conscience. They did not take the first step towards repentance: true
repentance begins in serious inquiry as to what we have done, from
conviction that we have done amiss. 3. They would not attend to the ways
of providence, nor understand the voice of God in them, [Jer
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007). They know not how to improve the
seasons of grace, which God affords. Many boast of their religious
knowledge, yet, unless taught by the Spirit of God, the instinct of
brutes is a more sure guide than their supposed wisdom. 4. They would
not attend to the written word. Many enjoy abundance of the means of
grace, have Bibles and ministers, but they have them in vain. They will
soon be ashamed of their devices. The pretenders to wisdom were the
priests and the false prophets. They flattered people in sin, and so
flattered them into destruction, silencing their fears and complaints
with, All is well. Selfish teachers may promise peace when there is no
peace; and thus men encourage each other in committing evil; but in the
day of visitation they will have no refuge to flee unto.

[Jeremiah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 8:14</span></span>

At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up. And when God
appears against us, every thing that is against us appears formidable.
As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the present moment should
be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick and dying kingdom? Is
there no skilful, faithful hand to apply the medicine? Yes, God is able
to help and to heal them. If sinners die of their wounds, their blood is
upon their own heads. The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit
is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be
healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardoned and unchanged, for they
will not come to Christ to be saved.
