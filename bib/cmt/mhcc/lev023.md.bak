[Leviticus 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 23:1</span></span>

In this chapter we have the institution of holy times; many of which
have been mentioned before. Though the yearly feasts were made more
remarkable by general attendance at the sanctuary, yet these must not be
observed more than the sabbath. On that day they must withdraw from all
business of the world. It is a sabbath of rest, typifying spiritual rest
from sin, and rest in God. God's sabbaths are to be religiously observed
in every private house, by every family apart, as well as by families
together, in holy assemblies. The sabbath of the Lord in our dwellings
will be their beauty, strength, and safety; it will sanctify, build up,
and glorify them.

[Leviticus 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 23:4</span></span>

The feast of the Passover was to continue seven days; not idle days,
spent in sport, as many that are called Christians spend their
holy-days. Offerings were made to the Lord at his altar; and the people
were taught to employ their time in prayer, and praise, and godly
meditation. The sheaf of first-fruits was typical of the Lord Jesus, who
is risen from the dead as the First-fruits of them that slept. Our Lord
Jesus rose from the dead on the very day that the first-fruits were
offered. We are taught by this law to honour the Lord with our
substance, and with the first-fruits of all our increase, [Pro
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md). They were not to eat of their new
corn, till God's part was offered to him out of it; and we must always
begin with God: begin every day with him, begin every meal with him,
begin every affair and business with him; seek first the kingdom of God.

[Leviticus 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 23:15</span></span>

The feast of Weeks was held in remembrance of the giving of the law,
fifty days after the departure from Egypt; and looked forward to the
outpouring of the Holy Ghost, fifty days after Christ our Passover was
sacrificed for us. On that day the apostles presented the first-fruits
of the Christian church to God. To the institution of the feast of
Pentecost, is added a repetition of that law, by which they were
required to leave the gleanings of their fields. Those who are truly
sensible of the mercy they received from God, will show mercy to the
poor without grudging.

[Leviticus 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 23:23</span></span>

the blowing of trumpets represented the preaching of the gospel, by
which men are called to repent of sin, and to accept the salvation of
Christ, which was signified by the day of atonement. Also it invited to
rejoice in God, and become strangers and pilgrims on earth, which was
denoted by the feast of Tabernacles, observed in the same month. At the
beginning of the year, they were called by this sound of trumpet to
shake off spiritual drowsiness, to search and try their ways, and to
amend them. The day of atonement was the ninth day after this; thus they
were awakened to prepare for that day, by sincere and serious
repentance, that it might indeed be to them a day of atonement. The
humbling of our souls for sin, and the making our peace with God, is
work that requires the whole man, and the closest application of mind.
On that day God spake peace to his people, and to his saints; therefore
they must lay aside all their wordly business, that they might the more
clearly hear that voice of joy and gladness.

[Leviticus 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 23:33</span></span>

In the feast of Tabernacles there was a remembrance of their dwelling in
tents, or booths, in the wilderness, as well as their fathers dwelling
in tents in Canaan; to remind them of their origin and their
deliverance. Christ's tabernacling on earth in human nature, might also
be prefigured. And it represents the believer's life on earth: a
stranger and pilgrim here below, his home and heart are above with his
Saviour. They would the more value the comforts and conveniences of
their own houses, when they had been seven days dwelling in the booths.
It is good for those who have ease and plenty, sometimes to learn what
it is to endure hardness. The joy of harvest ought to be improved for
the furtherance of our joy in God. The earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness thereof; therefore whatever we have the comfort of, he must
have the glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected. God appointed
these feasts, "Beside the sabbaths and your free-will offerings." Calls
to extraordinary services will not excuse from constant and stated ones.
