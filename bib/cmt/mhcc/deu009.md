### [Deuteronomy Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 9:0</span></span>

([Deu 9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001).md) The Israelites not to
think their success came by their own worthiness.

(v. 7-29) Moses reminds the Israelites of their rebellions.

[Deuteronomy 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 9:1</span></span>

Moses represents the strength of the enemies they were now to encounter.
This was to drive them to God, and engage their hope in him. He assures
them of victory, by the presence of God with them. He cautions them not
to have the least thought of their own righteousness, as if that
procured this favour at God's hand. In Christ we have both righteousness
and strength; in Him we must glory, not in ourselves, nor in any
sufficiency of our own. It is for the wickedness of these nations that
God drives them out. All whom God rejects, are rejected for their own
wickedness; but none whom he accepts are accepted for their own
righteousness. Thus boasting is for ever done away: see [Eph
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#009.md), [Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md), [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md).

[Deuteronomy 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 9:7</span></span>

That the Israelites might have no pretence to think that God brought
them to Canaan for their righteousness, Moses shows what a miracle of
mercy it was, that they had not been destroyed in the wilderness. It is
good for us often to remember against ourselves, with sorrow and shame,
our former sins; that we may see how much we are indebted to free grace,
and may humbly own that we never merited any thing but wrath and the
curse at God's hand. For so strong is our propensity to pride, that it
will creep in under one pretence or another. We are ready to fancy that
our righteousness has got for us the special favour of the Lord, though
in reality our wickedness is more plain than our weakness. But when the
secret history of every man's life shall be brought forth at the day of
judgment, all the world will be proved guilty before God. At present,
One pleads for us before the mercy-seat, who not only fasted, but died
upon the cross for our sins; through whom we may approach, though
self-condemned sinners, and beseech for undeserved mercy and for eternal
life, as the gift of God in Him. Let us refer all the victory, all the
glory, and all the praise, to Him who alone bringeth salvation.
