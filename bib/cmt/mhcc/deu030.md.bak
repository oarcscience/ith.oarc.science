### [Deuteronomy Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 30:0</span></span>

([Deu 30:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001).md) Mercies promised to the
repentant.

([Deu 30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011).md) The commandment
manifest.

([Deu 30:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015).md) Death and life set
before them.

[Deuteronomy 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 30:1</span></span>

In this chapter is a plain intimation of the mercy God has in store for
Israel in the latter days. This passage refers to the prophetic warnings
of the last two chapters, which have been mainly fulfilled in the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and in their dispersion to the
present day; and there can be no doubt that the prophetic promise
contained in these verses yet remain to come to pass. The Jewish nation
shall in some future period, perhaps not very distant, be converted to
the faith of Christ; and, many think, again settled in the land of
Canaan. The language here used is in a great measure absolute promises;
not merely a conditional engagement, but declaring an event assuredly to
take place. For the Lord himself here engages to "circumcise their
hearts;" and when regenerating grace has removed corrupt nature, and
Divine love has supplanted the love of sin, they certainly will reflect,
repent, return to God, and obey him; and he will rejoice in doing them
good. The change that will be wrought upon them will not be only
outward, or consisting in mere opinions; it will reach to their souls.
It will produce in them an utter hatred of all sin, and a fervent love
to God, as their reconciled God in Christ Jesus; they will love him with
all their hearts, and with all their soul. They are very far from this
state of mind at present, but so were the murderers of the Lord Jesus,
on the day of Pentecost; who yet in one hour were converted unto God. So
shall it be in the day of God's power; a nation shall be born in a day;
the Lord will hasten it in his time. As a conditional promise this
passage belongs to all persons and all people, not to Israel only; it
assures us that the greatest sinners, if they repent and are converted,
shall have their sins pardoned, and be restored to God's favour.

[Deuteronomy 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 30:11</span></span>

The law is not too high for thee. It is not only known afar off; it is
not confined to men of learning. It is written in thy books, made plain,
so that he who runs may read it. It is in thy mouth, in the tongue
commonly used by thee, in which thou mayest hear it read, and talk of it
among thy children. It is delivered so that it is level to the
understanding of the meanest. This is especially true of the gospel of
Christ, to which the apostle applies it. But the word is nigh us, and
Christ in that word; so that if we believe with the heart, that the
promises of the Messiah are fulfilled in our Lord Jesus, and confess
them with our mouth, we then have Christ with us.

[Deuteronomy 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 30:15</span></span>

What could be said more moving, and more likely to make deep and lasting
impressions? Every man wishes to obtain life and good, and to escape
death and evil; he desires happiness, and dreads misery. So great is the
compassion of the Lord, that he has favoured men, by his word, with such
a knowledge of good and evil as will make them for ever happy, if it be
not their own fault. Let us hear the sum of the whole matter. If they
and theirs would love God, and serve him, they should live and be happy.
If they or theirs should turn from God, desert his service, and worship
other gods, that would certainly be their ruin. There never was, since
the fall of man, more than one way to heaven; which is marked out in
both Testaments, though not with equal clearness. Moses meant that same
way of acceptance, which Paul more plainly described; and Paul's words
mean the same obedience, on which Moses more fully treated. In both
Testaments the good and right way is brought near, and plainly revealed
to us.
