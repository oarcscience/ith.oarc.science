### [Isaiah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 13:0</span></span>

([Isa 13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md) The armies of God's
wrath.

([Isa 13:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006).md) The conquest of
Babylon.

([Isa 13:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019).md) Its final desolation.

[Isaiah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 13:1</span></span>

The threatenings of God's word press heavily upon the wicked, and are a
sore burden, too heavy for them to bear. The persons brought together to
lay Babylon waste, are called God's sanctified or appointed ones;
designed for this service, and made able to do it. They are called God's
mighty ones, because they had their might from God, and were now to use
it for him. They come from afar. God can make those a scourge and ruin
to his enemies, who are farthest off, and therefore least dreaded.

[Isaiah 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 13:6</span></span>

We have here the terrible desolation of Babylon by the Medes and
Persians. Those who in the day of their peace were proud, and haughty,
and terrible, are quite dispirited when trouble comes. Their faces shall
be scorched with the flame. All comfort and hope shall fail. The stars
of heaven shall not give their light, the sun shall be darkened. Such
expressions are often employed by the prophets, to describe the
convulsions of governments. God will visit them for their iniquity,
particularly the sin of pride, which brings men low. There shall be a
general scene of horror. Those who join themselves to Babylon, must
expect to share her plagues, [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md). All that men have, they would
give for their lives, but no man's riches shall be the ransom of his
life. Pause here and wonder that men should be thus cruel and inhuman,
and see how corrupt the nature of man is become. And that little infants
thus suffer, which shows that there is an original guilt, by which life
is forfeited as soon as it is begun. The day of the Lord will, indeed,
be terrible with wrath and fierce anger, far beyond all here stated. Nor
will there be any place for the sinner to flee to, or attempt an escape.
But few act as though they believed these things.

[Isaiah 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 13:19</span></span>

Babylon was a noble city; yet it should be wholly destroyed. None shall
dwell there. It shall be a haunt for wild beasts. All this is fulfilled.
The fate of this proud city is a proof of the truth of the Bible, and an
emblem of the approaching ruin of the New Testament Babylon; a warning
to sinners to flee from the wrath to come, and it encourages believers
to expect victory over every enemy of their souls, and of the church of
God. The whole world changes and is liable to decay. Wherefore let us
give diligence to obtain a kingdom which cannot be moved; and in this
hope let us hold fast that grace whereby we may serve God acceptably
with reverence and godly fear.
