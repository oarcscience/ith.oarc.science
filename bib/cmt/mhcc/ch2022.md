### [2 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 22:0</span></span>

The reign of Ahaziah, Athaliah destroys the royal family.

[2 Chronicles 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 22:1</span></span>

The counsel of the ungodly ruins many young persons when they are
setting out in the world. Ahaziah gave himself up to be led by evil men.
Those who advise us to do wickedly, counsel us to our destruction; while
they pretend to be friends, they are our worst enemies. See and dread
the mischief of bad company. If not the infection, yet let the
destruction be feared, [Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md). We
have here, a wicked woman endeavouring to destroy the house of David,
and a good woman preserving it. No word of God shall fall to the ground.
The whole truth of the prophecies that the Messiah was to come from
David, and thereby the salvation of the world, appeared to be now hung
upon the brittle thread of the life of a single infant, to destroy whom
was the interest of the reigning power. But God had purposed, and vain
were the efforts of earth and hell.
