### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

([Th1 1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001).md) The faith, love, and
patience of the Thessalonians, are evident tokens of their election
which was manifested in the power with which the gospel came to them.

([Th1 1:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006).md) Its powerful and
exemplary effects upon their hearts and lives.

[1 Thessalonians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 1:1</span></span>

As all good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by sinners, but
from God in Christ. And the best good may be expected from God, as our
Father, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves,
but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever there is
a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life.
Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to our
neighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life,
this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign of
sincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. By
this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God
with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts,
weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless
the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead
letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They
were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken in mind
by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all for Christ,
and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon the truth of
the gospel revelation.

[1 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 1:6</span></span>

When careless, ignorant, and immoral persons are turned from their
carnal pursuits and connexions, to believe in and obey the Lord Jesus,
to live soberly, righteously, and godly, the matter speaks for itself.
The believers under the Old Testament waited for the coming of the
Messiah, and believers now wait for his second coming. He is yet to
come. And God had raised him from the dead, which is a full assurance
unto all men that he will come to judgment. He came to purchase
salvation, and will, when he comes again, bring salvation with him, full
and final deliverance from that wrath which is yet to come. Let all,
without delay, flee from the wrath to come, and seek refuge in Christ
and his salvation.
