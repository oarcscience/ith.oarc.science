### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 19:0</span></span>

([Kg2 19:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001).md) Hezekiah receives an
answer of peace.

([Kg2 19:8-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008).md) Sennacherib's letter.

([Kg2 19:20-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020).md) His fall is
prophesied.

([Kg2 19:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md) The Assyrian army
destroyed, Sennacherib slain.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 19:1</span></span>

Hezekiah discovered deep concern at the dishonour done to God by
Rabshakeh's blasphemy. Those who speak from God to us, we should in a
particular manner desire to speak to God for us. The great Prophet is
the great Intercessor. Those are likely to prevail with God, who lift up
their hearts in prayer. Man's extremity is God's opportunity. While his
servants can speak nothing but terror to the profane, the proud, and the
hypocritical, they have comfortable words for the discouraged believer.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 19:8</span></span>

Prayer is the never-failing resource of the tempted Christian, whether
struggling with outward difficulties or inward foes. At the mercy-seat
of his almighty Friend he opens his heart, spreads his case, like
Hezekiah, and makes his appeal. When he can discern that the glory of
God is engaged on his side, faith gains the victory, and he rejoices
that he shall never be moved. The best pleas in prayer are taken from
God's honour.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 19:20</span></span>

All Sennacherib's motions were under the Divine cognizance. God himself
undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but
be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians
probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is
supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the
produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those
two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the
destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith,
assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's
future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not
for their righteousness, but his own glory. May our hearts be as good
ground, that his word may strike root therein, and bring forth fruit in
our lives.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 19:35</span></span>

That night which followed the sending of this message to Hezekiah, the
main body of their army was slain. See how weak the mightiest men are
before Almighty God. Who ever hardened himself against Him and
prospered? The king of Assyria's own sons became his murderers. Those
whose children are undutiful, ought to consider whether they have not
been so to their Father in heaven? This history exhibits a strong proof
of the good of firm trust and confidence in God. He will afflict, but
not forsake his people. It is well when our troubles drive us to our
knees. But does it not reprove our unbelief? How unwilling are we to
rest on the declaration of Jehovah! How desirous to know in what way he
will save us! How impatient when relief is delayed! But we must wait for
the fulfilling of his word. Lord, help our unbelief.
