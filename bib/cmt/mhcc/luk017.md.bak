### [Luke Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 17:0</span></span>

([Luk 17:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001).md) To avoid offences, To
pray for increase of faith, Humility taught.

([Luk 17:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#011).md) Ten lepers cleansed.

(v. 20-37) Christ's kingdom.

[Luke 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 17:1</span></span>

It is no abatement of their guilt by whom an offence comes, nor will it
lessen their punishment that offences will come. Faith in God's
pardoning mercy, will enable us to get over the greatest difficulties in
the way of forgiving our brethren. As with God nothing is impossible, so
all things are possible to him that can believe. Our Lord showed his
disciples their need of deep humility. The Lord has such a property in
every creature, as no man can have in another; he cannot be in debt to
them for their services, nor do they deserve any return from him.

[Luke 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 17:11</span></span>

A sense of our spiritual leprosy should make us very humble whenever we
draw near to Christ. It is enough to refer ourselves to the compassions
of Christ, for they fail not. We may look for God to meet us with mercy,
when we are found in the way of obedience. Only one of those who were
healed returned to give thanks. It becomes us, like him, to be very
humble in thanksgivings, as well as in prayers. Christ noticed the one
who thus distinguished himself, he was a Samaritan. The others only got
the outward cure, he alone got the spiritual blessing.

[Luke 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 17:20</span></span>

The kingdom of God was among the Jews, or rather within some of them. It
was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divine
grace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what state
the judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Here is
shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to the secure
and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
revealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Roman
armies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as is
here spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge
the world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in like
manner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and
remember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who are
marked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.
