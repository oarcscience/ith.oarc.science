### [Philemon Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md)

([Plm 1:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001).md) The apostle's joy and
praise for Philemon's steady faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all
the saints.

([Plm 1:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008).md) He recommends Onesimus
as one who would make rich amends for the misconduct of which he had
been guilty; and on behalf of whom the apostle promises to make up any
loss Philemon had sustained.

([Plm 1:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023).md) Salutations and a
blessing.

[Philemon 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">plm 1:1</span></span>

Faith in Christ, and love to him, should unite saints more closely than
any outward relation can unite the people of the world. Paul in his
private prayers was particular in remembering his friends. We must
remember Christian friends much and often, as their cases may need,
bearing them in our thoughts, and upon our hearts, before our God.
Different sentiments and ways in what is not essential, must not make
difference of affection, as to the truth. He inquired concerning his
friends, as to the truth, growth, and fruitfulness of their graces,
their faith in Christ, and love to him, and to all the saints. The good
which Philemon did, was matter of joy and comfort to him and others, who
therefore desired that he would continue and abound in good fruits, more
and more, to God's honour.

[Philemon 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">plm 1:8</span></span>

It does not lower any one to condescend, and sometimes even to beseech,
where, in strictness of right, we might command: the apostle argues from
love, rather than authority, in behalf of one converted through his
means; and this was Onesimus. In allusion to that name, which signifies
"profitable," the apostle allows that in time past he had been
unprofitable to Philemon, but hastens to mention the change by which he
had become profitable. Unholy persons are unprofitable; they answer not
the great end of their being. But what happy changes conversion makes!
of evil, good; of unprofitable, useful. Religious servants are treasures
in a family. Such will make conscience of their time and trusts, and
manage all they can for the best. No prospect of usefulness should lead
any to neglect their obligations, or to fail in obedience to superiors.
One great evidence of true repentance consists in returning to practise
the duties which have been neglected. In his unconverted state, Onesimus
had withdrawn, to his master's injury; but now he had seen his sin and
repented, he was willing and desirous to return to his duty. Little do
men know for what purposes the Lord leaves some to change their
situations, or engage in undertakings, perhaps from evil motives. Had
not the Lord overruled some of our ungodly projects, we may reflect upon
cases, in which our destruction must have been sure.

[Philemon 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">plm 1:15</span></span>

When we speak of the nature of any sin or offence against God, the evil
of it is not to be lessened; but in a penitent sinner, as God covers it,
so must we. Such changed characters often become a blessing to all among
whom they reside. Christianity does not do away our duties to others,
but directs to the right doing of them. True penitents will be open in
owning their faults, as doubtless Onesimus had been to Paul, upon his
being awakened and brought to repentance; especially in cases of injury
done to others. The communion of saints does not destroy distinction of
property. This passage is an instance of that being imputed to one,
which is contracted by another; and of one becoming answerable for
another, by a voluntary engagement, that he might be freed from the
punishment due to his crimes, according to the doctrine that Christ of
his own will bore the punishment of our sins, that we might receive the
reward of his righteousness. Philemon was Paul's son in the faith, yet
he entreated him as a brother. Onesimus was a poor slave, yet Paul
besought for him as if seeking some great thing for himself. Christians
should do what may give joy to the hearts of one another. From the world
they expect trouble; they should find comfort and joy in one another.
When any of our mercies are taken away, our trust and hope must be in
God. We must diligently use the means, and if no other should be at
hand, abound in prayer. Yet, though prayer prevails, it does not merit
the things obtained. And if Christians do not meet on earth, still the
grace of the Lord Jesus will be with their spirits, and they will soon
meet before the throne to join for ever in admiring the riches of
redeeming love. The example of Onesimus may encourage the vilest sinners
to return to God, but it is shamefully prevented, if any are made bold
thereby to persist in evil courses. Are not many taken away in their
sins, while others become more hardened? Resist not present convictions,
lest they return no more.

[Philemon 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">plm 1:23</span></span>

Never have believers found more enjoyment of God, than when suffering
together for him. Grace is the best wish for ourselves and others; with
this the apostle begins and ends. All grace is from Christ; he
purchased, and he bestows it. What need we more to make us happy, than
to have the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with our spirit? Let us do
that now, which we should do at the last breath. Then men are ready to
renounce the world, and to prefer the least portion of grace and faith
before a kingdom.
