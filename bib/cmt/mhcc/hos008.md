### [Hosea Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 8:0</span></span>

([Hos 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001).md) Destruction threatened
for the impiety of Israel.

([Hos 8:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005).md) For their idolatry.

([Hos 8:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011).md) Further threatenings
for the same sins.

[Hosea 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 8:1</span></span>

When Israel was hard pressed, they would claim protection from God, but
this would be disregarded. What stead will it stand in to say, My God, I
know thee, if we cannot say, My God, I love thee, serve thee, and cleave
to thee only?

[Hosea 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 8:5</span></span>

They promised themselves plenty, peace, and victory, by worshipping
idols, but their expectations came to nothing. What they sow has no
stalk, no blade, or, if it have, the bud shall yield no fruit, there was
nothing in them. The works of darkness are unfruitful; nay, the end of
those things is death. The hopes of sinners will deceive them, and their
gains will be snares. In times of danger, especially in the day of
judgment, all carnal devices will fail. They take a course by
themselves, and like a wild ass by himself, they will be the easier and
surer prey for the lion. Man is in nothing more like the wild ass's
colt, than in seeking for that succour and that satisfaction in the
creature, which are to be had in God only. Though men may sorrow a
little, yet if it is not after a godly sort, they will be brought to
sorrow everlastingly.

[Hosea 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 8:11</span></span>

It is a great sin to corrupt the worship of God, and will be charged as
sin on all who do it, how plausible soever their excuses may seem to be.
The Lord had caused his law to be written for them, but they cared not
to know, and would not obey it. Man seems by the temples he builds to be
mindful of his Maker, yet really he has forgotten him, because he has
cast off all his fear; but none ever hardened his heart against God and
prospered. So long as men despise the truths and precepts of God's word,
and the ordinances of his worship, all the observances and offerings,
however costly, of their own devising, will be unto them for sin; for
those services only are acceptable to God, which are done according to
his word, and through Jesus Christ.
