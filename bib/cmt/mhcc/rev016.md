### [Revelation Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md)

[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 16:0</span></span>

([Rev 16:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001).md) The first vial is poured
out on the earth, the second on the sea, the third on the rivers and
fountains.

([Rev 16:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#008).md) The fourth on the sun,
the fifth on the seat of the beast.

([Rev 16:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012).md) The sixth on the great
river Euphrates.

([Rev 16:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017).md) And the seventh on the
air, when shall follow the destruction of all antichristian enemies.

[Revelation 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 16:1</span></span>

We are to pray that the will of God may be done on earth as it is done
in heaven. Here is a succession of terrible judgments of Providence; and
there seems to be an allusion to several of the plagues of Egypt. The
sins were alike, and so were the punishments. The vials refer to the
seven trumpets, which represented the rise of antichrist; and the fall
of the enemies of the church shall bear some resemblance to their rise.
All things throughout their earth, their air, their sea, their rivers,
their cities, all are condemned to ruin, all accursed for the wickedness
of that people. No wonder that angels, who witness or execute the Divine
vengeance on the obstinate haters of God, of Christ, and of holiness,
praise his justice and truth; and adore his awful judgments, when he
brings upon cruel persecutors the tortures they made his saints and
prophets suffer.

[Revelation 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 16:8</span></span>

The heart of man is so desperately wicked, that the most severe miseries
never will bring any to repent, without the special grace of God. Hell
itself is filled with blasphemies; and those are ignorant of the history
of human nature, of the Bible, and of their own hearts, who do not know
that the more men suffer, and the more plainly they see the hand of God
in their sufferings, the more furiously they often rage against him. Let
sinners now seek repentance from Christ, and the grace of the Holy
Spirit, or they will have the anguish and horror of an unhumbled,
impenitent, and desperate heart; thus adding to their guilt and misery
through all eternity. Darkness is opposed to wisdom and knowledge, and
forebodes the confusion and folly of the idolaters and followers of the
beast. It is opposed to pleasure and joy, and signifies anguish and
vexation of spirit.

[Revelation 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 16:12</span></span>

This probably shows the destruction of the Turkish power, and of
idolatry, and that a way will be made for the return of the Jews. Or,
take it for Rome, as mystical Babylon, the name of Babylon being put for
Rome, which was meant, but was not then to be directly named. When Rome
is destroyed, her river and merchandise must suffer with her. And
perhaps a way will be opened for the eastern nations to come into the
church of Christ. The great dragon will collect all his forces, to make
one desperate struggle before all be lost. God warns of this great
trial, to engage his people to prepare for it. These will be times of
great temptation; therefore Christ, by his apostle, calls on his
professed servants to expect his sudden coming, and to watch that they
might not be put to shame, as apostates or hypocrites. However
Christians differ, as to their views of the times and seasons of events
yet to be brought to pass, on this one point all are agreed, Jesus
Christ, the Lord of glory, will suddenly come again to judge the world.
To those living near to Christ, it is an object of joyful hope and
expectation, and delay is not desired by them.

[Revelation 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 16:17</span></span>

The seventh and last angel poured forth his vial, and the downfall of
Babylon was finished. The church triumphant in heaven saw it and
rejoiced; the church in conflict on earth saw it and became triumphant.
God remembered the great and wicked city; though for some time he seemed
to have forgotten her idolatry and cruelty. All that was most secure was
carried away by the ruin. Men blasphemed: the greatest judgments that
can befall men, will not bring to repentance without the grace of God.
To be hardened against God, by his righteous judgments, is a certain
token of sure and utter destruction.
