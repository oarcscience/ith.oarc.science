### [Jeremiah Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 27:0</span></span>

([Jer 27:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001).md) The neighbouring
nations to be subdued.

([Jer 27:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012).md) Zedekiah is warned to
yield.

([Jer 27:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019).md) The vessels of the
temple to be carried to Babylon, but afterwards to be restored.

[Jeremiah 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 27:1</span></span>

Jeremiah is to prepare a sign that all the neighbouring countries would
be made subject to the king of Babylon. God asserts his right to dispose
of kingdoms as he pleases. Whatever any have of the good things of this
world, it is what God sees fit to give; we should therefore be content.
The things of this world are not the best things, for the Lord often
gives the largest share to bad men. Dominion is not founded in grace.
Those who will not serve the God who made them, shall justly be made to
serve their enemies that seek to ruin them. Jeremiah urges them to
prevent their destruction, by submission. A meek spirit, by quiet
submission to the hardest turns of providence, makes the best of what is
bad. Many persons may escape destroying providences, by submitting to
humbling providences. It is better to take up a light cross in our way,
than to pull a heavier on our own heads. The poor in spirit, the meek
and humble, enjoy comfort, and avoid many miseries to which the
high-spirited are exposed. It must, in all cases, be our interest to
obey God's will.

[Jeremiah 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 27:12</span></span>

Jeremiah persuades the king of Judah to surrender to the king of
Babylon. Is it their wisdom to submit to the heavy iron yoke of a cruel
tyrant, that they may secure their lives; and is it not much more our
wisdom to submit to the pleasant and easy yoke of our Lord and Master,
Jesus Christ, that we may secure our souls? It were well if sinners
would be afraid of the destruction threatened against all who will not
have Christ to reign over them. Why should they die the second death,
infinitely worse than that by sword and famine, when they may submit and
live? And those who encourage sinners to go on in sinful ways, will
perish with them.

[Jeremiah 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 27:19</span></span>

Jeremiah assures them that the brazen vessels should go after the golden
ones. All shall be carried to Babylon. But he concludes with a gracious
promise, that the time would come when they should be brought back.
Though the return of the prosperity of the church does not come in our
time, we must not despair, for it will come in God's time.
