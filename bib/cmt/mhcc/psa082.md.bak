### [Psalms Chapter 82](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 82:0</span></span>

([Psa 82:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001).md) An exhortation to
judges.

([Psa 82:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006).md) The doom of evil rulers.

[Psalms 82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 82:1</span></span>

Magistrates are the mighty in authority for the public good. Magistrates
are the ministers of God's providence, for keeping up order and peace,
and particularly in punishing evil-doers, and protecting those that do
well. Good princes and good judges, who mean well, are under Divine
direction; and bad ones, who mean ill, are under Divine restraint. The
authority of God is to be submitted to, in those governors whom his
providence places over us. But when justice is turned from what is
right, no good can be expected. The evil actions of public persons are
public mischiefs.

[Psalms 82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 82:6</span></span>

It is hard for men to have honour put upon them, and not to be proud of
it. But all the rulers of the earth shall die, and all their honour
shall be laid in the dust. God governs the world. There is a righteous
God to whom we may go, and on whom we may depend. This also has respect
to the kingdom of the Messiah. Considering the state of affairs in the
world, we have need to pray that the Lord Jesus would speedily rule over
all nations, in truth, righteousness, and peace.
