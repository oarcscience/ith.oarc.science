### [Genesis Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 13:0</span></span>

([Gen 13:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001).md) Abram returns out of
Egypt with great riches.

([Gen 13:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#005).md) Strife between the
herdsmen of Abram and Lot. Abram gives Lot his choice of the country.

([Gen 13:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010).md) Lot chooses to dwell
at Sodom.

([Gen 13:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#014).md) God renews his promise
to Abram, who removes to Hebron.

[Genesis 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 13:1</span></span>

Abram was very rich: he was very heavy, so the Hebrew word is; for
riches are a burden; and they that will be rich, do but load themselves
with thick clay, [Hab 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md). There is a
burden of care in getting riches, fear in keeping them, temptation in
using them, guilt in abusing them, sorrow in losing them, and a burden
of account at last to be given up about them. Yet God in his providence
sometimes makes good men rich men, and thus God's blessing made Abram
rich without sorrow, [Pro 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022.md).
Though it is hard for a rich man to get to heaven, yet in some cases it
may be, [Mar 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#023.md), [Mar
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#024.md). Nay, outward prosperity, if
well managed, is an ornament to piety, and an opportunity for doing more
good. Abram removed to Beth-el. His altar was gone, so that he could not
offer sacrifice; but he called on the name of the Lord. You may as soon
find a living man without breath as one of God's people without prayer.

[Genesis 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 13:5</span></span>

Riches not only afford matter for strife, and are the things most
commonly striven about; but they also stir up a spirit of contention, by
making people proud and covetous. Mine and thine are the great
make-bates of the world. Poverty and labour, wants and wanderings, could
not separate Abram and Lot; but riches did so. Bad servants often make a
great deal of mischief in families and among neighbours, by their pride
and passion, lying, slandering, and talebearing. What made the quarrel
worse was, that the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
The quarrels of professors are the reproach of religion, and give
occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme. It is best to keep the
peace, that it be not broken; but the next best is, if differences do
happen, with all speed to quench the fire that is broken out. The
attempt to stay this strife was made by Abram, although he was the elder
and the greater man. Abram shows himself to be a man of cool spirit,
that had the command of his passion, and knew how to turn away wrath by
a soft answer. Those that would keep the peace, must never render
railing for railing. And of a condescending spirit; he was willing to
beseech even his inferior to be at peace. Whatever others are for, the
people of God must be for peace. Abram's plea for peace was very
powerful. Let the people of the land contend about trifles; but let not
us fall out, who know better things, and look for a better country.
Professors of religion should be most careful to avoid contention. Many
profess to be for peace who will do nothing towards it: not so Abram.
When God condescends to beseech us to be reconciled, we may well beseech
one another. Though God had promised Abram to give this land to his
seed, yet he offered an equal or better share to Lot, who had not an
equal right; and he will not, under the protection of God's promise, act
hardly to his kinsman. It is noble to be willing to yield for peace'
sake.

[Genesis 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 13:10</span></span>

Abram having offered Lot the choice, he at once accepted it. Passion and
selfishness make men rude. Lot looked to the goodness of the land;
therefore he doubted not that in such a fruitful soil he should
certainly thrive. But what came of it? Those who, in choosing relations,
callings, dwellings, or settlements, are guided and governed by the lust
of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life, cannot expect
God's presence or blessing. They are commonly disappointed even in that
which they principally aim at. In all our choices this principle should
rule, That is best for us, which is best for our souls. Lot little
considered the badness of the inhabitants. The men of Sodom were
impudent, daring sinners. This was the iniquity of Sodom, pride, fulness
of bread, and abundance of idleness, [Eze
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049.md). God often gives great plenty to
great sinners. It has often been the vexatious lot of good men to live
among wicked neighbours; and it must be the more grievous, if, as Lot
here, they have brought it upon themselves by a wrong choice.

[Genesis 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 13:14</span></span>

Those are best prepared for the visits of Divine grace, whose spirits
are calm, and not ruffled with passion. God will abundantly make up in
spiritual peace, what we lose for preserving neighbourly peace. When our
relations are separated from us, yet God is not. Observe also the
promises with which God now comforted and enriched Abram. Of two things
he assures him; a good land, and a numerous issue to enjoy it. The
prospects seen by faith are more rich and beautiful than those we see
around us. God bade him walk through the land, not to think of fixing in
it, but expect to be always unsettled, and walking through it to a
better Canaan. He built an altar, in token of his thankfulness to God.
When God meets us with gracious promises, he expects that we should
attend him with humble praises. In outward difficulties, it is very
profitable for the true believer to mediate on the glorious inheritance
which the Lord has for him at the last.
