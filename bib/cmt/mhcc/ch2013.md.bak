### [2 Chronicles Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 13:0</span></span>

Abijah overcomes Jeroboam.

[2 Chronicles 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 13:1</span></span>

Jeroboam and his people, by apostacy and idolatry, merited the severe
punishment Abijah was permitted to execute upon them. It appears from
the character of Abijah, [Kg1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003.md),
that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from
the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power
of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion
themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers
of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous
cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way
should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable
comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord.
Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of
faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of
Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.
