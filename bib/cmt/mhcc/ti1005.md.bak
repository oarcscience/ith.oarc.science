### [1 Timothy Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti1 5:0</span></span>

([Ti1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md), [Ti1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#002).md) Directions as to the elder and
younger men and women.

([Ti1 5:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003).md) And as to poor widows.

([Ti1 5:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009).md) Concerning widows.

([Ti1 5:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017).md) The respect to be paid
to elders. Timothy is to take care in rebuking offenders, in ordaining
ministers, and as to his own health.

[1 Timothy 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 5:1</span></span>

Respect must be paid to the dignity of years and place. The younger, if
faulty, must be rebuked, not as desirous to find fault with them, but as
willing to make the best of them. There is need of much meekness and
care in reproving those who deserve reproof.

[1 Timothy 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 5:3</span></span>

Honour widows that are widows indeed, relieve them, and maintain them.
It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they are
able to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhood
is a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue in
prayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually
dead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of this
description among nominal Christians, even to the latest period of life!
If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they in effect
deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures, what
should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, and are
worse than infidels. If professors of the gospel give way to any corrupt
principle or conduct, they are worse than those who do not profess to
believe the doctrines of grace.

[1 Timothy 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 5:9</span></span>

Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from
just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to
be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are
in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who
show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful
in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only
idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among
brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their
families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from
relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.

[1 Timothy 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 5:17</span></span>

Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who are
laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is
their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle
charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need
to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep
thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from
countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also
charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our
bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be
most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there
are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before
unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the
hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts.
Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper
offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and
doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.
