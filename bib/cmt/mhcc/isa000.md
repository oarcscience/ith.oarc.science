[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 0:0</span></span>

Isaiah prophesied in the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.
He has been well called the evangelical prophet, on account of his
numerous and full prophesies concerning the coming and character, the
ministry and preaching, the sufferings and death of the Messiah, and the
extent and continuance of his kingdom. Under the veil of the deliverance
from Babylon, Isaiah points to a much greater deliverance, which was to
be effected by the Messiah; and seldom does he mention the one, without
alluding at the same time to the other; nay, he is often so much
enraptured with the prospect of the more distant deliverance, as to lose
sight of that which was nearer, and to dwell on the Messiah's person,
office, character, and kingdom.
