### [Leviticus Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#001)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 17:0</span></span>

([Lev 17:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#001)) All sacrifices to be
offered at the tabernacle.

([Lev 17:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010)) Eating of blood, or of
animals which died a natural death, forbidden.

[Leviticus 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 17:1</span></span>

All the cattle killed by the Israelites, while in the wilderness, were
to be presented before the door of the tabernacle, and the flesh to be
returned to the offerer, to be eaten as a peace-offering, according to
the law. When they entered Canaan, this only continued in respect of
sacrifices. The spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer, are not
confined to any one place. We have now no temple or altar that
sanctifies the gift; nor does the gospel unity rest only in one place,
but in one heart, and the unity of the Spirit. Christ is our Altar, and
the true Tabernacle; in him God dwells among men. It is in him that our
sacrifices are acceptable to God, and in him only. To set up other
mediators, or other altars, or other expiatory sacrifices, is, in
effect, to set up other gods. And though God will graciously accept our
family offerings, we must not therefore neglect attending at the
tabernacle.

[Leviticus 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 17:10</span></span>

Here is a confirmation of the law against eating blood. They must eat no
blood. But this law was ceremonial, and is now no longer in force; the
coming of the substance does away the shadow. The blood of beasts is no
longer the ransom, but Christ's blood only; therefore there is not now
the reason for abstaining there then was. The blood is now allowed for
the nourishment of our bodies; it is no longer appointed to make an
atonement for the soul. Now the blood of Christ makes atonement really
and effectually; to that, therefore, we must have regard, and not
consider it as a common thing, or treat it with indifference.
