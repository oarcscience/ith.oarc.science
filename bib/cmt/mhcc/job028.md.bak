### [Job Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 28:0</span></span>

([Job 28:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001).md) Concerning wordly
wealth.

([Job 28:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012).md) Wisdom is of
inestimable value.

([Job 28:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#020).md) Wisdom is the gift of
God.

[Job 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 28:1</span></span>

Job maintained that the dispensations of Providence were regulated by
the highest wisdom. To confirm this, he showed of what a great deal of
knowledge and wealth men may make themselves masters. The caverns of the
earth may be discovered, but not the counsels of Heaven. Go to the
miners, thou sluggard in religion, consider their ways, and be wise. Let
their courage and diligence in seeking the wealth that perishes, shame
us out of slothfulness and faint-heartedness in labouring for the true
riches. How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! How much easier,
and safer! Yet gold is sought for, but grace neglected. Will the hopes
of precious things out of the earth, so men call them, though really
they are paltry and perishing, be such a spur to industry, and shall not
the certain prospect of truly precious things in heaven be much more so?

[Job 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 28:12</span></span>

Job here speaks of wisdom and understanding, the knowing and enjoying of
God and ourselves. Its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in
this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be bought with
money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so in ours.
Job asks after it as one that truly desired to find it, and despaired of
finding it any where but in God; any way but by Divine revelation.

[Job 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 28:20</span></span>

There is a two-fold wisdom; one hid in God, which is secret, and belongs
not to us; the other made known by him, and revealed to man. One day's
events, and one man's affairs, have such reference to, and so hang one
upon another, that He only, to whom all is open, and who sees the whole
at one view, can rightly judge of every part. But the knowledge of God's
revealed will is within our reach, and will do us good. Let man look
upon this as his wisdom, To fear the Lord, and to depart from evil. Let
him learn that, and he is learned enough. Where is this wisdom to be
found? The treasures of it are hid in Christ, revealed by the word,
received by faith, through the Holy Ghost. It will not feed pride or
vanity, or amuse our vain curiosity. It teaches and encourages sinners
to fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, in the exercise of repentance
and faith, without desiring to solve all difficulties about the events
of this life.
