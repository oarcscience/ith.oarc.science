### [2 Chronicles Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 26:0</span></span>

([Ch2 26:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001).md) Uzziah's good reign in
Judah.

([Ch2 26:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016).md) Uzziah's attempt to
burn incense.

[2 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 26:1</span></span>

As long as Uzziah sought the Lord, and minded religion, God made him to
prosper. Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is
his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and
kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God,
every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent
or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any
to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the
neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly
honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but
delighted in husbandry.

[2 Chronicles 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 26:16</span></span>

The transgression of the kings before Uzziah was, forsaking the temple
of the Lord, and burning incense upon idolatrous altars. But his
transgression was, going into the holy place, and attempting to burn
incense upon the altar of God. See how hard it is to avoid one extreme,
and not run into another. Pride of heart was at the bottom of his sin; a
lust that ruins many. Instead of lifting up the name God in gratitude to
him who had done so much for him, his heart was lifted up to his hurt.
Men's pretending to forbidden knowledge, and seeking things too high for
them, are owing to pride of heart. The incense of our prayers must be,
by faith, put into the hands of our Lord Jesus, the great High Priest of
our profession, else we cannot expect it to be accepted by God, [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md). Though Uzziah strove with the
priests, he would not strive with his Maker. But he was punished for his
transgression; he continued a leper to his death, shut out from society.
The punishment answered the sin as face to face in a glass. Pride was at
the bottom of his transgression, and thus God humbled him, and put
dishonour upon him. Those that covet forbidden honours, forfeit allowed
ones. Adam, by catching at the tree of knowledge which he might not eat
of, debarred himself of the tree of life which he might have eaten of.
Let all that read say, The Lord is righteous. And when the Lord sees
good to throw prosperous and useful men aside, as broken vessels, if he
raises up others to fill their places, they may rejoice to renounce all
worldly concerns, and employ their remaining days in preparation for
death.
