### [Ruth Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md)

[Ruth](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rut 4:0</span></span>

([Rut 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001).md) The kinsman refuses to
redeem Ruth's inheritance.

([Rut 4:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#009).md) Boaz marries Ruth.

([Rut 4:13-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013).md) Birth of Obed.

[Ruth 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 4:1</span></span>

This matter depended on the laws given by Moses about inheritances, and
doubtless the whole was settled in the regular and legal manner. This
kinsman, when he heard the conditions of the bargain, refused it. In
like manner many are shy of the great redemption; they are not willing
to espouse religion; they have heard well of it, and have nothing to say
against it; they will give it their good word, but they are willing to
part with it, and cannot be bound to it, for fear of marring their own
inheritance in this world. The right was resigned to Boaz. Fair and open
dealing in all matters of contract and trade, is what all must make
conscience of, who would approve themselves true Israelites, without
guile. Honesty will be found the best policy.

[Ruth 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rut 4:9</span></span>

Men are ready to seize opportunities for increasing their estates, but
few know the value of godliness. Such are the wise men of this world,
whom the Lord charges with folly. They attend not to the concerns of
their souls, but reject the salvation of Christ, for fear of marring
their inheritance. But God did Boaz the honour to bring him into the
line of the Messiah, while the kinsman, who was afraid of lessening
himself, and marring his inheritance, has his name, family, and
inheritance forgotten.

[Ruth 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rut 4:13</span></span>

Ruth bore a son, through whom thousands and myriads were born to God;
and in being the lineal ancestor of Christ, she was instrumental in the
happiness of all that shall be saved by him; even of us Gentiles, as
well as those of Jewish descent. She was a witness for God to the
Gentile world, that he had not utterly forsaken them, but that in due
time they should become one with his chosen people, and partake of his
salvation. Prayer to God attended the marriage, and praise to him
attended the birth of the child. What a pity it is that pious language
should not be more used among Christians, or that it should be let fall
into formality! Here is the descent of David from Ruth. And the period
came when Bethlehem-Judah displayed greater wonders than those in the
history of Ruth, when the outcast babe of another forlorn female of the
same race appeared, controlling the counsels of the Roman master of the
world, and drawing princes and wise men from the east, with treasures of
gold, and frankincense, and myrrh to his feet. His name shall endure for
ever, and all nations shall call Him blessed. In that Seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed.
