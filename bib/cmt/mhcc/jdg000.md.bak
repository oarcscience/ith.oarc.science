[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

The book of Judges is the history of Israel during the government of the
Judges, who were occasional deliverers, raised up by God to rescue
Israel from their oppressors, to reform the state of religion, and to
administer justice to the people. The state of God's people does not
appear in this book so prosperous, nor their character so religious, as
might have been expected; but there were many believers among them, and
the tabernacle service was attended to. The history exemplifies the
frequent warnings and predictions of Moses, and should have close
attention. The whole is full of important instruction.
