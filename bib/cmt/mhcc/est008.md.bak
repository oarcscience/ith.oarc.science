### [Esther Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001.md)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 8:0</span></span>

([Est 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001.md), [Est
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#002).md) Mordecai is advanced.

([Est 8:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#003).md) Esther makes suit for
the Jews.

([Est 8:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015).md) Mordecai honoured, The
joy of the Jews.

[Esther 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 8:1</span></span>

What Haman would have done mischief with, Esther will do good with. All
the trust the king had reposed in Haman, he now placed in Mordecai: a
happy change. See the vanity of laying up treasure upon earth; he that
heapeth up riches, knoweth not who shall gather them. With what little
pleasure, nay, with what constant vexation, would Haman have looked upon
his estate, if he could have foreseen that Mordecai, the man he hated
above all men in the world, should have rule over all that wherein he
had laboured! It is our interest to make sure of those riches which will
not be left behind, but which will go with us to another world.

[Esther 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 8:3</span></span>

It was time to be earnest, when the church of God was at stake. Esther,
though safe herself, fell down and begged for the deliverance of her
people. We read of no tears when she begged for her own life, but
although she was sure of that, she wept for her people. Tears of pity
and tenderness are the most Christ-like. According to the constitution
of the Persian government, no law or decree could be repealed or
recalled. This is so far from speaking to the wisdom and honour of the
Medes and Persians, that it clearly shows their pride and folly. This
savours of that old presumption which ruined all, We will be as gods! It
is God's prerogative not to repent, or to say what can never be altered
or unsaid. Yet a way was found, by another decree, to authorize the Jews
to stand upon their defence. The decree was published in the languages
of all the provinces. Shall all the subjects of an earthly prince have
his decrees in languages they understand, and shall God's oracles and
laws be locked up from any of his servants in an unknown tongue?

[Esther 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 8:15</span></span>

Mordecai's robes now were rich. These things are not worth notice, but
as marks of the king's favour, and the fruit of God's favour to his
church. It is well with a land, when ensigns of dignity are made the
ornaments of serious piety. When the church prospers, many will join it,
who will be shy of it when in trouble. When believers have rest, and
walk in the fear of the Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, they
will be multiplied. And the attempts of Satan to destroy the church,
always tend to increase the number of true Christians.
