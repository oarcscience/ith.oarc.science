[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 0:0</span></span>

The books of Chronicles are, in a great measure, repetitions of what is
in the books of Samuel and of the Kings, yet there are some excellent
useful things in them which we find not elsewhere. The FIRST BOOK traces
the rise of the Jewish people from Adam, and afterward gives an account
of the reign of David. In the SECOND BOOK the narrative is continued,
and relates the progress and end of the kingdom of Judah; also it
notices the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity. Jerome
says, that whoever supposes himself to have knowledge of the Scriptures
without being acquainted with the books of Chronicles, deceives himself.
Historical facts passed over elsewhere, names, and the connexion of
passages are to be found here, and many questions concerning the gospel
are explained.
