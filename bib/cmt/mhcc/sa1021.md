([Sa1 21:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001).md) David with Ahimelech.

([Sa1 21:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010).md) David at Gath feigns
himself mad.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 21:1</span></span>

David, in distress, fled to the tabernacle of God. It is great comfort
in a day of trouble, that we have a God to go to, to whom we may open
our cases, and from whom we may ask and expect direction. David told
Ahimelech a gross untruth. What shall we say to this? The Scripture does
not conceal it, and we dare not justify it; it was ill done, and proved
of bad consequence; for it occasioned the death of the priests of the
Lord. David thought upon it afterward with regret. David had great faith
and courage, yet both failed him; he fell thus foully through fear and
cowardice, and owing to the weakness of his faith. Had he trusted God
aright, he would not have used such a sorry, sinful shift for his own
preservation. It is written, not for us to do the like, no, not in the
greatest straits, but for our warning. David asked of Ahimelech bread
and a sword. Ahimelech supposed they might eat the shew-bread. The Son
of David taught from it, that mercy is to be preferred to sacrifice;
that ritual observances must give way to moral duties. Doeg set his foot
as far within the tabernacle as David did. We little know with what
hearts people come to the house of God, nor what use they will make of
pretended devotion. If many come in simplicity of heart to serve their
God, others come to observe their teachers and to prove accusers. Only
God and the event can distinguish between a David and a Doeg, when both
are in the tabernacle.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 21:10</span></span>

God's persecuted people have often found better usage from Philistines
than from Israelites. David had reason to put confidence in Achish, yet
he began to be afraid. His conduct was degrading, and discovered
wavering in his faith and courage. The more simply we depend on God, and
obey him, the more comfortably and surely we shall walk through this
troublesome world.
