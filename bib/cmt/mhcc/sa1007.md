### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 7:0</span></span>

([Sa1 7:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001)) The ark removed to
Kirjath-jearim.

([Sa1 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#005), [Sa1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006)) The Israelites solemnly repent.

([Sa1 7:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#007)) The Lord discomfits the
Philistines.

([Sa1 7:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013)) They are subdued,
Samuel judges Israel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 7:1</span></span>

God will find a resting-place for his ark; if some thrust it from them,
the hearts of others shall be inclined to receive it. It is no new thing
for God's ark to be in a private house. Christ and his apostles preached
from house to house, when they could not have public places. Twenty
years passed before the house of Israel cared for the want of the ark.
During this time the prophet Samuel laboured to revive true religion.
The few words used are very expressive; and this was one of the most
effectual revivals of religion which ever took place in Israel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 7:5</span></span>

Israel drew water and poured it out before the Lord; signifying their
humiliation and sorrow for sin. They pour out their hearts in repentance
before the Lord. They were free and full in their confession, and fixed
in their resolution to cast away from them all their wrong doings. They
made a public confession, We have sinned against the Lord; thus giving
glory to God, and taking shame to themselves. And if we thus confess our
sins, we shall find our God faithful and just to forgive us our sins.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 7:7</span></span>

The Philistines invaded Israel. When sinners begin to repent and reform,
they must expect that Satan will muster all his force against them, and
set his instruments at work to the utmost, to oppose and discourage
them. The Israelites earnestly beg Samuel to pray for them. Oh what a
comfort it is to all believers, that our great Intercessor above never
ceases, is never silent! for he always appears in the presence of God
for us. Samuel's sacrifice, without his prayer, had been an empty
shadow. God gave a gracious answer. And Samuel erected a memorial of
this victory, to the glory of God, and to encourage Israel. Through
successive generations, the church of God has had cause to set up
Eben-ezers for renewed deliverances; neither outward persecutions nor
inward corruptions have prevailed against her, because "hitherto the
Lord hath helped her:" and he will help, even to the end of the world.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 7:13</span></span>

In this great revival of true religion, the ark was neither removed to
Shiloh, nor placed with the tabernacle any where else. This disregard to
the Levitical institutions showed that their typical meaning formed
their chief use; and when that was overlooked, they became a lifeless
service, not to be compared with repentance, faith, and the love of God
and man.
