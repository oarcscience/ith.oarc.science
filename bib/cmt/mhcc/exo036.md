### [Exodus Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

The making of the tabernacle The liberality of the people restrained.

[Exodus 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 36:1</span></span>

The readiness and zeal with which these builders set about their work,
the exactness with which they performed it, and the faithfulness with
which they objected to receive more contributions, are worthy of our
imitation. Thus should we serve God, and our superiors also, in all
things lawful. Thus should all who are in public trusts abhor filthy
lucre, and avoid all occasions and temptations to covetousness. Where
have we the representation of God's love towards us, that we by love
dwell in him and he in us, save in Emmanuel? [Mat
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023). This is the sum of the ministry
of reconciliation, [Co2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018), [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019). This was the design of the
"tabernacle of witness," a visible testimony of the love of God to the
race of men, however they were fallen from their first state. And this
love was shown by Christ's taking up his abode on earth; by the Word
being made flesh, [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), wherein,
as the original expresses it, he did tabernacle among us.
