### [Matthew Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 17:0</span></span>

Christ.

([Mat 17:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014).md) Jesus casts out a dumb
and deaf spirit.

([Mat 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022.md), [Mat
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#023).md) He again foretells his
sufferings.

[Matthew 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 17:1</span></span>

Now the disciples beheld somewhat of Christ's glory, as of the only
begotten of the Father. It was intended to support their faith, when
they would have to witness his crucifixion; and would give them an idea
of the glory prepared for them, when changed by his power and made like
him. The apostles were overcome by the glorious sight. Peter thought
that it was most desirable to continue there, and to go no more down to
meet the sufferings of which he was so unwilling to hear. In this he
knew not what he said. We are wrong, if we look for a heaven here upon
earth. Whatever tabernacles we propose to make for ourselves in this
world, we must always remember to ask Christ's leave. That sacrifice was
not yet offered, without which the souls of sinful men could not have
been saved; and important services were to be done by Peter and his
brethren. While Peter spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, an emblem
of the Divine presence and glory. Ever since man sinned, and heard God's
voice in the garden, unusual appearances of God have been terrible to
man. They fell prostrate to the earth, till Jesus encouraged them; when
looking round, they beheld only their Lord as they commonly saw him. We
must pass through varied experiences in our way to glory; and when we
return to the world after an ordinance, it must be our care to take
Christ with us, and then it may be our comfort that he is with us.

[Matthew 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 17:14</span></span>

The case of afflicted children should be presented to God by faithful
and fervent prayer. Christ cured the child. Though the people were
perverse, and Christ was provoked, yet care was taken of the child. When
all other helps and succours fail, we are welcome to Christ, may trust
in him, and in his power and goodness. See here an emblem of Christ's
undertaking as our Redeemer. It encourages parents to bring children to
Christ, whose souls are under Satan's power; he is able to heal them,
and as willing as he is able. Not only bring them to Christ by prayer,
but bring them to the word of Christ; to means by which Satan's
strong-holds in the soul are beaten down. It is good for us to distrust
ourselves and our own strength; but it is displeasing to Christ when we
distrust any power derived from him, or granted by him. There was also
something in the malady which rendered the cure difficult. The
extraordinary power of Satan must not discourage our faith, but quicken
us to more earnestness in praying to God for the increase of it. Do we
wonder to see Satan's bodily possession of this young man from a child,
when we see his spiritual possession of every son of Adam from the fall!

[Matthew 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 17:22</span></span>

Christ perfectly knew all things that should befall him, yet undertook
the work of our redemption, which strongly shows his love. What outward
debasement and Divine glory was the life of the Redeemer! And all his
humiliation ended in his exaltation. Let us learn to endure the cross,
to despise riches and worldly honours, and to be content with his will.

[Matthew 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 17:24</span></span>

Peter felt sure that his Master was ready to do what was right. Christ
spoke first to give him proof that no thought can be withholden from
him. We must never decline our duty for fear of giving offence; but we
must sometimes deny ourselves in our worldly interests, rather than give
offence. However the money was lodged in the fish, He who knows all
things alone could know it, and only almighty power could bring it to
Peter's hook. The power and the poverty of Christ should be mentioned
together. If called by providence to be poor, like our Lord, let us
trust in his power, and our God shall supply all our need, according to
his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. In the way of obedience, in the
course, perhaps, of our usual calling, as he helped Peter, so he will
help us. And if any sudden call should occur, which we are not prepared
to meet, let us not apply to others, till we first seek Christ.
