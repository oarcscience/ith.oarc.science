### [Jeremiah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 6:0</span></span>

([Jer 6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001).md) The invasion of Judea.

([Jer 6:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009).md) The justice of God's
proceedings.

([Jer 6:18-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#018).md) All methods used to
amend them had been without success.

[Jeremiah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 6:1</span></span>

Whatever methods are used, it is vain to contend with God's judgments.
The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the more we unfit
ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean army shall break
in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all. The day is
coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways will be visited.
It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation to work out, and
the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But they were thus
eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but that they might
fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his own purposes. The
corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts out evil thoughts,
just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is always flowing, yet
always full. The God of mercy is loth to depart even from a provoking
people, and is earnest with them, that by repentance and reformation,
they may prevent things from coming to extremity.

[Jeremiah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 6:9</span></span>

When the Lord arises to take vengeance, no sinners of any age or rank,
or of either sex escape. They were set upon the world, and wholly
carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God's word,
we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it. Those are
to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, who flatter us in a
sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls! Ask for the old
paths; the way of godliness and righteousness has always been the way
God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old paths set forth by the
written word of God. When you have found the good way, go on in it, you
will find abundant recompence at your journey's end. But if men will not
obey the voice of God and flee to his appointed Refuge, it will plainly
appear at the day of judgment, that they are ruined because they reject
God's word.

[Jeremiah 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 6:18</span></span>

God rejects their outward services, as worthless to atone for their
sins. Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to a Mediator; but when
offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, they provoke God. The
sins of God's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies.
They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice in hope of God's
mercies, though they see them only in the promise: sinners must mourn
for fear of God's judgments, though they see them only in the
threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are all corrupters.
Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to ore supposed to have
good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothing will prevail to
part between them and their sins. Reprobate silver shall they be called,
useless and worthless. When warnings, corrections, rebukes, and all
means of grace, leave men unrenewed, they will be left, as rejected of
God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray, then, that we may be refined by
the Lord, as silver is refined.
