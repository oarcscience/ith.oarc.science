### [Leviticus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

What animals were clean and unclean.

[Leviticus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 11:1</span></span>

These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's
obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to
teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To
keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these
forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the
heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy
and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law
forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of
them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all
temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute,
and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their
obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian
liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be
careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called
his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out,
and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the
ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we
must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions
of his people.
