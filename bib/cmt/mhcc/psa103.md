### [Psalms Chapter 103](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 103:0</span></span>

([Psa 103:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001).md) An exhortation to bless
God for his mercy.

([Psa 103:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#006).md) And to the church and
to all men.

([Psa 103:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015).md) For the constancy of
his mercy.

([Psa 103:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019).md) For the government of
the world.

[Psalms 103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 103:1</span></span>

By the pardon of sin, that is taken away which kept good things from us,
and we are restored to the favor of God, who bestows good things on us.
Think of the provocation; it was sin, and yet pardoned: how many the
provocations, yet all pardoned! God is still forgiving, as we are still
sinning and repenting. The body finds the melancholy consequences of
Adam's offence, it is subject to many infirmities, and the soul also.
Christ alone forgives all our sins; it is he alone who heals all our
infirmities. And the person who finds his sin cured, has a well-grounded
assurance that it is forgiven. When God, by the graces and comforts of
his Spirit, recovers his people from their decays, and fills them with
new life and joy, which is to them an earnest of eternal life and joy,
they may then be said to return to the days of their youth, [Job
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#025.md).

[Psalms 103:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 103:6</span></span>

Truly God is good to all: he is in a special manner good to Israel. He
has revealed himself and his grace to them. By his ways we may
understand his precepts, the ways he requires us to walk in; and his
promises and purposes. He always has been full of compassion. How unlike
are those to God, who take every occasion to chide, and never know when
to cease! What would become of us, if God should deal so with us? The
Scripture says a great deal of the mercy of God, and we all have
experienced it. The father pities his children that are weak in
knowledge, and teaches them; pities them when they are froward, and
bears with them; pities them when they are sick, and comforts them;
pities them when they are fallen, and helps them to rise; pities them
when they have offended, and, upon their submission, forgives them;
pities them when wronged, and rights them: thus the Lord pities those
that fear him. See why he pities. He considers the frailty of our
bodies, and the folly of our souls, how little we can do, how little we
can bear; in all which his compassion appears.

[Psalms 103:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 103:15</span></span>

How short is man's life, and uncertain! The flower of the garden is
commonly more choice, and will last the longer, for being sheltered by
the garden-wall, and the gardener's care; but the flower of the field,
to which life is here compared, is not only withering in itself, but
exposed to the cold blasts, and liable to be cropped and trod on by the
beasts of the field. Such is man. God considers this, and pities him;
let him consider it himself. God's mercy is better than life, for it
will outlive it. His righteousness, the truth of his promise, shall be
unto children's children, who tread in the footsteps of their
forefathers' piety. Then shall mercy be preserved to them.

[Psalms 103:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 103:19</span></span>

He who made all, rules all, and both by a word of power. He disposes all
persons and things to his own glory. There is a world of holy angels who
are ever praising him. Let all his works praise him. Such would have
been our constant delight, if we had not been fallen creatures. Such it
will in a measure become, if we are born of God. Such it will be for
ever in heaven; nor can we be perfectly happy till we can take unwearied
pleasure in perfect obedience to the will of our God. And let the
feeling of each redeemed heart be, Bless the Lord, O my soul.
