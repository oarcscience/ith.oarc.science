### [Job Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 7:0</span></span>

([Job 7:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001).md) Job's troubles.

([Job 7:7-16](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007).md) Job expostulates with
God.

([Job 7:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017).md) He begs release.

[Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 7:1</span></span>

Job here excuses what he could not justify, his desire of death. Observe
man's present place: he is upon earth. He is yet on earth, not in hell.
Is there not a time appointed for his abode here? yes, certainly, and
the appointment is made by Him who made us and sent us here. During
that, man's life is a warfare, and as day-labourers, who have the work
of the day to do in its day, and must make up their account at night.
Job had as much reason, he thought, to wish for death, as a poor servant
that is tired with his work, has to wish for the shadows of the evening,
when he shall go to rest. The sleep of the labouring man is sweet; nor
can any rich man take so much satisfaction in his wealth, as the
hireling in his day's wages. The comparison is plain; hear his
complaint: His days were useless, and had long been so; but when we are
not able to work for God, if we sit still quietly for him, we shall be
accepted. His nights were restless. Whatever is grievous, it is good to
see it appointed for us, and as designed for some holy end. When we have
comfortable nights, we must see them also appointed to us, and be
thankful for them. His body was noisome. See what vile bodies we have.
His life was hastening apace. While we are living, every day, like the
shuttle, leaves a thread behind: many weave the spider's web, which will
fail, [Job 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014.md). But if, while we
live, we live unto the Lord, in works of faith and labours of love, we
shall have the benefit, for every man shall reap as he sowed, and wear
as he wove.

[Job 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 7:7</span></span>

Plain truths as to the shortness and vanity of man's life, and the
certainty of death, do us good, when we think and speak of them with
application to ourselves. Dying is done but once, and therefore it had
need be well done. An error here is past retrieve. Other clouds arise,
but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of men is raised
up, but the former generation vanishes away. Glorified saints shall
return no more to the cares and sorrows of their houses; nor condemned
sinners to the gaieties and pleasures of their houses. It concerns us to
secure a better place when we die. From these reasons Job might have
drawn a better conclusion than this, I will complain. When we have but a
few breaths to draw, we should spend them in the holy, gracious
breathings of faith and prayer; not in the noisome, noxious breathings
of sin and corruption. We have much reason to pray, that He who keeps
Israel, and neither slumbers nor sleeps, may keep us when we slumber and
sleep. Job covets to rest in his grave. Doubtless, this was his
infirmity; for though a good man would choose death rather than sin, yet
he should be content to live as long as God pleases, because life is our
opportunity of glorifying him, and preparing for heaven.

[Job 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 7:17</span></span>

Job reasons with God concerning his dealings with man. But in the midst
of this discourse, Job seems to have lifted up his thoughts to God with
some faith and hope. Observe the concern he is in about his sins. The
best men have to complain of sin; and the better they are, the more they
will complain of it. God is the Preserver of our lives, and the Saviour
of the souls of all that believe; but probably Job meant the Observer of
men, whose eyes are upon the ways and hearts of all men. We can hide
nothing from Him; let us plead guilty before his throne of grace, that
we may not be condemned at his judgment-seat. Job maintained, against
his friends, that he was not a hypocrite, not a wicked man, yet he owns
to his God, that he had sinned. The best must so acknowledge, before the
Lord. He seriously inquires how he might be at peace with God, and
earnestly begs forgiveness of his sins. He means more than the removing
of his outward trouble, and is earnest for the return of God's favour.
Wherever the Lord removes the guilt of sin, he breaks the power of sin.
To strengthen his prayer for pardon, Job pleads the prospect he had of
dying quickly. If my sins be not pardoned while I live, I am lost and
undone for ever. How wretched is sinful man without a knowledge of the
Saviour!
