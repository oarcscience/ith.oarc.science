### [Psalms Chapter 131](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 131:0</span></span>

The psalmist's humility. Believers encouraged to trust in God.

[Psalms 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 131:1</span></span>

The psalmist aimed at nothing high or great, but to be content in every
condition God allotted. Humble saints cannot think so well of themselves
as others think of them. The love of God reigning in the heart, will
subdue self-love. Where there is a proud heart, there is commonly a
proud look. To know God and our duty, is learning sufficiently high for
us. It is our wisdom not to meddle with that which does not belong to
us. He was well reconciled to every condition the Lord placed him in. He
had been as humble as a little child about the age of weaning, and as
far from aiming at high things; as entirely at God's disposal, as the
child at the disposal of the mother or nurse. We must become as little
children, [Mat 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003). Our hearts are
desirous of worldly things, cry for them, and are fond of them; but, by
the grace of God, a soul that is made holy, is weaned from these things.
The child is cross and fretful while in the weaning; but in a day or two
it cares no longer for milk, and it can bear stronger food. Thus does a
converted soul quiet itself under the loss of what it loved, and
disappointments in what it hoped for, and is easy whatever happens. When
our condition is not to our mind, we must bring our mind to our
condition; then we are easy to ourselves and all about us; then our
souls are as a weaned child. And thus the psalmist recommends confidence
in God, to all the Israel of God, from his own experience. It is good to
hope, and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord under every
trial.
