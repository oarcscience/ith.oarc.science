This epistle of James is one of the most instructive writings in the New
Testament. Being chiefly directed against particular errors at that time
brought in among the Jewish Christians, it does not contain the same
full doctrinal statements as the other epistles, but it presents an
admirable summary of the practical duties of all believers. The leading
truths of Christianity are set forth throughout; and on attentive
consideration, it will be found entirely to agree with St. Paul's
statements concerning grace and justification, while it abounds with
earnest exhortations to the patience of hope and obedience of faith and
love, interspersed with warnings, reproofs, and encouragements,
according to the characters addressed. The truths laid down are very
serious, and necessary to be maintained; and the rules for practice
ought to be observed in all times. In Christ there are no dead and
sapless branches, faith is not an idle grace; wherever it is, it brings
forth fruit in works.
