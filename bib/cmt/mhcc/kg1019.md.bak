<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 19:1</span></span>

Jezebel sent Elijah a threatening message. Carnal hearts are hardened
and enraged against God, by that which should convince and conquer them.
Great faith is not always alike strong. He might be serviceable to
Israel at this time, and had all reason to depend upon God's protection,
while doing God's work; yet he flees. His was not the deliberate desire
of grace, as Paul's, to depart and be with Christ. God thus left Elijah
to himself, to show that when he was bold and strong, it was in the
Lord, and the power of his might; but of himself he was no better than
his fathers. God knows what he designs us for, though we do not, what
services, what trials, and he will take care that we are furnished with
grace sufficient.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 19:9</span></span>

The question God put, What doest thou here, Elijah? is a reproof. It
concerns us often to ask whether we are in our place, and in the way of
our duty. Am I where I should be? whither God calls me, where my
business lies, and where I may be useful? He complained of the people,
and their obstinacy in sin; I only am left. Despair of success hinders
many a good enterprise. Did Elijah come hither to meet with God? he
shall find that God will meet him. The wind, and earthquake, and fire,
did not make him cover his face, but the still voice did. Gracious souls
are more affected by the tender mercies of the Lord, than by his
terrors. The mild voice of Him who speaks from the cross, or the
mercy-seat, is accompanied with peculiar power in taking possession of
the heart.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 19:14</span></span>

God repeated the question, What doest thou here? Then he complained of
his discouragement; and whither should God's prophets go with their
complaints of that kind, but to their Master? The Lord gave him an
answer. He declares that the wicked house of Ahab shall be rooted out,
that the people of Israel shall be punished for their sins; and he shows
that Elijah was not left alone as he had supposed, and also that a
helper should at once be raised up for him. Thus all his complaints are
answered and provided for. God's faithful ones are often his hidden
ones, [Psa 83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003.md), and the visible
church is scarcely to be seen: the wheat is lost in chaff, and the gold
in dross, till the sifting, refining, separating day comes. The Lord
knows them that are his, though we do not; he sees in secret. When we
come to heaven we shall miss many whom we thought to have met there; we
shall meet many whom we little thought to have met there. God's love
often proves larger than man's charity, and far more extended.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 19:19</span></span>

Elijah found Elisha by Divine direction, not in the schools of the
prophets, but in the field; not reading, or praying, or sacrificing, but
ploughing. Idleness is no man's honour, nor is husbandry any man's
disgrace. An honest calling in the world, does not put us out of the way
of our heavenly calling, any more than it did Elisha. His heart was
touched by the Holy Spirit, and he was ready to leave all to attend
Elijah. It is in a day of power that Christ's subjects are made willing;
nor would any come to Christ unless they were thus drawn. It was a
discouraging time for prophets to set out in. A man that had consulted
with flesh and blood, would not be fond of Elijah's mantle; yet Elisha
cheerfully leaves all to accompany him. When the Saviour said to one and
to another, Follow me, the dearest friends and most profitable
occupations were cheerfully left, and the most arduous duties done from
love to his name. May we, in like manner, feel the energy of his grace
working in us mightily, and by unreserved submission at once, may we
make our calling and election sure.
