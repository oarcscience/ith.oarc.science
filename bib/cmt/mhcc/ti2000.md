[2 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001)

The first design of this epistle seems to have been, to apprize Timothy
of what had occurred during the imprisonment of the apostle, and to
request him to come to Rome. But being uncertain whether he should be
suffered to live to see him, Paul gives a variety of advices and
encouragements, for the faithful discharge of his ministerial duties. As
this was a private epistle written to St. Paul's most intimate friend,
under the miseries of imprisonment, and in the near prospect of death,
it shows the temper and character of the apostle, and contains
convincing proofs that he sincerely believed the doctrines he preached.
