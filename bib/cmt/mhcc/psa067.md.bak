### [Psalms Chapter 67](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 67:0</span></span>

A prayer for the enlargement of Christ's kingdom.

[Psalms 67:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 67:1</span></span>

All our happiness comes from God's mercy; therefore the first thing
prayed for is, God be merciful to us, to us sinners, and pardon our
sins. Pardon is conveyed by God's blessing, and secured in that. If we,
by faith, walk with God, we may hope that his face will shine on us. The
psalmist passes on to a prayer for the conversion of the Gentiles, which
shows that the Old Testament saints desired that their advantages might
also be enjoyed by others. And many Scripture prophecies and promises
are wrapped up in prayers: the answer to the prayer of the church is as
sure as the performance of God's promises. The joy wished to the
nations, is holy joy. Let them be glad that by his providence the Lord
will overrule the affairs of kingdoms; that even the kingdoms of this
world shall became the kingdom of the Lord, and of his Christ. Then is
declared a joyful prospect of all good when God shall do this. The
success of the gospel brings outward mercies with it; righteousness
exalts a nation. The blessing of the Lord sweetens all our
creature-comforts to us, and makes them comforts indeed. All the world
shall be brought to worship Him. When the gospel begins to spread, it
shall go forward more and more, till it reaches to the ends of the
earth. It is good to cast in our lot with those that are the blessed of
the Lord. If nothing had been spoken in Scripture respecting the
conversion of the heathen, we might think it vain to attempt so hopeless
a work. But when we see with what confidence it is declared in the
Scriptures, we may engage in missionary labours, assured that God will
fulfil his own word. And shall we be backward to make known to the
heathen the knowledge with which we are favoured, and the salvation we
profess to glory in? They cannot learn unless they are taught. Then let
us go forward in the strength of the Lord, and look to him to accompany
the word the Holy Ghost; then Satan's kingdom shall be destroyed, and
the kingdom of our Redeemer established.
