### [Amos Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 2:0</span></span>

([Amo 2:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001).md) Judgments against Moab
and Judah.

([Amo 2:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009).md) The ingratitude and ruin
of Israel.

[Amos 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 2:1</span></span>

The evil passions of the heart break out in various forms; but the Lord
looks to our motives, as well as our conduct. Those that deal cruelly,
shall be cruelly dealt with. Other nations were reckoned with for
injuries done to men; Judah is reckoned with for dishonour done to God.
Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up to strong
delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they were the lies,
the idols, after which their fathers walked. The worst abominations and
most grievous oppressions have been committed by some of the professed
worshippers of the Lord. Such conduct leads many to unbelief and vile
idolatry.

[Amos 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 2:9</span></span>

We need often to be reminded of the mercies we have received; which add
much to the evil of the sins we have committed. They had helps for their
souls, which taught them how to make good use of their earthly
enjoyments, and were therefore more valuable. Faithful ministers are
great blessings to any people; but it is God that raises them up to be
so. Sinners' own consciences will witness that he has not been wanting
to them in the means of grace. They did what they could to lead
believers aside. Satan and his agents are busy to corrupt the minds of
young people who look heavenward; they overcome many by drawing them to
the love of mirth and pleasure, and into drinking company. Multitudes of
young men who bade fair as professors of religion, have erred through
strong drink, and have been undone for ever. The Lord complains of sin,
especially the sins of his professing people, as a burden to him. And
though his long-suffering be tired, his power is not, and so the sinner
will find to his cost. When men reject God's word, adding obstinacy to
sin, and this becomes the general character of a people, they will be
given up to misery, notwithstanding all their boasted power and
resources. May we then humble ourselves before the Lord, for all our
ingratitude and unfaithfulness.
