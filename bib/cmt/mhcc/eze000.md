### [Ezekiel Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

Ezekiel was one of the priests; he was carried captive to Chaldea with
Jehoiachin. All his prophecies appear to have been delivered in that
country, at some place north of Babylon. Their chief object appears to
have been to comfort his brethren in captivity. He is directed to warn
of the dreadful calamities coming upon Judea, particularly upon the
false prophets, and the neighbouring nations. Also to announce the
future restoration of Israel and Judah from their several dispersions,
and their happy state in their latter days, under the Messiah. Much of
Christ will be found in this book, especially in the conclusion.
