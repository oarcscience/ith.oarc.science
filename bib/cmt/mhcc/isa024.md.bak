### [Isaiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 24:0</span></span>

([Isa 24:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001).md) The desolation of the
land.

([Isa 24:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013).md) A few shall be
preserved.

([Isa 24:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016).md) God's kingdom advanced
by his judgments.

[Isaiah 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 24:1</span></span>

All whose treasures and happiness are laid up on earth, will soon be
brought to want and misery. It is good to apply to ourselves what the
Scripture says of the vanity and vexation of spirit which attend all
things here below. Sin has turned the earth upside down; the earth is
become quite different to man, from what it was when God first made it
to be his habitation. It is, at the best, like a flower, which withers
in the hands of those that please themselves with it, and lay it in
their bosoms. The world we live in is a world of disappointment, a vale
of tears; the children of men in it are but of few days, and full of
trouble, See the power of God's curse, how it makes all empty, and lays
waste all ranks and conditions. Sin brings these calamities upon the
earth; it is polluted by the sins of men, therefore it is made desolate
by God's judgments. Carnal joy will soon be at end, and the end of it is
heaviness. God has many ways to imbitter wine and strong drink to those
who love them; distemper of body, anguish of mind, and the ruin of the
estate, will make strong drink bitter, and the delights of sense
tasteless. Let men learn to mourn for sin, and rejoice in God; then no
man, no event, can take their joy from them.

[Isaiah 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 24:13</span></span>

There shall be a remnant preserved from the general ruin, and it shall
be a devout and pious remnant. These few are dispersed; like the
gleanings of the olive tree, hid under the leaves. The Lord knows those
that are his; the world does not. When the mirth of carnal worldlings
ceases, the joy of the saints is as lively as ever, because the covenant
of grace, the fountain of their comforts, and the foundation of their
hopes, never fails. Those who rejoice in the Lord can rejoice in
tribulation, and by faith may triumph when all about them are in tears.
They encourage their fellow-sufferers to do likewise, even those who are
in the furnace of affliction. Or, in the valleys, low, dark, miry
places. In every fire, even the hottest, in every place, even the
remotest, let us keep up our good thoughts of God. If none of these
trials move us, then we glorify the Lord in the fires.

[Isaiah 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 24:16</span></span>

Believers may be driven into the uttermost parts of the earth; but they
are singing, not sighing. Here is terror to sinners; the prophet laments
the miseries he saw breaking in like a torrent; and the small number of
believers. He foresees that sin would abound. The meaning is plain, that
evil pursues sinners. Unsteady, uncertain are all these things. Worldly
men think to dwell in the earth as in a palace, as in a castle; but it
shall be removed like a cottage, like a lodge put up for the night. It
shall fall and not rise again; but there shall be new heavens and a new
earth, in which shall dwell nothing but righteousness. Sin is a burden
to the whole creation; it is a heavy burden, under which it groans now,
and will sink at last. The high ones, that are puffed up with their
grandeur, that think themselves out of the reach of danger, God will
visit for their pride and cruelty. Let us judge nothing before the time,
though some shall be visited. None in this world should be secure,
though their condition be ever so prosperous; nor need any despair,
though their condition be ever so deplorable. God will be glorified in
all this. But the mystery of Providence is not yet finished. The ruin of
the Redeemer's enemies must make way for his kingdom, and then the Sun
of Righteousness will appear in full glory. Happy are those who take
warning by the sentence against others; every impenitent sinner will
sink under his transgression, and rise no more, while believers enjoy
everlasting bliss.
