[Matthew 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 4:1</span></span>

Concerning Christ's temptation, observe, that directly after he was
declared to be the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world, he was
tempted; great privileges, and special tokens of Divine favour, will not
secure any from being tempted. But if the Holy Spirit witness to our
being adopted as children of God, that will answer all the suggestions
of the evil spirit. Christ was directed to the combat. If we presume
upon our own strength, and tempt the devil to tempt us, we provoke God
to leave us to ourselves. Others are tempted, when drawn aside of their
own lust, and enticed, [Jam 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014.md); but
our Lord Jesus had no corrupt nature, therefore he was tempted only by
the devil. In the temptation of Christ it appears that our enemy is
subtle, spiteful, and very daring; but he can be resisted. It is a
comfort to us that Christ suffered, being tempted; for thus it appears
that our temptations, if not yielded to, are not sins, they are
afflictions only. Satan aimed in all his temptations, to bring Christ to
sin against God. 1. He tempted him to despair of his Father's goodness,
and to distrust his Father's care concerning him. It is one of the wiles
of Satan to take advantage of our outward condition; and those who are
brought into straits have need to double their guard. Christ answered
all the temptations of Satan with "It is written;" to set us an example,
he appealed to what was written in the Scriptures. This method we must
take, when at any time we are tempted to sin. Let us learn not to take
any wrong courses for our supply, when our wants are ever so pressing:
in some way or other the Lord will provide. 2. Satan tempted Christ to
presume upon his Father's power and protection, in a point of safety.
Nor are any extremes more dangerous than despair and presumption,
especially in the affairs of our souls. Satan has no objection to holy
places as the scene of his assaults. Let us not, in any place, be off
our watch. The holy city is the place, where he does, with the greatest
advantage, tempt men to pride and presumption. All high places are
slippery places; advancements in the world makes a man a mark for Satan
to shoot his fiery darts at. Is Satan so well versed in Scripture as to
be able to quote it readily? He is so. It is possible for a man to have
his head full of Scripture notions, and his mouth full of Scripture
expressions, while his heart is full of bitter enmity to God and to all
goodness. Satan misquoted the words. If we go out of our way, out of the
way of our duty, we forfeit the promise, and put ourselves out of God's
protection. This passage, [Deu 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md),
made against the tempter, therefore he left out part. This promise is
firm and stands good. But shall we continue in sin, that grace may
abound? No. 3. Satan tempted Christ to idolatry with the offer of the
kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them. The glory of the world is
the most charming temptation to the unthinking and unwary; by that men
are most easily imposed upon. Christ was tempted to worship Satan. He
rejected the proposal with abhorrence. "Get thee hence, Satan!" Some
temptations are openly wicked; and they are not merely to be opposed,
but rejected at once. It is good to be quick and firm in resisting
temptation. If we resist the devil he will flee from us. But the soul
that deliberates is almost overcome. We find but few who can decidedly
reject such baits as Satan offers; yet what is a man profited if he gain
the whole world, and lose his own soul? Christ was succoured after the
temptation, for his encouragement to go on in his undertaking, and for
our encouragement to trust in him; for as he knew, by experience, what
it was to suffer, being tempted, so he knew what it was to be succoured,
being tempted; therefore we may expect, not only that he will feel for
his tempted people, but that he will come to them with seasonable
relief.

[Matthew 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 4:12</span></span>

It is just with God to take the gospel and the means of grace, from
those that slight them and thrust them away. Christ will not stay long
where he is not welcome. Those who are without Christ, are in the dark.
They were sitting in this condition, a contented posture; they chose it
rather than light; they were willingly ignorant. When the gospel comes,
light comes; when it comes to any place, when it comes to any soul, it
makes day there. Light discovers and directs; so does the gospel. The
doctrine of repentance is right gospel doctrine. Not only the austere
John Baptist, but the gracious Jesus, preached repentance. There is
still the same reason to do so. The kingdom of heaven was not reckoned
to be fully come, till the pouring out of the Holy Spirit after Christ's
ascension.

[Matthew 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 4:18</span></span>

When Christ began to preach, he began to gather disciples, who should be
hearers, and afterwards preachers of his doctrine, who should be
witnesses of his miracles, and afterwards testify concerning them. He
went not to Herod's court, not to Jerusalem, among the chief priests and
the elders, but to the sea of Galilee, among the fishermen. The same
power which called Peter and Andrew, could have wrought upon Annas and
Caiaphas, for with God nothing is impossible. But Christ chooses the
foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Diligence in an honest
calling is pleasing to Christ, and it is no hinderance to a holy life.
Idle people are more open to the temptations of Satan than to the calls
of God. It is a happy and hopeful thing to see children careful of their
parents, and dutiful. When Christ comes, it is good to be found doing.
Am I in Christ? is a very needful question to ask ourselves; and, next
to that, Am I in my calling? They had followed Christ before, as common
disciples, [Joh 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#037.md); now they must
leave their calling. Those who would follow Christ aright, must, at his
command, leave all things to follow him, must be ready to part with
them. This instance of the power of the Lord Jesus encourages us to
depend upon his grace. He speaks, and it is done.

[Matthew 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 4:23</span></span>

Wherever Christ went, he confirmed his Divine mission by miracles, which
were emblems of the healing power of his doctrine, and the influences of
the Spirit which accompanied it. We do not now find the Saviour's
miraculous healing power in our bodies; but if we are cured by medicine,
the praise is equally his. Three general words are here used. He healed
every sickness or disease; none was too bad; none too hard, for Christ
to heal with a word. Three diseases are named; the palsy, which is the
greatest weakness of the body; lunacy, which is the greatest malady of
the mind; and possession of the devil, which is the greatest misery and
calamity of both; yet Christ healed all, and by thus curing bodily
diseases, showed that his great errand into the world was to cure
spiritual maladies. Sin is the sickness, disease, and torment of the
soul: Christ came to take away sin, and so to heal the soul.
