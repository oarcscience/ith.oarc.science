### [Jeremiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 9:0</span></span>

([Jer 9:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001)) The people are
corrected, Jerusalem is destroyed.

([Jer 9:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012)) The captives suffer in
a foreign land.

([Jer 9:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023)) God's loving-kindness,
He threatens the enemies of his people.

[Jeremiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 9:1</span></span>

Jeremiah wept much, yet wished he could weep more, that he might rouse
the people to a due sense of the hand of God. But even the desert,
without communion with God, through Christ Jesus, and the influences of
the Holy Spirit, must be a place for temptation and evil; while, with
these blessings, we may live in holiness in crowded cities. The people
accustomed their tongues to lies. So false were they, that a brother
could not be trusted. In trading and bargaining they said any thing for
their own advantage, though they knew it to be false. But God marked
their sin. Where no knowledge of God is, what good can be expected? He
has many ways of turning a fruitful land into barrenness for the
wickedness of those that dwell therein.

[Jeremiah 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 9:12</span></span>

In Zion the voice of joy and praise used to be heard, while the people
kept close to God; but sin has altered the sound, it is now the voice of
lamentation. Unhumbled hearts lament their calamity, but not their sin,
which is the cause of it. Let the doors be shut ever so fast, death
steals upon us. It enters the palaces of princes and great men, though
stately, strongly built, and guarded. Nor are those more safe that are
abroad; death cuts off even the children from without, and the young men
from the streets. Hearken to the word of the Lord, and mourn with godly
sorrow. This alone can bring true comfort; and it can turn the heaviest
afflictions into precious mercies.

[Jeremiah 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 9:23</span></span>

In this world of sin and sorrow, ending soon in death and judgement, how
foolish for men to glory in their knowledge, health, strength, riches,
or in any thing which leaves them under the dominion of sin and the
wrath of God! and of which an account must hereafter be rendered; it
will but increase their misery. Those are the true Israel who worship
God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in
the flesh. Let us prize the distinction which comes from God, and will
last for ever. Let us seek it diligently.
