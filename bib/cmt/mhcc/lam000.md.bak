It is evident that Jeremiah was the author of the Lamentations which
bear his name. The book was not written till after the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. May we be led to consider sin as the cause
of all our calamities, and under trials exercise submission, repentance,
faith, and prayer, with the hope of promised deliverance through God's
mercy.
