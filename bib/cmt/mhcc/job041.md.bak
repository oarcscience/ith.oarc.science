### [Job Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

Concerning Leviathan.

[Job 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 41:1</span></span>

The description of the Leviathan, is yet further to convince Job of his
own weakness, and of God's almighty power. Whether this Leviathan be a
whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how
unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in
that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of
Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a
humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty;
take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give
all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every
good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with
the Lord.
