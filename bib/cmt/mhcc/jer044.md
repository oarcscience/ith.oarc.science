### [Jeremiah Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 44:0</span></span>

([Jer 44:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001).md) The Jews in Egypt
persist in idolatry.

([Jer 44:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015).md) They refuse to reform.

([Jer 44:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#020).md) Jeremiah then
denounces destruction upon them.

[Jeremiah 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 44:1</span></span>

God reminds the Jews of the sins that brought desolations upon Judah. It
becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with all seriousness: Oh, do
not do it! If you love God, do not, for it is provoking to him; if you
love your own souls, do not, for it is destructive to them. Let
conscience do this for us in the hour of temptation. The Jews whom God
sent into the land of the Chaldeans, were there, by the power of God's
grace, weaned from idolatry; but those who went by their own perverse
will into the land of the Egyptians, were there more attached than ever
to their idolatries. When we thrust ourselves without cause or call into
places of temptation, it is just with God to leave us to ourselves. If
we walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us. The most awful
miseries to which men are exposed, are occasioned by the neglect of
offered salvation.

[Jeremiah 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 44:15</span></span>

These daring sinners do not attempt excuses, but declare they will do
that which is forbidden. Those who disobey God, commonly grow worse and
worse, and the heart is more hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Here
is the real language of the rebellious heart. Even the afflictions which
should have parted them from their sins, were taken so as to confirm
them in their sins. It is sad when those who should quicken each other
to what is good, and so help one another to heaven, harden each other in
sin, and so ripen one another for hell. To mingle idolatry with Divine
worship, and to reject the mediation of Christ, are provoking to God,
and ruinous to men. All who worship images, or honour saints, and
angels, and the queen of heaven, should recollect what came from the
idolatrous practices of the Jews.

[Jeremiah 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 44:20</span></span>

Whatever evil comes upon us, it is because we have sinned against the
Lord; we should therefore stand in awe, and sin not. Since they were
determined to persist in their idolatry, God would go on to punish them.
What little remains of religion were among them, would be lost. The
creature-comforts and confidences from which we promise ourselves most,
may fail as soon as those from which we promise ourselves least; and all
are what God makes them, not what we fancy them to be. Well-grounded
hopes of our having a part in the Divine mercy, are always united with
repentance and obedience.
