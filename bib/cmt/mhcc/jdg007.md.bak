[Judges 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 7:1</span></span>

God provides that the praise of victory may be wholly to himself, by
appointing only three hundred men to be employed. Activity and prudence
go with dependence upon God for help in our lawful undertakings. When
the Lord sees that men would overlook him, and through unbelief, would
shrink from perilous services, or that through pride they would vaunt
themselves against him, he will set them aside, and do his work by other
instruments. Pretences will be found by many, for deserting the cause
and escaping the cross. But though a religious society may thus be made
fewer in numbers, yet it will gain as to purity, and may expect an
increased blessing from the Lord. God chooses to employ such as are not
only well affected, but zealously affected in a good thing. They grudged
not at the liberty of the others who were dismissed. In doing the duties
required by God, we must not regard the forwardness or backwardness of
others, nor what they do, but what God looks for at our hands. He is a
rare person who can endure that others should excel him in gifts or
blessings, or in liberty; so that we may say, it is by the special grace
of God that we regard what God says to us, and not look to men what they
do.

[Judges 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 7:9</span></span>

The dream seemed to have little meaning in it; but the interpretation
evidently proved the whole to be from the Lord, and discovered that the
name of Gideon had filled the Midianites with terror. Gideon took this
as a sure pledge of success; without delay he worshipped and praised
God, and returned with confidence to his three hundred men. Wherever we
are, we may speak to God, and worship him. God must have the praise of
that which encourages our faith. And his providence must be acknowledged
in events, though small and seemingly accidental.

[Judges 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 7:16</span></span>

This method of defeating the Midianites may be alluded to, as
exemplifying the destruction of the devil's kingdom in the world, by the
preaching of the everlasting gospel, the sounding that trumpet, and the
holding forth that light out of earthen vessels, for such are the
ministers of the gospel, [Co2 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md),
[Co2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md). God chose the foolish things
of the world to confound the wise, a barley-cake to overthrow the tents
of Midian, that the excellency of the power might be of God only. The
gospel is a sword, not in the hand, but in the mouth: the sword of the
Lord and of Gideon; of God and Jesus Christ, of Him that sits on the
throne and the Lamb. The wicked are often led to avenge the cause of God
upon each other, under the power of their delusions, and the fury of
their passions. See also how God often makes the enemies of the church
instruments to destroy one another; it is a pity that the church's
friends should ever act like them.

[Judges 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 7:23</span></span>

Two chief commanders of the host of Midian were taken and slain by the
men of Ephraim. It were to be wished that we all did as these did, and
that where help is needed, that it were willingly and readily performed
by another. And that if there were any excellent and profitable matter
begun, we were willing to have fellow-labourers to the finishing and
perfecting the same, and not, as often, hinder one another.
