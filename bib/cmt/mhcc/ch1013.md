### [1 Chronicles Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 13:0</span></span>

([Ch1 13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001)) David consults about the
ark.

([Ch1 13:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006)) The removal of the ark.

[1 Chronicles 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 13:1</span></span>

David said not, What magnificent thing shall I do now? or, What pleasant
thing? but, What pious thing? that he might have the comfort and benefit
of that sacred oracle. Let us bring the ark to us, that it may be a
blessing to us. Those who honour God, profit themselves. It is the
wisdom of those setting out in the world, to take God's ark with them.
Those are likely to go on in the favour of God, who begin in the fear of
God.

[1 Chronicles 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 13:6</span></span>

Let the sin of Uzza warn all to take heed of presumption, rashness, and
irreverence, in dealing with holy things; and let none think that a good
design will justify a bad action. Let the punishment of Uzza teach us
not to dare to trifle with God in our approaches to him; yet let us,
through Christ, come boldly to the throne of grace. If the gospel be to
some a savour of death unto death, as the ark was to Uzza, yet let us
receive it in the love of it, and it will be to us a savour of life unto
life.
