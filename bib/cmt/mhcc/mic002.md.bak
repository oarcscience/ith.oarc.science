### [Micah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 2:0</span></span>

([Mic 2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001).md) The sins and desolations
of Israel.

([Mic 2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006).md) Their evil practices.

([Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md), [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013).md) A promise of restoration.

[Micah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 2:1</span></span>

Woe to the people that devise evil during the night, and rise early to
carry it into execution! It is bad to do mischief on a sudden thought,
much worse to do it with design and forethought. It is of great moment
to improve and employ hours of retirement and solitude in a proper
manner. If covetousness reigns in the heart, compassion is banished; and
when the heart is thus engaged, violence and fraud commonly occupy the
hands. The most haughty and secure in prosperity, are commonly most
ready to despair in adversity. Woe to those from whom God turns away!
Those are the sorest calamities which cut us off from the congregation
of the Lord, or cut us short in the enjoyment of its privileges.

[Micah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 2:6</span></span>

Since they say, "Prophesy not," God will take them at their word, and
their sin shall be their punishment. Let the physician no longer attend
the patient that will not be healed. Those are enemies, not only to God,
but to their country, who silence good ministers, and stop the means of
grace. What bonds will hold those who have no reverence for God's word?
Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land they have polluted. You shall
not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shall destroy
you. Apply this to our state in this present world. There is corruption
in the world through lust, and we should keep at a distance from it. It
is not our rest: it was designed for our passage, but not for our
portion; our inn, but not our home; here we have no continuing city; let
us therefore arise and depart, let us seek a continuing city above.
Since they will be deceived, let them be deceived. Teachers who
recommend self-indulgence by their doctrine and example, best suit such
sinners.

[Micah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 2:12</span></span>

These verses may refer to the captivity of Israel and Judah. But the
passage is also a prophecy of the conversion of the Jews to Christ. The
Lord would not only bring them from captivity, and multiply them, but
the Lord Jesus would open their way to God, by taking upon him the
nature of man, and by the work of his Spirit in their hearts, breaking
the fetters of Satan. Thus he has gone before, and the people follow,
breaking, in his strength, through the enemies that would stop their way
to heaven.
