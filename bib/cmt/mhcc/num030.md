### [Numbers Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 30:0</span></span>

([Num 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md), [Num
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002).md) Vows to be kept.

([Num 30:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003).md) The cases wherein vows
might be released.

[Numbers 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 30:1</span></span>

No man can be bound by his own promise to do what he is already, by the
Divine precept, forbidden to do. In other matters the command is, that
he shall not break his words, through he may change his mind.

[Numbers 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 30:3</span></span>

Two cases of vows are determined. The case of a daughter in her father's
house. When her vow comes to his knowledge, it is in his power either to
confirm it or do it away. The law is plain in the case of a wife. If her
husband allows her vow, though only by silence, it stands. If he
disallows it, her obligation to her husband takes place of it; for to
him she ought to be in subjection, as unto the Lord. The Divine law
consults the good order of families. It is fit that every man should
bear rule in his own house, and have his wife and children in
subjection; rather than that this great rule should be broken, or any
encouragement be given to inferior relations to break those bonds
asunder, God releases the obligation even of a solemn vow. So much does
religion secure the welfare of all societies; and in it the families of
the earth have a blessing.
