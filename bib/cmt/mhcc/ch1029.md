### [1 Chronicles Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 29:0</span></span>

([Ch1 29:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001).md) David induces the
princes and people to offer willingly.

([Ch1 29:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010).md) His thanksgiving and
prayer.

([Ch1 29:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#020).md) Solomon enthroned.

([Ch1 29:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#026).md) David's reign and
death.

[1 Chronicles 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 29:1</span></span>

What is done in works of piety and charity, should be done willingly,
not by constraint; for God loves a cheerful giver. David set a good
example. This David offered, not from constraint, or for show; but
because he had set his affection to the house of God, and thought he
could never do enough towards promoting that good work. Those who would
draw others to good, must lead the way themselves.

[1 Chronicles 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 29:10</span></span>

We cannot form a right idea of the magnificence of the temple, and the
buildings around it, about which such quantities of gold and silver were
employed. But the unsearchable riches of Christ exceed the splendour of
the temple, infinitely more than that surpassed the meanest cottage on
earth. Instead of boasting of these large oblations, David gave solemn
thanks to the Lord. All they gave for the Lord's temple was his own; if
they attempted to keep it, death would soon have removed them from it.
They only use they could make of it to their real advantage, was, to
consecrate it to the service of Him who gave it.

[1 Chronicles 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 29:20</span></span>

This great assembly joined with David in adoring God. Whoever is the
mouth of the congregation, those only have the benefit who join him, not
by bowing down the head, so much as by lifting up the soul. Solomon sat
on the throne of the Lord. Solomon's kingdom typified the kingdom of the
Messiah, whose throne is the throne of the Lord.

[1 Chronicles 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 29:26</span></span>

When we read the second book of Samuel, we could scarcely have expected
to behold David appear so illustrious in his closing scene. But his
repentance had been as remarkable as his sin; and his conduct during his
afflictions, and towards the end of his life, appears to have had a good
effect on his subjects. Blessed be God, even the chief of sinners may
hope for a glorious departure, when brought to repent and flee for
refuge to the Saviour's atoning blood. Let us mark the difference
between the spirit and character of the man after God's own heart,
living and dying, and those of worthless professors, who resemble him in
nothing but their sins, and who wickedly try to excuse their crimes by
his sins. Let us watch and pray, lest we be overcome by temptation, and
overtaken by sin, to the dishonour of God, and the wounding of our own
consciences. When we feel that we have offended, let us follow David's
example of repentance and patience, looking for a glorious resurrection,
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
