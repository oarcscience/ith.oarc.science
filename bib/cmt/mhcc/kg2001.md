### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 1:0</span></span>

([Kg2 1:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)) The revolt of
Moab-Sickness of Ahaziah, king of Israel.

([Kg2 1:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009)) Fire called from heaven
by Elijah-Death of Ahaziah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 1:1</span></span>

When Ahaziah rebelled against the Lord, Moab revolted from him. Sin
weakens and impoverishes us. Man's revolt from God is often punished by
the rebellion of those who owe subjection to him. Ahaziah fell through a
lattice, or railing. Wherever we go, there is but a step between us and
death. A man's house is his castle, but not to secure him against God's
judgments. The whole creation, which groans under the burden of man's
sin, will, at length, sink and break under the weight like this lattice.
He is never safe that has God for his enemy. Those that will not inquire
of the word of God for their comfort, shall hear it to their terror,
whether they will or no.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 1:9</span></span>

Elijah called for fire from heaven, to consume the haughty, daring
sinners; not to secure himself, but to prove his mission, and to reveal
the wrath of God from heaven, against the ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men. Elijah did this by a Divine impulse, yet our
Saviour would not allow the disciples to do the like, [Luk
9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054). The dispensation of the Spirit
and of grace by no means allowed it. Elijah was concerned for God's
glory, those for their own reputation. The Lord judges men's practices
by their principles, and his judgment is according to truth. The third
captain humbled himself, and cast himself upon the mercy of God and
Elijah. There is nothing to be got by contending with God; and those are
wise for themselves, who learn submission from the fatal end of
obstinacy in others. The courage of faith has often struck terror into
the heart of the proudest sinner. So thunderstruck is Ahaziah with the
prophet's words, that neither he, nor any about him, offer him violence.
Who can harm those whom God shelters? Many who think to prosper in sin,
are called hence like Ahaziah, when they do not expect it. All warns us
to seek the Lord while he may be found.
