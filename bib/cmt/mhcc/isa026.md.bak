### [Isaiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 26:0</span></span>

([Isa 26:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001).md) The Divine mercies
encourage to confidence in God.

([Isa 26:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005).md) His judgments.

([Isa 26:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012).md) His people exhorted to
wait upon Him.

([Isa 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md), [Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021).md) Deliverance promised.

[Isaiah 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 26:1</span></span>

"That day," seems to mean when the New Testament Babylon shall be
levelled with the ground. The unchangeable promise and covenant of the
Lord are the walls of the church of God. The gates of this city shall be
open. Let sinners then be encouraged to join to the Lord. Thou wilt keep
him in peace; in perfect peace, inward peace, outward peace, peace with
God, peace of conscience, peace at all times, in all events. Trust in
the Lord for that peace, that portion, which will be for ever. Whatever
we trust to the world for, it will last only for a moment; but those who
trust in God shall not only find in him, but shall receive from him,
strength that will carry them to that blessedness which is for ever. Let
us then acknowledge him in all our ways, and rely on him in all trials.

[Isaiah 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 26:5</span></span>

The way of the just is evenness, a steady course of obedience and holy
conversation. And it is their happiness that God makes their way plain
and easy. It is our duty, and will be our comfort, to wait for God, to
keep up holy desires toward him in the darkest and most discouraging
times. Our troubles must never turn us from God; and in the darkest,
longest night of affliction, with our souls must we desire him; and this
we must wait and pray to him for. We make nothing of our religion,
whatever our profession may be, if we do not make heart-work of it.
Though we come ever so early, we shall find God ready to receive us. The
intention of afflictions is to teach righteousness: blessed is the man
whom the Lord thus teaches. But sinners walk contrary to him. They will
go on in their evil ways, because they will not consider what a God he
is whose laws they persist in despising. Scorners and the secure will
shortly feel, what now they will not believe, that it is a fearful thing
to fall into the hands of the living God. They will not see the evil of
sin; but they shall see. Oh that they would abandon their sins, and turn
to the Lord, that he may have mercy upon them.

[Isaiah 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 26:12</span></span>

Every creature, every business, any way serviceable to our comfort, God
makes to be so; he makes that work for us which seemed to make against
us. They had been slaves of sin and Satan; but by the Divine grace they
were taught to look to be set free from all former masters. The cause
opposed to God and his kingdom will sink at last. See our need of
afflictions. Before, prayer came drop by drop; now they pour it out, it
comes now like water from a fountain. Afflictions bring us to secret
prayer. Consider Christ as the Speaker addressing his church. His
resurrection from the dead was an earnest of all the deliverance
foretold. The power of his grace, like the dew or rain, which causes the
herbs that seem dead to revive, would raise his church from the lowest
state. But we may refer to the resurrection of the dead, especially of
those united to Christ.

[Isaiah 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 26:20</span></span>

When dangers threaten, it is good to retire and lie hid; when we commend
ourselves to God to hide us, he will hide us either under heaven or in
heaven. Thus we shall be safe and happy in the midst of tribulations. It
is but for a short time, as it were for a little moment; when over, it
will seem as nothing. God's place is the mercy-seat; there he delights
to be: when he punishes, he comes out of his place, for he has no
pleasure in the death of sinners. But there is hardly any truth more
frequently repeated in Scripture, than God's determined purpose to
punish the workers of iniquity. Let us keep close to the Lord, and
separate from the world; and let us seek comfort in secret prayer. A day
of vengeance is coming on the world, and before it comes we are to
expect tribulation and suffering. But because the Christian looks for
these things, shall he be restless and dismayed? No, let him repose
himself in his God. Abiding in him, the believer is safe. And let us
wait patiently the fulfilling of God's promises.
