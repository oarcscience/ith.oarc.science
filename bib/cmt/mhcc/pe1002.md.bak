### [1 Peter Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 2:1</span></span>

Evil-speaking is a sign of malice and guile in the heart; and hinders
our profiting by the word of God. A new life needs suitable food.
Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are
able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God.
Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he
has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this
life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a
Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security,
the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence
of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services.
All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to
others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual
sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except
through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the
whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the
weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is
everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be
built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive
themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to
partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world
were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may
hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul
makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All
true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people
distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice;
which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such,
and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross
darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy,
pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the
Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast
their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown
mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man
have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works
repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not
dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved
by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk
as his people.

[1 Peter 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 2:11</span></span>

Even the best of men, the chosen generation, the people of God, need to
be exhorted to keep from the worst sins. And fleshly lusts are most
destructive to man's soul. It is a sore judgment to be given up to them.
There is a day of visitation coming, wherein God may call to repentance
by his word and his grace; then many will glorify God, and the holy
lives of his people will have promoted the happy change.

[1 Peter 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 2:13</span></span>

A Christian conversation must be honest; which it cannot be, if there is
not a just and careful discharge of all relative duties: the apostle
here treats of these distinctly. Regard to those duties is the will of
God, consequently, the Christian's duty, and the way to silence the base
slanders of ignorant and foolish men. Christians must endeavour, in all
relations, to behave aright, that they do not make their liberty a cloak
or covering for any wickedness, or for the neglect of duty; but they
must remember that they are servants of God.

[1 Peter 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 2:18</span></span>

Servants in those days generally were slaves, and had heathen masters,
who often used them cruelly; yet the apostle directs them to be subject
to the masters placed over them by Providence, with a fear to dishonour
or offend God. And not only to those pleased with reasonable service,
but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconduct
of one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; the
servant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfully
froward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to their
servants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, for
professed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? But
if when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionate
heathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes of
revenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to God
as a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him.
Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience under
sufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, and
thereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us. The
fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holy life
of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerful
motives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrection of
Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as a
sacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our souls are
cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. His misery;
he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and from the flock,
and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here is the recovery
by conversion; they are now returned as the effect of Divine grace. This
return is, from all their errors and wanderings, to Christ. Sinners,
before their conversion, are always going astray; their life is a
continued error.
