### [Numbers Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

The order of the tribes in their tents.

[Numbers 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 2:1</span></span>

The tribes were to encamp about the tabernacle, which was to be in the
midst of them. It was a token of God's gracious presence. Yet they were
to pitch their tents afar off, in reverence to the sanctuary. The
children of Israel put themselves in their posts, without murmuring or
disputing; and as it was their safety, so it was their beauty. It is our
duty and interest to be contented with the place allotted to us, and to
endeavour to occupy it in a proper manner, without envying or murmuring;
without ambition or covetousness. Thus the gospel church ought to be
compact, according to the Scripture model, every one knowing and keeping
his place; and then all that wish well to the church rejoice, beholding
their order, [Col 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md).
