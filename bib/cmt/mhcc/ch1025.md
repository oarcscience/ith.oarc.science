### [1 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

The singers and musicians.

[1 Chronicles 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 25:1</span></span>

David put those in order who were appointed to be singers and musicians
in the temple. To prophesy, in this place, means praising God with great
earnestness and devout affections, under the influences of the Holy
Spirit. In raising these affections, poetry and music were employed. If
the Spirit of God do not put life and fervour into our devotions, they
will, however ordered, be a lifeless, worthless form.
