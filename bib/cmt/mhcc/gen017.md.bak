### [Genesis Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 17:0</span></span>

([Gen 17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001).md) God renews the covenant
with Abram.

([Gen 17:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007).md) Circumcision
instituted.

([Gen 17:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#015).md) Sarai's name changed,
Isaac promised.

([Gen 17:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#023).md) Abraham and his family
are circumcised.

[Genesis 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 17:1</span></span>

The covenant was to be accomplished in due time. The promised Seed was
Christ, and Christians in him. And all who are of faith are blessed with
faithful Abram, being partakers of the same covenant blessings. In token
of this covenant his name was changed from Abram, "a high father," to
Abraham, "the father of a multitude." All that the Christian world
enjoys, it is indebted for to Abraham and his Seed.

[Genesis 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 17:7</span></span>

The covenant of grace is from everlasting in the counsels of it, and to
everlasting in the consequences of it. The token of the covenant was
circumcision. It is here said to be the covenant which Abraham and his
seed must keep. Those who will have the Lord to be to them a God, must
resolve to be to him a people. Not only Abraham and Isaac, and his
posterity by Isaac, were to be circumcised, but also Ishmael and the
bond-servants. It sealed not only the covenant of the land of Canaan to
Isaac's posterity, but of heaven, through Christ, to the whole church of
God. The outward sign is for the visible church; the inward seal of the
Spirit is peculiar to those whom God knows to be believers, and he alone
can know them. The religious observance of this institution was
required, under a very severe penalty. It is dangerous to make light of
Divine institutions, and to live in the neglect of them. The covenant in
question was one that involved great blessings for the world in all
future ages. Even the blessedness of Abraham himself, and all the
rewards conferred upon him, were for Christ's sake. Abraham was
justified, as we have seen, not by his own righteousness, but by faith
in the promised Messiah.

[Genesis 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 17:15</span></span>

Here is the promise made to Abraham of a son by Sarai, in whom the
promise made to him should be fulfilled. The assurance of this promise
was the change of Sarai's name into Sarah. Sarai signifies my princess,
as if her honour were confined to one family only; Sarah signifies a
princess. The more favours God confers upon us, the more low we should
be in our own eyes. Abraham showed great joy; he laughed, it was a
laughter of delight, not of distrust. Now it was that Abraham rejoiced
to see Christ's day; now he saw it and was glad, [Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md). Abraham, dreading lest Ishmael
should be abandoned and forsaken of God, put up a petition on his
behalf. God gives us leave in prayer to be particular in making known
our requests. Whatever is our care and fear, should be spread before God
in prayer. It is the duty of parents to pray for their children, and the
great thing we should desire is, that they may be kept in covenant with
Him, and may have grace to walk before him in uprightness. Common
blessings are secured to Ishmael. Outward good things are often given to
those children of godly parents who are born after the flesh, for their
parents' sake. Covenant blessings are reserved for Isaac, and
appropriated to him.

[Genesis 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 17:23</span></span>

Abraham and all his family were circumcised; so receiving the token of
the covenant, and distinguishing themselves from other families that had
no part nor lot in the matter. It was an implicit obedience; he did as
God said unto him, and did not ask why or wherefore. He did it because
God bade him. It was a speedy obedience; in the self-same day. Sincere
obedience makes no delay. Not only the doctrines of revelation, but the
seals of God's covenant, remind us that we are guilty, polluted sinners.
They show us our need of the blood of atonement; they point to the
promised Saviour, and teach us to exercise faith in him. They show us
that without regeneration, and sanctification by his Spirit, and the
mortification of our corrupt and carnal inclinations, we cannot be in
covenant with God. But let us remember that the true circumcision is
that of the heart, by the Spirit, [Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md). Both under the old and new
dispensation, many have had the outward profession, and the outward
seal, who were never sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise.
