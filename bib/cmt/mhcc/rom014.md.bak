### [Romans Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 14:0</span></span>

([Rom 14:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001).md) The Jewish converts
cautioned against judging, and Gentile believers against despising one
the other.

([Rom 14:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014).md) And the Gentiles
exhorted to take heed of giving offence in their use of indifferent
things.

[Romans 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 14:1</span></span>

Differences of opinion prevailed even among the immediate followers of
Christ and their disciples. Nor did St. Paul attempt to end them.
Compelled assent to any doctrine, or conformity to outward observances
without being convinced, would be hypocritical and of no avail. Attempts
for producing absolute oneness of mind among Christians would be
useless. Let not Christian fellowship be disturbed with strifes of
words. It will be good for us to ask ourselves, when tempted to disdain
and blame our brethren; Has not God owned them? and if he has, dare I
disown them? Let not the Christian who uses his liberty, despise his
weak brother as ignorant and superstitious. Let not the scrupulous
believer find fault with his brother, for God accepted him, without
regarding the distinctions of meats. We usurp the place of God, when we
take upon us thus to judge the thoughts and intentions of others, which
are out of our view. The case as to the observance of days was much the
same. Those who knew that all these things were done away by Christ's
coming, took no notice of the festivals of the Jews. But it is not
enough that our consciences consent to what we do; it is necessary that
it be certified from the word of God. Take heed of acting against a
doubting conscience. We are all apt to make our own views the standard
of truth, to deem things certain which to others appear doubtful. Thus
Christians often despise or condemn each other, about doubtful matters
of no moment. A thankful regard to God, the Author and Giver of all our
mercies, sanctifies and sweetens them.

[Romans 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 14:7</span></span>

Though some are weak, and others are strong, yet all must agree not to
live to themselves. No one who has given up his name to Christ, is
allowedly a self-seeker; that is against true Christianity. The business
of our lives is not to please ourselves, but to please God. That is true
Christianity, which makes Christ all in all. Though Christians are of
different strength, capacities, and practices in lesser things, yet they
are all the Lord's; all are looking and serving, and approving
themselves to Christ. He is Lord of those that are living, to rule them;
of those that are dead, to revive them, and raise them up. Christians
should not judge or despise one another, because both the one and the
other must shortly give an account. A believing regard to the judgment
of the great day, would silence rash judgings. Let every man search his
own heart and life; he that is strict in judging and humbling himself,
will not be apt to judge and despise his brother. We must take heed of
saying or doing things which may cause others to stumble or to fall. The
one signifies a lesser, the other a greater degree of offence; that
which may be an occasion of grief or of guilt to our brother.

[Romans 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 14:14</span></span>

Christ deals gently with those who have true grace, though they are weak
in it. Consider the design of Christ's death: also that drawing a soul
to sin, threatens the destruction of that soul. Did Christ deny himself
for our brethren, so as to die for them, and shall not we deny ourselves
for them, so as to keep from any indulgence? We cannot hinder ungoverned
tongues from speaking evil; but we must not give them any occasion. We
must deny ourselves in many cases what we may lawfully do, when our
doing it may hurt our good name. Our good often comes to be evil spoken
of, because we use lawful things in an uncharitable and selfish manner.
As we value the reputation of the good we profess and practise, let us
seek that it may not be evil-spoken of. Righteousness, peace, and joy,
are words that mean a great deal. As to God, our great concern is to
appear before him justified by Christ's death, sanctified by the Spirit
of his grace; for the righteous Lord loveth righteousness. As to our
brethren, it is to live in peace, and love, and charity with them;
following peace with all men. As to ourselves, it is joy in the Holy
Ghost; that spiritual joy wrought by the blessed Spirit in the hearts of
believers, which respects God as their reconciled Father, and heaven as
their expected home. Regard to Christ in doing our duties, alone can
make them acceptable. Those are most pleasing to God that are best
pleased with him; and they abound most in peace and joy in the Holy
Ghost. They are approved by wise and good men; and the opinion of others
is not to be regarded.

[Romans 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 14:19</span></span>

Many wish for peace, and talk loudly for it, who do not follow the
things that make for peace. Meekness, humility, self-denial, and love,
make for peace. We cannot edify one another, while quarrelling and
contending. Many, for meat and drink, destroy the work of God in
themselves; nothing more destroys the soul than pampering and pleasing
the flesh, and fulfilling the lusts of it; so others are hurt, by wilful
offence given. Lawful things may be done unlawfully, by giving offence
to brethren. This takes in all indifferent things, whereby a brother is
drawn into sin or trouble; or has his graces, his comforts, or his
resolutions weakened. Hast thou faith? It is meant of knowledge and
clearness as to our Christian liberty. Enjoy the comfort of it, but do
not trouble others by a wrong use of it. Nor may we act against a
doubting conscience. How excellent are the blessings of Christ's
kingdom, which consists not in outward rites and ceremonies, but in
righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost! How preferable is the
service of God to all other services! and in serving him we are not
called to live and die to ourselves, but unto Christ, whose we are, and
whom we ought to serve.
