### [Isaiah Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 61:0</span></span>

([Isa 61:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md) The Messiah, his
character and office.

([Isa 61:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004).md) His promises of the
future blessedness of the church.

([Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md), [Isa
61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011).md) The church praises God for
these mercies.

[Isaiah 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 61:1</span></span>

The prophets had the Holy Spirit of God at times, teaching them what to
say, and causing them to say it; but Christ had the Spirit always,
without measure, to qualify him, as man, for the work to which he was
appointed. The poor are commonly best disposed to receive the gospel,
[Jam 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005.md); and it is only likely to
profit us when received with meekness. To such as are poor in spirit,
Christ preached good tidings when he said, Blessed are the meek.
Christ's satisfaction is accepted. By the dominion of sin in us, we are
bound under the power of Satan; but the Son is ready, by his Spirit, to
make us free; and then we shall be free indeed. Sin and Satan were to be
destroyed; and Christ triumphed over them on his cross. But the children
of men, who stand out against these offers, shall be dealt with as
enemies. Christ was to be a Comforter, and so he is; he is sent to
comfort all who mourn, and who seek to him, and not to the world, for
comfort. He will do all this for his people, that they may abound in the
fruits of righteousness, as the branches of God's planting. Neither the
mercy of God, the atonement of Christ, nor the gospel of grace, profit
the self-sufficient and proud. They must be humbled, and led to know
their own character and wants, by the Holy Spirit, that they may see and
feel their need of the sinner's Friend and Saviour. His doctrine
contains glad tidings indeed to those who are humbled before God.

[Isaiah 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 61:4</span></span>

Promises are here made to the Jews returned out of captivity, which
extend to all those who, through grace, are delivered out of spiritual
thraldom. An unholy soul is like a city that is broken down, and has no
walls, like a house in ruins; but by the power of Christ's gospel and
grace, it is fitted to be a habitation of God, through the Spirit. When,
by the grace of God, we attain to holy indifference as to the affairs of
this world; when, though our hands are employed about them, our hearts
are not entangled with them, but preserved entire for God and his
service, then the sons of the alien are our ploughmen and vine-dressers.
Those whom He sets at liberty, he sets to work. His service is perfect
freedom; it is the greatest honour. All believers are made, to our God,
kings and priests; and always ought to conduct themselves as such. Those
who have the Lord for their portion, have reason to say, that they have
worthy portion, and to rejoice in it. In the fulness of heaven's joys we
shall receive more than double for all our services and sufferings. God
desires truth, and therefore hates all injustice. Nor will it justify
any man's robbery to say, it was for burnt-offerings; and that robbery
is most hateful which is under this pretence. Let the children of godly
parents be such, that all may see the fruits of a good education; an
answer to the prayers for them, in the fruit of God's blessing.

[Isaiah 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 61:10</span></span>

Those only shall be clothed with the garments of salvation hereafter,
that are covered with the robe of Christ's righteousness now, and by the
sanctification of the Spirit have God's image renewed upon them. These
blessings shall spring forth for ages to come, as the fruits of the
earth. So duly, so constantly, and with such advantage to mankind, will
the Lord God cause righteousness and praise to spring forth. They shall
spread far; the great salvation shall be published and proclaimed, to
the ends of the earth. Let us be earnest in prayer, that the Lord God
may cause that righteousness to spring forth among us, which constitutes
the excellence and glory of the Christian profession.
