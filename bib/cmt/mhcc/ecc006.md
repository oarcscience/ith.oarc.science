### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 6:0</span></span>

([Ecc 6:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001)) The vanity of riches.
Also of long life and flourishing families.

([Ecc 6:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007)) The little advantage any
one has in outward things.

[Ecclesiastes 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 6:1</span></span>

A man often has all he needs for outward enjoyment; yet the Lord leaves
him so to covetousness or evil dispositions, that he makes no good or
comfortable use of what he has. By one means or other his possessions
come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. A numerous
family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour among the Hebrews;
and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Even with these
additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family, and life.
Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have been born for no
end or use. And he who has entered on life only for one moment, to quit
it the next, has a preferable lot to him who has lived long, but only to
suffer.

[Ecclesiastes 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 6:7</span></span>

A little will serve to sustain us comfortably, and a great deal can do
no more. The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world
to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well as the richest,
and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Better is the sight of
the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it is better to live
by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, which dwells only
upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have what pleases God, and
let that please us. The greatest possessions and honours cannot set us
above the common events of human life. Seeing that the things men pursue
on earth increase vanities, what is man the better for his worldly
devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckoned by days. It is fleeting
and uncertain, and with little in it to be fond of, or to be depended
on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ, and
submit to his will. Then soon shall we glide through this vexatious
world, and find ourselves in that happy place, where there is fulness of
joy and pleasures for evermore.
