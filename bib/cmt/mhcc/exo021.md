### [Exodus Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 21:0</span></span>

([Exo 21:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001)) Laws respecting
servants.

([Exo 21:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012)) Judicial laws.

([Exo 21:22-36](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#022)) Judicial laws.

[Exodus 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 21:1</span></span>

The laws in this chapter relate to the fifth and sixth commandments; and
though they differ from our times and customs, nor are they binding on
us, yet they explain the moral law, and the rules of natural justice.
The servant, in the state of servitude, was an emblem of that state of
bondage to sin, Satan, and the law, which man is brought into by robbing
God of his glory, by the transgression of his precepts. Likewise in
being made free, he was an emblem of that liberty wherewith Christ, the
Son of God, makes free from bondage his people, who are free indeed; and
made so freely, without money and without price, of free grace.

[Exodus 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 21:12</span></span>

God, who by his providence gives and maintains life, by his law protects
it. A wilful murderer shall be taken even from God's altar. But God
provided cities of refuge to protect those whose unhappiness it was, and
not their fault, to cause the death of another; for such as by accident,
when a man is doing a lawful act, without intent of hurt, happens to
kill another. Let children hear the sentence of God's word upon the
ungrateful and disobedient; and remember that God will certainly requite
it, if they have ever cursed their parents, even in their hearts, or
have lifted up their hands against them, except they repent, and flee
for refuge to the Saviour. And let parents hence learn to be very
careful in training up their children, setting them a good example,
especially in the government of their passions, and in praying for them;
taking heed not to provoke them to wrath. Through poverty the Israelites
sometimes sold themselves or their children; magistrates sold some
persons for their crimes, and creditors were in some cases allowed to
sell their debtors who could not pay. But "man-stealing," the object of
which is to force another into slavery, is ranked in the New Testament
with the greatest crimes. Care is here taken, that satisfaction be made
for hurt done to a person, though death do not follow. The gospel
teaches masters to forbear, and to moderate threatenings, [Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009), considering with Job, What shall
I do, when God riseth up? [Job 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013),
[Job 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#014).

[Exodus 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 21:22</span></span>

The cases here mentioned give rules of justice then, and still in use,
for deciding similar matters. We are taught by these laws, that we must
be very careful to do no wrong, either directly or indirectly. If we
have done wrong, we must be very willing to make it good, and be
desirous that nobody may lose by us.
