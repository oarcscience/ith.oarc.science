### [Nehemiah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 13:1</span></span>

Israel was a peculiar people, and not to mingle with the nations. See
the benefit of publicly reading the word of God; when it is duly
attended to, it discovers to us sin and duty, good and evil, and shows
wherein we have erred. We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to
separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the
living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the
provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food
and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it. When sin is cast out of
the heart by repentance, let the blood of Christ be applied to it by
faith, then let it be furnished with the graces of God's Spirit, for
every good work.

[Nehemiah 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 13:10</span></span>

If a sacred character will not keep men from setting an evil example, it
must not shelter any one from deserved blame and punishment. The Levites
had been wronged; their portions had not been given them. They were gone
to get livelihoods for themselves and their families, for their
profession would not maintain them. A maintenance not sufficient, makes
a poor ministry. The work is neglected, because the workmen are.
Nehemiah laid the fault upon the rulers. Both ministers and people, who
forsake religion and the services of it, and magistrates, who do not
what they can to keep them to it, will have much to answer for. He
delayed not to bring the Levites to their places again, and that just
payment should be made. Nehemiah on every occasion looked up to God, and
committed himself and all his affairs to Him. It pleased him to think
that he had been of use to revive and support religion in his country.
He here refers to God, not in pride, but with a humble appeal concerning
his honest intention in what he had done. He prays, "Remember me;" not,
Reward me. "Wipe not out my good deeds;" not, Publish them, or record
them. Yet he was rewarded, and his good deeds recorded. God does more
than we are able to ask.

[Nehemiah 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 13:15</span></span>

The keeping holy the Lord's day forms an important object for their
attention who would promote true godliness. Religion never prospers
while sabbaths are trodden under foot. No wonder there was a general
decay of religion, and corruption of manners among the Jews, when they
forsook the sanctuary and profaned the sabbath. Those little consider
what an evil they do, who profane the sabbath. We must answer for the
sins others are led to commit by our example. Nehemiah charges it on
them as an evil thing, for so it is, proceeding from contempt of God and
our own souls. He shows that sabbath-breaking was one of the sins for
which God had brought judgments upon them; and if they did not take
warning, but returned to the same sins again, they had to expect further
judgments. The courage, zeal, and prudence of Nehemiah in this matter,
are recorded for us to do likewise; and we have reason to think, that
the cure he wrought was lasting. He felt and confessed himself a sinner,
who could demand nothing from God as justice, when he thus cried unto
him for mercy.

[Nehemiah 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">neh 13:23</span></span>

If either parent be ungodly, corrupt nature will incline the children to
take after that one; which is a strong reason why Christians should not
be unequally yoked. In the education of children, great care should be
taken about the government of their tongues; that they learn not the
language of Ashdod, no impious or impure talk, no corrupt communication.
Nehemiah showed the evil of these marriages. Some, more obstinate than
the rest, he smote, that is, ordered them to be beaten by the officers
according to the law, [Deu 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002.md), [Deu
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003.md). Here are Nehemiah's prayers on
this occasion He prays, "Remember them, O my God." Lord, convince and
convert them; put them in mind of what they should be and do. The best
services to the public have been forgotten by those for whom they were
done, therefore Nehemiah refers himself to God, to recompense him. This
may well be the summary of our petitions; we need no more to make us
happy than this; Remember me, O my God, for good. We may humbly hope
that the Lord will remember us and our services, although, after lives
of unwearied activity and usefulness, we shall still see cause to abhor
ourselves and repent in dust and ashes, and to cry out with Nehemiah,
Spare me, O my God, according to the greatness of they mercy.
