### [Psalms Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 59:0</span></span>

([Psa 59:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#001).md) David prays for
deliverance from his enemies.

([Psa 59:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#008).md) He foresees their
destruction.

[Psalms 59:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 59:1</span></span>

In these words we hear the voice of David when a prisoner in his own
house; the voice of Christ when surrounded by his merciless enemies; the
voice of the church when under bondage in the world; and the voice of
the Christian when under temptation, affliction, and persecution. And
thus earnestly should we pray daily, to be defended and delivered from
our spiritual enemies, the temptations of Satan, and the corruptions of
our own hearts. We should fear suffering as evil-doers, but not be
ashamed of the hatred of workers of iniquity. It is not strange, if
those regard not what they themselves say, who have made themselves
believe that God regards not what they say. And where there is no fear
of God, there is nothing to secure proper regard to man.

[Psalms 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 59:8</span></span>

It is our wisdom and duty, in times of danger and difficulty, to wait
upon God; for he is our defence, in whom we shall be safe. It is very
comfortable to us, in prayer, to look to God as the God of our mercy,
the Author of all good in us, and the Giver of all good to us. The
wicked can never be satisfied, which is the greatest misery in a poor
condition. A contented man, if he has not what he would have, yet he
does not quarrel with Providence, nor fret within himself. It is not
poverty, but discontent that makes a man unhappy. David would praise God
because he had many times, and all along, found Him his refuge in the
day of trouble. He that is all this to us, is certainly worthy of our
best affections, praises, and services. The trials of his people will
end in joy and praise. When the night of affliction is over, they will
sing of the Lord's power and mercy in the morning. Let believers now, in
assured faith and hope, praise Him for those mercies, for which they
will rejoice and praise him for ever.
