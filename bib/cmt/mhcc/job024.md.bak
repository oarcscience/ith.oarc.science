### [Job Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 24:0</span></span>

([Job 24:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001).md) Wickedness often
unpunished.

([Job 24:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#013).md) The wicked shun the
light.

([Job 24:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018).md) Judgements for the
wicked.

[Job 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 24:1</span></span>

Job discourses further about the prosperity of the wicked. That many
live at ease who are ungodly and profane, he had showed, ch. 21. Here he
shows that many who live in open defiance of all the laws of justice,
succeed in wicked practices; and we do not see them reckoned with in
this world. He notices those that do wrong under pretence of law and
authority; and robbers, those that do wrong by force. He says, "God
layeth not folly to them;" that is, he does not at once send his
judgments, nor make them examples, and so manifest their folly to all
the world. But he that gets riches, and not by right, at his end shall
be a fool, [Jer 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011.md).

[Job 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 24:13</span></span>

See what care and pains wicked men take to compass their wicked designs;
let it shame our negligence and slothfulness in doing good. See what
pains those take, who make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts
of it: pains to compass, and then to hide that which will end in death
and hell at last. Less pains would mortify and crucify the flesh, and be
life and heaven at last. Shame came in with sin, and everlasting shame
is at the end of it. See the misery of sinners; they are exposed to
continual frights: yet see their folly; they are afraid of coming under
the eye of men, but have no dread of God's eye, which is always upon
them: they are not afraid of doing things which they are afraid of being
known to do.

[Job 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 24:18</span></span>

Sometimes how gradual is the decay, how quiet the departure of a wicked
person, how is he honoured, and how soon are all his cruelties and
oppressions forgotten! They are taken off with other men, as the
harvestman gathers the ears of corn as they come to hand. There will
often appear much to resemble the wrong view of Providence Job takes in
this chapter. But we are taught by the word of inspiration, that these
notions are formed in ignorance, from partial views. The providence of
God, in the affairs of men, is in every thing a just and wise
providence. Let us apply this whenever the Lord may try us. He cannot do
wrong. The unequalled sorrows of the Son of God when on earth, unless
looked at in this view, perplex the mind. But when we behold him, as the
sinner's Surety, bearing the curse, we can explain why he should endure
that wrath which was due to sin, that Divine justice might be satisfied,
and his people saved.
