### [Judges Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 10:0</span></span>

([Jdg 10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001)) Tola and Jair judge
Israel.

([Jdg 10:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006)) The Philistines and
Ammonites oppress Israel.

([Jdg 10:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010)) Israel's repentance.

[Judges 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 10:1</span></span>

Quiet and peaceable reigns, though the best to live in, yield least
variety of matter to be spoken of. Such were the days of Tola and Jair.
They were humble, active, and useful men, rulers appointed of God.

[Judges 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 10:6</span></span>

Now the threatening was fulfilled, that the Israelites should have no
power to stand before their enemies, [Lev
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#017), [Lev
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#037). By their evil ways and their
evil doings they procured this to themselves.

[Judges 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 10:10</span></span>

God is able to multiply men's punishments according to the numbers of
their sins and idols. But there is hope when sinners cry to the Lord for
help, and lament their ungodliness as well as their more open
transgressions. It is necessary, in true repentance, that there be a
full conviction that those things cannot help us which we have set in
competition with God. They acknowledged what they deserved, yet prayed
to God not to deal with them according to their deserts. We must submit
to God's justice, with a hope in his mercy. True repentance is not only
for sin, but from sin. As the disobedience and misery of a child are a
grief to a tender father, so the provocations of God's people are a
grief to him. From him mercy never can be sought in vain. Let then the
trembling sinner, and the almost despairing backslider, cease from
debating about God's secret purposes, or from expecting to find hope
from former experiences. Let them cast themselves on the mercy of God
our Saviour, humble themselves under his hand, seek deliverance from the
powers of darkness, separate themselves from sin, and from occasions of
it, use the means of grace diligently, and wait the Lord's time, and so
they shall certainly rejoice in his mercy.
