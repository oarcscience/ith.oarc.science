### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 11:0</span></span>

([Sa2 11:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001)) David's adultery.

([Sa2 11:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#006)) He tries to conceal his
crime.

([Sa2 11:14-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#014)) Uriah murdered.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 11:1</span></span>

Observe the occasions of David's sin; what led to it. 1. Neglect of his
business. He tarried at Jerusalem. When we are out of the way of our
duty, we are in temptation. 2. Love of ease: idleness gives great
advantage to the tempter. 3. A wandering eye. He had not, like Job, made
a covenant with his eyes, or, at this time, he had forgotten it. And
observe the steps of the sin. See how the way of sin is down-hill; when
men begin to do evil, they cannot soon stop. Observe the aggravations of
the sin. How could David rebuke or punish that in others, of which he
was conscious that he himself was guilty?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 11:6</span></span>

Giving way to sin hardens the heart, and provokes the departure of the
Holy Spirit. Robbing a man of his reason, is worse than robbing him of
his money; and drawing him into sin, is worse than drawing him into any
wordly trouble whatever.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 11:14</span></span>

Adulteries often occasion murders, and one wickedness is sought to be
covered by another. The beginnings of sin are much to be dreaded; for
who knows where they will end? Can a real believer ever tread this path?
Can such a person be indeed a child of God? Though grace be not lost in
such an awful case, the assurance and consolation of it must be
suspended. All David's life, spirituality, and comfort in religion, we
may be sure were lost. No man in such a case can have evidence to be
satisfied that he is a believer. The higher a man's confidence is, who
has sunk in wickedness, the greater his presumption and hypocrisy. Let
not any one who resembles David in nothing but his transgressions,
bolster up his confidence with this example. Let him follow David in his
humiliation, repentance, and his other eminent graces, before he thinks
himself only a backslider, and not a hypocrite. Let no opposer of the
truth say, These are the fruits of faith! No; they are the effects of
corrupt nature. Let us all watch against the beginnings of
self-indulgence, and keep at the utmost distance from all evil. But with
the Lord there is mercy and plenteous redemption. He will cast out no
humble, penitent believer; nor will he suffer Satan to pluck his sheep
out of his hand. Yet the Lord will recover his people, in such a way as
will mark his abhorrence of their crimes, to hinder all who regard his
word from abusing the encouragements of his mercy.
