[Malachi](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mal 0:0</span></span>

Malachi was the last of the prophets, and is supposed to have prophesied
B.C. 420. He reproves the priests and the people for the evil practices
into which they had fallen, and invites them to repentance and
reformation, with promises of the blessings to be bestowed at the coming
of the Messiah. And now that prophecy was to cease, he speaks clearly of
the Messiah, as nigh at hand, and directs the people of God to keep in
remembrance the law of Moses, while they were in expectation of the
gospel of Christ.
