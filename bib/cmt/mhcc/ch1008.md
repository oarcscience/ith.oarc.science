### [1 Chronicles Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

Genealogies.

[1 Chronicles 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 8:1</span></span>

Here is a larger list of Benjamin's tribe. We may suppose that many
things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and
perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the
intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations
then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are
now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God
are here kept in everlasting remembrance. The memory of the just is
blessed.
