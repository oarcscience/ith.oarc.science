### [Jeremiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 11:0</span></span>

([Jer 11:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001)) The disobedient Jews
reproved.

([Jer 11:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011)) Their utter ruin.

([Jer 11:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018)) The people would be
destroyed who sought the prophet's life.

[Jeremiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 11:1</span></span>

God never promised to bestow blessings on his rational creatures, while
they persist in wilful disobedience. Pardon and acceptance are promised
freely to all believers; but no man can be saved who does not obey the
command of God to repent, to believe in Christ, to separate from sin and
the world, to choose self-denial and newness of life. In general, men
will hearken to those who speak of doctrines, promises, and privileges;
but when duties are mentioned, they will not bend their ear.

[Jeremiah 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 11:11</span></span>

Evil pursues sinners, and entangles them in snares, out of which they
cannot free themselves. Now, in their distress, their many gods and many
altars stand them in no stead. And those whose own prayers will not be
heard, cannot expect benefit from the prayers of others. Their
profession of religion shall prove of no use. When trouble came upon
them, they made this their confidence, but God has rejected it. His
altar shall yield them no satisfaction. The remembrance of God's former
favours to them shall be no comfort under troubles; and his remembrance
of them shall be no argument for their relief. Every sin against the
Lord is a sin against ourselves, and so it will be found sooner or
later.

[Jeremiah 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 11:18</span></span>

The prophet Jeremiah tells much concerning himself, the times he lived
in being very troublesome. Those of his own city plotted how they might
cause his death. They thought to end his days, but he outlived most of
his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but it lives to this day,
and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows all the secret designs
of his and his people's enemies, and can, when he pleases, make them
known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, but a comfort to the
godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commit our cause to, and it
is our duty to commit it to him. We should also look well to our own
spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, but that by patient
continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindness to them, we may
overcome evil with good.
