### [Psalms Chapter 142](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

David's comfort in prayer.

[Psalms 142:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 142:1</span></span>

There can be no situation so distressing or dangerous, in which faith
will not get comfort from God by prayer. We are apt to show our troubles
too much to ourselves, poring upon them, which does us no service;
whereas, by showing them to God, we might cast the cares upon him who
careth for us, and thereby ease ourselves. Nor should we allow any
complaint to ourselves or others, which we cannot make to God. When our
spirits are overwhelmed by distress, and filled with discouragement;
when we see snares laid for us on every side, while we walk in his way,
we may reflect with comfort that the Lord knoweth our path. Those who in
sincerity take the Lord for their God, find him all-sufficient, as a
Refuge, and as a Portion: every thing else is a refuge of lies, and a
portion of no value. In this situation David prayed earnestly to God. We
may apply it spiritually; the souls of believers are often straitened by
doubts and fears. And it is then their duty and interest to beg of God
to set them at liberty, that they may run the way of his commandments.
Thus the Lord delivered David from his powerful persecutors, and dealt
bountifully with him. Thus he raised the crucified Redeemer to the
throne of glory, and made him Head over all things for his church. Thus
the convinced sinner cries for help, and is brought to praise the Lord
in the company of his redeemed people; and thus all believers will at
length be delivered from this evil world, from sin and death, and praise
their Saviour for ever.
