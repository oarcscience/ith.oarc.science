### [Psalms Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 10:0</span></span>

([Psa 10:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001)) The psalmist complains
of the wickedness of the wicked.

([Psa 10:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012)) He prays to God to
appear for the relief of his people.

[Psalms 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 10:1</span></span>

God's withdrawings are very grievous to his people, especially in times
of trouble. We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then
complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad
men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to
the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories
in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that
is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living
without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but
think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his
will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it
below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice
and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of
religion.

[Psalms 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 10:12</span></span>

The psalmist speaks with astonishment, at the wickedness of the wicked,
and at the patience and forbearance of God. God prepares the heart for
prayer, by kindling holy desires, and strengthening our most holy faith,
fixing the thoughts, and raising the affections, and then he graciously
accepts the prayer. The preparation of the heart is from the Lord, and
we must seek unto him for it. Let the poor, afflicted, persecuted, or
tempted believer recollect, that Satan is the prince of this world, and
that he is the father of all the ungodly. The children of God cannot
expect kindness, truth, or justice from such persons as crucified the
Lord of glory. But this once suffering Jesus, now reigns as King over
all the earth, and of his dominion there shall be no end. Let us commit
ourselves unto him, humbly trusting in his mercy. He will rescue the
believer from every temptation, and break the arm of every wicked
oppressor, and bruise Satan under our feet shortly. But in heaven alone
will all sin and temptation be shut out, though in this life the
believer has a foretaste of deliverance.
