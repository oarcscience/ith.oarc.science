### [Joshua Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 18:0</span></span>

([Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001).md) The tabernacle set up at
Shiloh.

([Jos 18:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#002).md) The remainder of the
land described and divided.

(v. 11-28) The boundaries of Benjamin.

[Joshua 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 18:1</span></span>

Shiloh was in the lot of Ephraim, the tribe to which Joshua belonged,
and it was proper that the tabernacle should be near the residence of
the chief governor. The name of this city is the same as that by which
Jacob prophesied of the Messiah, [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md). It is supposed by some that the
city was thus called, when it was chosen for the resting-place of the
ark, which typified our great Peace-maker, and the way by him to a
reconciled God.

[Joshua 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 18:2</span></span>

After a year or more, Joshua blamed their slackness, and told them how
to proceed. God, by his grace, has given us a title to a good land, the
heavenly Canaan, but we are slack to take possession of it; we enter not
into that rest, as we might by faith, and hope, and holy joy. How long
shall it be thus with us? How long shall we thus stand in our own light,
and forsake our own mercies for lying vanities? Joshua stirs the
Israelites up to take possession of their lots. He is ready to do his
part, if they will do theirs.

[Joshua 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 18:11</span></span>

The boundaries of each portion were distinctly drawn, and the
inheritance of each tribe settled. All contests and selfish claims were
prevented by the wise appointment of God, who allotted the hill and the
valley, the corn and pasture, the brooks and rivers, the towns and
cities. Is the lot of any servant of Christ cast in affliction and
sorrow? It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Are we in
prosperity and peace? It is from above. Be humbled when you compare the
gift with your own unworthiness. Forget not Him that gave the good, and
always be ready to resign it at his command.
