### [2 Chronicles Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple.

[2 Chronicles 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 6:1</span></span>

The order of Solomon's prayer is to be observed. First and chiefly, he
prays for repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing, and
the only solid foundation of other mercies: he then prays for temporal
mercies; thereby teaching us what things to mind and desire most in our
prayers. This also Christ hath taught us in his perfect pattern and form
of prayer, where there is but one prayer for outward, and all the rest
are for spiritual blessings. The temple typified the human nature of
Christ, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. The ark
typified his obedience and sufferings, by which repenting sinners have
access to a reconciled God, and communion with him. Jehovah has made our
nature his resting-place for ever, in the person of Emmanuel, and
through him he dwells with, and delights in his church of redeemed
sinners. May our hearts become his resting-place; may Christ dwell
therein by faith, consecrating them as his temples, and shedding abroad
his love therein. May the Father look upon us in and through his
Anointed; and may he remember and bless us in all things, according to
his mercy to sinners, in and through Christ.
