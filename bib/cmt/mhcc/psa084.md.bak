### [Psalms Chapter 84](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 84:0</span></span>

([Psa 84:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001).md) The psalmist expresses
his affection to the ordinances of God.

([Psa 84:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008).md) His desire towards the
God of the ordinances.

[Psalms 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 84:1</span></span>

The ordinances of God are the believer's solace in this evil world; in
them he enjoys the presence of the living God: this causes him to regret
his absence from them. They are to his soul as the nest to the bird. Yet
they are only an earnest of the happiness of heaven; but how can men
desire to enter that holy habitation, who complain of Divine ordinances
as wearisome? Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go on in the
exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from
whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenly city may have
to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many a thirsty desert; but
wells of salvation shall be opened for them, and consolations sent for
their support. Those that press forward in their Christian course, shall
find God add grace to their graces. And those who grow in grace, shall
be perfect in glory.

[Psalms 84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 84:8</span></span>

In all our addresses to God, we must desire that he would look on
Christ, his Anointed One, and accept us for his sake: we must look to
Him with faith, and then God will with favour look upon the face of the
Anointed: we, without him, dare not show our faces. The psalmist pleads
love to God's ordinances. Let us account one day in God's courts better
than a thousand spent elsewhere; and deem the meanest place in his
service preferable to the highest earthly preferment. We are here in
darkness, but if God be our God, he will be to us a Sun, to enlighten
and enliven us, to guide and direct us. We are here in danger, but he
will be to us a Shield, to secure us from the fiery darts that fly thick
about us. Through he has not promised to give riches and dignities, he
has promised to give grace and glory to all that seek them in his
appointed way. And what is grace, but heaven begun below, in the
knowledge, love, and service of God? What is glory, but the completion
of this happiness, in being made like to him, and in fully enjoying him
for ever? Let it be our care to walk uprightly, and then let us trust
God to give us every thing that is good for us. If we cannot go to the
house of the Lord, we may go by faith to the Lord of the house; in him
we shall be happy, and may be easy. That man is really happy, whatever
his outward circumstances may be, who trusts in the Lord of hosts, the
God of Jacob.
