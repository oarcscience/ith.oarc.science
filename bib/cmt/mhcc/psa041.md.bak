### [Psalms Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 41:0</span></span>

([Psa 41:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001).md) God's care for his
people.

([Psa 41:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005).md) The treachery of
David's enemies.

[Psalms 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 41:1</span></span>

The people of God are not free from poverty, sickness, or outward
affliction, but the Lord will consider their case, and send due
supplies. From his Lord's example the believer learns to consider his
poor and afflicted brethren. This branch of godliness is usually
recompensed with temporal blessings. But nothing is so distressing to
the contrite believer, as a fear or sense of the Divine displeasure, or
of sin in his heart. Sin is the sickness of the soul; pardoning mercy
heals it, renewing grace heals it, and for this spiritual healing we
should be more earnest than for bodily health.

[Psalms 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 41:5</span></span>

We complain, and justly, of the want of sincerity, and that there is
scarcely any true friendship to be found among men; but the former days
were no better. One particularly, in whom David had reposed great
confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange,
if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we
ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily,
yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in
the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their
designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or
public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care
of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give
heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in
heaven render to their God and Saviour.
