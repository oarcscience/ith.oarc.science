### [Jeremiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 43:0</span></span>

([Jer 43:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001).md) The leaders carry the
people to Egypt.

([Jer 43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008).md) Jeremiah foretells the
conquest of Egypt.

[Jeremiah 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 43:1</span></span>

Only by pride comes contention, both with God and man. They preferred
their own wisdom to the revealed will of God. Men deny the Scriptures to
be the word of God, because they are resolved not to conform themselves
to Scripture rules. When men will persist in sin, they charge the best
actions to bad motives. These Jews deserted their own land, and threw
themselves out of God's protection. It is the folly of men, that they
often ruin themselves by wrong endeavours to mend their situation.

[Jeremiah 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 43:8</span></span>

God can find his people wherever they are. The Spirit of prophecy was
not confined to the land of Israel. It is foretold that Nebuchadnezzar
should destroy and carry into captivity many of the Egyptians. Thus God
makes one wicked man, or wicked nation, a scourge and plague to another.
He will punish those who deceive his professing people, or tempt them to
rebellion.
