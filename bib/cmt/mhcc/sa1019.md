### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 19:0</span></span>

([Sa1 19:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#001)) Jonathan reconciles his
father to David, Saul again tries to slay him.

([Sa1 19:11-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#011)) David flees to Samuel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 19:1</span></span>

How forcible are right words! Saul was, for a time, convinced of the
unreasonableness of his enmity to David; but he continued his malice
against David. So incurable is the hatred of the seed of the serpent
against that of the woman; so deceitful and desperately wicked is the
heart of man without the grace of God, [Jer
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 19:11</span></span>

Michal's stratagem to gain time till David got to a distance was
allowable, but her falsehood had not even the plea of necessity to
excuse it, and manifests that she was not influenced by the same spirit
of piety which had dictated Jonathan's language to Saul. In flying to
Samuel, David made God his refuge. Samuel, as a prophet, was best able
to advise him what to do in this day of distress. He met with little
rest or satisfaction in Saul's court, therefore went to seek it in
Samuel's church. What little pleasure is to be had in this world, those
have who live a life of communion with God; to that David returned in
the time of trouble. So impatient was Saul after David's blood, so
restless against him, that although baffled by one providence after
another, he could not see that David was under the special protection of
God. And when God will take this way to protect David, even Saul
prophesies. Many have great gifts, yet no grace; they may prophesy in
Christ's name, yet are disowned by him. Let us daily seek for renewing
grace, which shall be in us as a well of water springing up into
everlasting life. Let us cleave to truth and holiness with full purpose
of heart. In every danger and trouble, let us seek protection, comfort,
and direction in God's ordinances.
