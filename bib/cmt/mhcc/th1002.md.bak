### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th1 2:0</span></span>

([Th1 2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001).md) The apostle reminds the
Thessalonians of his preaching and behaviour.

([Th1 2:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013).md) And of their receiving
the gospel as the word of God.

([Th1 2:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017).md) His joy on their
account.

[1 Thessalonians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 2:1</span></span>

The apostle had no wordly design in his preaching. Suffering in a good
cause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first met
with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving
in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's
exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without
guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt
affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This
is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all
we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it
is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward.
The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery
and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.

[1 Thessalonians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 2:7</span></span>

Mildness and tenderness greatly recommend religion, and are most
conformable to God's gracious dealing with sinners, in and by the
gospel. This is the way to win people. We should not only be faithful to
our calling as Christians, but in our particular callings and relations.
Our great gospel privilege is, that God has called us to his kingdom and
glory. The great gospel duty is, that we walk worthy of God. We should
live as becomes those called with such a high and holy calling. Our
great business is to honour, serve, and please God, and to seek to be
worthy of him.

[1 Thessalonians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 2:13</span></span>

We should receive the word of God with affections suitable to its
holiness, wisdom, truth, and goodness. The words of men are frail and
perishing, like themselves, and sometimes false, foolish, and fickle;
but God's word is holy, wise, just, and faithful. Let us receive and
regard it accordingly. The word wrought in them, to make them examples
to others in faith and good works, and in patience under sufferings, and
in trials for the sake of the gospel. Murder and persecution are hateful
to God, and no zeal for any thing in religion can excuse it. Nothing
tends more to any person or people's filling up the measure of their
sins, than opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation of souls.
The pure gospel of Christ is abhorred by many, and the faithful
preaching of it is hindered in many ways. But those who forbid the
preaching it to sinners, to men dead in sin, do not by this please God.
Those have cruel hearts, and are enemies to the glory of God, and to the
salvation of his people, who deny them the Bible.

[1 Thessalonians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 2:17</span></span>

This world is not a place where we are to be always, or long together.
In heaven holy souls shall meet, and never part more. And though the
apostle could not come to them yet, and thought he might never be able
to come, yet our Lord Jesus Christ will come; nothing shall hinder that.
May God give faithful ministers to all who serve him with their spirit
in the gospel of his Son, and send them to all who are in darkness.
