[Jeremiah 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 50:1</span></span>

The king of Babylon was kind to Jeremiah, yet the prophet must foretell
the ruin of that kingdom. If our friends are God's enemies, we dare not
speak peace to them. The destruction of Babylon is spoken of as done
thoroughly. Here is a word for the comfort of the Jews. They shall
return to their God first, then to their own land; the promise of their
conversion and reformation makes way for the other promises. Their tears
flow not from the sorrow of the world, as when they went into captivity,
but from godly sorrow. They shall seek after the Lord as their God, and
have no more to do with idols. They shall think of returning to their
own country. This represents the return of poor souls to God. In true
converts there are sincere desires to attain the end, and constant cares
to keep in the way. Their present case is lamented as very sad. The sins
of professing Christians never will excuse those who rejoice in
destroying them.

[Jeremiah 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 50:8</span></span>

The desolation that shall be brought upon Babylon is set forth in a
variety of expressions. The cause of this destruction is the wrath of
the Lord. Babylon shall be wholly desolated; for she hath sinned against
the Lord. Sin makes men a mark for the arrows of God's judgments. The
mercy promised to the Israel of God, shall not only accompany, but arise
from the destruction of Babylon. These sheep shall be gathered from the
deserts, and put again into good pasture. All who return to God and
their duty, shall find satisfaction of soul in so doing. Deliverances
out of trouble are comforts indeed, when fruits of the forgiveness of
sin.

[Jeremiah 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 50:21</span></span>

The forces are mustered and empowered to destroy Babylon. Let them do
what God demands, and they shall bring to pass what he threatens. The
pride of men's hearts sets God against them, and ripens them apace for
ruin. Babylon's pride must be her ruin; she has been proud against the
Holy One of Israel; who can keep those up whom God will throw down?

[Jeremiah 50:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 50:33</span></span>

It is Israel's comfort in distress, that, though they are weak, their
Redeemer is strong. This may be applied to believers, who complain of
the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their own weakness and
manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep what they commit to
him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He will give them that
rest which remains for the people of God. Also here is Babylon's sin,
and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry and persecution. He that
will not save his people in their sins, never will countenance the
wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of God for these sins will
lay them waste. In the judgments denounced against prosperous Babylon,
and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, we learn to choose to
suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the
pleasures of sin for a season.
