### [Jeremiah Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 17:0</span></span>

([Jer 17:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001).md) The fatal consequences
of the idolatry of the Jews.

([Jer 17:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005).md) The happiness of the
man that trusts in God; the end of the opposite character.

([Jer 17:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012).md) The malice of the
prophet's enemies.

([Jer 17:19-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019).md) The observance of the
sabbath.

[Jeremiah 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 17:1</span></span>

The sins which men commit make little impression on their minds, yet
every sin is marked in the book of God; they are all so graven upon the
table of the heart, that they will all be remembered by the conscience.
That which is graven in the heart will become plain in the life; men's
actions show the desires and purposes of their hearts. What need we have
to humble ourselves before God, who are so vile in his sight! How should
we depend on his mercy and grace, begging of God to search and prove us;
not to suffer us to be deceived by our own hearts, but to create in us a
clean and holy nature by his Spirit!

[Jeremiah 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 17:5</span></span>

He who puts confidence in man, shall be like the heath in a desert, a
naked tree, a sorry shrub, the product of barren ground, useless and
worthless. Those who trust to their own righteousness and strength, and
think they can do without Christ, make flesh their arm, and their souls
cannot prosper in graces or comforts. Those who make God their Hope,
shall flourish like a tree always green, whose leaf does not wither.
They shall be fixed in peace and satisfaction of mind; they shall not be
anxious in a year of drought. Those who make God their Hope, have enough
in him to make up the want of all creature-comforts. They shall not
cease from yielding fruit in holiness and good works. The heart, the
conscience of man, in his corrupt and fallen state, is deceitful above
all things. It calls evil good, and good evil; and cries peace to those
to whom it does not belong. Herein the heart is desperately wicked; it
is deadly, it is desperate. The case is bad indeed, if the conscience,
which should set right the errors of other faculties, is a leader in the
delusion. We cannot know our own hearts, nor what they will do in an
hour of temptation. Who can understand his errors? Much less can we know
the hearts of others, or depend upon them. He that believes God's
testimony in this matter, and learns to watch his own heart, will find
this is a correct, though a sad picture, and learns many lessons to
direct his conduct. But much in our own hearts and in the hearts of
others, will remain unknown. Yet whatever wickedness there is in the
heart, God sees it. Men may be imposed upon, but God cannot be deceived.
He that gets riches, and not by right, though he may make them his hope,
never shall have joy of them. This shows what vexation it is to a
worldly man at death, that he must leave his riches behind; but though
the wealth will not follow to another world, guilt will, and everlasting
torment. The rich man takes pains to get an estate, and sits brooding
upon it, but never has any satisfaction in it; by sinful courses it
comes to nothing. Let us be wise in time; what we get, let us get it
honestly; and what we have, use it charitably, that we may be wise for
eternity.

[Jeremiah 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 17:12</span></span>

The prophet acknowledges the favour of God in setting up religion. There
is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowing fulness, like a
fountain. It is always fresh and clear, like spring-water, while the
pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays to God for healing, saving
mercy. He appeals to God concerning his faithful discharge of the office
to which he was called. He humbly begs that God would own and protect
him in the work to which he had plainly called him. Whatever wounds or
diseases we find to be in our hearts and consciences, let us apply to
the Lord to heal us, to save us, that our souls may praise his name. His
hands can bind up the troubled conscience, and heal the broken heart; he
can cure the worst diseases of our nature.

[Jeremiah 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 17:19</span></span>

The prophet was to lay before the rulers and the people of Judah, the
command to keep holy the sabbath day. Let them strictly observe the
fourth command. If they obeyed this word, their prosperity should be
restored. It is a day of rest, and must not be made a day of labour,
unless in cases of necessity. Take heed, watch against the profanation
of the sabbath. Let not the soul be burdened with the cares of this
world on sabbath days. The streams of religion run deep or shallow,
according as the banks of the sabbath are kept up or neglected. The
degree of strictness with which this ordinance is observed, or the
neglect shown towards it, is a good test to find the state of spiritual
religion in any land. Let all; by their own example, by attention to
their families, strive to check this evil, that national prosperity may
be preserved, and, above all, that souls may be saved.
