### [Exodus Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 39:0</span></span>

(v. 1-31) The priests' garments.

([Exo 39:32-43](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032).md) The tabernacle
completed.

[Exodus 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 39:1</span></span>

The priests' garments were rich and splendid. The church in its infancy
was thus taught by shadows of good things to come; but the substance is
Christ, and the grace of the gospel. Christ is our great High Priest.
When he undertook the work of our redemption, he put on the clothes of
service, he arrayed himself with the gifts and graces of the Spirit,
girded himself with resolution to go through the undertaking, took
charge of all God's spiritual Israel, laid them near his heart, engraved
them on the palms of his hands, and presented them to his Father. And he
crowned himself with holiness to the Lord, consecrating his whole
undertaking to the honour of his Father's holiness. True believers are
spiritual priests. The clean linen with which all their clothes of
service must be made, is the righteousness of saints, [Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008.md).

[Exodus 39:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 39:32</span></span>

The tabernacle was a type or emblem of Jesus Christ. As the Most High
dwelt visibly within the sanctuary, even on the ark, so did he reside in
the human nature and tabernacle of his dear Son; in Christ dwelt all the
fulness of the Godhead bodily, [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md). The tabernacle was a symbol of
every real Christian. In the soul of every true follower of the Saviour
the Father dwells, the object of his worship, and the author of his
blessings. The tabernacle also typified the church of the Redeemer. The
meanest and the mightiest are alike dear to the Father's love, freely
exercised through faith in Christ. The tabernacle was a type and emblem
of the heavenly temple, [Rev 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003.md).
What, then, will be the splendour of His appearance, when the cloud
shall be withdrawn, and his faithful worshippers shall see him as he is!
