### [Hosea Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 12:0</span></span>

([Hos 12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md) Judah and Israel
reminded of the Divine favours.

([Hos 12:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007).md) The provocations of
Israel.

[Hosea 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 12:1</span></span>

Ephraim feeds himself with vain hopes of help from man, when he is at
enmity with God. The Jews vainly thought to secure the Egyptians by a
present of the produce of their country. Judah is contended with also.
God sees the sin of his own people, and will reckon with them for it.
They are put in mind of what Jacob did, and what God did for him. When
his faith upon the Divine promise prevailed above his fears, then by his
strength he had power with God. He is Jehovah, the same that was, and
is, and is to come. What was a revelation of God to one, is his memorial
to many, to all generations. Then let those who have gone from God, be
turned to him. Turn thou to the Lord, by repentance and faith, as thy
God. Let those that are converted to him, walk with him in all holy
conversation and godliness. Let us wrestle with Him for promised
blessings, determined not to give over till we prevail; and let us seek
Him in his ordinances.

[Hosea 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 12:7</span></span>

Ephraim became a merchant: the word also signifies a Canaanite. They
carried on trade upon Canaanitish principles, covetously and with fraud
and deceit. Thus they became rich, and falsely supposed that Providence
favoured them. But shameful sins shall have shameful punishments. Let
them remember, not only what a mighty prince Jacob was with God, but
what a servant he was to Laban. The benefits we have had from the word
of God, make our sin and folly the worse, if we put any slight upon that
word. We had better follow the hardest labour in poverty, than grow rich
by sin. We may form a judgment of our own conduct, by comparing it with
that of ancient believers in the like circumstances. Whoever despises
the message of God, will perish. May we all hear his word with humble,
obedient faith.
