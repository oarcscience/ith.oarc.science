### [Jeremiah Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 22:1</span></span>

The king of Judah is spoken to, as sitting upon the throne of David, the
man after God's own heart. Let him follow his example, that he may have
the benefit of the promises made to him. The way to preserve a
government, is to do the duty of it. But sin will be the ruin of the
houses of princes, as well as of meaner men. And who can contend with
destroyers of God's preparing? God destroys neither persons, cities, nor
nations, except for sin; even in this world he often makes it plain for
what crimes he sends punishment; and it will be clear at the day of
judgement.

[Jeremiah 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 22:10</span></span>

Here is a sentence of death upon two kings, the wicked sons of a very
pious father. Josiah was prevented from seeing the evil to come in this
world, and removed to see the good to come in the other world;
therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who is likely to
live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justly envied,
while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doom of
Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build,
beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, and
make them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings of
vain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gotten
unjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices the
wrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and will
repay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom they
employ. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as their
neighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, and
made no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which is
the root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children who despise
their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their real
excellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to be
the way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall die
unlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.

[Jeremiah 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 22:20</span></span>

The Jewish state is described under a threefold character. Very haughty
in a day of peace and safety. Very fearful on alarm of trouble. Very
much cast down under pressure of trouble. Many never are ashamed of
their sins till brought by them to the last extremity. The king shall
close his days in bondage. Those that think themselves as signets on
God's right hand, must not be secure, but fear lest they should be
plucked thence. The Jewish king and his family shall be carried to
Babylon. We know where we were born, but where we shall die we know not;
it is enough that our God knows. Let it be our care that we die in
Christ, then it will be well with us wherever we die, thought it may be
in a far country. The Jewish king shall be despised. Time was when he
was delighted in; but all those in whom God has no pleasure, some time
or other, will be so lowered, that men will have no pleasure in them.
Whoever are childless, it is the Lord that writes them so; and those who
take no care to do good in their days, cannot expect to prosper. How
little is earthly grandeur to be depended upon, or flourishing families
to be rejoiced in! But those who hear the voice of Christ, and follow
him, have eternal life, and shall never perish, neither shall any enemy
pluck them out of his almighty hands.
