### [Deuteronomy Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 16:0</span></span>

(v. 1-17) The yearly feasts.

([Deu 16:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018)) Of judges, Groves and
images forbidden.

[Deuteronomy 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 16:1</span></span>

The laws for the three yearly feasts are here repeated; that of the
Passover, that of the Pentecost, that of Tabernacles; and the general
law concerning the people's attendance. Never should a believer forget
his low estate of guilt and misery, his deliverance, and the price it
cost the Redeemer; that gratitude and joy in the Lord may be mingled
with sorrow for sin, and patience under the tribulations in his way to
the kingdom of heaven. They must rejoice in their receivings from God,
and in their returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must be
our delight, as well as our enjoyment. If those who were under the law
must rejoice before God, much more we that are under the grace of the
gospel; which makes it our duty to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in the
Lord always. When we rejoice in God ourselves, we should do what we can
to assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners, and
supplying those who are in want. All who make God their joy, may rejoice
in hope, for He is faithful that has promised.

[Deuteronomy 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 16:18</span></span>

Care is taken for the due administration of justice. All personal
regards must be laid aside, so that right is done to all, and wrong to
none. Care is taken to prevent following the idolatrous customs of the
heathen. Nothing belies God more, or tends more to corrupt the minds of
men, than representing and worshipping, by an image, that God, who is an
almighty and eternal Spirit, present every where. Alas! even in gospel
days, and under a better dispensation, established upon better promises,
there is a tendency to set up idols, under one form or another, in the
human heart.
