### [Psalms Chapter 99](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 99:0</span></span>

([Psa 99:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001).md) The happy government
God's people are under.

([Psa 99:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006).md) Its happy
administration.

[Psalms 99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 99:1</span></span>

God governs the world by his providence, governs the church by his
grace, and both by his Son. The inhabitants of the earth have cause to
tremble, but the Redeemer still waits to be gracious. Let all who hear,
take warning, and seek his mercy. The more we humble ourselves before
God, the more we exalt him; and let us be thus reverent, for he is holy.

[Psalms 99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 99:6</span></span>

The happiness of Israel is made out by referring to the most useful
governors of that people. They in every thing made God's word and law
their rule, knowing that they could not else expect that their prayers
should be answered. They all wonderfully prevailed with God in prayer;
miracles were wrought at their request. They pleaded for the people, and
obtained answers of peace. Our Prophet and High Priest, of infinitely
greater dignity than Moses, Aaron, or Samuel, has received and declared
to us the will of the Father. Let us not only exalt the Lord with our
lips, but give him the throne in our heart; and while we worship him
upon his mercy-seat, let us never forget that he is holy.
