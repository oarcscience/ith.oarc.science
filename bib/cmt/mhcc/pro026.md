### [Proverbs Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 26:1</span></span>

Honour is out of season to those unworthy and unfit for it.

[Proverbs 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 26:2</span></span>

He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm
than the bird that flies over his head.

[Proverbs 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 26:3</span></span>

Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless
and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man
indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God,
are changed.

[Proverbs 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 26:4</span></span>

We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his
conscience, so as may best end the debate.

[Proverbs 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 26:6</span></span>

Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings,
as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness.

[Proverbs 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 26:10</span></span>

This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will
deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among
men should disgrace and punish the wicked.

[Proverbs 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 26:11</span></span>

The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their
vices, [Pe2 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022.md).

[Proverbs 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 26:12</span></span>

We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This
describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really
it is very bad.

[Proverbs 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 26:13</span></span>

The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it
is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied
difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of
religion.

[Proverbs 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 26:14</span></span>

Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in
love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual
diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful
professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they
are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they
are not the nearer to heaven.

[Proverbs 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 26:15</span></span>

The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for
any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for
men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are
slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with
the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer.

[Proverbs 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 26:16</span></span>

He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master,
and that his labour shall not be in vain.

[Proverbs 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 26:17</span></span>

To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves
into temptation.

[Proverbs 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 26:18</span></span>

He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his
ruin.

[Proverbs 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 26:20</span></span>

Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a
flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers
and backbiters.

[Proverbs 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 26:23</span></span>

A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the
dross of silver.

[Proverbs 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 26:24</span></span>

Always distrust when a man speaks fair unless you know him well. Satan,
in his temptations, speaks fair, as he did to Eve; but it is madness to
give credit to him.

[Proverbs 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 26:27</span></span>

What pains men take to do mischief to others! but it is digging a pit,
it is rolling a stone, hard work; and they prepare mischief to
themselves.

[Proverbs 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 26:28</span></span>

There are two sorts of lies equally detestable. A slandering lie, the
mischief of this every body sees. A flattering lie, which secretly works
ruin. A wise man will be more afraid of a flatterer than of a slanderer.
