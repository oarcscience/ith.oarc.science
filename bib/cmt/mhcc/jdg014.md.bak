[Judges 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 14:1</span></span>

As far as Samson's marriage was a common case, it was weak and foolish
of him to set his affections upon a daughter of the Philistines. Shall
one, not only an Israelite, but a Nazarite, devoted to the Lord, covet
to become one with a worshipper of Dagon? It does not appear that he had
any reason to think her wise or virtuous, or any way likely to be a help
meet for him; but he saw something in her agreeable to his fancy. He
that, in the choice of a wife, is only guided by his eye, and governed
by his fancy, must afterwards thank himself if he find a Philistine in
his arms. Yet it was well done not to proceed till Samson had made his
parents acquainted with the matter. Children ought not to marry, nor to
move towards it, without the advice and consent of their parents.
Samson's parents did well to dissuade him from yoking himself unequally
with unbelievers. It seems that it pleased God to leave Samson to follow
his own inclinations, intending to bring out good from his conduct; and
his parents consented, because he was bent upon it. However, his example
is not recorded for us to do likewise.

[Judges 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 14:5</span></span>

By enabling him to kill a lion, God let Samson know what he could do in
the strength of the Spirit of the Lord, that he might never be afraid to
look the greatest difficulties in the face. He was alone in the
vineyards, whither he had rambled. Young people consider not how they
exposed themselves to the roaring lion that seeks to devour, when they
wander from their prudent, pious parents. Nor do men consider what lions
lurk in the vineyards, the vineyards of red wines. Our Lord Jesus having
conquered Satan, that roaring lion, believers, like Samson, find honey
in the carcass abundant strength and satisfaction, enough for
themselves, and for all their friends.

[Judges 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 14:10</span></span>

Samson's riddle literally meant no more than that he had got honey, for
food and for pleasure, from the lion, which in its strength and fury was
ready to devour him. But the victory of Christ over Satan, by means of
his humiliation, agonies, and death, and the exaltation that followed to
him, with the glory thence to the Father, and spiritual advantages to
his people, seem directly alluded to. And even death, that devouring
monster, being robbed of his sting, and stripped of his horror, forwards
the soul to the realms of bliss. In these and other senses, out of the
eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong, sweetness. Samson's
companions obliged his wife to get the explanation from him. A worldly
wife, or a worldly friend, is to a godly man as an enemy in the camp,
who will watch every opportunity to betray him. No union can be
comfortable or lasting, where secrets cannot be intrusted, without
danger of being divulged. Satan, in his temptations, could not do us the
mischief he does, if he did not plough with the heifer of our corrupt
nature. His chief advantage against us arises from his correspondence
with our deceitful hearts and inbred lusts. This proved an occasion of
weaning Samson from his new relations. It were well for us, if the
unkindness we meet with from the world, and our disappointments in it,
obliged us by faith and prayer to return to our heavenly Father's house,
and to rest there. See how little confidence is to be put in man.
Whatever pretence of friendship may be made, a real Philistine will soon
be weary of a true Israelite.
