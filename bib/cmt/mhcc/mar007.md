### [Mark Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 7:0</span></span>

([Mar 7:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001)) The traditions of the
elders.

([Mar 7:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#014)) What defiles the man.

([Mar 7:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024)) The woman of Canaan's
daughter cured.

([Mar 7:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031)) Christ restores a man
to hearing and speech.

[Mark 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 7:1</span></span>

One great design of Christ's coming was, to set aside the ceremonial
law; and to make way for this, he rejects the ceremonies men added to
the law of God's making. Those clean hands and that pure heart which
Christ bestows on his disciples, and requires of them, are very
different from the outward and superstitious forms of Pharisees of every
age. Jesus reproves them for rejecting the commandment of God. It is
clear that it is the duty of children, if their parents are poor, to
relieve them as far as they are able; and if children deserve to die
that curse their parents, much more those that starve them. But if a man
conformed to the traditions of the Pharisees, they found a device to
free him from the claim of this duty.

[Mark 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 7:14</span></span>

Our wicked thoughts and affections, words and actions, defile us, and
these only. As a corrupt fountain sends forth corrupt streams, so does a
corrupt heart send forth corrupt reasonings, corrupt appetites and
passions, and all the wicked words and actions that come from them. A
spiritual understanding of the law of God, and a sense of the evil of
sin, will cause a man to seek for the grace of the Holy Spirit, to keep
down the evil thoughts and affections that work within.

[Mark 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 7:24</span></span>

Christ never put any from him that fell at his feet, which a poor
trembling soul may do. As she was a good woman, so a good mother. This
sent her to Christ. His saying, Let the children first be filled, shows
that there was mercy for the Gentiles, and not far off. She spoke, not
as making light of the mercy, but magnifying the abundance of miraculous
cures among the Jews, in comparison with which a single cure was but as
a crumb. Thus, while proud Pharisees are left by the blessed Saviour, he
manifests his compassion to poor humbled sinners, who look to him for
children's bread. He still goes about to seek and save the lost.

[Mark 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 7:31</span></span>

Here is a cure of one that was deaf and dumb. Those who brought this
poor man to Christ, besought him to observe the case, and put forth his
power. Our Lord used more outward actions in the doing of this cure than
usual. These were only signs of Christ's power to cure the man, to
encourage his faith, and theirs that brought him. Though we find great
variety in the cases and manner of relief of those who applied to
Christ, yet all obtained the relief they sought. Thus it still is in the
great concerns of our souls.
