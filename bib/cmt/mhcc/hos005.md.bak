### [Hosea Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 5:0</span></span>

([Hos 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001).md) The Divine judgments
against Israel.

([Hos 5:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008).md) Approaching desolations
threatened.

[Hosea 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 5:1</span></span>

The piercing eye of God saw secret liking and disposition to sin, the
love the house of Israel had to their sins, and the dominion their sins
had over them. Pride makes men obstinate in other sins. And as Judah was
treading in the same steps, they would fall with Israel. By dealing
treacherously with the Lord, men only deceive themselves. Those that go
to seek the Lord with their flocks and their herds only, and not with
their hearts and souls, cannot expect to find him; nor shall any speed
who do not seek the Lord while he may be found. See how much it is our
concern to seek God early, now, while it is the accepted time, and the
day of salvation.

[Hosea 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 5:8</span></span>

The destruction of impenitent sinners is not mere talk, to frighten
them, it is a sentence which will not be recalled. And it is a mercy
that we have timely warning given us, that we may flee from the wrath to
come. Compliance with the commandments of men, who thwart the
commandments of God, ripens a people for ruin. The judgments of God are
sometimes to a sinful people as a moth, and as rottenness, or as a worm;
as these consume the clothes and the wood, so shall the judgments of God
consume them. Silently, they shall think themselves safe and thriving,
but when they look into their state, shall find themselves wasting and
decaying. Slowly, for the Lord gives them space to repent. Many a
nation; as well as many a person, dies of a consumption. Gradually, God
comes upon sinners with lesser judgments, to prevent greater, if they
will be wise, and take warning. When Israel and Judah found themselves
in danger, they sought the protection of the Assyrians, but this only
helped to make their wound the worse. They would be forced to apply to
God. He will bring them home to himself, by afflictions. When men begin
to complain more of their sins than of their afflictions, then there
begins to be some hope of them; and when under the conviction of sin,
and the corrections of the rod, we must seek the knowledge of God. Those
who are led by severe trials to seek God earnestly and sincerely, will
find him a present help and an effectual refuge; for with him is
plenteous redemption for all who call upon him. There is solid peace,
and there only, where God is.
