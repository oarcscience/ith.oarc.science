### [Psalms Chapter 79](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 79:0</span></span>

([Psa 79:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001).md) The deplorable condition
of the people of God.

([Psa 79:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006).md) A petition for relief.

[Psalms 79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 79:1</span></span>

God is complained to: whither should children go but to a Father able
and willing to help them? See what a change sin made in the holy city,
when the heathen were suffered to pour in upon them. God's own people
defiled it by their sins, therefore he suffered their enemies to defile
it by their insolence. They desired that God would be reconciled. Those
who desire God's favour as better than life, cannot but dread his wrath
as worse than death. In every affliction we should first beseech the
Lord to cleanse away the guilt of our sins; then he will visit us with
his tender mercies.

[Psalms 79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 79:6</span></span>

Those who persist in ignorance of God, and neglect of prayer, are the
ungodly. How unrighteous soever men were, the Lord was righteous in
permitting them to do what they did. Deliverances from trouble are
mercies indeed, when grounded upon the pardon of sin; we should
therefore be more earnest in prayer for the removal of our sins than for
the removal of afflictions. They had no hopes but from God's mercies,
his tender mercies. They plead no merit, they pretend to none, but, Help
us for the glory of thy name; pardon us for thy name's sake. The
Christian forgets not that he is often bound in the chain of his sins.
The world to him is a prison; sentence of death is passed upon him, and
he knows not how soon it may be executed. How fervently should he at all
times pray, O let the sighing of a prisoner come before thee, according
to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to
die! How glorious will the day be, when, triumphant over sin and sorrow,
the church beholds the adversary disarmed for ever! while that church
shall, from age to age, sing the praises of her great Shepherd and
Bishop, her King and her God.
