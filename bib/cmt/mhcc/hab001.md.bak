### [Habakkuk Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md)

([Hab 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001).md) The wickedness of the
land. The fearful vengeance to be executed.

([Hab 1:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012).md) These judgments to be
inflicted by a nation more wicked than themselves.

[Habakkuk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 1:1</span></span>

The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness and
violence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No man
scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the
world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be
before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men,
and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will
be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those
that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the
heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be
scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that
calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty
nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall
overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common
offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. The closing words
give a glimpse of comfort.

[Habakkuk 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hab 1:12</span></span>

However matters may be, yet God is the Lord our God, our Holy One. We
are an offending people, he is an offended God, yet we will not
entertain hard thoughts of him, or of his service. It is great comfort
that, whatever mischief men design, the Lord designs good, and we are
sure that his counsel shall stand. Though wickedness may prosper a
while, yet God is holy, and does not approve the wickedness. As he
cannot do iniquity himself, so he is of purer eyes than to behold it
with any approval. By this principle we must abide, though the
dispensations of his providence may for a time, in some cases, seem to
us not to agree with it. The prophet complains that God's patience was
abused; and because sentence against these evil works and workers was
not executed speedily, their hearts were the more fully set in them to
do evil. Some they take up as with the angle, one by one; others they
catch in shoals, as in their net, and gather them in their drag, their
enclosing net. They admire their own cleverness and contrivance: there
is great proneness in us to take the glory of outward prosperity to
ourselves. This is idolizing ourselves, sacrificing to the drag-net
because it is our own. God will soon end successful and splendid
robberies. Death and judgment shall make men cease to prey on others,
and they shall be preyed on themselves. Let us remember, whatever
advantages we possess, we must give all the glory to God.
