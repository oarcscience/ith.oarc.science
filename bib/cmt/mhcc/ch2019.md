### [2 Chronicles Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

Jehoshaphat visits his kingdom.

[2 Chronicles 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 19:1</span></span>

Whenever we return in peace to our houses, we ought to acknowledge God's
providence in preserving our going out and coming in. And if we have
been kept through more than common dangers, we are, in a special manner,
bound to be thankful. Distinguishing mercies lay us under strong
obligations. The prophet tells Jehoshaphat he had done very ill in
joining Ahab. He took the reproof well. See the effect the reproof had
upon him. He strictly searched his own kingdom. By what the prophet
said, Jehoshaphat perceived that his former attempts for reformation
were well-pleasing to God; therefore he did what was then left undone.
It is good when commendations quicken us to our duty. There are
diversities of gifts and operations, but all from the same Spirit, and
for the public good; and as every one has received the gift, so let him
minister the same. Blessed be God for magistrates and ministers, scribes
and statesmen, men of books, and men of business. Observe the charge the
king gave. They must do all in the fear of the Lord, with a perfect,
upright heart. And they must make it their constant care to prevent sin,
as an offence to God, and what would bring wrath on the people.
