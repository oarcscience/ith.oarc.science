### [Psalms Chapter 117](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 117:0</span></span>

All people called upon to praise God.

[Psalms 117:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 117:1</span></span>

Here is a solemn call to all nations to praise the Lord, and proper
matter for that praise is suggested. We are soon weary of well-doing, if
we keep not up the pious and devout affections with which the spiritual
sacrifice of praise ought to be kindled and kept burning. This is a
gospel psalm. The apostle, [Rom 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#011.md),
quotes it as a proof that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentile
nations, and that it would be entertained by them. For many ages, in
Judah only was God known, and his name praised; this call was not then
given to any Gentiles. But the gospel of Christ is ordered to be
preached to all nations, and by him those that were afar off are made
nigh. We are among the persons to whom the Holy Spirit here speaks, whom
he calls upon to join his ancient people in praising the Lord. Grace has
thus abounded to millions of perishing sinners. Let us then listen to
the offers of the grace of God, and pray for that time when all nations
of the earth shall show forth his praises. And let us bless God for the
unsearchable riches of gospel grace.
