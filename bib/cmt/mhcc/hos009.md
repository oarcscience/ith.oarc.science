### [Hosea Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 9:0</span></span>

([Hos 9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001).md) The distress to come upon
Israel.

([Hos 9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007).md) The approach of the day
of trouble.

([Hos 9:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011).md) Judgments on Israel.

[Hosea 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 9:1</span></span>

Israel gave rewards to their idols, in the offerings presented to them.
It is common for those who are niggardly in religion, to be prodigal
upon their lusts. Those are reckoned as idolaters, who love a reward in
the corn-floor better than a reward in the favour of God and in eternal
life. They are full of the joy of harvest, and have no disposition to
mourn for sin. When we make the world, and the things of it, our idol
and our portion, it is just with God to show us our folly, and correct
us. None may expect to dwell in the Lord's land, who will not be subject
to the Lord's laws, or be influenced by his love. When we enjoy the
means of grace, we ought to consider what we shall do, if they should be
taken from us. While the pleasures of communion with God are out of the
reach of change, the pleasant places purchased with silver, or in which
men deposit silver, are liable to be laid in ruins. No famine is so
dreadful as that of the soul.

[Hosea 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 9:7</span></span>

Time had been when the spiritual watchmen of Israel were with the Lord,
but now they were like the snare of a fowler to entangle persons to
their ruin. The people were become as corrupt as those of Gibeah, Judges
19; and their crimes should be visited in like manner. At first God had
found Israel pleasing to Him, as grapes to the traveller in the
wilderness. He saw them with pleasure as the first ripe figs. This shows
the delight God took in them; yet they followed after idolatry.

[Hosea 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 9:11</span></span>

God departs from a people, or from a person, when he withdraws his
goodness and mercy from them; and when the Lord is departed, what can
the creature do? Even though, for the present, good things seem to
remain, yet the blessing is gone if God is gone. Even the children
should perish with the parents. The Divine wrath dries up the root, and
withers the fruit of all comforts; and the scattered Jews daily warn us
to beware, lest we neglect or abuse the gospel. Yet every smiting is not
a drying up of the root. It may be that God intends only to smite so
that the sap may be turned to the root, that there may be more of root
graces, more humility, patience, faith, and self-denial. It is very just
that God should bring judgments on those who slight his offered mercy.
