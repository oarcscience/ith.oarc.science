### [Deuteronomy Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 8:0</span></span>

([Deu 8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001).md) Exhortations and
cautions, enforced by the Lord's former dealings with Israel, and his
promises.

([Deu 8:10-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#010).md) Exhortations and
cautions further enforced.

[Deuteronomy 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001.md)

Obedience must be, 1. Careful, observe to do; 2. Universal, to do all
the commandments; and 3. From a good principle, with a regard to God as
the Lord, and their God, and with a holy fear of him. To engage them to
this obedience. Moses directs them to look back. It is good to remember
all the ways, both of God's providence and grace, by which he has led us
through this wilderness, that we may cheerfully serve him and trust in
him. They must remember the straits they were sometimes brought into,
for mortifying their pride, and manifesting their perverseness; to prove
them, that they and others might know all that was in their heart, and
that all might see that God chose them, not for any thing in them which
might recommend them to his favour. They must remember the miraculous
supplies of food and raiment granted them. Let none of God's children
distrust their Father, nor take any sinful course for the supply of
their necessities. Some way or other, God will provide for them in the
way of duty and honest diligence, and verily they shall be fed. It may
be applied spiritually; the word of God is the food of the soul. Christ
is the word of God; by him we live. They must also remember the rebukes
they had been under, and not without need. This use we should make of
all our afflictions; by them let us be quickened to our duty. Moses also
directs them to look forward to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to
look back and to look forward, to Canaan. Look which way we will, both
to look back and to look forward will furnish us with arguments for
obedience. Moses saw in that land a type of the better country. The
gospel church is the New Testament Canaan, watered with the Spirit in
his gifts and graces, planted with trees of righteousness, bearing
fruits of righteousness. Heaven is the good land, in which nothing is
wanting, and where is fulness of joy.

[Deuteronomy 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 8:10</span></span>

Moses directs to the duty of a prosperous condition. Let them always
remember their Benefactor. In everything we must give thanks. Moses arms
them against the temptations of a prosperous condition. When men possess
large estates, or are engaged in profitable business, they find the
temptation to pride, forgetfulness of God, and carnal-mindedness, very
strong; and they are anxious and troubled about many things. In this the
believing poor have the advantage; they more easily perceive their
supplies coming from the Lord in answer to the prayer of faith; and,
strange as it may seem, they find less difficulty in simply trusting him
for daily bread. They taste a sweetness therein, which is generally
unknown to the rich, while they are also freed from many of their
temptations. Forget not God's former dealings with thee. Here is the
great secret of Divine Providence. Infinite wisdom and goodness are the
source of all the changes and trials believers experience. Israel had
many bitter trials, but it was "to do them good." Pride is natural to
the human heart. Would one suppose that such a people, after their
slavery at the brick-kilns, should need the thorns of the wilderness to
humble them? But such is man! And they were proved that they might be
humbled. None of us live a single week without giving proofs of our
weakness, folly, and depravity. To broken-hearted souls alone the
Saviour is precious indeed. Nothing can render the most suitable outward
and inward trials effectual, but the power of the Spirit of God. See
here how God's giving and our getting are reconciled, and apply it to
spiritual wealth. All God's gifts are in pursuance of his promises.
Moses repeats the warning he had often given of the fatal consequences
of forsaking God. Those who follow others in sin, will follow them to
destruction. If we do as sinners do, we must expect to fare as sinners
fare.
