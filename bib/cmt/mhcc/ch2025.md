### [2 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 25:0</span></span>

([Ch2 25:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001)) Amaziah, king of Judah.

([Ch2 25:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014)) Amaziah worships the
idols of Edom.

([Ch2 25:17-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#017)) Amaziah's rash
challenge.

[2 Chronicles 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 25:1</span></span>

Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Many
do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for
repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his
honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our
duty, and to make up all the loss and damage was sustain in his service,
will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are
called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should
satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced
sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying
obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the
hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose
so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall
we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet
their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are
necessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much
more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given
up for his sake.

[2 Chronicles 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 25:14</span></span>

To worship the gods of those whom Amaziah had conquered, who could not
help their own worshippers, was the greatest absurdity. If men would
consider how unable all those things are to help them, to which they
look whenever they forsake God, they would not be such enemies to
themselves. The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to be
answered; themselves. The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to
be answered; but he was bidden not to say a word more. The secure sinner
rejoices to have silenced his reprovers and monitors; but what comes of
it? Those that are deaf to reproof, are ripening for destruction.

[2 Chronicles 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 25:17</span></span>

Never was a proud prince more thoroughly mortified than Amaziah by Joash
king of Israel. A man's pride will bring him low, [Pro
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#023); it goes before his destruction,
and deservedly brings it on. He that exalteth himself shall be abased.
He that goes forth hastily to strive, will not know what he shall do in
the end thereof, when his neighbour has put him to shame, [Pro
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#008). And what are we when we offer to
establish our own righteousness, or presume to justify ourselves before
the Most High God, but despicable thistles, that fancy themselves
stately cedars? And are not various temptations, is not every
corruption, a wild beast of the desert, which will trample on the
wretched boaster, and tread his haughty pretensions to the dust? A man's
pride shall bring him low; his ruin may be dated from his turning from
the Lord.
