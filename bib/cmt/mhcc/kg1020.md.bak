### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

([Kg1 20:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#012).md) Benhadad's defeat.

([Kg1 20:22-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#022).md) The Syrians again
defeated.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 20:1</span></span>

Benhadad sent Ahab a very insolent demand. Ahab sent a very disgraceful
submission; sin brings men into such straits, by putting them out of the
Divine protection. If God do not rule us, our enemies shall: guilt
dispirits men, and makes them cowards. Ahab became desperate. Men will
part with their most pleasant things, those they most love, to save
their lives; yet they lose their souls rather than part with any
pleasure or interest to prevent it. Here is one of the wisest sayings
that ever Ahab spake, and it is a good lesson to all. It is folly to
boast of any day to come, since we know not what it may bring forth.
Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by self-confidence.
Happy is the man who is never off his watch.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 20:12</span></span>

The proud Syrians were beaten, and the despised Israelites were
conquerors. The orders of the proud, drunken king disordered his troops,
and prevented them from attacking the Israelites. Those that are most
secure, are commonly least courageous. Ahab slew the Syrians with a
great slaughter. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 20:22</span></span>

Those about Benhadad advised him to change his ground. They take it for
granted that it was not Israel, but Israel's gods, that beat them; but
they speak very ignorantly of Jehovah. They supposed that Israel had
many gods, to whom they ascribed limited power within a certain
district; thus vain were the Gentiles in their imaginations concerning
God. The greatest wisdom in worldly concerns is often united with the
most contemptible folly in the things of God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 20:31</span></span>

This encouragement sinners have to repent and humble themselves before
God; Have we not heard, that the God of Israel is a merciful God? Have
we not found him so? That is gospel repentance, which flows from an
apprehension of the mercy of God, in Christ; there is forgiveness with
him. What a change is here! The most haughty in prosperity often are
most abject in adversity; an evil spirit will thus affect a man in both
these conditions. There are those on whom, like Ahab, success is ill
bestowed; they know not how to serve either God or their generation, or
even their own true interests with their prosperity: Let favour be
showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. The prophet
designed to reprove Ahab by a parable. If a good prophet were punished
for sparing his friend and God's when God said, Smite, of much sorer
punishment should a wicked king be thought worthy, who spared his enemy
and God's, when God said, Smite. Ahab went to his house, heavy and
displeased, not truly penitent, or seeking to undo what he had done
amiss; every way out of humour, notwithstanding his victory. Alas! many
that hear the glad tidings of Christ, are busy and there till the day of
salvation is gone.
