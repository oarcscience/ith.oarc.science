<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 2:1</span></span>

Hannah's heart rejoiced, not in Samuel, but in the Lord. She looks
beyond the gift, and praises the Giver. She rejoiced in the salvation of
the Lord, and in expectation of His coming, who is the whole salvation
of his people. The strong are soon weakened, and the weak are soon
strengthened, when God pleases. Are we poor? God made us poor, which is
a good reason why we should be content, and make up our minds to our
condition. Are we rich? God made us rich, which is a good reason why we
should be thankful, and serve him cheerfully, and do good with the
abundance he gives us. He respects not man's wisdom or fancied
excellences, but chooses those whom the world accounts foolish, teaching
them to feel their guilt, and to value his free and precious salvation.
This prophecy looks to the kingdom of Christ, that kingdom of grace, of
which Hannah speaks, after having spoken largely of the kingdom of
providence. And here is the first time that we meet with the name
MESSIAH, or his Anointed. The subjects of Christ's kingdom will be safe,
and the enemies of it will be ruined; for the Anointed, the Lord Christ,
is able to save, and to destroy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 2:11</span></span>

Samuel, being devoted to the Lord in a special manner, was from a child
employed about the sanctuary in the services he was capable of. As he
did this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministering
unto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young people
who serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that they
may serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him to
indulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain and
correct them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of the
sanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and his
sons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of the
sanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offence was
committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typified the
atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself,
are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of the covenant.
Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, none are more
abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, when they break
through restraints.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 2:27</span></span>

Those who allow their children in any evil way, and do not use their
authority to restrain and punish them, in effect honour them more than
God. Let Eli's example excite parents earnestly to strive against the
beginnings of wickedness, and to train up their children in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord. In the midst of the sentence against the
house of Eli, mercy is promised to Israel. God's work shall never fall
to the ground for want of hands to carry it on. Christ is that merciful
and faithful High Priest, whom God raised up when the Levitical
priesthood was thrown off, who in all things did his Father's mind, and
for whom God will build a sure house, build it on a rock, so that hell
cannot prevail against it.
