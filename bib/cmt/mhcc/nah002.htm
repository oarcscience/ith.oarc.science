<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001">Nah 2:1-10</A>) Nineveh's destruction foretold.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011">Nah 2:11-13</A>) The true cause, their sinning against God, and his appearing against them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001">Nahum 2:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">nah 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Nineveh shall not put aside this judgment; there is no counsel or strength against the Lord. God looks upon proud cities, and brings them down. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invading enemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria is represented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt in the conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what will treasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day of wrath? Yet for such things how many lose their souls! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011">Nahum 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">nah 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The kings of Assyria had long been terrible and cruel to their neighbours, but the Lord would destroy their power. Many plead as an excuse for rapine and fraud, that they have families to provide for; but what is thus obtained will never do them any good. Those that fear the Lord, and get honestly what they have, shall not want for themselves and theirs. It is just with God to deprive those of children, or of comfort in them, who take sinful courses to enrich them. Those are not worthy to be heard again, that have spoken reproachfully of God. Let us then come to God upon his mercy-seat, that having peace with him through our Lord Jesus Christ, we may know that he is for us, and that all things shall work together for our everlasting good.
