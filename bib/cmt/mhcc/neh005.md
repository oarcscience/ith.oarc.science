### [Nehemiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 5:0</span></span>

([Neh 5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001)) The Jews complain of
grievances.

([Neh 5:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#006)) Nehemiah redresses the
grievances.

([Neh 5:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014)) Nehemiah's forbearance.

[Nehemiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 5:1</span></span>

Men prey upon their fellow-creatures: by despising the poor they
reproach their Maker. Such conduct is a disgrace to any, but who can
sufficiently abhor it when adopted by professing Christians? With
compassion for the oppressed, we should lament the hardships which many
in the world are groaning under; putting our souls into their souls'
stead, and remembering in our prayers and succours those who are
burdened. But let those who show no mercy, expect judgment without
mercy.

[Nehemiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 5:6</span></span>

Nehemiah knew that, if he built Jerusalem's walls ever so high, so
thick, or so strong, the city could not be safe while there were abuses.
The right way to reform men's lives, is to convince their consciences.
If you walk in the fear of God, you will not be either covetous of
worldly gain, or cruel toward your brethren. Nothing exposes religion
more to reproach, than the worldliness and hard-heartedness of the
professors of it. Those that rigorously insist upon their right, with a
very ill grace try to persuade others to give up theirs. In reasoning
with selfish people, it is good to contrast their conduct with that of
others who are liberal; but it is best to point to His example, who
though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we, through his
poverty, might be rich, [Co2 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009). They
did according to promise. Good promises are good things, but good
performances are better.

[Nehemiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 5:14</span></span>

Those who truly fear God, will not dare to do any thing cruel or unjust.
Let all who are in public places remember that they are so placed to do
good, not to enrich themselves. Nehemiah mentions it to God in prayer,
not as if he had merited any favour from God, but to show that he
depended upon God only, to make up to him what he had lost and laid out
for his honour. Nehemiah evidently spake and acted as one that knew
himself to be a sinner. He did not mean to claim a reward as of debt,
but in the manner that the Lord rewards a cup of cold water given to a
disciple for his sake. The fear and love of God in the heart, and true
love of the brethren, will lead to every good work. These are proper
evidences of justifying faith; and our reconciled God will look upon
persons of this character for good, according to all they have done for
his people.
