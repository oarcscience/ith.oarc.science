### [Daniel Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 11:0</span></span>

The vision of the Scriptures of truth.

[Daniel 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 11:1</span></span>

The angel shows Daniel the succession of the Persian and Grecian
empires. The kings of Egypt and Syria are noticed: Judea was between
their dominions, and affected by their contests. From vs. 5-30, is
generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during
the continuance of these governments; and from [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021), to relate to Antiochus
Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what
decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the
power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and
pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and
fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of
states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen
by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has
designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the
potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are
prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will
trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their
cross, and maintain their conflict.

[Daniel 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">dan 11:31</span></span>

The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators
differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to
antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth
monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of
the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of
his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the
infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well
as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of
truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our
paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.
