### [Proverbs Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 15:1</span></span>

A right cause will be better pleaded with meekness than with passion.
Nothing stirs up anger like grievous words.

He that has knowledge, is to use it aright, for the good of others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 15:3</span></span>

Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under God's eye. This speaks
comfort to saints, and terror to sinners.

[Proverbs 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 15:4</span></span>

A good tongue is healing to wounded consciences, by comforting them; to
sin-sick souls, by convincing them; and it reconciles parties at
variance.

[Proverbs 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 15:5</span></span>

If instruction is despised, reprove men rather than suffer them to go on
undisturbed in the way to ruin.

[Proverbs 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 15:6</span></span>

The wealth of worldly men increases their fears and suspicions, adds
strength to their passions, and renders the fear of death more
distressing.

[Proverbs 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 15:7</span></span>

We use knowledge aright when we disperse it; but the heart of the
foolish has nothing to disperse that is good.

[Proverbs 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 15:8</span></span>

The wicked put other things in the stead of Christ's atonement, or in
the place of holy obedience. Praying graces are his gift, and the work
of his Spirit, with which he is well pleased.

[Proverbs 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 15:10</span></span>

He that hates reproof shall perish in his sins, since he would not be
parted from them.

thoughts.

[Proverbs 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013.md)

A gloomy, impatient, unthankful spirit, springing from pride and undue
attachment to worldly objects, renders a man uneasy to himself and
others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 15:14</span></span>

A wise man seeks to gain more wisdom, growing in grace and in the
knowledge of Christ. But a carnal mind rests contented, flattering
itself.

[Proverbs 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 15:15</span></span>

pitied, prayed for, and comforted. And others serve God with gladness of
heart, and it prompts their obedience, yet they should rejoice with
trembling.

about their state, because always in neglect of some duty.
