### [2 Chronicles Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md)

Hezekiah destroys idolatry.

[2 Chronicles 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 31:1</span></span>

After the passover, the people of Israel applied with vigour to destroy
the monuments of idolatry. Public ordinances should stir us up to
cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin, and
the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same. The
after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatest importance to
personal, family, and public religion. When they had tasted the
sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they were free in
maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit of a settled
ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all that Hezekiah
attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in his aim and
dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have few or many
talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, and encourage
others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincere regard to the
glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfort at last.
