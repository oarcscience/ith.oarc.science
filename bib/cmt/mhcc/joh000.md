[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

The apostle and evangelist, John, seems to have been the youngest of the
twelve. He was especially favoured with our Lord's regard and
confidence, so as to be spoken of as the disciple whom Jesus loved. He
was very sincerely attached to his Master. He exercised his ministry at
Jerusalem with much success, and outlived the destruction of that city,
agreeably to Christ's prediction, [Joh
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#022). History relates that after the
death of Christ's mother, John resided chiefly at Ephesus. Towards the
close of Domitian's reign he was banished to the isle of Patmos, where
he wrote his Revelation. On the accession of Nerva, he was set at
liberty, and returned to Ephesus, where it is thought he wrote his
Gospel and Epistles, about A. D. 97, and died soon after. The design of
this Gospel appears to be to convey to the Christian world, just notions
of the real nature, office, and character of that Divine Teacher, who
came to instruct and to redeem mankind. For this purpose, John was
directed to select for his narrative, those passages of our Saviour's
life, which most clearly displayed his Divine power and authority; and
those of his discourses, in which he spake most plainly of his own
nature, and of the power of his death, as an atonement for the sins of
the world. By omitting, or only briefly mentioning, the events recorded
by the other evangelists, John gave testimony that their narratives are
true, and left room for the doctrinal statements already mentioned, and
for particulars omitted in the other Gospels, many of which are
exceedingly important.
