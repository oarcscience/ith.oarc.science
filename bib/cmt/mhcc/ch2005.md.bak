### [2 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 5:0</span></span>

([Ch2 5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001).md) The ark placed in the
temple.

([Ch2 5:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011).md) The temple filled with
glory.

[2 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 5:1</span></span>

The ark was a type of Christ, and, as such, a token of the presence of
God. That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
of the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religious
assemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this we
should be most earnest for. When Christ is formed in a soul, the law
written in the heart, the ark of the covenant settled there, so that it
becomes the temple of the Holy Ghost, there is true satisfaction in that
soul.

[2 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 5:11</span></span>

God took possession of the temple; he filled it with a cloud. Thus he
signified his acceptance of this temple, to be the same to him that the
tabernacle of Moses was, and assured his people that he would be the
same in it. Would we have God dwell in our hearts, we must leave room
for him; every thing else must give way. The Word was made flesh; and
when he comes to his temple, like a refiner's fire, who may abide the
day of his coming? May he prepare us for that day.
