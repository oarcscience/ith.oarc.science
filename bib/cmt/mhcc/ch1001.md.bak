### [1 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

(v. 1-27) Genealogies, Adam to Abraham.

(v. 28-54) The descendants of Abraham.

[1 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 1:1</span></span>

This chapter, and many that follow, repeat the genealogies, or lists of
fathers and children in the Bible history, and put them together, with
many added. When compared with other places, there are some differences
found; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless God that
the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The original of the
Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that God created, and is
thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, and absurd origins
assigned to other nations. But the nations now are all so mingled with
one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is
descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatest part of any,
is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Only this we are sure
of, that God has created of one blood all nations of men; they are all
descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not all one father? Has not
one God created us? [Mal 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md).

[1 Chronicles 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 1:28</span></span>

The genealogy is from hence confined to the posterity of Abraham. Let us
take occasion from reading these lists of names, to think of the
multitudes that have gone through this world, have done their parts in
it, and then quitted it. As one generation, even of sinful men, passes
away, another comes. [Ecc 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004.md); [Num
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#014.md), and will do so while the earth
remains. Short is our passage through time into eternity. May we be
distinguished as the Lord's people.
