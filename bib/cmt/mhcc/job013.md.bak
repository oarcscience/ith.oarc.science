### [Job Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 13:0</span></span>

([Job 13:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001).md) Job reproves his
friends.

([Job 13:13-22](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#013).md) He professes his
confidence in God.

([Job 13:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023).md) Job entreats to know
his sins.

[Job 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 13:1</span></span>

With self-preference, Job declared that he needed not to be taught by
them. Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lower
their brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with the
fear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, we
should apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any, never
prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him we may speak
at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures,
without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidently speaks with a
very angry spirit against his friends. They had advanced some truths
which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled before God, never
meekly receives the reproofs of men.

[Job 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 13:13</span></span>

Job resolved to cleave to the testimony his own conscience gave of his
uprightness. He depended upon God for justification and salvation, the
two great things we hope for through Christ. Temporal salvation he
little expected, but of his eternal salvation he was very confident;
that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy, but his
salvation, in the sight and enjoyment of whom he should be happy. He
knew himself not to be a hypocrite, and concluded that he should not be
rejected. We should be well pleased with God as a Friend, even when he
seems against us as an enemy. We must believe that all shall work for
good to us, even when all seems to make against us. We must cleave to
God, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In a
dying hour, we must derive from him living comforts; and this is to
trust in him, though he slay us.

[Job 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 13:23</span></span>

Job begs to have his sins discovered to him. A true penitent is willing
to know the worst of himself; and we should all desire to know what our
transgressions are, that we may confess them, and guard against them for
the future. Job complains sorrowfully of God's severe dealings with him.
Time does not wear out the guilt of sin. When God writes bitter things
against us, his design is to make us bring forgotten sins to mind, and
so to bring us to repent of them, as to break us off from them. Let
young persons beware of indulging in sin. Even in this world they may so
possess the sins of their youth, as to have months of sorrow for moments
of pleasure. Their wisdom is to remember their Creator in their early
days, that they may have assured hope, and sweet peace of conscience, as
the solace of their declining years. Job also complains that his present
mistakes are strictly noticed. So far from this, God deals not with us
according to our deserts. This was the language of Job's melancholy
views. If God marks our steps, and narrowly examines our paths, in
judgment, both body and soul feel his righteous vengeance. This will be
the awful case of unbelievers, yet there is salvation devised, provided,
and made known in Christ.
