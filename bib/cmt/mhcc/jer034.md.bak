### [Jeremiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 34:0</span></span>

([Jer 34:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001).md) Zedekiah's death at
Babylon foretold.

([Jer 34:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008).md) The Jews reproved for
compelling their poor brethren to return to unlawful bondage.

[Jeremiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 34:1</span></span>

Zedekiah is told that the city shall be taken, and that he shall die a
captive, but he shall die a natural death. It is better to live and die
penitent in a prison, than to live and die impenitent in a palace.

[Jeremiah 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 34:8</span></span>

A Jew should not be held in servitude above seven years. This law they
and their fathers had broken. And when there was some hope that the
siege was raised, they forced the servants they had released into their
services again. Those who think to cheat God by dissembled repentance
and partial reformation, put the greatest cheat upon their own souls.
This shows that liberty to sin, is really only liberty to have the
sorest judgments. It is just with God to disappoint expectations of
mercy, when we disappoint the expectations of duty. And when reformation
springs only from terror, it is seldom lasting. Solemn vows thus entered
into, profane the ordinances of God; and the most forward to bind
themselves by appeals to God, are commonly most ready to break them. Let
us look to our hearts, that our repentance may be real, and take care
that the law of God regulates our conduct.
