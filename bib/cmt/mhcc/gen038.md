### [Genesis Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 38:0</span></span>

The profligate conduct of Judah and his family.

[Genesis 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 38:1</span></span>

This chapter gives an account of Judah and his family, and such an
account it is, that it seems a wonder that of all Jacob's sons, our Lord
should spring out of Judah, [Heb 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014).
But God will show that his choice is of grace and not of merit, and that
Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the chief. Also, that
the worthiness of Christ is of himself, and not from his ancestors. How
little reason had the Jews, who were so called from this Judah, to boast
as they did, [Joh 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#041). What awful
examples the Lord proclaims in his punishments, of his utter displeasure
at sin! Let us seek grace from God to avoid every appearance of sin. And
let that state of humbleness to which Jesus submitted, when he came to
put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, in appointing such characters
as those here recorded, to be his ancestors, endear the Redeemer to our
hearts.
