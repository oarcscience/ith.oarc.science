### [Psalms Chapter 107](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 107:0</span></span>

([Psa 107:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001).md) God's providential care
of the children of men in distresses, in banishment, and dispersion.

([Psa 107:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010).md) In captivity.

([Psa 107:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017).md) In sickness.

([Psa 107:23-32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023).md) Danger at sea..

([Psa 107:33-43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033).md) God's hand is to be
seen by his own people.

[Psalms 107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 107:1</span></span>

In these verses there is reference to the deliverance from Egypt, and
perhaps that from Babylon: but the circumstances of travellers in those
countries are also noted. It is scarcely possible to conceive the
horrors suffered by the hapless traveller, when crossing the trackless
sands, exposed to the burning rays of the sum. The words describe their
case whom the Lord has redeemed from the bondage of Satan; who pass
through the world as a dangerous and dreary wilderness, often ready to
faint through troubles, fears, and temptations. Those who hunger and
thirst after righteousness, after God, and communion with him, shall be
filled with the goodness of his house, both in grace and glory.

[Psalms 107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 107:10</span></span>

This description of prisoners and captives intimates that they are
desolate and sorrowful. In the eastern prisons the captives were and are
treated with much severity. Afflicting providences must be improved as
humbling providences; and we lose the benefit, if our hearts are
unhumbled and unbroken under them. This is a shadow of the sinner's
deliverance from a far worse confinement. The awakened sinner discovers
his guilt and misery. Having struggled in vain for deliverance, he finds
there is no help for him but in the mercy and grace of God. His sin is
forgiven by a merciful God, and his pardon is accompanied by deliverance
from the power of sin and Satan, and by the sanctifying and comforting
influences of God the Holy Spirit.

[Psalms 107:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 107:17</span></span>

If we knew no sin, we should know no sickness. Sinners are fools. They
hurt their bodily health by intemperance, and endanger their lives by
indulging their appetites. This their way is their folly. The weakness
of the body is the effect of sickness. It is by the power and mercy of
God that we are recovered from sickness, and it is our duty to be
thankful. All Christ's miraculous cures were emblems of his healing
diseases of the soul. It is also to be applied to the spiritual cures
which the Spirit of grace works. He sends his word, and heals souls;
convinces, converts them, makes them holy, and all by the word. Even in
common cases of recovery from sickness, God in his providence speaks,
and it is done; by his word and Spirit the soul is restored to health
and holiness.

[Psalms 107:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 107:23</span></span>

Let those who go to sea, consider and adore the Lord. Mariners have
their business upon the tempestuous ocean, and there witness
deliverances of which others cannot form an idea. How seasonable it is
at such a time to pray! This may remind us of the terrors and distress
of conscience many experience, and of those deep scenes of trouble which
many pass through, in their Christian course. Yet, in answer to their
cries, the Lord turns their storm into a calm, and causes their trials
to end in gladness.

[Psalms 107:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 107:33</span></span>

What surprising changes are often made in the affairs of men! Let the
present desolate state of Judea, and of other countries, explain this.
If we look abroad in the world, we see many greatly increase, whose
beginning was small. We see many who have thus suddenly risen, as
suddenly brought to nothing. Worldly wealth is uncertain; often those
who are filled with it, ere they are aware, lose it again. God has many
ways of making men poor. The righteous shall rejoice. It shall fully
convince all those who deny the Divine Providence. When sinners see how
justly God takes away the gifts they have abused, they will not have a
word to say. It is of great use to us to be fully assured of God's
goodness, and duly affected with it. It is our wisdom to mind our duty,
and to refer our comfort to him. A truly wise person will treasure in
his heart this delightful psalm. From it, he will fully understand the
weakness and wretchedness of man, and the power and loving-kindness of
God, not for our merit, but for his mercy's sake.
