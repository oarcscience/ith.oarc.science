### [Micah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

([Mic 1:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001).md) The wrath of God against
Israel.

([Mic 1:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008).md) Also against Jerusalem
and other cities, Their precautions vain.

[Micah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 1:1</span></span>

The earth is called upon, with all that are therein, to hear the
prophet. God's holy temple will not protect false professors. Neither
men of high degree, as the mountains, nor men of low degree, as the
valleys, can secure themselves or the land from the judgments of God. If
sin be found in God's people he will not spare them; and their sins are
most provoking to him, for they are most reproaching. When we feel the
smart of sin, it behoves us to seek what is the sin we smart for.
Persons and places most exalted, are most exposed to spiritual diseases.
The vices of leaders and rulers shall be surely and sorely punished. The
punishment answers the sin. What they gave to idols, never shall
prosper, nor do them any good. What is got by one lust, is wasted on
another.

[Micah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 1:8</span></span>

The prophet laments that Israel's case is desperate; but declare it not
in Gath. Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the
sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to
do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, "a house of
dust." When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves
to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this
mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming
upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath.
All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in
them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven;
and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh
from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours' sufferings,
yet their turn to be punished will some come.
