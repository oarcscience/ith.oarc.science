### [Genesis Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 21:0</span></span>

([Gen 21:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009).md) Ishmael mocks Isaac.

([Gen 21:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014).md) Hagar and Ishmael are
cast forth, They are relieved and comforted by an angel.

([Gen 21:22-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022).md) Abimelech's covenant

[Genesis 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 21:1</span></span>

Few under the Old Testament were brought into the world with such
expectations as Isaac. He was in this a type of Christ, that Seed which
the holy God so long promised, and holy men so long expected. He was
born according to the promise, at the set time of which God had spoken.
God's promised mercies will certainly come at the time which He sets,
and that is the best time. Isaac means "laughter," and there was good
reason for the name, [Gen 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md); [Gen
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#013.md). When the Sun of comfort is
risen upon the soul, it is good to remember how welcome the dawning of
the day was. When Sarah received the promise, she laughed with distrust
and doubt. When God gives us the mercies we began to despair of, we
ought to remember with sorrow and shame our sinful distrust of his power
and promise, when we were in pursuit of them. This mercy filled Sarah
with joy and wonder. God's favours to his covenant people are such as
surpass their own and others' thoughts and expectations: who could
imagine that he should do so much for those that deserve so little, nay,
for those that deserve so ill? Who would have said that God should send
his Son to die for us, his Spirit to make us holy, his angels to attend
us? Who would have said that such great sins should be pardoned, such
mean services accepted, and such worthless worms taken into covenant? A
short account of Isaac's infancy is given. God's blessing upon the
nursing of children, and the preservation of them through the perils of
the infant age, are to be acknowledged as signal instances of the care
and tenderness of the Divine providence. See [Psa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009.md), [Psa
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md), [Hos
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002.md).

[Genesis 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 21:9</span></span>

Let us not overlook the manner in which this family matter instructs us
not to rest in outward privileges, or in our own doings. And let us seek
the blessings of the new covenant by faith in its Divine Surety.
Ishmael's conduct was persecution, being done in profane contempt of the
covenant and promise, and with malice against Isaac. God takes notice of
what children say and do in their play; and will reckon with them, if
they say or do amiss, though their parents do not. Mocking is a great
sin, and very provoking to God. And the children of promise must expect
to be mocked. Abraham was grieved that Ishmael should misbehave, and
Sarah demand so severe a punishment. But God showed him that Isaac must
be the father of the promised Seed; therefore, send Ishmael away, lest
he corrupt the manners, or try to take the rights of Isaac. The covenant
seed of Abraham must be a people by themselves, not mingled with those
who were out of covenant: Sarah little thought of this; but God turned
aright what she said.

[Genesis 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 21:14</span></span>

If Hagar and Ishmael had behaved well in Abraham's family, they might
have continued there; but they were justly punished. By abusing
privileges, we forfeit them. Those who know not when they are well off,
will be made to know the worth of mercies by the want of them. They were
brought to distress in the wilderness. It is not said that the
provisions were spent, or that Abraham sent them away without money. But
the water was spent; and having lost their way, in that hot climate
Ishmael was soon overcome with fatigue and thirst. God's readiness to
help us when we are in trouble, must not slacken, but quicken our
endeavours to help ourselves. The promise concerning her son is
repeated, as a reason why Hagar should bestir herself to help him. It
should engage our care and pains about children and young people, to
consider that we know not what great use God has designed them for, and
may make of them. The angel directs her to a present supply. Many who
have reason to be comforted, go mourning from day to day, because they
do not see the reason they have for comfort. There is a well of water
near them in the covenant of grace, but they are not aware of it, till
the same God that opened their eyes to see their wound, opens them to
see their remedy. Paran was a wild place, fit for a wild man; such as
Ishmael. Those who are born after the flesh, take up with the wilderness
of this world, while the children of the promise aim at the heavenly
Canaan, and cannot be at rest till they are there. Yet God was with the
lad; his outward welfare was owing to this.

[Genesis 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 21:22</span></span>

Abimelech felt sure that the promises of God would be fulfilled to
Abraham. It is wise to connect ourselves with those who are blessed of
God; and we ought to requite kindness to those who have been kind to us.
Wells of water are scarce and valuable in eastern countries. Abraham
took care to have his title to the well allowed, to prevent disputes in
future. No more can be expected from an honest man than that he be ready
to do right, as soon as he knows he has done wrong. Abraham, being now
in a good neighbourhood, stayed a great while there. There he made, not
only a constant practice, but an open profession of his religion. There
he called on the name of the Lord, as the everlasting God; probably in
the grove he planted, which was his place of prayer. Abraham kept up
public worship, in which his neighbours might join. Good men should do
all they can to make others so. Wherever we sojourn, we must neither
neglect nor be ashamed of the worship of Jehovah.
