### [Mark Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001.md)

[Mark 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 11:1</span></span>

Christ's coming into Jerusalem thus remarkably, shows that he was not
afraid of the power and malice of his enemies. This would encourage his
disciples who were full of fear. Also, that he was not disquieted at the
thoughts of his approaching sufferings. But all marked his humiliation;
and these matters teach us not to mind high things, but to condescend to
those of low estate. How ill it becomes Christians to take state, when
Christ was so far from claiming it! They welcomed his person; Blessed is
he that cometh, the "He that should come," so often promised, so long
expected; he comes in the name of the Lord. Let him have our best
affections; he is a blessed Saviour, and brings blessings to us, and
blessed be He that sent him. Praises be to our God, who is in the
highest heavens, over all, God blessed for ever.

[Mark 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 11:12</span></span>

Christ looked to find some fruit, for the time of gathering figs, though
it was near, was not yet come; but he found none. He made this fig-tree
an example, not to the trees, but to the men of that generation. It was
a figure of the doom upon the Jewish church, to which he came seeking
fruit, but found none. Christ went to the temple, and began to reform
the abuses in its courts, to show that when the Redeemer came to Zion,
it was to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. The scribes and the chief
priests sought, not how they might make their peace with him, but how
they might destroy him. A desperate attempt, which they could not but
fear was fighting against God.

[Mark 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 11:19</span></span>

The disciples could not think why that fig-tree should so soon wither
away; but all wither who reject Christ; it represented the state of the
Jewish church. We should rest in no religion that does not make us
fruitful in good works. Christ taught them from hence to pray in faith.
It may be applied to that mighty faith with which all true Christians
are endued, and which does wonders in spiritual things. It justifies us,
and so removes mountains of guilt, never to rise up in judgment against
us. It purifies the heart, and so removes mountains of corruption, and
makes them plain before the grace of God. One great errand to the throne
of grace is to pray for the pardon of our sins; and care about this
ought to be our daily concern.

[Mark 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 11:27</span></span>

Our Saviour shows how near akin his doctrine and baptism were to those
of John; they had the same design and tendency, to bring in the gospel
kingdom. These elders did not deserve to be taught; for it was plain
that they contended not for truth, but victory: nor did he need to tell
them; for the works he did, told them plainly he had authority from God;
since no man could do the miracles which he did, unless God were with
him.
