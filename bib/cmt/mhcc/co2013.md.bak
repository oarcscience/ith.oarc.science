### [2 Corinthians Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 13:0</span></span>

([Co2 13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001).md) The apostle threatens
obstinate offenders.

([Co2 13:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007).md) He prays for their
reformation.

([Co2 13:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011).md) And ends the epistle
with a salutation and blessing.

[2 Corinthians 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 13:1</span></span>

Though it is God's gracious method to bear long with sinners, yet he
will not bear always; at length he will come, and will not spare those
who remain obstinate and impenitent. Christ at his crucifixion, appeared
as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and life showed
his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they
appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifested the power of
God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, and experience, as gold is
assayed or proved by the touchstone. If they could prove themselves not
to be reprobates, not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would
know that he was not a reprobate, not disowned by Christ. They ought to
know if Christ Jesus was in them, by the influences, graces, and
indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdom set up in their hearts. Let us
question our own souls; either we are true Christians, or we are
deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by his Spirit, and power of his love,
our faith is dead, and we are yet disapproved by our Judge.

[2 Corinthians 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 13:7</span></span>

The most desirable thing we can ask of God, for ourselves and our
friends, is to be kept from sin, that we and they may not do evil. We
have far more need to pray that we may not do evil, than that we may not
suffer evil. The apostle not only desired that they might be kept from
sin, but also that they might grow in grace, and increase in holiness.
We are earnestly to pray to God for those we caution, that they may
cease to do evil, and learn to do well; and we should be glad for others
to be strong in the grace of Christ, though it may be the means of
showing our own weakness. let us also pray that we may be enabled to
make a proper use of all our talents.

[2 Corinthians 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 13:11</span></span>

Here are several good exhortations. God is the Author of peace and Lover
of concord; he hath loved us, and is willing to be at peace with us. And
let it be our constant aim so to walk, that separation from our friends
may be only for a time, and that we may meet in that happy world where
parting will be unknown. He wishes that they may partake all the
benefits which Christ of his free grace and favour has purchased; the
Father out of his free love has purposed; and the Holy Ghost applies and
bestows.
