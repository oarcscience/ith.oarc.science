### [Jeremiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 18:0</span></span>

([Jer 18:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001).md) God's power over his
creatures is represented by the potter.

([Jer 18:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011).md) The Jews exhorted to
repentance, and judgments foretold.

([Jer 18:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018).md) The prophet appeals to
God.

[Jeremiah 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 18:1</span></span>

While Jeremiah looks upon the potter's work, God darts into his mind two
great truths. God has authority, and power, to form and fashion kingdoms
and nations as he pleases. He may dispose of us as he thinks fit; and it
would be as absurd for us to dispute this, as for the clay to quarrel
with the potter. But he always goes by fixed rules of justice and
goodness. When God is coming against us in judgments, we may be sure it
is for our sins; but sincere conversion from the evil of sin will
prevent the evil of punishment, as to persons, and to families, and
nations.

[Jeremiah 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 18:11</span></span>

Sinners call it liberty to live at large; whereas for a man to be a
slave to his lusts, is the very worst slavery. They forsook God for
idols. When men are parched with heat, and meet with cooling, refreshing
streams, they use them. In these things men will not leave a certainty
for an uncertainty; but Israel left the ancient paths appointed by the
Divine law. They walked not in the highway, in which they might travel
safely, but in a way in which they must stumble: such was the way of
idolatry, and such is the way of iniquity. This made their land
desolate, and themselves miserable. Calamities may be borne, if God
smile upon us when under them; but if he is displeased, and refuses his
help, we are undone. Multitudes forget the Lord and his Christ, and
wander from the ancient paths, to walk in ways of their own devising.
But what will they do in the day of judgment!

[Jeremiah 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 18:18</span></span>

When the prophet called to repentance, instead of obeying the call, the
people devised devices against him. Thus do sinners deal with the great
Intercessor, crucifying him afresh, and speaking against him on earth,
while his blood is speaking for them in heaven. But the prophet had done
his duty to them; and the same will be our rejoicing in a day of evil.
