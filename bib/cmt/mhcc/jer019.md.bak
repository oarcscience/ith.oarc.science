### [Jeremiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 19:0</span></span>

By the type of breaking an earthen vessel, Jeremiah is to predict the
destruction of Judah.

[Jeremiah 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 19:1</span></span>

The prophet must give notice of ruin coming upon Judah and Jerusalem.
Both rulers and ruled must attend to it. That place which holiness made
the joy of the whole earth, sin made the reproach and shame of the whole
earth. There is no fleeing from God's justice, but by fleeing to his
mercy.

[Jeremiah 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 19:10</span></span>

The potter's vessel, after it is hardened, can never be pieced again
when it is broken. And as the bottle was broken, so shall Judah and
Jerusalem be broken by the Chaldeans. No human hand can repair it; but
if they return to the Lord he will heal. As they filled Tophet with the
slain sacrificed to their idols, so will God fill the whole city with
the slain that shall fall as sacrifices to his justice. Whatever men may
think, God will appear as terrible against sin and sinners as the
Scriptures state; nor shall the unbelief of men make his promise or his
threatenings of no effect. The obstinacy of sinners in sinful ways, is
their own fault; if they are deaf to the word of God, it is because they
have stopped their ears. We have need to pray that God, by his grace,
would deliver us from hardness of heart, and contempt of his word and
commandments.
