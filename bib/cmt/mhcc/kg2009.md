### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 9:0</span></span>

([Kg2 9:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001)) Elisha sends to anoint
Jehu.

([Kg2 9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011)) Jehu and the captains.

([Kg2 9:16-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#016)) Joram and Ahaziah slain
by Jehu.

([Kg2 9:30-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030)) Jezebel eaten by dogs.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 9:1</span></span>

In these and the like events, we must acknowledge the secret working of
God, disposing men to fulfil his purposes respecting them. Jehu was
anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still
had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among
them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house
of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right
principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder
of God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatry and
enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 9:11</span></span>

Those who faithfully deliver the Lord's message to sinners, have in all
ages been treated as madmen. Their judgment, speech, and conduct are
contrary to those of other men; they endure much in pursuit of objects,
and are influenced by motives, into which the others cannot enter. But
above all, the charge is brought by the worldly and ungodly of all
sorts, who are mad indeed; while the principles and practice of the
devoted servants of God, prove to be wise and reasonable. Some faith in
the word of God, seems to have animated Jehu to this undertaking.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 9:16</span></span>

Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choice
of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to
be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better
than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The
circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to
make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a
glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, [Isa
57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021). What peace can sinners have
with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is
repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal,
under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of
Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin. It is dangerous
to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt and misery by it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 9:30</span></span>

Instead of hiding herself, as one afraid of Divine vengeance, Jezebel
mocked at fear. See how a heart, hardened against God, will brave it out
to the last. There is not a surer presage of ruin, than an unhumbled
heart under humbling providences. Let those look at Jezebel's conduct
and fate, who use arts to seduce others to commit wickedness, and to
draw them aside from the ways of truth and righteousness. Jehu called
for aid against Jezebel. When reformation-work is on foot, it is time to
ask, Who sides with it? Her attendants delivered her up. Thus she was
put to death. See the end of pride and cruelty, and say, The Lord is
righteous. When we pamper our bodies, let us think how vile they are;
shortly they will be a feast for worms under ground, or beasts above
ground. May we all flee from that wrath which is revealed from heaven,
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
