### [Deuteronomy Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 28:0</span></span>

([Deu 28:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001).md) The blessings for
obedience.

(v. 15-44) The curses for disobedience.

(v. 45-68) Their ruin, if disobedient.

[Deuteronomy 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 28:1</span></span>

This chapter is a very large exposition of two words, the blessing and
the curse. They are real things and have real effects. The blessings are
here put before the curses. God is slow to anger, but swift to show
mercy. It is his delight to bless. It is better that we should be drawn
to what is good by a child-like hope of God's favour, than that we be
frightened to it by a slavish fear of his wrath. The blessing is
promised, upon condition that they diligently hearken to the voice of
God. Let them keep up religion, the form and power of it, in their
families and nation, then the providence of God would prosper all their
outward concerns.

[Deuteronomy 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 28:15</span></span>

If we do not keep God's commandments, we not only come short of the
blessing promised, but we lay ourselves under the curse, which includes
all misery, as the blessing all happiness. Observe the justice of this
curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent
and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God
follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a
curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true
comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many
judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and
with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostasy
and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in
their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by
these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left
to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in
danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks
frightful.

[Deuteronomy 28:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">deu 28:45</span></span>

If God inflicts vengeance, what miseries his curse can bring upon
mankind, even in this present world! Yet these are but the beginning of
sorrows to those under the curse of God. What then will be the misery of
that world where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched!
Observe what is here said of the wrath of God, which should come and
remain upon the Israelites for their sins. It is amazing to think that a
people so long the favourites of Heaven, should be so cast off; and yet
that a people so scattered in all nations should be kept distinct, and
not mixed with others. If they would not serve God with cheerfulness,
they should be compelled to serve their enemies. We may justly expect
from God, that if we do not fear his fearful name, we shall feel his
fearful plagues; for one way or other God will be feared. The
destruction threatened is described. They have, indeed, been plucked
from off the land, [Deu 28:63](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063.md). Not
only by the Babylonish captivity, and when Jerusalem was destroyed by
the Romans; but afterwards, when they were forbidden to set foot in
Jerusalem. They should have no rest; no rest of body, [Deu
28:65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065.md), but be continually on the
remove, either in hope of gain, or fear of persecution. No rest of the
mind, which is much worse. They have been banished from city to city,
from country to country; recalled, and banished again. These events,
compared with the favour shown to Israel in ancient times, and with the
prophecies about them, should not only excite astonishment, but turn
unto us for a testimony, assuring us of the truth of Scripture. And when
the other prophecies of their conversion to Christ shall come to pass,
the whole will be a sign and a wonder to all the nations of the earth,
and the forerunner of a general spread of true Christianity. The
fulfilling of these prophecies upon the Jewish nation, delivered more
than three thousand years ago, shows that Moses spake by the Spirit of
God; who not only foresees the ruin of sinners, but warns of it, that
they may prevent it by a true and timely repentance, or else be left
without excuse. And let us be thankful that Christ hath redeemed us from
the curse of the law, by being made a curse for us, and bearing in his
own person all that punishment which our sins merit, and which we must
otherwise have endured for ever. To this Refuge and salvation let
sinners flee; therein let believers rejoice, and serve their reconciled
God with gladness of heart, for the abundance of his spiritual
blessings.
