### [Psalms Chapter 93](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 93:0</span></span>

The majesty, power, and holiness of Christ's kingdom.

[Psalms 93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 93:1</span></span>

The Lord might have displayed only his justice, holiness, and awful
power, in his dealings with fallen men; but he has been pleased to
display the riches of his mercy, and the power of his renewing grace. In
this great work, the Father has given all power to his Son, the Lord
from heaven, who has made atonement for our sins. He not only can
pardon, but deliver and protect all who trust in him. His word is past,
and all the saints may rely upon it. Whatever was foretold concerning
the kingdom of the Messiah, must be fulfilled in due time. All his
people ought to be very strictly pure. God's church is his house; it is
a holy house, cleansed from sin, and employed in his service. Where
there is purity, there shall be peace. Let all carefully look if this
kingdom is set up in their hearts.
