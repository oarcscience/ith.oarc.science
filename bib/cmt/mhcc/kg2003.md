### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 3:0</span></span>

([Kg2 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001)) Jehoram, king of Israel.

([Kg2 3:6-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#006)) War with Moab, The
intercession of Elisha.

([Kg2 3:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#020)) Water supplied, Moab
overcome.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 3:1</span></span>

Jehoram took warning by God's judgment, and put away the image of Baal,
yet he maintained the worship of the calves. Those do not truly repent
or reform, who only part with the sins they lose by, but continue to
love the sins that they think to gain by.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 3:6</span></span>

The king of Israel laments their distress, and the danger they were in.
He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus
the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth
against the Lord, [Pro 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003). It was
well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much
better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men
sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them
to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and
society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them
make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's
blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of
Baca, and thus make even that a well, [Psa
84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006). We need not inquire whence the
water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek
for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than
conquerors.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 3:20</span></span>

It is a blessing to be favoured with the company of those who have power
with God, and can prevail by their prayers. A kingdom may be upheld and
prosper, in consequence of the fervent prayers of those who are dear to
God. May we place our highest regard upon such as are most precious in
his account. When sinners are saying Peace, peace, destruction comes
upon them: despair will follow their mad presumption. In Satan's service
and at his suggestion, such horrid deeds have been done, as cause the
natural feelings of the heart to shudder; like the king of Moab's
sacrificing his son. It is well not to urge the worst of men to
extremities; we should rather leave them to the judgment of God.
