### [Judges Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 8:0</span></span>

[Judges 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 8:1</span></span>

Those who will not attempt or venture any thing in the cause of God,
will be the most ready to censure and quarrel with such as are of a more
zealous and enterprising spirit. And those who are the most backward to
difficult services, will be the most angry not to have the credit of
them. Gideon stands here as a great example of self-denial; and shows us
that envy is best removed by humility. The Ephraimites had given vent to
their passion in very wrong freedom of speech, a certain sign of a weak
cause: reason runs low when chiding flies high.

[Judges 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 8:4</span></span>

Gideon's men were faint, yet pursuing; fatigued with what they had done,
yet eager to do more against their enemies. It is many a time the true
Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows but little
of the persevering and successful struggle the real believer maintains
with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divine strength,
in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by the supply of which
alone he can finish it in triumph.

[Judges 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 8:13</span></span>

The active servants of the Lord meet with more dangerous opposition from
false professors than from open enemies; but they must not care for the
behaviour of those who are Israelites in name, but Midianites in heart.
They must pursue the enemies of their souls, and of the cause of God,
though they are ready to faint through inward conflicts and outward
hardships. And they shall be enabled to persevere. The less men help,
and the more they seek to hinder, the more will the Lord assist.
Gideon's warning being slighted, the punishment was just. Many are
taught with the briers and thorns of affliction, who would not learn
otherwise.

[Judges 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 8:18</span></span>

The kings of Midian must be reckoned with. As they confessed themselves
guilty of murder, Gideon acted as the avenger of blood, being the next
of kin to the persons slain. Little did they think to have heard of this
so long after; but murder seldom goes unpunished in this life. Sins long
forgotten by man, must be accounted for to God. What poor consolation in
death from the hope of suffering less pain, and of dying with less
disgrace than some others! yet many are more anxious on these accounts,
than concerning the future judgment, and what will follow.

[Judges 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 8:22</span></span>

Gideon refused the government the people offered him. No good man can be
pleased with any honour done to himself, which belongs only to God.
Gideon thought to keep up the remembrance of this victory by an ephod,
made of the choicest of the spoils. But probably this ephod had, as
usual, a teraphim annexed to it, and Gideon intended this for an oracle
to be consulted. Many are led into false ways by one false step of a
good man. It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruin of
the family. How soon will ornaments which feed the lust of the eye, and
form the pride of life, as well as tend to the indulgences of the flesh,
bring shame on those who are fond of them!

[Judges 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 8:29</span></span>

As soon as Gideon was dead, who kept the people to the worship of the
God of Israel, they found themselves under no restraint; then they went
after Baalim, and showed no kindness to the family of Gideon. No wonder
if those who forget their God, forget their friends. Yet conscious of
our own ingratitude to the Lord, and observing that of mankind in
general, we should learn to be patient under any unkind returns we meet
with for our poor services, and resolve, after the Divine example, not
to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.
