### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 18:0</span></span>

([Sa2 18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001).md) Absalom's army defeated.

([Sa2 18:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009).md) He is slain.

([Sa2 18:19-33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#019).md) David's over-sorrow.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 18:1</span></span>

How does David render good for evil! Absalom would have only David
smitten; David would have only Absalom spared. This seems to be a
resemblance of man's wickedness towards God, and God's mercy to man, of
which it is hard to say which is most amazing. Now the Israelites see
what it is to take counsel against the Lord and his anointed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 18:9</span></span>

Let young people look upon Absalom, hanging on a tree, accursed,
forsaken of heaven and earth; there let them read the Lord's abhorrence
of rebellion against parents. Nothing can preserve men from misery and
contempt, but heavenly wisdom and the grace of God.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 18:19</span></span>

By directing David to give God thanks for his victory, Ahimaaz prepared
him for the news of his son's death. The more our hearts are fixed and
enlarged, in thanksgiving to God for our mercies, the better disposed we
shall be to bear with patience the afflictions mixed with them. Some
think David's wish arose from concern about Absalom's everlasting state;
but he rather seems to have spoken without due thought. He is to be
blamed for showing so great fondness for a graceless son. Also for
quarrelling with Divine justice. And for opposing the justice of the
nation, which, as king, he had to administer, and which ought to be
preferred before natural affection. The best men are not always in a
good frame; we are apt to over-grieve for what we over-loved. But while
we learn from this example to watch and pray against sinful indulgence,
or neglect of our children, may we not, in David, perceive a shadow of
the Saviour's love, who wept over, prayed for, and even suffered death
for mankind, though vile rebels and enemies.
