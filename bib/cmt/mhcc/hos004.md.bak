### [Hosea Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 4:0</span></span>

([Hos 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001).md) God's judgments against
the sins of the people.

([Hos 4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006).md) And of the priests.

([Hos 4:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012).md) Idolatry is reproved,
and Judah is admonished.

[Hosea 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 4:1</span></span>

Hosea reproves for immorality, as well as idolatry. There was no truth,
mercy, or knowledge of God in the land: it was full of murders, [Kg2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md). Therefore calamities were near,
which would desolate the country. Our sins, as separate persons, as a
family, as a neighbourhood, as a nation, cause the Lord to have a
controversy with us; let us submit and humble ourselves before Him, that
he may not go on to destroy.

[Hosea 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 4:6</span></span>

Both priests and people rejected knowledge; God will justly reject them.
They forgot the law of God, neither desired nor endeavoured to retain it
in mind, and to transmit the remembrance to their posterity; therefore
God will justly forget them and their children. If we dishonour God with
that which is our honour, it will, sooner or later, be turned into shame
to us. Instead of warning the people against sin, from the consideration
of the sacrifices, which showed what an offence sin was to God, since it
needed an atonement, the priests encouraged the people to sin, since
atonement might be made at so small an expense. It is very wicked to be
pleased with the sins of others, because they may turn to our advantage.
What is unlawfully gained, cannot be comfortably used. The people and
the priests hardened one another in sin; therefore justly shall they
share in the punishment. Sharers in sin must expect to share in ruin.
Any lust harboured in the heart, in time will eat out all its strength
and vigour. That is the reason why many professors grow so heavy, so
dull, so dead in the way of religion. They have a liking for some secret
lust, which takes away their hearts.

[Hosea 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 4:12</span></span>

The people consulted images, and not the Divine word. This would lead to
disorder and sin. Thus men prepare scourges for themselves, and vice is
spread through a people. Let not Judah come near the idolatrous worship
of Israel. For Israel was devoted to idols, and must now be let alone.
When sinners cast off the easy yoke of Christ, they go on in sin till
the Lord saith, Let them alone. Then they receive no more warnings, feel
no more convictions: Satan takes full possession of them, and they ripen
for destruction. It is a sad and sore judgment for any man to be let
alone in sin. Those who are not disturbed in their sin, will be
destroyed for their sin. May we be kept from this awful state; for the
wrath of God, like a strong tempest, will soon hurry impenitent sinners
into ruin.
