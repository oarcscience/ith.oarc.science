### [Leviticus Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

Laws concerning the priests and sacrifices.

[Leviticus 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 22:1</span></span>

In this chapter we have divers laws concerning the priests and
sacrifices, all for preserving the honour of the sanctuary. Let us
recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered
by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember,
that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his
ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine
ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from
them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever
attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of
self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes
to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the
minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in
this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of
their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the
atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance
with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.
