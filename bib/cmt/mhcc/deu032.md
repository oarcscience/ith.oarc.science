[Deuteronomy 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 32:1</span></span>

Moses begins with a solemn appeal to heaven and earth, concerning the
truth and importance of what he was about to say. His doctrine is the
gospel, the speech of God, the doctrine of Christ; the doctrine of grace
and mercy through him, and of life and salvation by him.

[Deuteronomy 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 32:3</span></span>

"He is a Rock." This is the first time God is called so in Scripture.
The expression denotes that the Divine power, faithfulness, and love, as
revealed in Christ and the gospel, form a foundation which cannot be
changed or moved, on which we may build our hopes of happiness. And
under his protection we may find refuge from all our enemies, and in all
our troubles; as the rocks in those countries sheltered from the burning
rays of the sun, and from tempests, or were fortresses from the enemy.
"His work is perfect:" that of redemption and salvation, in which there
is a display of all the Divine perfection, complete in all its parts.
All God's dealings with his creatures are regulated by wisdom which
cannot err, and perfect justice. He is indeed just and right; he takes
care that none shall lose by him. A high charge is exhibited against
Israel. Even God's children have their spots, while in this imperfect
state; for if we say we have no sin, no spot, we deceive ourselves. But
the sin of Israel was not habitual, notorious, unrepented sin; which is
a certain mark of the children of Satan. They were fools to forsake
their mercies for lying vanities. All wilful sinners, especially sinners
in Israel, are unwise and ungrateful.

[Deuteronomy 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 32:7</span></span>

Moses gives particular instances of God's kindness and concern for them.
The eagle's care for her young is a beautiful emblem of Christ's love,
who came between Divine justice and our guilty souls, and bare our sins
in his own body on the tree. And by the preached gospel, and the
influences of the Holy Spirit, He stirs up and prevails upon sinners to
leave Satan's bondage. In [Deu 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013.md),
[Deu 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014.md), are emblems of the
conquest believers have over their spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, and
the world, in and through Christ. Also of their safety and triumph in
him; of their happy frames of soul, when they are above the world, and
the things of it. This will be the blessed case of spiritual Israel in
every sense in the latter day.

[Deuteronomy 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 32:15</span></span>

Here are two instances of the wickedness of Israel, each was apostasy
from God. These people were called Jeshurun, "an upright people," so
some; "a seeing people," so others: but they soon lost the reputation
both of their knowledge and of their righteousness. They indulged their
appetites, as if they had nothing to do but to make provision for the
flesh to fulfil the lusts of it. Those who make a god of themselves, and
a god of their bellies, in pride and wantonness, and cannot bear to be
told of it, thereby forsake God, and show they esteem him lightly. There
is but one way of a sinner's acceptance and sanctification, however
different modes of irreligion, or false religion, may show that
favourable regard for other ways, which is often miscalled candid. How
mad are idolaters, who forsake the Rock of salvation, to run themselves
upon the rock of perdition!

[Deuteronomy 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 32:19</span></span>

The revolt of Israel was described in the foregoing verses, and here
follow the resolves of Divine justice as to them. We deceive ourselves,
if we think that God will be mocked by a faithless people. Sin makes us
hateful in the sight of the holy God. See what mischief sin does, and
reckon those to be fools that mock at it.

[Deuteronomy 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 32:26</span></span>

The idolatry and rebellions of Israel deserved, and the justice of God
seemed to demand, that they should be rooted out. But He spared Israel,
and continues them still to be living witnesses of the truth of the
Bible, and to silence unbelievers. They are preserved for wise and holy
purposes and the prophecies give us some idea what those purposes are.
The Lord will never disgrace the throne of his glory. It is great
wisdom, and will help much to the return of sinners to God, seriously to
consider their latter end, or the future state. It is here meant
particularly of what God foretold by Moses, about this people in the
latter days; but it may be applied generally. Oh that men would consider
the happiness they will lose, and the misery they will certainly plunge
into, if they go on in their trespasses! What will be in the end
thereof? [Jer 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md). For the Lord will
in due time bring down the enemies of the church, in displeasure against
their wickedness. When sinners deem themselves most secure, they
suddenly fall into destruction. And God's time to appear for the
deliverance of his people, is when things are at the worst with them.
But those who trust to any rock but God, will find it fail them when
they most need it. The rejection of the Messiah by the Jewish nation, is
the continuance of their ancient idolatry, apostasy, and rebellion. They
shall be brought to humble themselves before the Lord, to repent of
their sins, and to trust in their long-rejected Mediator for salvation.
Then he will deliver them, and make their prosperity great.

[Deuteronomy 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">deu 32:39</span></span>

This conclusion of the song speaks, 1. Glory to God. No escape can be
made from his power. 2. It speaks terror to his enemies. Terror indeed
to those who hate him. The wrath of God is here revealed from heaven
against them. 3. It speaks comfort to his own people. The song concludes
with words of joy. Whatever judgments are brought upon sinners, it shall
go well with the people of God.

[Deuteronomy 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">deu 32:44</span></span>

Here is the solemn delivery of this song to Israel, with a charge to
mind all the good words Moses had said unto them. It is not a trifle,
but a matter of life and death: mind it, and you are made for ever;
neglect it, and you are for ever undone. Oh that men were fully
persuaded that religion is their life, even the life of their souls!

[Deuteronomy 32:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">deu 32:48</span></span>

Now Moses had done his work, why should he desire to live a day longer?
God reminds him of the sin of which he had been guilty, for which he was
kept from entering Canaan. It is good for the best of men to die
repenting the infirmities of which they are conscious. But those may die
with comfort and ease, whenever God calls for them, notwithstanding the
sins they remember against themselves, who have a believing prospect,
and a well-grounded hope of eternal life beyond death.
