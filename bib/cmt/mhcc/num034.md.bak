### [Numbers Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 34:0</span></span>

([Num 34:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001).md) The bounds of the
promised land.

([Num 34:16-29](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016).md) Those appointed to
divide the land.

[Numbers 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 34:1</span></span>

Canaan was of small extent; as it is here bounded, it is but about 160
miles in length, and about 50 in breadth; yet this was the country
promised to the father of the faithful, and the possession of the seed
of Israel. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many
ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the garden
enclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness of the
space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earth is
the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and serve him;
but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see how little a
share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who have their
portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a small pittance of
this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, having it from the
love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable
than the riches of many wicked.

[Numbers 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 34:16</span></span>

God here appoints men to divide the land to them. So sure must they feel
of victory and success while God fought for them, that the persons are
named who should be entrusted with the dividing of the land.
