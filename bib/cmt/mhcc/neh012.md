### [Nehemiah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 12:0</span></span>

(v. 1-26) The priests and Levites that returned.

(v. 27-43) The dedication of the wall.

([Neh 12:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044)) The officers of the
temple settled.

[Nehemiah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 12:1</span></span>

It is a debt we owe to faithful ministers, to remember our guides, who
have spoken to us the word of God. It is good to know what our godly
predecessors were, that we may learn what we should be.

[Nehemiah 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">neh 12:27</span></span>

All our cities, all our houses, must have holiness to the Lord written
upon them. The believer should undertake nothing which he does not
dedicate to the Lord. We are concerned to cleanse our hands, and purify
our hearts, when any work for God is to pass through them. Those that
would be employed to sanctify others, must sanctify themselves, and set
themselves apart for God. To those who are sanctified, all their
creature-comforts and enjoyments are made holy. The people greatly
rejoiced. All that share in public mercies, ought to join in public
thanksgivings.

[Nehemiah 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">neh 12:44</span></span>

When the solemnities of a thanksgiving day leave such impressions on
ministers and people, that both are more careful and cheerful in doing
their duty, they are indeed acceptable to the Lord, and turn to good
account. And whatever we do, must be purified by the blood of
sprinkling, and by the grace of the Holy Spirit, or it cannot be
acceptable to God.
