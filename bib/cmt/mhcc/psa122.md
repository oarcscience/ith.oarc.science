### [Psalms Chapter 122](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 122:0</span></span>

([Psa 122:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001)) Esteem for Jerusalem.

([Psa 122:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006)) Concern for its
welfare.

[Psalms 122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 122:1</span></span>

The pleasure and profit from means of grace, should make us disregard
trouble and fatigue in going to them; and we should quicken one another
to what is good. We should desire our Christian friends, when they have
any good work in hand, to call for us, and take us with them. With what
readiness should we think of the heavenly Jerusalem! How cheerfully
should we bear the cross and welcome death, in hopes of a crown of
glory! Jerusalem is called the beautiful city. It was a type of the
gospel church, which is compact together in holy love and Christian
communion, so that it is all as one city. If all the disciples of Christ
were of one mind, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,
their enemies would be deprived of their chief advantages against them.
But Satan's maxim always has been, to divide that he may conquer; and
few Christians are sufficiently aware of his designs.

[Psalms 122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 122:6</span></span>

Those who can do nothing else for the peace of Jerusalem, may pray for
it. Let us consider all who seek the glory of the Redeemer, as our
brethren and fellow-travellers, without regarding differences which do
not affect our eternal welfare. Blessed Spirit of peace and love, who
didst dwell in the soul of the holy Jesus, descend into his church, and
fill those who compose it with his heavenly tempers; cause bitter
contentions to cease, and make us to be of one mind. Love of the
brethren and love to God, ought to stir us up to seek to be like the
Lord Jesus in fervent prayer and unwearied labour, for the salvation of
men, and the Divine glory.
