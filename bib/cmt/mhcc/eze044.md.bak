### [Ezekiel Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001.md)

This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The
prince evidently means Christ, and the words in [Eze
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002.md), may remind us that no other can
enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of
his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and
strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own
holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must
enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.
