### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 21:0</span></span>

([Kg1 21:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001).md) Ahab covets Naboth's
vineyard.

([Kg1 21:5-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#005).md) Naboth murdered by
Jezebel.

([Kg1 21:17-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#017).md) Elijah denounces
judgments against Ahab.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 21:1</span></span>

Naboth, perhaps, had been pleased that he had a vineyard situated so
near the palace, but the situation proved fatal to him; many a man's
possessions have been his snare, and his neighbourhood to greatness, of
bad consequence. Discontent is a sin that is its own punishment, and
makes men torment themselves. It is a sin that is its own parent; it
arises not from the condition, but from the mind: as we find Paul
contented in a prison, so Ahab was discontented in a palace. He had all
the delights of Canaan, that pleasant land, at command; the wealth of a
kingdom, the pleasures of a court, and the honours and powers of a
throne; yet all avails him nothing without Naboth's vineyard. Wrong
desires expose men to continual vexations, and those that are disposed
to fret, however well off, may always find something or other to fret
at.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 21:5</span></span>

When, instead of a help meet, a man has an agent for Satan, in the form
of an artful, unprincipled, yet beloved wife, fatal effects may be
expected. Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those
Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under
colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but
religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done
under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let
us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and
the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the
keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always
be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be
set to rights in the great day.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 21:17</span></span>

Blessed Paul complains that he was sold under sin, [Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014.md), as a poor captive against his
will; but Ahab was willing, he sold himself to sin; of choice, and as
his own act and deed, he loved the dominion of sin. Jezebel his wife
stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before
his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has
made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the
ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth.
Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was
unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen
of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent,
and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial
penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing
penitent shall go to his house justified.
