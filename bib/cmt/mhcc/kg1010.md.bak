### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 10:0</span></span>

([Kg1 10:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001).md) The queen of Sheba's
visit to Solomon.

(v. 14-29) Solomon's wealth.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 10:1</span></span>

The queen of Sheba came to Solomon to hear his wisdom, thereby to
improve her own. Our Saviour mentions her inquiries after God, by
Solomon, as showing the stupidity of those who inquire not after God, by
our Lord Jesus Christ. By waiting and prayer, by diligently searching
the Scriptures, by consulting wise and experienced Christians, and by
practising what we have learned, we shall be delivered from
difficulties. Solomon's wisdom made more impression upon the queen of
Sheba than all his prosperity and grandeur. There is a spiritual
excellence in heavenly things, and in consistent Christians, to which no
reports can do justice. Here the truth exceeded; and all who, through
grace, are brought to commune with God, will say the one half was not
told them of the pleasures and the advantages of wisdom's ways.
Glorified saints, much more, will say of heaven, that the thousandth
part was not told them, [Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md). She
pronounced them happy that constantly attended Solomon. With much more
reason may we say of Christ's servants, Blessed are they that dwell in
his house; they will be still praising him. She made a noble present to
Solomon. What we present to Christ, he needs not, but will have us do so
to express our gratitude. The believer who has been with Jesus, will
return to his station, discharge his duties with readiness, and from
better motives; looking forward to the day when, being absent from the
body, he shall be present with the Lord.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 10:14</span></span>

Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is
the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable;
much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of
all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be
despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven,
which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in
Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it
encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was
he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the
vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them,
and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious
godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that
all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of
God, it is within our reach.
