### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 9:0</span></span>

([Ecc 9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001).md) Good and bad men fare
alike as to this world.

([Ecc 9:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004).md) All men must die, Their
portion as to this life.

([Ecc 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md), [Ecc
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012).md) Disappointments common.

([Ecc 9:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013).md) Benefits of wisdom.

[Ecclesiastes 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 9:1</span></span>

We are not to think our searching into the word or works of God useless,
because we cannot explain all difficulties. We may learn many things
good for ourselves and useful to others. But man cannot always decide
who are objects of God's special love, or under his wrath; and God will
certainly put a difference between the precious and the vile, in the
other world. The difference as to present happiness, arises from the
inward supports and consolations the righteous enjoy, and the benefit
they derive from varied trials and mercies. As far as the sons of men
are left to themselves, their hearts are full of evil; and prosperity in
sin, causes them even to set God at defiance by daring wickedness.
Though, on this side death, the righteous and the wicked may often seem
to fare alike, on the other side there will be a vast difference between
them.

[Ecclesiastes 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 9:4</span></span>

The most despicable living man's state, is preferable to that of the
most noble who have died impenitent. Solomon exhorts the wise and pious
to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their condition in life. The
meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answer to prayer,
will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our hearts upon the
delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use with wisdom. The
joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springs from a sense
of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, that to come is the
world of recompence. All in their stations, may find some work to do.
And above all, sinners have the salvation of their souls to seek after,
believers have to prove their faith, adorn the gospel, glorify God, and
serve their generation.

[Ecclesiastes 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 9:11</span></span>

Men's success seldom equals their expectations. We must use means, but
not trust to them: if we succeed, we must give God the praise; if
crossed, we must submit to his will. Those who put off the great
concerns of their souls, are caught in Satan's net, which he baits with
some worldly object, for which they reject or neglect the gospel, and go
on in sin till they suddenly fall into destruction.

[Ecclesiastes 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 9:13</span></span>

A man may, by his wisdom, bring to pass that which he could never do by
his strength. If God be for us, who can be against us, or stand before
us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though it may labour under
outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words! But wise and good
men must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done
good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it, when they cannot do the good
they would, nor have the praise they should. How many of the good gifts,
both of nature and Providence, does one sinner destroy and make waste!
He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. One sinner may draw
many into his destroying ways. See who are the friends and enemies of a
kingdom or a family, if one saint does much good, and one sinner
destroys much good.
