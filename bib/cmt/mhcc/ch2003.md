### [2 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

The building of the temple.

[2 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 3:1</span></span>

There is a more particular account of the building of the temple in 1
Kings 6. It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he
had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full
instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to
proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough
to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let
us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to
understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be
made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him.
Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of
Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through
the Spirit.
