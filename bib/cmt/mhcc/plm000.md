[Philemon](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001)

Philemon was an inhabitant of Colosse, a person of some note and wealth,
and a convert under the ministry of St. Paul. Onesimus was the slave of
Philemon: having run away from his master, he went to Rome, where he was
converted to the Christian faith, by the word as set forth by Paul, who
kept him till his conduct proved the truth and sincerity of his
conversion. He wished to repair the injury he had done to his master,
but fearing the punishment his offence deserved might be inflicted, he
entreated the apostle to write to Philemon. And St. Paul seems no where
to reason more beautifully, or to entreat more forcibly, than in this
epistle.
