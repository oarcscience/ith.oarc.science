### [Esther Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#001)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 7:0</span></span>

([Est 7:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#001)) Esther accuses Haman.

([Est 7:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#007)) Haman hanged on his own
gallows.

[Esther 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 7:1</span></span>

If the love of life causes earnest pleadings with those that can only
kill the body, how fervent should our prayers be to Him, who is able to
destroy both body and soul in hell! How should we pray for the salvation
of our relatives, friends, and all around us! When we petition great
men, we must be cautious not to give them offence; even just complaints
must often be kept back. But when we approach the King of kings with
reverence, we cannot ask or expect too much. Though nothing but wrath be
our due, God is able and willing to do exceeding abundantly, even beyond
all we can ask or think.

[Esther 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 7:7</span></span>

The king was angry: those that do things with self-will, reflect upon
them afterward with self-reproach. When angry, we should pause before we
come to any resolution, and thus rule our own spirits, and show that we
are governed by reason. Those that are most haughty and insolent when in
power and prosperity, commonly, like Haman, are the most abject and
poor-spirited when brought down. The day is coming when those that hate
and persecute God's chosen ones, would gladly be beholden to them. The
king returns yet more angry against Haman. Those about him were ready to
put his wrath into execution. How little can proud men be sure of the
interest they think they have! The enemies of God's church have often
been thus taken in their own craftiness. The Lord is known by such
judgments. Then was the king's wrath pacified, and not till then. And
who pities Haman hanged on his own gallows? who does not rather rejoice
in the Divine righteousness displayed in the destruction his own art
brought upon him? Let the workers of iniquity tremble, turn to the Lord,
and seek pardon through the blood of Jesus.
