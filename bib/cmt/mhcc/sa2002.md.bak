### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 2:1</span></span>

After the death of Saul, many went to David at Ziklag, [Ch1
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#022.md), but he trusted in God who
promised him the kingdom, to give it in his own time and manner. Yet
assurance of hope in God's promise, will quicken pious endeavours. If I
be chosen to the crown of life, it does not follow, Then I will do
nothing; but, Then I will do all that God directs me. This good use
David made of his election, and so will all whom God has chosen. In all
our journeys and removes, it is comfortable to see God going before us;
and we may do so, if by faith and prayer we set Him before us. God,
according to the promise, directed David's path. David rose gradually:
thus the kingdom of the Messiah, the Son of David, is set up by degrees;
he is Lord of all, but we see not yet all things put under him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 2:8</span></span>

The nation in general refused David. By this the Lord trained up his
servant for future honour and usefulness; and the tendency of true
godliness was shown in his behaviour while passing through various
difficulties. David was herein a type of Christ, whom Israel would not
submit to, though anointed of the Father to be a Prince and a Saviour to
them. Abner meant, Let the young men fight before us, when he said, Let
them play before us: fools thus make a mock at sin. But he is unworthy
the name of a man, that can thus trifle with human blood.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 2:18</span></span>

Death often comes by ways we least suspect. We are often betrayed by the
accomplishments we are proud of! Asahel's swiftness, which he presumed
so much upon, did him no service, but hastened his end.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 2:25</span></span>

Abner appeals to Joab concerning the miserable consequences of a civil
war. Those who make light of such unnatural contests, will find that
they are bitterness to all concerned. How easy it is for men to use
reason, when it makes for them, who would not use it, if it made against
them! See how the issue of things alter men's minds! The same thing
which looked pleasant in the morning, at night looked dismal. Those who
are most forward to enter into contention, will repent before they have
done with it, and had better leave it off before it be meddled with, as
Solomon advises. This is true of every sin, oh that men would consider
it in time, that it will be bitterness in the latter end! Asahel's
funeral is here mentioned. Distinctions are made between the dust of
some and that of others; but in the resurrection no difference will be
made, but between the godly and ungodly, which will remain for ever.
