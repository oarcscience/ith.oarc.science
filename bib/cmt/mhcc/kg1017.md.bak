God wonderfully suits men to the work he designs them for. The times
were fit for an Elijah; an Elijah was fit for them. The Spirit of the
Lord knows how to fit men for the occasions. Elijah let Ahab know that
God was displeased with the idolaters, and would chastise them by the
want of rain, which it was not in the power of the gods they served to
bestow. Elijah was commanded to hide himself. If Providence calls us to
solitude and retirement, it becomes us to go: when we cannot be useful,
we must be patient; and when we cannot work for God, we must sit still
quietly for him. The ravens were appointed to bring him meat, and did
so. Let those who have but from hand to mouth, learn to live upon
Providence, and trust it for the bread of the day, in the day. God could
have sent angels to minister to him; but he chose to show that he can
serve his own purposes by the meanest creatures, as effectually as by
the mightiest. Elijah seems to have continued thus above a year. The
natural supply of water, which came by common providence, failed; but
the miraculous supply of food, made sure to him by promise, failed not.
If the heavens fail, the earth fails of course; such are all our
creature-comforts: we lose them when we most need them, like brooks in
summer. But there is a river which makes glad the city of God, that
never runs dry, a well of water that springs up to eternal life. Lord,
give us that living water!

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 17:8</span></span>

Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, and some, it is likely,
would have bidden him welcome to their houses; yet he is sent to honour
and bless with his presence a city of Sidon, a Gentile city, and so
becomes the first prophet of the Gentiles. Jezebel was Elijah's greatest
enemy; yet, to show her how powerless was her malice, God will find a
hiding-place for him even in her own country. The person appointed to
entertain Elijah is not one of the rich or great men of Sidon; but a
poor widow woman, in want, and desolate, is made both able and willing
to sustain him. It is God's way, and it is his glory, to make use of,
and put honour upon, the weak and foolish things of the world. O woman,
great was thy faith; one has not found the like, no not in Israel. She
took the prophet's word, that she should not lose by it. Those who can
venture upon the promise of God, will make no difficulty to expose and
empty themselves in his service, by giving him his part first. Surely
the increase of this widow's faith, so as to enable her thus readily to
deny herself, and to depend upon the Divine promise, was as great a
miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the increase of her meal and oil in
the kingdom of providence. Happy are all who can thus, against hope,
believe and obey in hope. One poor meal's meat this poor widow gave the
prophet; in recompence of it, she and her son did eat above two years,
in a time of famine. To have food from God's special favour, and in such
good company as Elijah, made it more than doubly sweet. It is promised
to those who trust in God, that they shall not be ashamed in evil time;
in days of famine they shall be satisfied.

Neither faith nor obedience shut out afflictions and death. The child
being dead, the mother spake to the prophet, rather to give vent to her
sorrow, than in hope of relief. When God removes our comforts from us,
he remembers our sins against us, perhaps the sins of our youth, though
long since past. When God remembers our sins against us, he designs to
teach us to remember them against ourselves, and to repent of them.
Elijah's prayer was doubtless directed by the Holy Spirit. The child
revived. See the power of prayer, and the power of Him who hears prayer.
