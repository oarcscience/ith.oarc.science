### [Ezekiel Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 34:0</span></span>

([Eze 34:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001).md) The rulers reproved.

([Eze 34:7-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#007).md) The people are to be
restored to their own land.

([Eze 34:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017).md) The kingdom of Christ.

[Ezekiel 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 34:1</span></span>

The people became as sheep without a shepherd, were given up as a prey
to their enemies, and the land was utterly desolated. No rank or office
can exempt from the reproofs of God's word, men who neglect their duty,
and abuse the trust reposed in them.

[Ezekiel 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 34:7</span></span>

The Lord declared that he intended mercy towards the scattered flock.
Doubtless this, in the first place, had reference to the restoration of
the Jews. It also represented the good Shepherd's tender care of the
souls of his people. He finds them in their days of darkness and
ignorance, and brings them to his fold. He comes to their relief in
times of persecution and temptation. He leads them in the ways of
righteousness, and causes them to rest on his love and faithfulness. The
proud and self-sufficient, are enemies of the true gospel and of
believers; against such we must guard. He has rest for disquieted
saints, and terror for presumptuous sinners.

[Ezekiel 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 34:17</span></span>

The whole nation seemed to be the Lord's flock, yet they were very
different characters; but he knew how to distinguish between them. By
good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the
dispensing of justice. The latter verses, [Eze
34:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md), prophesy of Christ, and of
the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good
Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though
excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being
the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields
spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and
prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place
where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the
gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.
