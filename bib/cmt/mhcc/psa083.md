### [Psalms Chapter 83](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 83:0</span></span>

([Psa 83:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001).md) The designs of the
enemies of Israel.

([Psa 83:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009).md) Earnest prayer for
their defeat.

[Psalms 83:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 83:1</span></span>

Sometimes God seems not to be concerned at the unjust treatment of his
people. But then we may call upon him, as the psalmist here. All wicked
people are God's enemies, especially wicked persecutors. The Lord's
people are his hidden one; the world knows them not. He takes them under
his special protection. Do the enemies of the church act with one
consent to destroy it, and shall not the friends of the church be
united? Wicked men wish that there might be no religion among mankind.
They would gladly see all its restraints shaken off, and all that
preach, profess, or practise it, cut off. This they would bring to pass
if it were in their power. The enemies of God's church have always been
many: this magnifies the power of the Lord in preserving to himself a
church in the world.

[Psalms 83:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 83:9</span></span>

All who oppose the kingdom of Christ may here read their doom. God is
the same still that ever he was; the same to his people, and the same
against his and their enemies. God would make their enemies like a
wheel; unsettled in all their counsels and resolves. Not only let them
be driven away as stubble, but burnt as stubble. And this will be the
end of wicked men. Let them be made to fear thy name, and perhaps that
will bring them to seek thy name. We should desire no confusion to our
enemies and persecutors but what may forward their conversion. The
stormy tempest of Divine vengeance will overtake them, unless they
repent and seek the pardoning mercy of their offended Lord. God's
triumphs over his enemies, clearly prove that he is, according to his
name JEHOVAH, an almighty Being, who has all power and perfection in
himself. May we fear his wrath, and yield ourselves to be his willing
servants. And let us seek deliverance by the destruction of our fleshly
lusts, which war against the soul.
