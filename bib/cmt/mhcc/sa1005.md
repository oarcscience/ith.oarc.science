### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 5:0</span></span>

([Sa1 5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001).md) Dagon is broken before
the ark.

([Sa1 5:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006).md) The Philistine smitten.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 5:1</span></span>

See the ark's triumph over Dagon. Thus the kingdom of Satan will
certainly fall before the kingdom of Christ, error before truth,
profaneness before godliness, and corruption before grace in the hearts
of the faithful. When the interests of religion seem to be ready to
sink, even then we may be confident that the day of their triumph will
come. When Christ, the true Ark of the covenant, really enters the heart
of fallen man, which is indeed Satan's temple, all idols will fall,
every endeavour to set them up again will be vain, sin will be forsaken,
and unrighteous gain restored; the Lord will claim and possess the
throne. But pride, self-love, and worldly lusts, though dethroned and
crucified, still remain within us, like the stump of Dagon. Let us watch
and pray that they may not prevail. Let us seek to have them more
entirely destroyed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 5:6</span></span>

The hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Philistines; he not only
convinced them of their folly, but severely chastised their insolence.
Yet they would not renounce Dagon; and instead of seeking God's mercy,
they desired to get clear of his ark. Carnal hearts, when they smart
under the judgments of God, would rather, if it were possible, put him
far from them, than enter into covenant or communion with him, and seek
him for their friend. But their devices to escape the Divine judgments
only increase them. Those that fight against God will soon have enough
of it.
