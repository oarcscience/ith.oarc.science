<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001">Eze 25:1-7</A>) Judgments against the Ammonites.
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008">Eze 25:8-17</A>) Against the Moabites, Edomites, and Philistines.

<p>It is wicked to be glad at the calamities of any, especially of God's people; it is a sin for which he will surely reckon. God will make it appear that he is the God of Israel, though he suffers them for a time to be captives in Babylon. It is better to know Him, and to be poor, than to be rich and ignorant of him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008">Ezekiel 25:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">eze 25:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Though one event seem to the righteous and wicked, it is vastly different. Those who glory in any other defence and protection than the Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God to take vengeance for them, may expect that he will take vengeance on them. The equity of the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he not only avenges injuries upon those that did them, but by those against whom they were done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch for the opportunity of manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath.
