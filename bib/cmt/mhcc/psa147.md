### [Psalms Chapter 147](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 147:0</span></span>

([Psa 147:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001).md) The people of God are
exhorted to praise him for his mercies and care.

([Psa 147:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012).md) For the salvation and
prosperity of the church.

[Psalms 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 147:1</span></span>

Praising God is work that is its own wages. It is comely; it becomes us
as reasonable creatures, much more as people in covenant with God. He
gathers outcast sinners by his grace, and will bring them into his holy
habitation. To those whom God heals with the consolations of his Spirit,
he speaks peace, assures them their sins are pardoned. And for this, let
others praise him also. Man's knowledge is soon ended; but God's
knowledge is a dept that can never be fathomed. And while he telleth the
number of the stars, he condescends to hear the broken-hearted sinner.
While he feeds the young ravens, he will not leave his praying people
destitute. Clouds look dull and melancholy, yet without them we could
have no rain, therefore no fruit. Thus afflictions look black and
unpleasant; but from clouds of affliction come showers that make the
soul to yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness. The psalmist
delights not in things wherein sinners trust and glory; but a serious
and suitable regard to God is, in his sight, of very great price. We are
not to be in doubt between hope and fear, but to act under the gracious
influences of hope and fear united.

[Psalms 147:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 147:12</span></span>

The church, like Jerusalem of old, built up and preserved by the wisdom,
power, and goodness of God, is exhorted to praise him for all the
benefits and blessings vouchsafed to her; and these are represented by
his favours in the course of nature. The thawing word may represent the
gospel of Christ, and the thawing wind the Spirit of Christ; for the
Spirit is compared to the wind, [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md). Converting grace softens the
heart that was hard frozen, and melts it into tears of repentance, and
makes good reflections to flow, which before were chilled and stopped
up. The change which the thaw makes is very evident, yet how it is done
no one can say. Such is the change wrought in the conversion of a soul,
when God's word and Spirit are sent to melt it and restore it to itself.
