### [Ezekiel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 9:0</span></span>

A vision denoting the destruction of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
the departure of the symbol of the Divine presence.

[Ezekiel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 9:1</span></span>

It is a great comfort to believers, that in the midst of destroyers and
destructions, there is a Mediator, a great High Priest, who has an
interest in heaven, and in whom saints on earth have an interest. The
representation of the Divine glory from above the ark, removed to the
threshold, denoted that the Lord was about to leave his mercy-seat, and
to pronounce judgment on the people. The distinguishing character of
this remnant that is to be saved, is such as sigh and cry to God in
prayer, because of the abominations in Jerusalem. Those who keep pure in
times of general wickedness, God will keep safe in times of general
trouble and distress.

[Ezekiel 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 9:5</span></span>

The slaughter must begin at the sanctuary, that all may see and know
that the Lord hates sin most in those nearest to him. He who was
appointed to protect, reported the matter. Christ is faithful to the
trust reposed in him. Is he commanded by his Father to secure eternal
life to the chosen remnant? He says, Of all that thou hast given me, I
have lost none. If others perish, and we are saved, we must ascribe the
difference wholly to the mercy of our God, for we too have deserved
wrath. Let us still continue to plead in behalf of others. But where the
Lord shows no mercy he does no injustice; he only recompenses men's
ways.
