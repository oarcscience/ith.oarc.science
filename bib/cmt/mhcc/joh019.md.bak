### [John Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001.md)

[John 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 19:1</span></span>

Little did Pilate think with what holy regard these sufferings of Christ
would, in after-ages, be thought upon and spoken of by the best and
greatest of men. Our Lord Jesus came forth, willing to be exposed to
their scorn. It is good for every one with faith, to behold Christ Jesus
in his sufferings. Behold him, and love him; be still looking unto
Jesus. Did their hatred sharpen their endeavours against him? and shall
not our love for him quicken our endeavours for him and his kingdom?
Pilate seems to have thought that Jesus might be some person above the
common order. Even natural conscience makes men afraid of being found
fighting against God. As our Lord suffered for the sins both of Jews and
Gentiles, it was a special part of the counsel of Divine Wisdom, that
the Jews should first purpose his death, and the Gentiles carry that
purpose into effect. Had not Christ been thus rejected of men, we had
been for ever rejected of God. Now was the Son of man delivered into the
hands of wicked and unreasonable men. He was led forth for us, that we
might escape. He was nailed to the cross, as a Sacrifice bound to the
altar. The Scripture was fulfilled; he did not die at the altar among
the sacrifices, but among criminals sacrificed to public justice. And
now let us pause, and with faith look upon Jesus. Was ever sorrow like
unto his sorrow? See him bleeding, see him dying, see him and love him!
love him, and live to him!

[John 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 19:19</span></span>

Here are some remarkable circumstances of Jesus' death, more fully
related than before. Pilate would not gratify the chief priests by
allowing the writing to be altered; which was doubtless owing to a
secret power of God upon his heart, that this statement of our Lord's
character and authority might continue. Many things done by the Roman
soldiers were fulfilments of the prophecies of the Old Testament. All
things therein written shall be fulfilled. Christ tenderly provided for
his mother at his death. Sometimes, when God removes one comfort from
us, he raises up another for us, where we looked not for it. Christ's
example teaches all men to honour their parents in life and death; to
provide for their wants, and to promote their comfort by every means in
their power. Especially observe the dying word wherewith Jesus breathed
out his soul. It is finished; that is, the counsels of the Father
concerning his sufferings were now fulfilled. It is finished; all the
types and prophecies of the Old Testament, which pointed at the
sufferings of the Messiah, were accomplished. It is finished; the
ceremonial law is abolished; the substance is now come, and all the
shadows are done away. It is finished; an end is made of transgression
by bringing in an everlasting righteousness. His sufferings were now
finished, both those of his soul, and those of his body. It is finished;
the work of man's redemption and salvation is now completed. His life
was not taken from him by force, but freely given up.

[John 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 19:31</span></span>

A trial was made whether Jesus was dead. He died in less time than
persons crucified commonly did. It showed that he had laid down his life
of himself. The spear broke up the very fountains of life; no human body
could survive such a wound. But its being so solemnly attested, shows
there was something peculiar in it. The blood and water that flowed out,
signified those two great benefits which all believers partake of
through Christ, justification and sanctification; blood for atonement,
water for purification. They both flow from the pierced side of our
Redeemer. To Christ crucified we owe merit for our justification, and
Spirit and grace for our sanctification. Let this silence the fears of
weak Christians, and encourage their hopes; there came both water and
blood out of Jesus' pierced side, both to justify and sanctify them. The
Scripture was fulfilled, in Pilate's not allowing his legs to be broken,
[Psa 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020.md). There was a type of this
in the paschal lamb, [Exo 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#046.md). May
we ever look to Him, whom, by our sins, we have ignorantly and
heedlessly pierced, nay, sometimes against convictions and mercies; and
who shed from his wounded side both water and blood, that we might be
justified and sanctified in his name.

[John 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 19:38</span></span>

Joseph of Arimathea was a disciple of Christ in secret. Disciples should
openly own themselves; yet some, who in lesser trials have been fearful,
in greater have been courageous. When God has work to do, he can find
out such as are proper to do it. The embalming was done by Nicodemus, a
secret friend to Christ, though not his constant follower. That grace
which at first is like a bruised reed, may afterward resemble a strong
cedar. Hereby these two rich men showed the value they had for Christ's
person and doctrine, and that it was not lessened by the reproach of the
cross. We must do our duty as the present day and opportunity are, and
leave it to God to fulfil his promises in his own way and his own time.
The grave of Jesus was appointed with the wicked, as was the case of
those who suffered as criminals; but he was with the rich in his death,
as prophesied, [Isa 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md); these two
circumstances it was very unlikely should ever be united in the same
person. He was buried in a new sepulchre; therefore it could not be said
that it was not he, but some other that rose. We also are here taught
not to be particular as to the place of our burial. He was buried in the
sepulchre next at hand. Here is the Sun of Righteousness set for a
while, to rise again in greater glory, and then to set no more.
