### [Psalms Chapter 95](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 95:0</span></span>

([Psa 95:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001).md) Part. An exhortation to
praise God.

([Psa 95:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007).md) A warning not to tempt
Him.

[Psalms 95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 95:1</span></span>

Whenever we come into God's presence, we must come with thanksgiving.
The Lord is to be praised; we do not want matter, it were well if we did
not want a heart. How great is that God, whose the whole earth is, and
the fulness thereof; who directs and disposes of all!, The Lord Jesus,
whom we are here taught to praise, is a great God; the mighty God is one
of his titles, and God over all, blessed for evermore. To him all power
is given, both in heaven and earth. He is our God, and we should praise
him. He is our Saviour, and the Author of our blessedness. The gospel
church is his flock, Christ is the great and good Shepherd of believers;
he sought them when lost, and brought them to his fold.

[Psalms 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 95:7</span></span>

Christ calls upon his people to hear his voice. You call him Master, or
Lord; then be his willing, obedient people. Hear the voice of his
doctrine, of his law, and in both, of his Spirit: hear and heed; hear
and yield. Christ's voice must be heard to-day. This day of opportunity
will not last always; improve it while it is called to-day. Hearing the
voice of Christ is the same with believing. Hardness of heart is at the
bottom of all distrust of the Lord. The sins of others ought to be
warnings to us not to tread in their steps. The murmurings of Israel
were written for our admonition. God is not subject to such passions as
we are; but he is very angry at sin and sinners. That certainly is evil,
which deserves such a recompence; and his threatenings are as sure as
his promises. Let us be aware of the evils of our hearts, which lead us
to wander from the Lord. There is a rest ordained for believers, the
rest of everlasting refreshment, begun in this life, and perfected in
the life to come. This is the rest which God calls his rest.
