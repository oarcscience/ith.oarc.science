### [2 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 1:0</span></span>

Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth.

[2 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 1:1</span></span>

SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those
that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed;
while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have
not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their
end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but
those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that,
and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is
good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those
great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal
snares to the soul.
