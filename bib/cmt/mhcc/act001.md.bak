### [Acts Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

([Act 1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001).md) Proofs of Christ's
resurrection.

([Act 1:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006).md) Christ's ascension.

([Act 1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012).md) The apostles unite in
prayer.

([Act 1:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015).md) Matthias chosen in the
place of Judas.

[Acts 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 1:1</span></span>

Our Lord told the disciples the work they were to do. The apostles met
together at Jerusalem; Christ having ordered them not to depart thence,
but to wait for the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. This would be a
baptism by the Holy Ghost, giving them power to work miracles, and
enlightening and sanctifying their souls. This confirms the Divine
promise, and encourages us to depend upon it, that we have heard it from
Christ; for in Him all the promises of God are yea and amen.

[Acts 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 1:6</span></span>

They were earnest in asking about that which their Master never had
directed or encouraged them to seek. Our Lord knew that his ascension
and the teaching of the Holy Spirit would soon end these expectations,
and therefore only gave them a rebuke; but it is a caution to his church
in all ages, to take heed of a desire of forbidden knowledge. He had
given his disciples instructions for the discharge of their duty, both
before his death and since his resurrection, and this knowledge is
enough for a Christian. It is enough that He has engaged to give
believers strength equal to their trials and services; that under the
influence of the Holy Spirit they may, in one way or other, be witnesses
for Christ on earth, while in heaven he manages their concerns with
perfect wisdom, truth, and love. When we stand gazing and trifling, the
thoughts of our Master's second coming should quicken and awaken us:
when we stand gazing and trembling, they should comfort and encourage
us. May our expectation of it be stedfast and joyful, giving diligence
to be found of him blameless.

[Acts 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 1:12</span></span>

God can find hiding-places for his people. They made supplication. All
God's people are praying people. It was now a time of trouble and danger
with the disciples of Christ; but if any is afflicted, let him pray;
that will silence cares and fears. They had now a great work to do, and
before they entered upon it, they were earnest in prayer to God for his
presence. They were waiting for the descent of the Spirit, and abounded
in prayer. Those are in the best frame to receive spiritual blessings,
who are in a praying frame. Christ had promised shortly to send the Holy
Ghost; that promise was not to do away prayer, but to quicken and
encourage it. A little company united in love, exemplary in their
conduct, fervent in prayer, and wisely zealous to promote the cause of
Christ, are likely to increase rapidly.

[Acts 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 1:15</span></span>

The great thing the apostles were to attest to the world, was, Christ's
resurrection; for that was the great proof of his being the Messiah, and
the foundation of our hope in him. The apostles were ordained, not to
wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his
resurrection. An appeal was made to God; "Thou, Lord, who knowest the
hearts of all men," which we do not; and better than they know their
own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as
he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit,
shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall
in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything
which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be
committed to us.
