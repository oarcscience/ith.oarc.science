### [Romans Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

([Rom 1:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001).md) The apostle's commission.

([Rom 1:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008).md) Prays for the saints at
Rome, and expresses his desire to see them.

([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md), [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017).md) The gospel way of justification
by faith, for Jews and Gentiles.

([Rom 1:18-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018).md) The sins of the
Gentiles set forth.

[Romans 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 1:1</span></span>

The doctrine of which the apostle Paul wrote, set forth the fulfilment
of the promises by the prophets. It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesus
the Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his human
nature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine power
which raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does not
consist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perverse
disputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, are brought
to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of Jesus Christ.
Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved of God, and
are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty of Christians; to
be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints. These the
apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify their souls, and
peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the free mercy of God,
the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming to them through the
Lord Jesus Christ.

[Romans 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 1:8</span></span>

We must show love for our friends, not only by praying for them, but by
praising God for them. As in our purposes, so in our desires, we must
remember to say, If the Lord will, [Jam
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015.md). Our journeys are made prosperous
or otherwise, according to the will of God. We should readily impart to
others what God has trusted to us, rejoicing to make others joyful,
especially taking pleasure in communing with those who believe the same
things with us. If redeemed by the blood, and converted by the grace of
the Lord Jesus, we are altogether his; and for his sake we are debtors
to all men, to do all the good we can. Such services are our duty.

[Romans 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 1:16</span></span>

In these verses the apostle opens the design of the whole epistle, in
which he brings forward a charge of sinfulness against all flesh;
declares the only method of deliverance from condemnation, by faith in
the mercy of God, through Jesus Christ; and then builds upon it purity
of heart, grateful obedience, and earnest desires to improve in all
those Christian graces and tempers, which nothing but a lively faith in
Christ can bring forth. God is a just and holy God, and we are guilty
sinners. It is necessary that we have a righteousness to appear in
before him: there is such a righteousness brought in by the Messiah, and
made known in the gospel; a gracious method of acceptance,
notwithstanding the guilt of our sins. It is the righteousness of
Christ, who is God, coming from a satisfaction of infinite value. Faith
is all in all, both in the beginning and progress of Christian life. It
is not from faith to works, as if faith put us into a justified state,
and then works kept us in it; but it is all along from faith to faith;
it is faith pressing forward, and gaining the victory over unbelief.

[Romans 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 1:18</span></span>

The apostle begins to show that all mankind need the salvation of the
gospel, because none could obtain the favour of God, or escape his wrath
by their own works. For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his
obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he
has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is
described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and
unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that
sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less,
do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so
that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's
invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has
made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse.
They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the
worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and
senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true
religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel
prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of
man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern
the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that
men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and
superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and
most abominable deeds.

[Romans 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 1:26</span></span>

In the horrid depravity of the heathen, the truth of our Lord's words
was shown: "Light was come into the world, but men loved darkness rather
than light, because their deeds were evil; for he that doeth evil hateth
the light." The truth was not to their taste. And we all know how soon a
man will contrive, against the strongest evidence, to reason himself out
of the belief of what he dislikes. But a man cannot be brought to
greater slavery than to be given up to his own lusts. As the Gentiles
did not like to keep God in their knowledge, they committed crimes
wholly against reason and their own welfare. The nature of man, whether
pagan or Christian, is still the same; and the charges of the apostle
apply more or less to the state and character of men at all times, till
they are brought to full submission to the faith of Christ, and renewed
by Divine power. There never yet was a man, who had not reason to lament
his strong corruptions, and his secret dislike to the will of God.
Therefore this chapter is a call to self-examination, the end of which
should be, a deep conviction of sin, and of the necessity of deliverance
from a state of condemnation.
