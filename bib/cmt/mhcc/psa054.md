### [Psalms Chapter 54](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 54:0</span></span>

([Psa 54:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001)) David complains of the
malice of his enemies.

([Psa 54:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#004)) Assurance of the Divine
favour and protection.

[Psalms 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 54:1</span></span>

God is faithful, though men are not to be trusted, and it is well for us
it is so. David has no other plea to depend upon than God's name, no
other power to depend upon than God's strength, and these he makes his
refuge and confidence. This would be the effectual answer to his
prayers. Looking unto David, betrayed by the men of Judah, and to Jesus,
betrayed by one of his apostles, what can we expect from any who have
not set God before them, save ingratitude, treachery, malice, and
cruelty? What bonds of nature, or friendship, or gratitude, or covenant,
will hold those that have broken through the fear of God? Selah; Mark
this. Let us set God before us at all times; for if we do not, we are in
danger of despair.

[Psalms 54:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 54:4</span></span>

Behold, God is mine Helper. If we are for him, he is for us; and if he
is for us, we need not fear. Every creature is that to us, and no more,
which God makes it to be. The Lord will in due time save his people, and
in the mean time he sustains them, and bears them up, so that the spirit
he has made shall not fail. There is truth in God's threatenings, as
well as in his promises; sinners that repent not, will find it so to
their cost. David's present deliverance was an earnest of further
deliverance. He speaks of the completion of his deliverance as a thing
done, though he had as yet many troubles before him; because, having
God's promise for it, he was as sure of it as if it was done already.
The Lord would deliver him out of all his troubles. May he help us to
bear our cross without repining, and at length bring us to share his
victories and glory. Christians never should suffer the voice of praise
and thanksgiving to cease in the church of the redeemed.
