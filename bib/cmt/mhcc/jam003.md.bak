### [James Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001.md)

[James](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jam 3:0</span></span>

([Jam 3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001).md) Cautions against proud
behaviour, and the mischief of an unruly tongue.

([Jam 3:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013).md) The excellence of
heavenly wisdom, in opposition to that which is worldly.

[James 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 3:1</span></span>

We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils.
The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men.
Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public,
affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of
the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are
employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame
the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not
represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay
with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful,
as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no
pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of
age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the
dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue
confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of
God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even
good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True
religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be
prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying
language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who
understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and
revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the
fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors
succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining
their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to
bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and
actions.

[James 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 3:13</span></span>

These verses show the difference between men's pretending to be wise,
and their being really so. He who thinks well, or he who talks well, is
not wise in the sense of the Scripture, if he does not live and act
well. True wisdom may be know by the meekness of the spirit and temper.
Those who live in malice, envy, and contention, live in confusion; and
are liable to be provoked and hurried to any evil work. Such wisdom
comes not down from above, but springs up from earthly principles, acts
on earthly motives, and is intent on serving earthly purposes. Those who
are lifted up with such wisdom, described by the apostle James, is near
to the Christian love, described by the apostle Paul; and both are so
described that every man may fully prove the reality of his attainments
in them. It has no disguise or deceit. It cannot fall in with those
managements the world counts wise, which are crafty and guileful; but it
is sincere, and open, and steady, and uniform, and consistent with
itself. May the purity, peace, gentleness, teachableness, and mercy
shown in all our actions, and the fruits of righteousness abounding in
our lives, prove that God has bestowed upon us this excellent gift.
