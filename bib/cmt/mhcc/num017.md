### [Numbers Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 17:0</span></span>

([Num 17:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001).md) Twelve rods laid up
before the Lord.

([Num 17:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008).md) Aaron's rod buds, and
is kept for a memorial.

[Numbers 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 17:1</span></span>

It is an instance of the grace of God, that, having wrought divers
miracles to punish sin, he would work one more to prevent it. Twelve
rods or staves were to be brought in. It is probable that they were the
staves which the princes used as ensigns of their authority; old dry
staves, that had no sap in them. They were to expect that the rod of the
tribe, or prince, whom God chose to the priesthood, should bud and
blossom. Moses did not object that the matter was sufficiently settled
already; he did not undertake to determine it; but left the case before
the Lord.

[Numbers 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 17:8</span></span>

While all the other rods remained as they were. Aaron's rod became a
living branch. In some places there were buds, in others blossoms, in
others fruit, at the same time; all this was miraculous. Thus Aaron was
manifested to be under the special blessing of Heaven. Fruitfulness is
the best evidence of a Divine call; and the plants of God's setting, and
the boughs cut off them, will flourish. This rod was preserved, to take
away the murmurings of the people, that they might not die. The design
of God, in all his providences, and in the memorials of them, is to take
away sin. Christ was manifested to take away sin. Christ is expressly
called a rod out of the stem of Jesse: little prospect was there,
according to human views, that he should ever flourish. But the dry rod
revived and blossomed to the confusion of his adversaries. The people
cry, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish! This was the language of
a repining people, quarrelling with the judgments of God, which by their
own pride and obstinacy they brought upon themselves. It is very wicked
to fret against God when we are in affliction, and in our distress thus
to trespass yet more. If we die, if we perish, it is of ourselves, and
the blame will be upon our own heads. When God judges, he will overcome,
and will oblige the most obstinate gainsayers to confess their folly.
And how great are our mercies, that we have a clearer and a better
dispensation, established upon better promises!
