### [Esther Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001.md)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 6:0</span></span>

([Est 6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001).md) Providence recommends
Mordecai to the king's favour.

([Est 6:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#004).md) Haman's counsel honours
Mordecai.

([Est 6:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#012).md) Haman's friends tell
him of his danger.

[Esther 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 6:1</span></span>

The providence of God rules over the smallest concerns of men. Not a
sparrow falls to the ground without him. Trace the steps which
Providence took towards the advancement of Mordecai. The king could not
sleep when Providence had a design to serve, in keeping him awake. We
read of no illness that broke his sleep, but God, whose gift sleep is,
withheld it from him. He who commanded a hundred and twenty-seven
provinces, could not command one hour's sleep.

[Esther 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 6:4</span></span>

See how men's pride deceives them. The deceitfulness of our own hearts
appears in nothing more than in the conceit we have of ourselves and our
own performances: against which we should constantly watch and pray.
Haman thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, but he was
deceived. We should suspect that the esteem which others profess for us,
is not so great as it seems to be, that we may not think too well of
ourselves, nor trust too much in others. How Haman is struck, when the
king bids him do honour to Mordecai the Jew, the very man whom he hated
above all men, whose ruin he was now designing!

[Esther 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 6:12</span></span>

Mordecai was not puffed up with his honours, he returned to his place
and the duty of it. Honour is well bestowed on those that do not think
themselves above their business. But Haman could not bear it. What harm
had it done him? But that will break a proud man's heart, which will not
break a humble man's sleep. His doom was, out of this event, read to him
by his wife and his friends. They plainly confessed that the Jews,
though scattered through the nations, were special objects of Divine
care. Miserable comforters are they all; they did not advise Haman to
repent, but foretold his fate as unavoidable. The wisdom of God is seen,
in timing the means of his church's deliverance, so as to manifest his
own glory.
