### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 22:0</span></span>

([Sa1 22:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001).md) David at Adullam, Many
resort to him.

([Sa1 22:6-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006).md) Saul destroys the
priests of Nob.

([Sa1 22:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020).md) Abiathar escapes to
David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 22:1</span></span>

See what weak instruments God sometimes uses, to bring about his own
purposes. The Son of David is ready to receive distressed souls, who
will be commanded by him. He receives all who come unto Him, however
vile and miserable; he changes them into a holy people, and employs them
in his service: those who would reign with him must be contented first
to suffer with and for him. Observe with what tender concern David
provided for his aged parents. The first thing he does is to find them a
quiet habitation, whatever became of himself. Let children learn to
honour their parents, in every thing consulting their ease and
satisfaction. Though highly preferred, and much employed, let them not
forget their aged parents. The steps of a good man are ordered by the
Lord. And the Lord will preserve his people for their appointed work,
however they may be hated and exposed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 22:6</span></span>

See the nature of jealous malice and its pitiful arts. Saul looks upon
all about him as his enemies, because they do not just say as he says.
In Ahimelech's answer to Saul we have the language of conscious
innocence. But what wickedness will not the evil spirit hurry men to
when he gets the dominion! Saul alleges that which was utterly false and
unproved. But the most bloody tyrants have found instruments of their
cruelty as barbarous as themselves. Doeg, having murdered the priests,
went to the city, Nob, and put all to the sword there. Nothing so vile
but those may do it, who have provoked God to give them up to their
hearts' lusts. Yet this was the accomplishment of the threatenings
against the house of Eli. Though Saul was unrighteous in doing this, yet
God was righteous in permitting it. No word of God shall fall to the
ground.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 22:20</span></span>

David greatly lamented the calamity. It is great trouble to a good man
to find himself any way the cause of evil to others. He must have been
much pained, when he considered that his falsehood was one cause of this
fatal event. David speaks with assurance of his own safety, and promises
that Abiathar should have his protection. With the Son of David, all who
are his may be sure they shall be in safeguard, [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md). In the hurry and distraction
David was continually in, he found time for communion with God, and
found comfort in it.
