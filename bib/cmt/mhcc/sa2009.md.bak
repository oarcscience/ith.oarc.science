### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 9:0</span></span>

([Sa2 9:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001).md) David sends for
Mephibosheth.

([Sa2 9:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#009).md) And provides for him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 9:1</span></span>

Amidst numerous affairs we are apt to forget the gratitude we owe, and
the engagements we are under, not only to our friends, but to God
himself. Yet persons of real godliness will have no rest till they have
discharged them. And the most proper objects of kindness and charity,
frequently will not be found without inquiry. Jonathan was David's sworn
friend, therefore he shows kindness to his son Mephibosheth. God is
faithful to us; let us not be unfaithful to one another. If Providence
has raised us, and our friends and their families are brought low, we
must look upon that as giving us the fairer opportunity of being kind to
them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 9:9</span></span>

As David was a type of Christ, his Lord and Son, his Root and Offspring,
let his kindness to Mephibosheth remind us of the kindness and love of
God our Saviour to fallen man, to whom he was under no obligation, as
David was to Jonathan. The Son of God seeks this lost and ruined race,
who sought not after him. He comes to seek and to save them!
