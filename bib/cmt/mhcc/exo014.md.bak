### [Exodus Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 14:0</span></span>

([Exo 14:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001).md) God directs the
Israelites to Pihahiroth, Pharaoh pursues after them.

([Exo 14:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010).md) The Israelites murmur,
Moses comforts them.

([Exo 14:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015).md) God instructs Moses,
The cloud between the Israelites and the Egyptians.

([Exo 14:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021).md) The Israelites pass
through the Red sea, which drowns the Egyptians.

[Exodus 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 14:1</span></span>

Pharaoh would think that all Israel was entangled in the wilderness, and
so would become an easy prey. But God says, I will be honoured upon
Pharaoh. All men being made for the honour of their Maker, those whom he
is not honoured by, he will be honoured upon. What seems to tend to the
church's ruin, is often overruled to the ruin of the church's enemies.
While Pharaoh gratified his malice and revenge, he furthered the
bringing to pass God's counsels concerning him. Though with the greatest
reason he had let Israel go, yet now he was angry with himself for it.
God makes the envy and rage of men against his people, a torment to
themselves. Those who set their faces heavenward, and will live godly in
Christ Jesus, must expect to be set upon by Satan's temptations and
terrors. He will not tamely part with any out of his service.

[Exodus 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 14:10</span></span>

There was no way open to Israel but upward, and thence their deliverance
came. We may be in the way of duty, following God, and hastening toward
heaven, yet may be troubled on every side. Some cried out unto the Lord;
their fear led them to pray, and that was well. God brings us into
straits, that he may bring us to our knees. Others cried out against
Moses; fear set them murmuring as if God were not still able to work
miracles. They quarrel with Moses for bringing them out of Egypt; and so
were angry with God for the greatest kindness ever done them; thus gross
are the absurdities of unbelief. Moses says, Fear ye not. It is always
our duty and interest, when we cannot get out of troubles, yet to get
above our fears; let them quicken our prayers and endeavours, but not
silence our faith and hope. "Stand still," think not to save yourselves
either by fighting or flying; wait God's orders, and observe them.
Compose yourselves, by confidence in God, into peaceful thoughts of the
great salvation God is about to work for you. If God brings his people
into straits, he will find a way to bring them out.

[Exodus 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 14:15</span></span>

Moses' silent prayers of faith prevailed more with God than Israel's
loud outcries of fear. The pillar of cloud and fire came behind them,
where they needed a guard, and it was a wall between them and their
enemies. The word and providence of God have a black and dark side
toward sin and sinners, but a bright and pleasant side toward the people
of the Lord. He, who divided between light and darkness, [Gen
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004.md), allotted darkness to the
Egyptians, and light to the Israelites. Such a difference there will be
between the inheritance of the saints in light, and that utter darkness
which will be the portion of hypocrites for ever.

[Exodus 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 14:21</span></span>

The dividing the Red sea was the terror of the Canaanites, [Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md); the praise and triumph of the
Israelites, [Psa 114:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#003.md); [Psa
106:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#009.md); [Psa
136:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#013.md). It was a type of baptism, [Co1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md), [Co1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002.md). Israel's passage through it was
typical of the conversion of souls, [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md); and the Egyptians being drowned
in it was typical of the final ruin of all unrepenting sinners. God
showed his almighty power, by opening a passage through the waters, some
miles over. God can bring his people through the greatest difficulties,
and force a way where he does not find it. It was an instance of his
wonderful favour to his Israel. They went through the sea, they walked
upon dry land in the midst of the sea. This was done, in order to
encourage God's people in all ages to trust him in the greatest straits.
What cannot he do who did this? What will not he do for those that fear
and love him, who did this for these murmuring, unbelieving Israelites?
Then followed the just and righteous wrath of God upon his and his
people's enemies. The ruin of sinners is brought on by their own rage
and presumption. They might have let Israel alone, and would not; now
they would flee from the face of Israel, and cannot. Men will not be
convinced, till it is too late, that those who meddle with God's people,
meddle to their own hurt. Moses was ordered to stretch out his hand over
the sea; the waters returned, and overwhelmed all the host of the
Egyptians. Pharaoh and his servants, who had hardened one another in
sin, now fell together, not one escaped. The Israelites saw the
Egyptians dead upon the sands. The sight very much affected them. While
men see God's works, and feel the benefit, they fear him and trust in
him. How well were it for us, if we were always in as good a frame as
sometimes! Behold the end to which a Christian may look forward. His
enemies rage, and are mighty; but while he holds fast by God, he shall
pass the waves in safety guarded by that very power of his Saviour,
which shall come down on every spiritual foe. The enemies of his soul
whom he hath seen to-day, he shall see no more for ever.
