### [Nahum Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001.md)

[Nahum](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">nah 3:0</span></span>

([Nah 3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001).md) The sins and judgments of
Nineveh.

([Nah 3:8-19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008).md) Its utter destruction.

[Nahum 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 3:1</span></span>

When proud sinners are brought down, others should learn not to lift
themselves up. The fall of this great city should be a lesson to private
persons, who increase wealth by fraud and oppression. They are preparing
enemies for themselves; and if the Lord sees good to punish them in this
world, they will have none to pity them. Every man who seeks his own
prosperity, safety, and peace, should not only act in an upright,
honourable manner, but with kindness to all.

[Nahum 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">nah 3:8</span></span>

Strong-holds, even the strongest, are no defence against the judgments
of God. They shall be unable to do any thing for themselves. The
Chaldeans and Medes would devour the land like canker-worms. The
Assyrians also would be eaten up by their own numerous hired troops,
which seem to be meant by the word rendered "merchants." Those that have
done evil to their neighbours, will find it come home to them. Nineveh,
and many other cities, states, and empires, have been ruined, and should
be a warning to us. Are we better, except as there are some true
Christians amongst us, who are a greater security, and a stronger
defence, than all the advantages of situation or strength? When the Lord
shows himself against a people, every thing they trust in must fail, or
prove a disadvantage; but he continues good to Israel. He is a
strong-hold for every believer in time of trouble, that cannot be
stormed or taken; and he knoweth those that trust in Him.
