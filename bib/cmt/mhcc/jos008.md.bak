### [Joshua Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 8:0</span></span>

([Jos 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md), [Jos
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#002).md) God encourages Joshua.

(v. 3-22) The taking of Ai.

([Jos 8:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#023).md) The destruction of Ai
and its king.

([Jos 8:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030).md) The law read on Ebal
and Gerizim.

[Joshua 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 8:1</span></span>

When we have faithfully put away sin, that accursed thing which
separates between us and God, then, and not till then, we may look to
hear from God to our comfort; and God's directing us how to go on in our
Christian work and warfare, is a good evidence of his being reconciled
to us. God encouraged Joshua to proceed. At Ai the spoil was not to be
destroyed as at Jericho, therefore there was no danger of the people's
committing such a trespass. Achan, who caught at forbidden spoil, lost
that, and life, and all; but the rest of the people, who kept themselves
from the accursed thing, were quickly rewarded for their obedience. The
way to have the comfort of what God allows us, is, to keep from what he
forbids us. No man shall lose by self-denial.

[Joshua 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 8:3</span></span>

Observe Joshua's conduct and prudence. Those that would maintain their
spiritual conflicts must not love their ease. Probably he went into the
valley alone, to pray to God for a blessing, and he did not seek in
vain. He never drew back till the work was done. Those that have
stretched out their hands against their spiritual enemies, must never
draw them back.

[Joshua 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 8:23</span></span>

God, the righteous Judge, had sentenced the Canaanites for their
wickedness; the Israelites only executed his doom. None of their conduct
can be drawn into an example for others. Especial reason no doubt there
was for this severity to the king of Ai; it is likely he had been
notoriously wicked and vile, and a blasphemer of the God of Israel.

[Joshua 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jos 8:30</span></span>

As soon as Joshua got to the mountains Ebal and Gerizim, without delay,
and without caring for the unsettled state of Israel, or their enemies,
he confirmed the covenant of the Lord with his people, as appointed,
Deuteronomy chapters 11 and 27. We must not think to defer covenanting
with God till we are settled in the world; nor must any business put us
from minding and pursuing the one thing needful. The way to prosper is
to begin with God, [Mat 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033.md). They
built an altar, and offered sacrifice to God, in token of their
dedicating themselves to God, as living sacrifices to his honour, in and
by a Mediator. By Christ's sacrifice of himself for us, we have peace
with God. It is a great mercy to any people to have the law of God in
writing, and it is fit that the written law should be in a known tongue,
that it may be seen and read of all men.
