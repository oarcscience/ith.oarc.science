### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 4:0</span></span>

(v. 1-19) Solomon's court.

([Kg1 4:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020).md) Solomon's dominions,
His daily provision.

([Kg1 4:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029).md) The wisdom of Solomon.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 4:1</span></span>

In the choice of the great officers of Solomon's court, no doubt, his
wisdom appeared. Several are the same that were in his father's time. A
plan was settled by which no part of the country was exhausted to supply
his court, though each sent its portion.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 4:20</span></span>

Never did the crown of Israel shine so bright, as when Solomon wore it.
He had peace on all sides. Herein, his kingdom was a type of the
Messiah's; for to Him it is promised that he shall have the heathen for
his inheritance, and that princes shall worship him. The spiritual
peace, and joy, and holy security, of all the faithful subjects of the
Lord Jesus, were typified by that of Israel. The kingdom of God is not,
as Solomon's was, meat and drink, but, what is infinitely better,
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. The vast number of
his attendants, and the great resort to him, are shown by the provision
daily made. Herein Christ far outdoes Solomon, that he feeds all his
subjects, not with the bread that perishes, but with that which endures
to eternal life.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 4:29</span></span>

Solomon's wisdom was more his glory than his wealth. He had what is here
called largeness of heart, for the heart is often put for the powers of
the mind. He had the gift of utterance, as well as wisdom. It is very
desirable, that those who have large gifts of any kind, should have
large hearts to use them for the good of others. What treasures of
wisdom and knowledge are lost! But every sort of knowledge that is
needful for salvation is to be found in the holy Scriptures. There came
persons from all parts, who were more eager after knowledge than their
neighbours, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Solomon was herein a type of
Christ, in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and hid
for us, for he is made of God to us, wisdom. Christ's fame shall spread
through all the earth, and men of all nations shall come to him, learn
of him, and take upon them his easy yoke, and find rest for their souls.
