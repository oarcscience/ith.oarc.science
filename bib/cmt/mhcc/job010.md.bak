### [Job Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 10:0</span></span>

([Job 10:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001).md) Job complains of his
hardships.

([Job 10:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008).md) He pleads with God as
his Maker.

([Job 10:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#014).md) He complains of God's
severity.

[Job 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 10:1</span></span>

Job, being weary of his life, resolves to complain, but he will not
charge God with unrighteousness. Here is a prayer that he might be
delivered from the sting of his afflictions, which is sin. When God
afflicts us, he contends with us; when he contends with us, there is
always a reason; and it is desirable to know the reason, that we may
repent of and forsake the sin for which God has a controversy with us.
But when, like Job, we speak in the bitterness of our souls, we increase
guilt and vexation. Let us harbour no hard thoughts of God; we shall
hereafter see there was no cause for them. Job is sure that God does not
discover things, nor judge of them, as men do; therefore he thinks it
strange that God continues him under affliction, as if he must take time
to inquire into his sin.

[Job 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 10:8</span></span>

Job seems to argue with God, as if he only formed and preserved him for
misery. God made us, not we ourselves. How sad that those bodies should
be instruments of unrighteousness, which are capable of being temples of
the Holy Ghost! But the soul is the life, the soul is the man, and this
is the gift of God. If we plead with ourselves as an inducement to duty,
God made me and maintains me, we may plead as an argument for mercy,
Thou hast made me, do thou new-make me; I am thine, save me.

[Job 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 10:14</span></span>

Job did not deny that as a sinner he deserved his sufferings; but he
thought that justice was executed upon him with peculiar rigour. His
gloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribed
to Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the sense
of God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remaining depravity.
Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the
work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto
holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earth renders
the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition who are
condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever? Let every sinner seek
deliverance from that dreadful state, and every believer be thankful to
Jesus, who delivereth from the wrath to come.
