### [Luke Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 5:0</span></span>

([Luk 5:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001).md) The miraculous draught
of fishes, Peter, James, and John called.

([Luk 5:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012).md) A leper cleansed.

([Luk 5:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017).md) A paralytic cured.

([Luk 5:27-39](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027).md) Levi called, Christ's
answer to the Pharisees.

[Luke 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 5:1</span></span>

When Christ had done preaching, he told Peter to apply to the business
of his calling. Time spent on week days in public exercises of religion,
need be but little hinderance in time, and may be great furtherance to
us in temper of mind, as to our worldly business. With what cheerfulness
may we go about the duties of our calling, when we have been with God,
and thus have our worldly employments sanctified to us by the word and
prayer! Though they had taken nothing, yet Christ told them to let down
their nets again. We must not abruptly quit our callings because we have
not the success in them we desire. We are likely to speed well, when we
follow the guidance of Christ's word. The draught of fishes was by a
miracle. We must all, like Peter, own ourselves to be sinful men,
therefore Jesus Christ might justly depart from us. But we must beseech
him that he would not depart; for woe unto us if the Saviour depart from
sinners! Rather let us entreat him to come and dwell in our hearts by
faith, that he may transform and cleanse them. These fishermen forsook
all, and followed Jesus, when their calling prospered. When riches
increase, and we are tempted to set our hearts upon them, then to quit
them for Christ is thankworthy.

[Luke 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 5:12</span></span>

This man is said to be full of leprosy; he had that distemper in a high
degree, which represents our natural pollution by sin; we are full of
that leprosy; from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot there
is no soundness in us. Strong confidence and deep humility are united in
the words of this leper. And if any sinner, from a deep sense of
vileness, says, I know the Lord can cleanse, but will he look upon such
a one as me? will he apply his own precious blood for my cleansing and
healing? Yes, he will. Speak not as doubting, but as humbly referring
the matter to Christ. And being saved from the guilt and power of our
sins, let us spread abroad Christ's fame, and bring others to hear him
and to be healed.

[Luke 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 5:17</span></span>

How many are there in our assemblies, where the gospel is preached, who
do not sit under the word, but sit by! It is to them as a tale that is
told them, not as a message that is sent to them. Observe the duties
taught and recommended to us by the history of the paralytic. In
applying to Christ, we must be very pressing and urgent; that is an
evidence of faith, and is very pleasing to Christ, and prevailing with
him. Give us, Lord, the same kind of faith with respect to thy ability
and willingness to heal our souls. Give us to desire the pardon of sin
more than any earthly blessing, or life itself. Enable us to believe thy
power to forgive sins; then will our souls cheerfully arise and go where
thou pleasest.

[Luke 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 5:27</span></span>

It was a wonder of Christ's grace, that he would call a publican to be
his disciple and follower. It was a wonder of his grace, that the call
was made so effectual. It was a wonder of his grace, that he came to
call sinners to repentance, and to assure them of pardon. It was a
wonder of his grace, that he so patiently bore the contradiction of
sinners against himself and his disciples. It was a wonder of his grace,
that he fixed the services of his disciples according to their strength
and standing. The Lord trains up his people gradually for the trials
allotted them; we should copy his example in dealing with the weak in
faith, or the tempted believer.
