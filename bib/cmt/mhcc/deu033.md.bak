### [Deuteronomy Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 33:0</span></span>

([Deu 33:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001).md) The glorious majesty of
God.

(v. 6-23) The blessings of the twelve tribes.

([Deu 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md), [Deu
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025).md) Strength to believers.

([Deu 33:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026).md) The excellency of
Israel.

[Deuteronomy 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 33:1</span></span>

To all his precepts, warnings, and prophecies, Moses added a solemn
blessing. He begins with a description of the glorious appearances of
God, in giving the law. His law works like fire. If received, it is
melting, warming, purifying, and burns up the dross of corruption; if
rejected, it hardens, sears, pains, and destroys. The Holy Spirit came
down in cloven tongues, as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery law.
The law of God written in the heart, is a certain proof of the love of
God shed abroad there: we must reckon His law one of the gifts of his
grace.

[Deuteronomy 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 33:6</span></span>

The order in which the tribes are here blessed, is not the same as is
observed elsewhere. The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe
in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the
tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and
desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, [Co2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009.md). This prayer is a prophecy, that
God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe
of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated
near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not
to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should
thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the
successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father
of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the
pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are
infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The
precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in
heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the
Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the
bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour
must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and
wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good.
Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply
thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not
only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing
of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the
soul. Those are happy indeed, who have the favour of God; and those
shall have it, who reckon that in having it they have enough, and desire
no more.

[Deuteronomy 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 33:24</span></span>

All shall be sanctified to true believers; if their way be rough, their
feet shall be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. As thy
days, so shall thy strength be. The "day" is often in Scripture put for
the events of the day; it is a promise that God would graciously and
constantly support under trials and troubles, whatever they were. It is
a promise sure to all the spiritual seed of Abraham. Have they work
allotted? They shall have strength to do it. Have they burdens
appointed? They shall have strength, and never be tempted above what
they are able to bear.

[Deuteronomy 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 33:26</span></span>

None had such a God as Israel. There is no people like the Israel of
God. What is here said of the church of Israel is to be applied to the
spiritual church. Never were people so well seated and sheltered. Those
who make God their habitation, shall have all the comforts and benefits
of a habitation in him, [Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md).
Never were people so well supported and borne up. How low soever the
people of God are at any time brought, everlasting arms are underneath
them, to keep the spirit from sinking, from fainting, and their faith
from failing. Divine grace is sufficient for them, [Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md). Never were people so well
commanded. Thus believers are more than conquerors over their spiritual
enemies, through Christ that loved them. Never were people so well
secured and protected. Israel shall dwell in safety alone. All who keep
close to God, shall be kept safe by him. Never were people so well
provided for. Every true Israelite looks with faith to the better
country, the heavenly Canaan, which is filled with better things than
corn and wine. Never were people so well helped. If in danger of any
harm, or in want of any good, they had an eternal God to go to. Nothing
could hurt those whom God helped, nor was it possible the people should
perish who were saved by the Lord. Never were people so well armed.
Those in whose hearts is the excellency of holiness, are defended by the
whole armour of God, Ephesians 6. Never were people so well assured of
victory over their enemies. Thus shall the God of peace tread Satan
under the feet of all believers, and shall do it shortly, [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md). May God help us to seek and to
set our affections on the things above; and to turn our souls from
earthly perishing objects; that we may not have our lot with Israel's
foes in the regions of darkness and despair, but with the Israel of God,
in the realms of love and eternal happiness.
