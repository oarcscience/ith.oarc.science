### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 8:0</span></span>

([Sa2 8:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001).md) David subdues the
Philistines, the Moabites, and the Syrians.

([Sa2 8:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#009).md) The spoil dedicated.

([Sa2 8:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015).md) David's government and

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 8:1</span></span>

David subdued the Philistines. They had long been troublesome to Israel.
And after the long and frequent struggles the saints have with the
powers of darkness, like Israel with the Philistines, the Son of David
shall tread them all under foot, and make the saints more than
conquerors. He smote the Moabites, and made them tributaries to Israel.
Two parts he destroyed, the third part he spared. The line that was to
keep alive, though it was but one, is ordered to be a full line. Let the
line of mercy be stretched to the utmost. He smote the Syrians. In all
these wars David was protected, for this in his psalms he often gives
glory to God.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 8:9</span></span>

All the precious things David was master of, were dedicated things; they
were designed for building the temple. The idols of gold David
destroyed, [Sa2 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#021.md), but the vessels
of gold he dedicated. Thus, in the conquest of a soul by the grace of
the Son of David, what stands in opposition to God must be destroyed,
every lust must be mortified and crucified, but what may glorify him
must be dedicated; thus the property of it is altered. God employs his
servants in various ways; some, as David, in spiritual battles; others,
as Solomon, in spiritual buildings; and one prepares work for the other,
that God may have the glory of all.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 8:15</span></span>

David neither did wrong, nor denied or delayed right to any. This speaks
his close application to business; also his readiness to admit all
addresses and appeals made to him. He had no respect of persons in
judgment. Herein he was a type of Christ. To Him let us submit, his
friendship let us seek, his service let us count our pleasure,
diligently attending to the work he assigns to each of us. David made
his sons chief rulers; but all believers, Christ's spiritual seed, are
better preferred, for they are made kings and priests to our God, [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md).
