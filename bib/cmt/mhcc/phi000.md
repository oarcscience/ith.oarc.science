The Philippians felt a very deep interest for the apostle. The scope of
the epistle is to confirm them in the faith, to encourage them to walk
as becomes the gospel of Christ, to caution them against judaizing
teachers, and to express gratitude for their Christian bounty. This
epistle is the only one, among those written by St. Paul, in which no
censures are implied or expressed. Full commendation and confidence are
in every part, and the Philippians are addressed with a peculiar
affection, which every serious reader will perceive.
