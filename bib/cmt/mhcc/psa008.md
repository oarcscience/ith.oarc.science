### [Psalms Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 8:0</span></span>

([Psa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001), [Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002)) God is to be glorified, for
making known himself to us.

([Psa 8:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003)) And for making even the
heavenly bodies useful to man, thereby placing him but little lower than
the angels.

[Psalms 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 8:1</span></span>

The psalmist seeks to give unto God the glory due to his name. How
bright this glory shines even in this lower world! He is ours, for he
made us, protects us, and takes special care of us. The birth, life,
preaching, miracles, suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension of
Jesus are known through the world. No name is so universal, no power and
influence so generally felt, as those of the Saviour of mankind. But how
much brighter it shines in the upper world! We, on this earth, only hear
God's excellent name, and praise that; the angels and blessed spirits
above, see his glory, and praise that; yet he is exalted far above even
their blessing and praise. Sometimes the grace of God appears
wonderfully in young children. Sometimes the power of God brings to pass
great things in his church, by very weak and unlikely instruments, that
the excellency of the power might the more evidently appear to be of
God, and not of man. This he does, because of his enemies, that he may
put them to silence.

[Psalms 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 8:3</span></span>

We are to consider the heavens, that man thus may be directed to set his
affections on things above. What is man, so mean a creature, that he
should be thus honoured! so sinful a creature, that he should be thus
favoured! Man has sovereign dominion over the inferior creatures, under
God, and is appointed their lord. This refers to Christ. In [Heb
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006), the apostle, to prove the
sovereign dominion of Christ, shows he is that Man, that Son of man,
here spoken of, whom God has made to have dominion over the works of his
hands. The greatest favour ever showed to the human race, and the
greatest honour ever put upon human nature, were exemplified in the Lord
Jesus. With good reason does the psalmist conclude as he began, Lord,
how excellent is thy name in all the earth, which has been honoured with
the presence of the Redeemer, and is still enlightened by his gospel,
and governed by his wisdom and power! What words can reach his praises,
who has a right to our obedience as our Redeemer?
