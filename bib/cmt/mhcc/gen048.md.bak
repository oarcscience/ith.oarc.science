### [Genesis Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 48:0</span></span>

([Gen 48:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001).md) Joseph visits his dying
father.

([Gen 48:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#008).md) Jacob blesses Joseph's
sons.

[Genesis 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 48:1</span></span>

The death-beds of believers, with the prayers and counsels of dying
persons, are suited to make serious impressions upon the young, the gay,
and the prosperous: we shall do well to take children on such occasions,
when it can be done properly. If the Lord please, it is very desirable
to bear our dying testimony to his truth, to his faithfulness, and the
pleasantness of his ways. And one would wish so to live, as to give
energy and weight to our dying exhortations. All true believers are
blessed at their death, but all do not depart equally full of spiritual
consolations. Jacob adopted Joseph's two sons. Let them not succeed
their father, in his power and grandeur in Egypt; but let them succeed
in the inheritance of the promise made to Abraham. Thus the aged dying
patriarch teaches these young persons to take their lot with the people
of God. He appoints each of them to be the head of a tribe. Those are
worthy of double honour, who, through God's grace, break through the
temptations of worldly wealth and preferment, to embrace religion in
disgrace and poverty. Jacob will have Ephraim and Manasseh to know, that
it is better to be low, and in the church, than high, and out of it.

[Genesis 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 48:8</span></span>

The two good men own God in their comforts. Joseph says, They are my
sons whom God has given me. Jacob says, God hath showed me thy seed.
Comforts are doubly sweet to us when we see them coming from God's hand.
He not only prevents our fears, but exceeds our hopes. Jacob mentions
the care the Divine providence had taken of him all his days. A great
deal of hardship he had known in his time, but God kept him from the
evil of his troubles. Now he was dying, he looked upon himself as
redeemed from all sin and sorrow for ever. Christ, the Angel of the
covenant, redeems from all evil. Deliverances from misery and dangers,
by the Divine power, coming through the ransom of the blood of Christ,
in Scripture are often called redemption. In blessing Joseph's sons,
Jacob crossed hands. Joseph was willing to support his first-born, and
would have removed his father's hands. But Jacob acted neither by
mistake, nor from a partial affection to one more than the other; but
from a spirit of prophecy, and by the Divine counsel. God, in bestowing
blessings upon his people, gives more to some than to others, more
gifts, graces, and comforts, and more of the good things of this life.
He often gives most to those that are least likely. He chooses the weak
things of the world; he raises the poor out of the dust. Grace observes
not the order of nature, nor does God prefer those whom we think fittest
to be preferred, but as it pleases him. How poor are they who have no
riches but those of this world! How miserable is a death-bed to those
who have no well-grounded hope of good, but dreadful apprehensions of
evil, and nothing but evil for ever!
