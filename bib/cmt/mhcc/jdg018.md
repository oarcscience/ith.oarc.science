### [Judges Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 18:0</span></span>

The Danites seek to enlarge their inheritance, and rob Micah.

[Judges 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 18:1</span></span>

The Danites determined to take Micah's gods with them. Oh the folly of
these Danites! How could they imagine those gods should protect them,
that could not keep themselves from being stolen! To take them for their
own use, was a double crime; it showed they neither feared God, nor
regarded man, but were lost both to godliness and honesty. What a folly
was it for Micah to call those his gods, which he had made, when He only
is to be worshipped by us as God, that made us! That is put in God's
place, which we are concerned about, as if our all were bound up in it.
If people will walk in the name of their false gods, much more should we
love and serve the true God!
