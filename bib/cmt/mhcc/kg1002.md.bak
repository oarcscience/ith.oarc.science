[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 2:1</span></span>

David's charge to Solomon is, to keep the charge of the Lord. The
authority of a dying father is much, but nothing to that of a living
God. God promised David that the Messiah should come from his
descendants, and that promise was absolute; but the promise, that there
should not fail of them a man on the throne of Israel, was conditional;
if he walks before God in sincerity, with zeal and resolution: in order
hereunto, he must take heed to his way.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 2:5</span></span>

These dying counsels concerning Joab and Shimei, did not come from
personal anger, but for the security of Solomon's throne, which was the
murders he had committed, but would readily repeat them to carry any
purpose; though long reprieved, he shall be reckoned with at last. Time
does not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly of murder.
Concerning Shimei, Hold him not guiltless; do not think him any true
friend to thee, or thy government, or fit to be trusted; he has no less
malice now than he had then. David's dying sentiments are recorded, as
delivered under the influence of the Holy Ghost, [Sa2
23:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md). The Lord discovered to him the
offices and the salvation of that glorious personage, the Messiah, whose
coming he then foretold, and from whom he derived all his comforts and
expectations. That passage gives a decided proof that David died under
the influence of the Holy Ghost, in the exercise of faith and hope.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 2:12</span></span>

Solomon received Bathsheba with all the respect that was owing to a
mother; but let none be asked for that which they ought not to grant. It
ill becomes a good man to prefer a bad request, or to appear in a bad
cause. According to eastern customs it was plain that Adonijah sought to
be king, by his asking for Abishag as his wife, and Solomon could not be
safe while he lived. Ambitious, turbulent spirits commonly prepare death
for themselves. Many a head has been lost by catching at a crown.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 2:26</span></span>

Solomon's words to Abiathar, and his silence, imply that some recent
conspiracies had been entered into. Those that show kindness to God's
people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason
Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In
case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was
a refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as the
Author of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it. The
Lord of peace himself gives us that peace which is everlasting.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 2:35</span></span>

The old malignity remains in the unconverted heart, and a watchful eye
should be kept on those who, like Shimei, have manifested their enmity,
but have given no evidence of repentance. No engagements or dangers will
restrain worldly men; they go on, though they forfeit their lives and
souls. Let us remember, God will not accommodate his judgment to us. His
eye is over us; and let us strive to walk as in his presence. Let our
every act, word, and thought, be governed by this great truth, that the
hour is quickly coming when the smallest circumstances of our lives
shall be brought to light, and our eternal state be fixed by a righteous
and unerring God. Thus Solomon's throne was established in peace, as the
type of the Redeemer's kingdom of peace and righteousness. And it is a
comfort, in reference to the enmity of the church's enemies, that, how
much soever they rage, it is a vain thing they imagine. Christ's throne
is established, and they cannot shake it.
