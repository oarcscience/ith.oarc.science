### [Ezekiel Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001.md)

The ordinances of worship for the prince and for the people, are here
described, and the gifts the prince may bestow on his sons and servants.
Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many
things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may
abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences,
or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily
worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our
souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.
