### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 31:0</span></span>

([Sa1 31:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001).md) Saul's defeat and death.

([Sa1 31:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008).md) Saul's body rescued by
the men of Jabesh-gilead.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 31:1</span></span>

We cannot judge of the spiritual or eternal state of any by the manner
of their death; for in that, there is one event to the righteous and to
the wicked. Saul, when sorely wounded, and unable to resist or to flee,
expressed no concern about his never-dying soul; but only desired that
the Philistines might not insult over him, or put him to pain, and he
became his own murderer. As it is the grand deceit of the devil, to
persuade sinners, under great difficulties, to fly to this last act of
desperation, it is well to fortify the mind against it, by a serious
consideration of its sinfulness before God, and its miserable
consequences in society. But our security is not in ourselves. Let us
seek protection from Him who keepeth Israel. Let us watch and pray; and
take unto us the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withstand
in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 31:8</span></span>

The Scripture makes no mention what became of the souls of Saul and his
sons, after they were dead; but of their bodies only: secret things
belong not to us. It is of little consequence by what means we die, or
what is done with our dead bodies. If our souls are saved, our bodies
will be raised incorruptible and glorious; but not to fear His wrath,
who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell, is the extreme of
folly and wickedness. How useless is the respect of fellow-creatures to
those who are suffering the wrath of God! While pompous funerals, grand
monuments, and he praises of men, honour the memory of the deceased, the
soul may be suffering in the regions of darkness and despair! Let us
seek that honour which cometh from God only.
