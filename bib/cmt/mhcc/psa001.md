*Complete Commentary on the Whole Bible*, by Matthew Henry, at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

([Psa 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)) The holiness and
happiness of a godly man.

([Psa 1:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004)) The sinfulness and misery
of a wicked man, The ground and reason of both.

[Psalms 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 1:1</span></span>

To meditate in God's word, is to discourse with ourselves concerning the
great things contained in it, with close application of mind and
fixedness of thought. We must have constant regard to the word of God,
as the rule of our actions, and the spring of our comforts; and have it
in our thoughts night and day. For this purpose no time is amiss.

[Psalms 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 1:4</span></span>

The ungodly are the reverse of the righteous, both in character and
condition. The ungodly are not so, [Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004); they are led by the counsel of
the wicked, in the way of sinners, to the seat of the scornful; they
have no delight in the law of God; they bring forth no fruit but what is
evil. The righteous are like useful, fruitful trees: the ungodly are
like the chaff which the wind drives away: the dust which the owner of
the floor desires to have driven away, as not being of any use. They are
of no worth in God's account, how highly soever they may value
themselves. They are easily driven to and fro by every wind of
temptation. The chaff may be, for a while, among the wheat, but He is
coming, whose fan is in his hand, and who will thoroughly purge his
floor. Those that, by their own sin and folly, make themselves as chaff,
will be found so before the whirlwind and fire of Divine wrath. The doom
of the ungodly is fixed, but whenever the sinner becomes sensible of
this guilt and misery, he may be admitted into the company of the
righteous by Christ the living way, and become in Christ a new creature.
He has new desires, new pleasures, hopes, fears, sorrows, companions,
and employments. His thoughts, words, and actions are changed. He enters
on a new state, and bears a new character. Behold, all things are become
new by Divine grace, which changes his soul into the image of the
Redeemer. How different the character and end of the ungodly!
