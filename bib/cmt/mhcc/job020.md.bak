### [Job Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 20:0</span></span>

([Job 20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#001).md) Zophar speaks of the
short joy of the wicked.

([Job 20:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#010).md) The ruin of the
wicked.

([Job 20:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023).md) The portion of the
wicked.

[Job 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 20:1</span></span>

Zophar's discourse is upon the certain misery of the wicked. The triumph
of the wicked and the joy of the hypocrite are fleeting. The pleasures
and gains of sin bring disease and pain; they end in remorse, anguish,
and ruin. Dissembled piety is double iniquity, and the ruin that attends
it will be accordingly.

[Job 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 20:10</span></span>

The miserable condition of the wicked man in this world is fully set
forth. The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth. His
hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment of his
beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in the
heart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The love of
the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man sets his
heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bring God's
judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment of the
wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than which nothing
is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will all unlawful gains
be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through the anxieties of his
own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God to restore what was
unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy. But to be forced to
restore by the horrors of a despairing conscience, as Judas was, has no
benefit and comfort attending it.

[Job 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 20:23</span></span>

Zophar, having described the vexations which attend wicked practices,
shows their ruin from God's wrath. There is no fence against this, but
in Christ, who is the only Covert from the storm and tempest, [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md). Zophar concludes, "This is the
portion of a wicked man from God;" it is allotted him. Never was any
doctrine better explained, or worse applied, than this by Zophar, who
intended to prove Job a hypocrite. Let us receive the good explanation,
and make a better application, for warning to ourselves, to stand in awe
and sin not. One view of Jesus, directed by the Holy Spirit, and by him
suitably impressed upon our souls, will quell a thousand carnal
reasonings about the suffering of the faithful.
