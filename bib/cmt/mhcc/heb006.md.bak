### [Hebrews Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">heb 6:0</span></span>

([Heb 6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001).md) The Hebrews are urged to
go forward in the doctrine of Christ, and the consequences of apostacy,
or turning back, are described.

([Heb 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009.md), [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010).md) The apostle expresses
satisfaction, as to the most of them.

([Heb 6:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011).md) And encourages them to
persevere in faith and holiness.

[Hebrews 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 6:1</span></span>

Every part of the truth and will of God should be set before all who
profess the gospel, and be urged on their hearts and consciences. We
should not be always speaking about outward things; these have their
places and use, but often take up too much attention and time, which
might be better employed. The humbled sinner who pleads guilty, and
cries for mercy, can have no ground from this passage to be discouraged,
whatever his conscience may accuse him of. Nor does it prove that any
one who is made a new creature in Christ, ever becomes a final apostate
from him. The apostle is not speaking of the falling away of mere
professors, never convinced or influenced by the gospel. Such have
nothing to fall away from, but an empty name, or hypocritical
profession. Neither is he speaking of partial declinings or
backslidings. Nor are such sins meant, as Christians fall into through
the strength of temptations, or the power of some worldly or fleshly
lust. But the falling away here mentioned, is an open and avowed
renouncing of Christ, from enmity of heart against him, his cause, and
people, by men approving in their minds the deeds of his murderers, and
all this after they have received the knowledge of the truth, and tasted
some of its comforts. Of these it is said, that it is impossible to
renew them again unto repentance. Not because the blood of Christ is not
sufficient to obtain pardon for this sin; but this sin, in its very
nature, is opposite to repentance and every thing that leads to it. If
those who through mistaken views of this passage, as well as of their
own case, fear that there is no mercy for them, would attend to the
account given of the nature of this sin, that it is a total and a
willing renouncing of Christ, and his cause, and joining with his
enemies, it would relieve them from wrong fears. We should ourselves
beware, and caution others, of every approach near to a gulf so awful as
apostacy; yet in doing this we should keep close to the word of God, and
be careful not to wound and terrify the weak, or discourage the fallen
and penitent. Believers not only taste of the word of God, but they
drink it in. And this fruitful field or garden receives the blessing.
But the merely nominal Christian, continuing unfruitful under the means
of grace, or producing nothing but deceit and selfishness, was near the
awful state above described; and everlasting misery was the end reserved
for him. Let us watch with humble caution and prayer as to ourselves.

[Hebrews 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 6:9</span></span>

There are things that are never separated from salvation; things that
show the person to be in a state of salvation, and which will end in
eternal salvation. And the things that accompany salvation, are better
things than ever any dissembler or apostate enjoyed. The works of love,
done for the glory of Christ, or done to his saints for Christ's sake,
from time to time, as God gives occasion, are evident marks of a man's
salvation; and more sure tokens of saving grace given, than the
enlightenings and tastings spoken of before. No love is to be reckoned
as love, but working love; and no works are right works, which flow not
from love to Christ.

[Hebrews 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 6:11</span></span>

The hope here meant, is a sure looking for good things promised, through
those promises, with love, desire, and valuing of them. Hope has its
degrees, as faith also. The promise of blessedness God has made to
believers, is from God's eternal purpose, settled between the eternal
Father, Son, and Spirit. These promises of God may safely be depended
upon; for here we have two things which cannot change, the counsel and
the oath of God, in which it is not possible for God to lie; it would be
contrary to his nature as well as to his will. And as He cannot lie; the
destruction of the unbeliever, and the salvation of the believer, are
alike certain. Here observe, those to whom God has given full security
of happiness, have a title to the promises by inheritance. The
consolations of God are strong enough to support his people under their
heaviest trials. Here is a refuge for all sinners who flee to the mercy
of God, through the redemption of Christ, according to the covenant of
grace, laying aside all other confidences. We are in this world as a
ship at sea, tossed up and down, and in danger of being cast away. We
need an anchor to keep us sure and steady. Gospel hope is our anchor in
the storms of this world. It is sure and stedfast, or it could not keep
us so. The free grace of God, the merits and mediation of Christ, and
the powerful influences of his Spirit, are the grounds of this hope, and
so it is a stedfast hope. Christ is the object and ground of the
believer's hope. Let us therefore set our affections on things above,
and wait patiently for his appearance, when we shall certainly appear
with him in glory.
