[Leviticus 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 27:1</span></span>

Zeal for the service of God disposed the Israelites, on some occasions,
to dedicate themselves or their children to the service of the Lord, in
his house for life. Some persons who thus dedicated themselves might be
employed as assistants; in general they were to be redeemed for a value.
It is good to be zealously affected and liberally disposed for the
Lord's service; but the matter should be well weighed, and prudence
should direct as to what we do; else rash vows and hesitation in doing
them will dishonour God, and trouble our own minds.

[Leviticus 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 27:14</span></span>

Our houses, lands, cattle, and all our substance, must be used to the
glory of God. It is acceptable to him that a portion be given to support
his worship, and to promote his cause. But God would not approve such a
degree of zeal as ruined a man's family.

[Leviticus 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 27:26</span></span>

Things or persons devoted, are distinguished from things or persons that
were only sanctified. Devoted things were most holy to the Lord, and
could neither be taken back nor applied to other purposes. Whatever
productions they had the benefit, God must be honoured with the tenth
of, if it could be applied. Thus they acknowledge God to be the Owner of
their land, the Giver of its fruits, and themselves to be his tenants,
and dependants upon him. Thus they gave him thanks for the plenty they
enjoyed, and besought his favour in the continuance of it. We are taught
to honour the Lord with our substance.

[Leviticus 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 27:34</span></span>

The last verse seems to have reference to this whole book. Many of the
precepts in it are moral, and always binding; others are ceremonial, and
peculiar to the Jewish nation; yet they have a spiritual meaning, and so
teach us; for unto us, by these institutions, is the gospel preached, as
well as unto them, [Heb 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002.md). The
doctrine of reconciliation to God by a Mediator, is not clouded with the
smoke of burning sacrifice, but cleared by the knowledge of Christ and
him crucified. We are under the sweet and easy institutions of the
gospel, which pronounces those true worshippers, who worship the Father
in spirit and truth, by Christ only, and in his name. Yet, let us not
think, because we are not tied to the ceremonial rites and oblations,
that a little care, time, and expense, will serve to honour God with.
Having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, let us
draw near with a true heart, and in full assurance of faith, worshipping
God with the more cheerfulness and humble confidence, still saying,
BLESSED BE GOD FOR JESUS CHRIST.
