### [2 Chronicles Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 9:0</span></span>

([Ch2 9:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001).md) The queen of Sheba.

(v. 13-31) Solomon's riches, and his death.

[2 Chronicles 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 9:1</span></span>

This history has been considered, 1 Kings 10; yet because our Saviour
has proposed it as an example in seeking after him, [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042.md), we must not pass it over
without observing, that those who know the worth of true wisdom will
grudge no pains or cost to obtain it. The queen of Sheba put herself to
a great deal of trouble and expense to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
yet, learning from him to serve God, and do her duty, she thought
herself well paid for her pains. Heavenly wisdom is that pearl of great
price, for which, if we part with all, we make a good bargain.

[2 Chronicles 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 9:13</span></span>

The imports here mentioned, would show that prosperity drew the minds of
Solomon and his subjects to the love of things curious and uncommon,
though useless in themselves. True wisdom and happiness are always
united together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and the
enjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselves
with the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomon
reigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of which
could never since be found; for the most known of the great princes of
the earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned forty years
in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would give him
riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. The lustre
wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of the kingdom
of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne, which is
above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all his wealth
and power to one who he knew would be a fool! [Ecc
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md), [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md). This was not only vanity, but
vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, nor wisdom, can ward off or
prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks be to God who giveth the
victory to the true believer, even over this dreaded enemy, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.
