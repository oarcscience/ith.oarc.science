### [Exodus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 11:0</span></span>

([Exo 11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001).md) God's last instructions
to Moses respecting Pharaoh and the Egyptians.

([Exo 11:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004).md) The death of the
first-born threatened.

[Exodus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 11:1</span></span>

A secret revelation was made to Moses while in the presence of Pharaoh,
that he might give warning of the last dreadful judgment, before he went
out. This was the last day of the servitude of Israel; they were about
to go away. Their masters, who had abused them in their work, would have
sent them away empty; but God provided that the labourers should not
lose their hire, and ordered them to demand it now, at their departure,
and it was given to them. God will right the injured, who in humble
silence commit their cause to him; and none are losers at last by
patient suffering. The Lord gave them favour in the sight of the
Egyptians, by making it appear how much he favoured them. He also
changed the spirit of the Egyptians toward them, and made them to be
pitied of their oppressors. Those that honour God, he will honour.

[Exodus 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 11:4</span></span>

The death of all the first-born in Egypt at once: this plague had been
the first threatened, but is last executed. See how slow God is to
wrath. The plague is foretold, the time is fixed; all their first-born
should sleep the sleep of death, not silently, but so as to rouse the
families at midnight. The prince was not too high to be reached by it,
nor the slaves at the mill too low to be noticed. While angels slew the
Egyptians, not so much as a dog should bark at any of the children of
Israel. It is an earnest of the difference there shall be in the great
day, between God's people and his enemies. Did men know what a
difference God puts, and will put to eternity, between those that serve
him and those that serve him not, religion would not seem to them an
indifferent thing; nor would they act in it with so much carelessness as
they do. When Moses had thus delivered his message, he went out from
Pharaoh in great anger at his obstinacy; though he was the meekest of
the men of the earth. The Scripture has foretold the unbelief of many
who hear the gospel, that it might not be a surprise or stumbling-block
to us, [Rom 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016.md). Let us never think
the worse of the gospel of Christ for the slights men put upon it.
Pharaoh was hardened, yet he was compelled to abate his stern and
haughty demands, till the Israelites got full freedom. In like manner
the people of God will find that every struggle against their spiritual
adversary, made in the might of Jesus Christ, every attempt to overcome
him by the blood of the Lamb, and every desire to attain increasing
likeness and love to that Lamb, will be rewarded by increasing freedom
from the enemy of souls.
