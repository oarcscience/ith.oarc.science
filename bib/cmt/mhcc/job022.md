### [Job Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#001)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 22:0</span></span>

([Job 22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#001)) Eliphaz shows that a
man's goodness profits not God.

([Job 22:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#005)) Job accused of
oppression.

([Job 22:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#015)) The world before the
flood.

([Job 22:21-30](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021)) Eliphaz exhorts Job to
repentance.

[Job 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 22:1</span></span>

Eliphaz considers that, because Job complained so much of his
afflictions, he thought God was unjust in afflicting him; but Job was
far from thinking so. What Eliphaz says, is unjustly applied to Job, but
it is very true, that when God does us good it is not because he is
indebted to us. Man's piety is no profit to God, no gain. The gains of
religion to men are infinitely greater than the losses of it. God is a
Sovereign, who gives no account of his conduct; but he is perfectly
wise, just, faithful, good, and merciful. He approves the likeness of
his own holiness, and delights in the fruits of his Spirit; he accepts
the thankful services of the humble believer, while he rejects the proud
claim of the self-confident.

[Job 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 22:5</span></span>

Eliphaz brought heavy charges against Job, without reason for his
accusations, except that Job was visited as he supposed God always
visited every wicked man. He charges him with oppression, and that he
did harm with his wealth and power in the time of his prosperity.

[Job 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 22:15</span></span>

Eliphaz would have Job mark the old way that wicked men have trodden,
and see what the end of their way was. It is good for us to mark it,
that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we are
not, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does
here, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.

[Job 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 22:21</span></span>

The answer of Eliphaz wrongly implied that Job had hitherto not known
God, and that prosperity in this life would follow his sincere
conversion. The counsel Eliphaz here gives is good, though, as to Job,
it was built upon a false supposition that he was a stranger and enemy
to God. Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot
to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how
Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient. Let us examine whether there
may not be some colour for the slander, and walk watchfully, so as to be
clear of all appearances of evil.
