### [Revelation Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md)

[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 21:0</span></span>

([Rev 21:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001).md) A new heaven, and new
earth: the new Jerusalem where God dwells, and banishes all sorrow from
his people.

([Rev 21:9-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009).md) Its heavenly origin,
glory, and secure defence.

([Rev 21:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022).md) Its perfect happiness,
as enlightened with the presence of God and the Lamb, and in the free
access of multitudes, made holy.

[Revelation 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 21:1</span></span>

The new heaven and the new earth will not be separate from each other;
the earth of the saints, their glorified, bodies, will be heavenly. The
old world, with all its troubles and tumults, will have passed away.
There will be no sea; this aptly represents freedom from conflicting
passions, temptations, troubles, changes, and alarms; from whatever can
divide or interrupt the communion of saints. This new Jerusalem is the
church of God in its new and perfect state, the church triumphant. Its
blessedness came wholly from God, and depends on him. The presence of
God with his people in heaven, will not be interrupt as it is on earth,
he will dwell with them continually. All effects of former trouble shall
be done away. They have often been in tears, by reason of sin, of
affliction, of the calamities of the church; but no signs, no
remembrance of former sorrows shall remain. Christ makes all things new.
If we are willing and desirous that the gracious Redeemer should make
all things new in order hearts and nature, he will make all things new
in respect of our situation, till he has brought us to enjoy complete
happiness. See the certainty of the promise. God gives his titles, Alpha
and Omega, the Beginning and the End, as a pledge for the full
performance. Sensual and sinful pleasures are muddy and poisoned waters;
and the best earthly comforts are like the scanty supplies of a cistern;
when idolized, they become broken cisterns, and yield only vexation. But
the joys which Christ imparts are like waters springing from a fountain,
pure, refreshing, abundant, and eternal. The sanctifying consolations of
the Holy Spirit prepare for heavenly happiness; they are streams which
flow for us in the wilderness. The fearful durst not meet the
difficulties of religion, their slavish fear came from their unbelief;
but those who were so dastardly as not to dare to take up the cross of
Christ, were yet so desperate as to run into abominable wickedness. The
agonies and terrors of the first death will lead to the far greater
terrors and agonies of eternal death.

[Revelation 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 21:9</span></span>

God has various employments for his holy angels. Sometimes they sound
the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes
they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation.
Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven
as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the
vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in
its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the
happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity
to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are
only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for
security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and
secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for
all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power
of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the
safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by
twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of
the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the
personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there
is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find
themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl
of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was
pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under
foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and
idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another.
All these glories but faintly represent heaven.

[Revelation 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rev 21:22</span></span>

Perfect and direct communion with God, will more than supply the place
of gospel institutions. And what words can more full express the union
and co-equality of the Son with the Father, in the Godhead? What a
dismal world would this be, if it were not for the light of the sun!
What is there in heaven that supplies its place? The glory of God
lightens that city, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. God in Christ
will be an everlasting Fountain of knowledge and joy to the saints in
heaven. There is no night, therefore no need of shutting the gates; all
is at peace and secure. The whole shows us that we should be more and
more led to think of heaven as filled with the glory of God, and
enlightened by the presence of the Lord Jesus. Nothing sinful or
unclean, idolatrous, or false and deceitful, can enter. All the
inhabitants are made perfect in holiness. Now the saints feel a sad
mixture of corruption, which hinders them in the service of God, and
interrupts their communion with him; but, at their entrance into the
holy of holies, they are washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and
presented to the Father without spot. None are admitted into heaven who
work abominations. It is free from hypocrites, such as make lies. As
nothing unclean can enter heaven, let us be stirred up by these glimpses
of heavenly things, to use all diligence, and to perfect holiness in the
fear of God.
