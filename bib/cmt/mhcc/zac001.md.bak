### [Zechariah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

([Zac 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001).md) An exhortation to
repentance.

([Zac 1:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007).md) A vision of the ministry
of angels.

([Zac 1:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018).md) The security of the
Jews and the destruction of their enemies.

[Zechariah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 1:1</span></span>

God's almighty power and sovereign dominion, should engage and encourage
sinners to repent and turn to Him. It is very desirable to have the Lord
of hosts for our friend, and very dreadful to have him for our enemy.
Review what is past, and observe the message God sent by his servants,
the prophets, to your fathers. Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from
your evil doings. Be persuaded to leave your sins, as the only way to
prevent approaching ruin. What is become of our fathers, and of the
prophets that preached to them? They are all dead and gone. Here they
were, in the towns and countries where we live, passing and repassing in
the same streets, dwelling in the same houses, trading in the same shops
and exchanges, worshipping God in the same places. But where are they?
When they died, there was not an end of them; they are in eternity, in
the world of spirits, the unchangeable world to which we hasten apace.
Where are they? Those of them who lived and died in sin, are in torment.
Those who lived and died in Christ, are in heaven; and if we live and
die as they did, we shall be with them shortly and eternally. If they
minded not their own souls, is that a reason why their posterity should
ruin theirs also? The prophets are gone. Christ is a Prophet that lives
for ever, but all other prophets have a period put to their office. Oh
that this consideration had its due weight; that dying ministers are
dealing with dying people about their never-dying souls, and an awful
eternity, upon the brink of which both are standing! In another world,
both we and our prophets shall live for ever: to prepare for that world
ought to be our great care in this. The preachers died, and the hearers
died, but the word of God died not; not one jot or title of it fell to
the ground; for he is righteous.

[Zechariah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 1:7</span></span>

The prophet saw a dark, shady grove, hidden by hills. This represented
the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior
sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the
church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to
appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be
employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in
mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners,
but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to
learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that
time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the
pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ.
His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel,
this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All
the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus
Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of
his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The
earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of
God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction,
harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under
oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to
the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were
shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of
the New Testament Babylon is ended.

[Zechariah 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zac 1:18</span></span>

The enemies of the church threaten to cut off the name of Israel. They
are horns, emblems of power, strength, and violence. The prophet saw
them so formidable that he began to despair of the safety of every good
man, and the success of every good work; but the Lord showed him four
workmen empowered to cut off these horns. With an eye of sense we see
the power of the enemies of the church; look which way we will, the
world shows us that; but it is only with an eye of faith that we see it
safe. The Lord shows us that. When God has work to do, he will raise up
some to do it, and others to defend it, and to protect those employed in
doing it. What cause there is to look up in love and praise to the holy
and eternal Spirit, who has the same care over the present and eternal
interests of believers, by the holy word bringing the church to know the
wonderful things of salvation!
