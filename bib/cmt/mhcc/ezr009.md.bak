### [Ezra Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 9:0</span></span>

([Ezr 9:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001).md) Ezra mourns for the Jews'

[Ezra 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md)

Many corruptions lurk out of the view of the most careful rulers. Some
of the people disobeyed the express command of God, which forbade all
marriages with the heathen, Deuteronomy 7. Disbelief of God's
all-sufficiency, is at the bottom of the sorry shifts we make to help
ourselves. They exposed themselves and their children to the peril of
idolatry, that had ruined their church and nation. Carnal professors may
make light of such connexions, and try to explain away the exhortations
to be separate; but those who are best acquainted with the word of God,
will treat the subject in another manner. They must forebode the worst
from such unions. The evils excused, and even pleaded for; by many
professors, astonish and cause regret in the true believer. All who
profess to be God's people, ought to strengthen those that appear and
act against vice and profaneness.

[Ezra 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 9:5</span></span>

The sacrifice, especially the evening sacrifice, was a type of the
blessed Lamb of God, who in the evening of the world, was to take away
sin by the sacrifice of himself. Ezra's address is a penitent confession
of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfort of true
penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God's mercy is
in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one much ashamed. Holy
shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow. Ezra speaks as
much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement; the more we think
of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful to me sinner. Ezra
speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer or saddler presage of
ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments, and great
deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonder that he has
not wearied out the Lord's patience, and brought destruction upon
himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly? But though the true
penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf, the heavenly Advocate
pleads most powerfully for him.
