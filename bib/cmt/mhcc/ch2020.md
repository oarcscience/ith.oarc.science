[2 Chronicles 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 20:1</span></span>

In all dangers, public or personal, our first business should be to seek
help from God. Hence the advantage of days for national fasting and
prayer. From the first to the last of our seeking the Lord, we must
approach him with humiliation for our sins, trusting only in his mercy
and power. Jehoshaphat acknowledges the sovereign dominion of the Divine
Providence. Lord, exert it on our behalf. Whom should we seek to, whom
should we trust to for relief, but the God we have chosen and served.
Those that use what they have for God, may comfortably hope he will
secure it to them. Every true believer is a son of Abraham, a friend of
God; with such the everlasting covenant is established, to such every
promise belongs. We are assured of God's love, by his dwelling in human
nature in the person of the Saviour. Jehoshaphat mentions the temple, as
a token of God's favourable presence. He pleads the injustice of his
enemies. We may well appeal to God against those that render us evil for
good. Though he had a great army, he said, We have no might without
thee; we rely upon thee.

[2 Chronicles 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 20:14</span></span>

The Spirit of prophecy came upon a Levite in the midst of the
congregation. The Spirit, like the wind, blows where and on whom He
listeth. He encouraged them to trust in God. Let the Christian soldier
go out against his spiritual enemies, and the God of peace will make him
more than a conqueror. Our trials will prove our gain. The advantage
will be all our own, but the whole glory must be given to God.

[2 Chronicles 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 20:20</span></span>

Jehoshaphat exhorted his troops to firm faith in God. Faith inspires a
man with true courage; nor will any thing help more to the establishing
of the heart in shaking times, than a firm belief of the power, and
mercy, and promise of God. In all our trust in the Lord, and our praises
of him, let us especially look at his everlasting mercy to sinners
through Jesus Christ. Never was an army so destroyed as that of the
enemy. Thus God often makes wicked people destroy one another. And never
was a victory celebrated with more solemn thanksgivings.

[2 Chronicles 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch2 20:31</span></span>

Jehoshaphat kept close to the worship of God, and did what he could to
keep his people close to it. But after God had done such great things
for him, given him not only victory, but wealth; after this, to go and
join himself with a wicked king, was very ungrateful. What could he
expect but that God would be angry with him? Yet it seems, he took the
warning; for when Ahaziah afterward pressed him to join him, he would
not, [Kg1 22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049.md). Thus the alliance was
broken, and the Divine rebuke had its effect, at least for a season. Let
us be thankful for any losses which may have prevented the loss of our
immortal souls. Let us praise the Lord, who sought after us, and left us
not to perish in our sins.
