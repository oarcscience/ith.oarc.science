### [Matthew Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 12:0</span></span>

[Matthew 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 12:1</span></span>

Being in the corn-fields, the disciples began to pluck the ears of corn:
the law of God allowed it, [Deu 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025.md).
This was slender provision for Christ and his disciples; but they were
content with it. The Pharisees did not quarrel with them for taking
another man's corn, but for doing it on the sabbath day. Christ came to
free his followers, not only from the corruptions of the Pharisees, but
from their unscriptural rules, and justified what they did. The greatest
shall not have their lusts indulged, but the meanest shall have their
wants considered. Those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are
necessary, and sabbath rest is to froward, not to hinder sabbath
worship. Needful provision for health and food is to be made; but when
servants are kept at home, and families become a scene of hurry and
confusion on the Lord's day, to furnish a feast for visitors, or for
indulgence, the case is very different. Such things as these, and many
others common among professors, are to be blamed. The resting on the
sabbath was ordained for man's good, [Deu
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#014.md). No law must be understood so as
to contradict its own end. And as Christ is the Lord of the sabbath, it
is fit the day and the work of it should be dedicated to him.

[Matthew 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 12:9</span></span>

Christ shows that works of mercy are lawful and proper to be done on the
Lord's day. There are more ways of doing well upon sabbath days, than by
the duties of worship: attending the sick, relieving the poor, helping
those who need speedy relief, teaching the young to care for their
souls; these are doing good: and these must be done from love and
charity, with humility and self-denial, and shall be accepted, [Gen
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007.md). This, like other cures which
Christ wrought, had a spiritual meaning. By nature our hands are
withered, and we are unable of ourselves to do any thing that is good.
Christ only, by the power of his grace, cures us; he heals the withered
hand by putting life into the dead soul, works in us both to will and to
do: for, with the command, there is a promise of grace given by the
word.

[Matthew 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 12:14</span></span>

The Pharisees took counsel to find some accusation, that Jesus might be
condemned to death. Aware of their design, as his time was not come, he
retired from that place. Face does not more exactly answer to face in
water, than the character of Christ drawn by the prophet, to his temper
and conduct as described by the evangelists. Let us with cheerful
confidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far from
breaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching the
smoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into a
flame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receive
one another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the gracious
kindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us,
and make us able to copy his example.

[Matthew 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 12:22</span></span>

A soul under Satan's power, and led captive by him, is blind in the
things of God, and dumb at the throne of grace; sees nothing, and says
nothing to the purpose. Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals up
the lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the more
desirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satan
aided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was divided
against itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesus
cast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove that
their children cast them out by any other power. There are two great
interests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by the
Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith and
obedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid or
rejoice in such a change are against Christ.

[Matthew 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 12:31</span></span>

Here is a gracious assurance of the pardon of all sin upon gospel terms.
Christ herein has set an example to the sons of men, to be ready to
forgive words spoken against them. But humble and conscientious
believers, at times are tempted to think they have committed the
unpardonable sin, while those who have come the nearest to it, seldom
have any fear about it. We may be sure that those who indeed repent and
believe the gospel, have not committed this sin, or any other of the
same kind; for repentance and faith are the special gifts of God, which
he would not bestow on any man, if he were determined never to pardon
him; and those who fear they have committed this sin, give a good sign
that they have not. The trembling, contrite sinner, has the witness in
himself that this is not his case.

[Matthew 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 12:33</span></span>

Men's language discovers what country they are of, likewise what manner
of spirit they are of. The heart is the fountain, words are the streams.
A troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring, must send forth muddy and
unpleasant streams. Nothing but the salt of grace, cast into the spring,
will heal the waters, season the speech, and purify the corrupt
communication. An evil man has an evil treasure in his heart, and out of
it brings forth evil things. Lusts and corruptions, dwelling and
reigning in the heart, are an evil treasure, out of which the sinner
brings forth bad words and actions, to dishonour God, and hurt others.
Let us keep constant watch over ourselves, that we may speak words
agreeable to the Christian character.

[Matthew 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 12:38</span></span>

Though Christ is always ready to hear and answer holy desires and
prayers, yet those who ask amiss, ask and have not. Signs were granted
to those who desired them to confirm their faith, as Abraham and Gideon;
but denied to those who demanded them to excuse their unbelief. The
resurrection of Christ from the dead by his own power, called here the
sign of the prophet Jonah, was the great proof of Christ's being the
Messiah. As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale, and then
came out again alive, thus Christ would be so long in the grave, and
then rise again. The Ninevites would shame the Jews for not repenting;
the queen of Sheba, for not believing in Christ. And we have no such
cares to hinder us, we come not to Christ upon such uncertainties. This
parable represents the case of the Jewish church and nation. It is also
applicable to all those who hear the word of God, and are in part
reformed, but not truly converted. The unclean spirit leaves for a time,
but when he returns, he finds Christ is not there to shut him out; the
heart is swept by outward reformation, but garnished by preparation to
comply with evil suggestions, and the man becomes a more decided enemy
of the truth. Every heart is the residence of unclean spirits, except
those which are temples of the Holy Ghost, by faith in Christ.

[Matthew 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 12:46</span></span>

Christ's preaching was plain, easy, and familiar, and suited to his
hearers. His mother and brethren stood without, desiring to speak with
him, when they should have been standing within, desiring to hear him.
Frequently, those who are nearest to the means of knowledge and grace
are most negligent. We are apt to neglect that which we think we may
have any day, forgetting that to-morrow is not ours. We often meet with
hinderances in our work from friends about us, and are taken off by care
for the things of this life, from the concerns of our souls. Christ was
so intent on his work, that no natural or other duty took him from it.
Not that, under pretence of religion, we may be disrespectful to
parents, or unkind to relations; but the lesser duty must stand by,
while the greater is done. Let us cease from men, and cleave to Christ;
let us look upon every Christian, in whatever condition of life, as the
brother, sister, or mother of the Lord of glory; let us love, respect,
and be kind to them, for his sake, and after his example.
