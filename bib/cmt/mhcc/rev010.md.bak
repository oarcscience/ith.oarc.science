### [Revelation Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md)

[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 10:0</span></span>

([Rev 10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001).md) The Angel of the
covenant presents a little open book, which is followed with seven
thunders.

([Rev 10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005).md) At the end of the
following prophecies, time should be no more.

([Rev 10:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008).md) A voice directs the
apostle to eat the book.

([Rev 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011).md) And tells him he must
prophesy further.

[Revelation 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md)

The apostle saw another representation. The person communicating this
discovery probably was our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, or it was to
show his glory. He veils his glory, which is too great for mortal eyes
to behold; and throws a veil upon his dispensations. A rainbow was upon
his head; our Lord is always mindful of his covenant. His awful voice
was echoed by seven thunders; solemn and terrible ways of discovering
the mind of God. We know not the subjects of the seven thunders, nor the
reasons for suppressing them. There are great events in history, perhaps
relating to the Christian church, which are not noticed in open
prophecy. The final salvation of the righteous, and the final success of
true religion on earth, are engaged for by the unfailing word of the
Lord. Though the time may not be yet, it cannot be far distant. Very
soon, as to us, time will be no more; but if we are believers, a happy
eternity will follow: we shall from heaven behold and rejoice in the
triumphs of Christ, and his cause on earth.

[Revelation 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 10:8</span></span>

Most men feel pleasure in looking into future events, and all good men
like to receive a word from God. But when this book of prophecy was
thoroughly digested by the apostle, the contents would be bitter; there
were things so awful and terrible, such grievous persecutions of the
people of God, such desolations in the earth, that the foresight and
foreknowledge of them would be painful to his mind. Let us seek to be
taught by Christ, and to obey his orders; daily meditating on his word,
that it may nourish our souls; and then declaring it according to our
several stations. The sweetness of such contemplations will often be
mingled with bitterness, while we compare the Scriptures with the state
of the world and the church, or even with that of our own hearts.
