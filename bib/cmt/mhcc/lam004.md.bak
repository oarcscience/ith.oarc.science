### [Lamentations Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)

[Lamentations](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lam 4:0</span></span>

The deplorable state of the nation is contrasted with its ancient
prosperity.

[Lamentations 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 4:1</span></span>

What a change is here! Sin tarnishes the beauty of the most exalted
powers and the most excellent gifts; but that gold, tried in the fire,
which Christ bestows, never will be taken from us; its outward
appearance may be dimmed, but its real value can never be changed. The
horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem are again described.
Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us
seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the
church now. But, Lord, though we have gone from thee in rebellion, yet
turn to us, and turn our hearts to thee, that we may fear thy name. Come
to us, bless us with awakening, converting, renewing, confirming grace.

[Lamentations 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 4:13</span></span>

Nothing ripens a people more for ruin, nor fills the measure faster,
than the sins of priests and prophets. The king himself cannot escape,
for Divine vengeance pursues him. Our anointed King alone is the life of
our souls; we may safely live under his shadow, and rejoice in Him in
the midst of our enemies, for He is the true God and eternal life.

[Lamentations 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 4:21</span></span>

Here it is foretold that an end should be put to Zion's troubles. Not
the fulness of punishment deserved, but of what God has determined to
inflict. An end shall be put to Edom's triumphs. All the troubles of the
church and of the believer will soon be accomplished. And the doom of
their enemies approaches. The Lord will bring their sins to light, and
they shall lie down in eternal sorrow. Edom here represents all the
enemies of the church. And the corruption, and sin of Israel, which the
prophet has proved to be universal, justifies the judgments of the Lord.
It shows the need of that grace in Christ Jesus, which the sin and
corruption of all mankind make so necessary.
