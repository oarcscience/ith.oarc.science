### [Psalms Chapter 125](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 125:0</span></span>

([Psa 125:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001).md) The security of the
righteous.

([Psa 125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004.md), [Psa
125:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#005).md) Prayer for them, The ruin of
the wicked.

[Psalms 125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 125:1</span></span>

All those minds shall be truly stayed, that are stayed on God. They
shall be as Mount Zion, firm as it is; a mountain supported by
providence, much more as a holy mountain supported by promise. They
cannot be removed from confidence in God. They abide for ever in that
grace which is the earnest of their everlasting continuance in glory.
Committing themselves to God, they shall be safe from their enemies.
Even mountains may moulder and come to nothing, and rocks be removed,
but God's covenant with his people cannot be broken, nor his care of
them cease. Their troubles shall last no longer than their strength will
bear them up under them. The rod of the wicked may come, may fall upon
the righteous, upon their persons, their estates, their liberties, their
families names, on any thing that falls to their lot; only it cannot
reach their souls. And though it may come upon their lot, it shall not
rest thereon. The Lord will make all work together for their good. The
wicked shall only prove a correcting rod, not a destroying sword; even
this rod shall not remain upon them, lest they distrust the promise,
thinking God has cast them off.

[Psalms 125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 125:4</span></span>

God's promises should quicken our prayers. The way of holiness is
straight; there are no windings or shiftings in it. But the ways of
sinners are crooked. They shift from one purpose to another, and turn
hither and thither to deceive; but disappointment and misery shall
befall them. Those who cleave to the ways of God, though they may have
trouble in their way, their end shall be peace. The pleading of their
Saviour for them, secures to them the upholding power and preserving
grace of their God. Lord, number us with them, in time, and to eternity.
