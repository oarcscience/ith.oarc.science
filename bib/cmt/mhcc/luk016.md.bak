### [Luke Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 16:0</span></span>

([Luk 16:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001).md) The parable of the
unjust steward.

([Luk 16:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#013).md) Christ reproves the
hypocrisy of the covetous Pharisees.

([Luk 16:19-31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019).md) The rich man and
Lazarus.

[Luke 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 16:1</span></span>

Whatever we have, the property of it is God's; we have only the use of
it, according to the direction of our great Lord, and for his honour.
This steward wasted his lord's goods. And we are all liable to the same
charge; we have not made due improvement of what God has trusted us
with. The steward cannot deny it; he must make up his accounts, and be
gone. This may teach us that death will come, and deprive us of the
opportunities we now have. The steward will make friends of his lord's
debtors or tenants, by striking off a considerable part of their debt to
his lord. The lord referred to in this parable commended not the fraud,
but the policy of the steward. In that respect alone is it so noticed.
Worldly men, in the choice of their object, are foolish; but in their
activity, and perseverance, they are often wiser than believers. The
unjust steward is not set before us as an example in cheating his
master, or to justify any dishonesty, but to point out the careful ways
of worldly men. It would be well if the children of light would learn
wisdom from the men of the world, and would as earnestly pursue their
better object. The true riches signify spiritual blessings; and if a man
spends upon himself, or hoards up what God has trusted to him, as to
outward things, what evidence can he have, that he is an heir of God
through Christ? The riches of this world are deceitful and uncertain.
Let us be convinced that those are truly rich, and very rich, who are
rich in faith, and rich toward God, rich in Christ, in the promises; let
us then lay up our treasure in heaven, and expect our portion from
thence.

[Luke 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 16:13</span></span>

To this parable our Lord added a solemn warning. Ye cannot serve God and
the world, so divided are the two interests. When our Lord spoke thus,
the covetous Pharisees treated his instructions with contempt. But he
warned them, that what they contended for as the law, was a wresting of
its meaning: this our Lord showed in a case respecting divorce. There
are many covetous sticklers for the forms of godliness, who are the
bitterest enemies to its power, and try to set others against the truth.

[Luke 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 16:19</span></span>

Here the spiritual things are represented, in a description of the
different state of good and bad, in this world and in the other. We are
not told that the rich man got his estate by fraud, or oppression; but
Christ shows, that a man may have a great deal of the wealth, pomp, and
pleasure of this world, yet perish for ever under God's wrath and curse.
The sin of this rich man was his providing for himself only. Here is a
godly man, and one that will hereafter be happy for ever, in the depth
of adversity and distress. It is often the lot of some of the dearest of
God's saints and servants to be greatly afflicted in this world. We are
not told that the rich man did him any harm, but we do not find that he
had any care for him. Here is the different condition of this godly poor
man, and this wicked rich man, at and after death. The rich man in hell
lifted up his eyes, being in torment. It is not probable that there are
discourses between glorified saints and damned sinners, but this
dialogue shows the hopeless misery and fruitless desires, to which
condemned spirits are brought. There is a day coming, when those who now
hate and despise the people of God, would gladly receive kindness from
them. But the damned in hell shall not have the least abatement of their
torment. Sinners are now called upon to remember; but they do not, they
will not, they find ways to avoid it. As wicked people have good things
only in this life, and at death are for ever separated from all good, so
godly people have evil things only in this life, and at death they are
for ever put from them. In this world, blessed be God, there is no gulf
between a state of nature and grace, we may pass from sin to God; but if
we die in our sins, there is no coming out. The rich man had five
brethren, and would have them stopped in their sinful course; their
coming to that place of torment, would make his misery the worse, who
had helped to show them the way thither. How many would now desire to
recall or to undo what they have written or done! Those who would make
the rich man's praying to Abraham justify praying to saints departed, go
far to seek for proofs, when the mistake of a damned sinner is all they
can find for an example. And surely there is no encouragement to follow
the example, when all his prayers were made in vain. A messenger from
the dead could say no more than what is said in the Scriptures. The same
strength of corruption that breaks through the convictions of the
written word, would triumph over a witness from the dead. Let us seek to
the law and to the testimony, [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md), [Isa
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md), for that is the sure word of
prophecy, upon which we may rest, [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md). Circumstances in every age show
that no terrors, or arguments, can give true repentance without the
special grace of God renewing the sinner's heart.
