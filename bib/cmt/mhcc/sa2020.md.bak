### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 20:0</span></span>

([Sa2 20:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001).md) Sheba's rebellion.

([Sa2 20:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004).md) Amasa slain by Joab.

([Sa2 20:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#014).md) Sheba takes refuge in
Abel.

([Sa2 20:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023).md) David's officers.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 20:1</span></span>

One trial arises after another for our good, till we reach the place
where sin and sorrow are for ever done away. Angry disputers
misunderstand or misconstrue one another's words; proud men will have
every thing their own way, or wholly refuse their assistance. The favour
of the many is not to be depended upon; and what have others to expect,
when Hosanna to the Son of David was soon changed to Crucify him,
crucify him?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 20:4</span></span>

Joab barbarously murdered Amasa. The more plot there is in a sin, the
worse it is. Joab contentedly sacrificed the interest both of the king
and the kingdom to his personal revenge. But one would wonder with what
face a murderer could pursue a traitor; and how, under such a load of
guilt, he had courage to enter upon danger: his conscience was seared.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 20:14</span></span>

Justly is that place attacked, which dares to harbour a traitor; nor
will the heart fare better which indulges rebellious lusts, that will
not have Christ to reign over them. A discreet woman, by her prudent
management, satisfied Joab, and yet saved the city. Wisdom is not
confined to rank or sex; it consists not in deep knowledge; but in
understanding how to act as matters arise, that troubles may be turned
away and benefits secured. A great deal of mischief would be prevented,
if contending parties would understand one another. Let both sides be
undeceived. The single condition of peace is, the surrender of the
traitor. It is so in God's dealing with the soul, when besieged by
conviction and distress; sin is the traitor; the beloved lust is the
rebel: part with that, cast away the transgression, and all shall be
well. There is no peace on any other terms.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 20:23</span></span>

Here is the state of David's court, after his restoration. It is well
when able men are appointed to discharge public duties; let all seek to
perform those duties, as faithful servants to the Son of David.
