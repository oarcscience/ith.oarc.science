### [Romans Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 4:0</span></span>

([Rom 4:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001).md) The doctrine of
justification by faith is shown by the case of Abraham.

([Rom 4:13-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013).md) He received the promise
through the righteousness of faith.

([Rom 4:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#023).md) And we are justified in
the same way of believing.

[Romans 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 4:1</span></span>

To meet the views of the Jews, the apostle first refers to the example
of Abraham, in whom the Jews gloried as their most renowned forefather.
However exalted in various respects, he had nothing to boast in the
presence of God, being saved by grace, through faith, even as others.
Without noticing the years which passed before his call, and the
failures at times in his obedience, and even in his faith, it was
expressly stated in Scripture that "he believed God, and it was counted
to him for righteousness," [Gen 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md).
From this example it is observed, that if any man could work the full
measure required by the law, the reward must be reckoned as a debt,
which evidently was not the case even of Abraham, seeing faith was
reckoned to him for righteousness. When believers are justified by
faith, "their faith being counted for righteousness," their faith does
not justify them as a part, small or great, of their righteousness; but
as the appointed means of uniting them to Him who has chosen as the name
whereby he shall be called, "the Lord our Righteousness." Pardoned
people are the only blessed people. It clearly appears from the
Scripture, that Abraham was justified several years before his
circumcision. It is, therefore, plain that this rite was not necessary
in order to justification. It was a sign of the original corruption of
human nature. And it was such a sign as was also an outward seal,
appointed not only to confirm God's promises to him and to his seed, and
their obligation to be the Lord's, but likewise to assure him of his
being already a real partaker of the righteousness of faith. Thus
Abraham was the spiritual forefather of all believers, who walked after
the example of his obedient faith. The seal of the Holy Spirit in our
sanctification, making us new creatures, is the inward evidence of the
righteousness of faith.

[Romans 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 4:13</span></span>

The promise was made to Abraham long before the law. It points at
Christ, and it refers to the promise, [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md). In Thee shall all families of
the earth be blessed. The law worketh wrath, by showing that every
transgressor is exposed to the Divine displeasure. As God intended to
give men a title to the promised blessings, so he appointed it to be by
faith, that it might be wholly of grace, to make it sure to all who were
of the like precious faith with Abraham, whether Jews or Gentiles, in
all ages. The justification and salvation of sinners, the taking to
himself the Gentiles who had not been a people, were a gracious calling
of things which are not, as though they were; and this giving a being to
things that were not, proves the almighty power of God. The nature and
power of Abraham's faith are shown. He believed God's testimony, and
looked for the performance of his promise, firmly hoping when the case
seemed hopeless. It is weakness of faith, that makes a man lie poring on
the difficulties in the way of a promise. Abraham took it not for a
point that would admit of argument or debate. Unbelief is at the bottom
of all our staggerings at God's promises. The strength of faith appeared
in its victory over fears. God honours faith; and great faith honours
God. It was imputed to him for righteousness. Faith is a grace that of
all others gives glory to God. Faith clearly is the instrument by which
we receive the righteousness of God, the redemption which is by Christ;
and that which is the instrument whereby we take or receive it, cannot
be the thing itself, nor can it be the gift thereby taken and received.
Abraham's faith did not justify him by its own merit or value, but as
giving him a part in Christ.

[Romans 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 4:23</span></span>

The history of Abraham, and of his justification, was recorded to teach
men of after-ages; those especially to whom the gospel was then made
known. It is plain, that we are not justified by the merit of our own
works, but by faith in Jesus Christ and his righteousness; which is the
truth urged in this and the foregoing chapter, as the great spring and
foundation of all comfort. Christ did meritoriously work our
justification and salvation by his death and passion, but the power and
perfection thereof, with respect to us, depend on his resurrection. By
his death he paid our debt, in his resurrection he received our
acquittance, [Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md). When he was
discharged, we, in Him and together with Him, received the discharge
from the guilt and punishment of all our sins. This last verse is an
abridgement or summary of the whole gospel.
