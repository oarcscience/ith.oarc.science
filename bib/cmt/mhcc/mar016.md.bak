### [Mark Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md)

[Mark 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 16:1</span></span>

Nicodemus brought a large quantity of spices, but these good women did
not think that enough. The respect others show to Christ, should not
hinder us from showing our respect. And those who are carried by holy
zeal, to seek Christ diligently, will find the difficulties in their way
speedily vanish. When we put ourselves to trouble and expense, from love
to Christ, we shall be accepted, though our endeavours are not
successful. The sight of the angel might justly have encouraged them,
but they were affrighted. Thus many times that which should be matter of
comfort to us, through our own mistake, proves a terror to us. He was
crucified, but he is glorified. He is risen, he is not here, not dead,
but alive again; hereafter you will see him, but you may here see the
place where he was laid. Thus seasonable comforts will be sent to those
that lament after the Lord Jesus. Peter is particularly named, Tell
Peter; it will be most welcome to him, for he is in sorrow for sin. A
sight of Christ will be very welcome to a true penitent, and a true
penitent is very welcome to a sight of Christ. The men ran with all the
haste they could to the disciples; but disquieting fears often hinder us
from doing that service to Christ and to the souls of men, which, if
faith and the joy of faith were strong, we might do.

[Mark 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 16:9</span></span>

Better news cannot be brought to disciples in tears, than to tell them
of Christ's resurrection. And we should study to comfort disciples that
are mourners, by telling them whatever we have seen of Christ. It was a
wise providence that the proofs of Christ's resurrection were given
gradually, and admitted cautiously, that the assurance with which the
apostles preached this doctrine afterwards might the more satisfy. Yet
how slowly do we admit the consolations which the word of God holds
forth! Therefore while Christ comforts his people, he often sees it
needful to rebuke and correct them for hardness of heart in distrusting
his promise, as well as in not obeying his holy precepts.

[Mark 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 16:14</span></span>

The evidences of the truth of the gospel are so full, that those who
receive it not, may justly be upbraided with their unbelief. Our blessed
Lord renewed his choice of the eleven as his apostles, and commissioned
them to go into all the world, to preach his gospel to every creature.
Only he that is a true Christian shall be saved through Christ. Simon
Magus professed to believe, and was baptized, yet he was declared to be
in the bonds of iniquity: see his history in [Act
8:13-25](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#013.md). Doubtless this is a solemn
declaration of that true faith which receives Christ in all his
characters and offices, and for all the purposes of salvation, and which
produces its right effect on the heart and life; not a mere assent,
which is a dead faith, and cannot profit. The commission of Christ's
ministers extends to every creature throughout the world, and the
declarations of the gospel contain not only truths, encouragements, and
precepts, but also most awful warnings. Observe what power the apostles
should be endued with, for confirming the doctrine they were to preach.
These were miracles to confirm the truth of the gospel, and means of
spreading the gospel among nations that had not heard it.

[Mark 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 16:19</span></span>

After the Lord had spoken he went up into heaven. Sitting is a posture
of rest, he had finished his work; and a posture of rule, he took
possession of his kingdom. He sat at the right hand of God, which
denotes his sovereign dignity and universal power. Whatever God does
concerning us, gives to us, or accepts from us, it is by his Son. Now he
is glorified with the glory he had before the world. The apostles went
forth, and preached every where, far and near. Though the doctrine they
preached was spiritual and heavenly, and directly contrary to the spirit
and temper of the world; though it met with much opposition, and was
wholly destitute of all worldly supports and advantages; yet in a few
years the sound went forth unto the ends of the earth. Christ's
ministers do not now need to work miracles to prove their message; the
Scriptures are proved to be of Divine origin, and this renders those
without excuse who reject or neglect them. The effects of the gospel,
when faithfully preached, and truly believed, in changing the tempers
and characters of mankind, form a constant proof, a miraculous proof,
that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, of all who believe.
