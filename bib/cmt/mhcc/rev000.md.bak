[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 0:0</span></span>

The Book of the Revelation of St. John consists of two principal
divisions. 1. Relates to "the things which are," that is, the then
present state of the church, and contains the epistle of John to the
seven churches, and his account of the appearance of the Lord Jesus, and
his direction to the apostle to write what he beheld, [Rev
1:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md). Also the addresses or epistles
to seven churches of Asia. These, doubtless, had reference to the state
of the respective churches, as they then existed, but contain excellent
precepts and exhortations, commendations and reproofs, promises and
threatenings, suitable to instruct the Christian church at all times. 2.
Contains a prophecy of "the things which shall be hereafter," and
describes the future state of the church, from the time when the apostle
beheld the visions here recorded. It is intended for our spiritual
improvement; to warn the careless sinner, point out the way of salvation
to the awakened inquirer, build up the weak believer, comfort the
afflicted and tempted Christian, and, we may especially add, to
strengthen the martyr of Christ, under the cruel persecutions and
sufferings inflicted by Satan and his followers.
