### [Psalms Chapter 80](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 80:0</span></span>

([Psa 80:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001)) The psalmist complains
of the miseries of the church.

([Psa 80:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008)) Its former prosperity
and present desolation.

([Psa 80:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017)) A prayer for mercy.

[Psalms 80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 80:1</span></span>

He that dwelleth upon the mercy-seat, is the good Shepherd of his
people. But we can neither expect the comfort of his love, nor the
protection of his arm, unless we partake of his converting grace. If he
is really angry at the prayers of his people, it is because, although
they pray, their ends are not right, or there is some secret sin
indulged in them, or he will try their patience and perseverance in
prayer. When God is displeased with his people, we must expect to see
them in tears, and their enemies in triumph. There is no salvation but
from God's favour; there is no conversion to God but by his own grace.

[Psalms 80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 80:8</span></span>

The church is represented as a vine and a vineyard. The root of this
vine is Christ, the branches are believers. The church is like a vine,
needing support, but spreading and fruitful. If a vine do not bring
forth fruit, no tree is so worthless. And are not we planted as in a
well-cultivated garden, with every means of being fruitful in works of
righteousness? But the useless leaves of profession, and the empty
boughs of notions and forms, abound far more than real piety. It was
wasted and ruined. There was a good reason for this change in God's way
toward them. And it is well or ill with us, according as we are under
God's smiles or frowns. When we consider the state of the purest part of
the visible church, we cannot wonder that it is visited with sharp
corrections. They request that God would help the vine. Lord, it is
formed by thyself, and for thyself, therefore it may, with humble
confidence, be committed to thyself.

[Psalms 80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 80:17</span></span>

The Messiah, the Protector and Saviour of the church, is the Man of
God's right hand; he is the Arm of the Lord, for all power is given to
him. In him is our strength, by which we are enabled to persevere to the
end. The vine, therefore, cannot be ruined, nor can any fruitful branch
perish; but the unfruitful will be cut off and cast into the fire. The
end of our redemption is, that we should serve Him who hath redeemed us,
and not go back to our old sins.
