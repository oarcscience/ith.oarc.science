If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and
it is a good means of understanding more.

[Proverbs 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 28:6</span></span>

An honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man;

That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long.
Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified.

[Proverbs 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 28:9</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 28:13</span></span>

It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall
not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true
repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our
great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may
claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto
eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.

the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and
fear sinning against him.

ease, and safety.

[Proverbs 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#017.md)

him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.

[Proverbs 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 28:23</span></span>

Upon reflection, most will have a better opinion of a faithful reprover
than of a soothing flatterer.

[Proverbs 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 28:24</span></span>

to his own heart, which is not only deceitful above all things, but
which has often deceived him.

will look off from those that call for his attention.

[Proverbs 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 28:28</span></span>

business. If the reader will go diligently over this and the other
chapters, in many places where at first he may suppose there is least of
Christ, still he will find what will lead to him.
