### [Ezekiel Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 13:0</span></span>

([Eze 13:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001).md) Heavy judgments against
lying prophets.

([Eze 13:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010).md) The insufficiency of
their work.

([Eze 13:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017).md) Woes against false
prophetesses.

[Ezekiel 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 13:1</span></span>

Where God gives a warrant to do any thing, he gives wisdom. What they
delivered was not what they had seen or heard, as that is which the
ministers of Christ deliver. They were not praying prophets, had no
intercourse with Heaven; they contrived how to please people, not how to
do them good; they stood not against sin. They flattered people into
vain hopes. Such widen the breach, by causing men to think themselves
deserving of eternal life, when the wrath of God abides upon them.

[Ezekiel 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 13:10</span></span>

One false prophet built the wall, set up the notion that Jerusalem
should be victorious, and made himself acceptable by it. Others made the
matter yet more plausible and promising; they daubed the wall which the
first had built; but they would, ere long, be undeceived when their work
was beaten down by the storm of God's just wrath; when the Chaldean army
desolated the land. Hopes of peace and happiness, not warranted by the
word of God, will cheat men; like a wall well daubed, but ill built.

[Ezekiel 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 13:17</span></span>

It is ill with those who had rather hear pleasing lies than unpleasing
truths. The false prophetesses tried to make people secure, signified by
laying them at ease, and to make them proud, signified by the finery
laid on their heads. They shall be confounded in their attempts, and
God's people shall be delivered out of their hands. It behoves
Christians to keep close to the word of God, and in every thing to seek
the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Let us so trust the promises of God as
to keep his commandments.
