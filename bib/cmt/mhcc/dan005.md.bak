[Daniel 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 5:1</span></span>

Belshazzar bade defiance to the judgments of God. Most historians
consider that Cyrus then besieged Babylon. Security and sensuality are
sad proofs of approaching ruin. That mirth is sinful indeed, which
profanes sacred things; and what are many of the songs used at modern
feasts better than the praises sung by the heathens to their gods! See
how God struck terror upon Belshazzar and his lords. God's written word
is enough to put the proudest, boldest sinner in a fright. What we see
of God, the part of the hand that writes in the book of the creatures,
and in the book of the Scriptures, should fill us with awful thoughts
concerning that part which we do not see. If this be the finger of God,
what is his arm when made bare? And what is He? The king's guilty
conscience told him that he had no reason to expect any good news from
heaven. God can, in a moment, make the heart of the stoutest sinner to
tremble; and there needs no more than to let loose his own thoughts upon
him; they will give him trouble enough. No bodily pain can equal the
inward agony which sometimes seizes the sinner in the midst of mirth,
carnal pleasures, and worldly pomp. Sometimes terrors cause a man to
flee to Christ for pardon and peace; but many cry out for fear of wrath,
who are not humbled for their sins, and who seek relief by lying
vanities. The ignorance and uncertainty concerning the Holy Scriptures,
shown by many who call themselves wise, only tend to drive sinners to
despair, as the ignorance of these wise men did.

[Daniel 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 5:10</span></span>

Daniel was forgotten at court; he lived privately, and was then ninety
years of age. Many consult servants of God on curious questions, or to
explain difficult subjects, but without asking the way of salvation, or
the path of duty. Daniel slighted the offer of reward. He spoke to
Belshazzar as to a condemned criminal. We should despise all the gifts
and rewards this world can give, did we see, as we may by faith, its end
hastening on; but let us do our duty in the world, and do it all the
real service we can.

[Daniel 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 5:18</span></span>

Daniel reads Belshazzar's doom. He had not taken warning by the
judgments upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he had insulted God. Sinners are
pleased with gods that neither see, nor hear, nor know; but they will be
judged by One to whom all things are open. Daniel reads the sentence
written on the wall. All this may well be applied to the doom of every
sinner. At death, the sinner's days are numbered and finished; after
death is the judgment, when he will be weighed in the balance, and found
wanting; and after judgment the sinner will be cut asunder, and given as
a prey to the devil and his angels. While these things were passing in
the palace, it is considered that the army of Cyrus entered the city;
and when Belshazzar was slain, a general submission followed. Soon will
every impenitent sinner find the writing of God's word brought to pass
upon him, whether he is weighed in the balance of the law as a
self-righteous Pharisee, or in that of the gospel as a painted
hypocrite.
