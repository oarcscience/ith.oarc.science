### [Amos Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 0:0</span></span>

Amos was a herdsman, and engaged in agriculture. But the same Divine
Spirit influenced Isaiah and Daniel in the court, and Amos in the
sheep-folds, giving to each the powers and eloquence needful for them.
He assures the twelve tribes of the destruction of the neighbouring
nations; and as they at that time gave themselves up to wickedness and
idolatry, he reproves the Jewish nation with severity; but describes the
restoration of the church by the Messiah, extending to the latter days.
