### [Jeremiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 28:0</span></span>

([Jer 28:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001).md) A false prophet opposes
Jeremiah.

([Jer 28:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010).md) The false prophet
warned of his approaching death.

[Jeremiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 28:1</span></span>

Hananiah spoke a false prophecy. Here is not a word of good counsel
urging the Jews to repent and return to God. He promises temporal
mercies, in God's name, but makes no mention of the spiritual mercies
which God always promised with earthly blessings. This was not the first
time Jeremiah had prayed for the people, though he prophesied against
them. He appeals to the event, to prove Hananiah's falsehood. The
prophet who spake only of peace and prosperity, without adding that they
must not by wilful sin stop God's favours, will be proved a false
prophet. Those who do not declare the alarming as well as the
encouraging parts of God's word, and call men to repentance, and faith,
and holiness, tread in the steps of the false prophets. The gospel of
Christ encourages men to do works meet for repentance, but gives no
encouragement to continue in sin.

[Jeremiah 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 28:10</span></span>

Hananiah is sentenced to die, and Jeremiah, when he has received
direction from God, boldly tells him so; but not before he received that
commission. Those have much to answer for, who tell sinners that they
shall have peace, though they harden their hearts in contempt of God's
word. The servant of God must be gentle to all men. He must give up even
his right, and leave the Lord to plead his cause. Every attempt of
ungodly men to make vain the purposes of God, will add to their
miseries.
