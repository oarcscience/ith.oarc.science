### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 3:0</span></span>

([Sa2 3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001).md) David's power increases
His family.

([Sa2 3:7-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#007).md) Abner revolts to David.

(v. 22-39) Joab kills Abner David mourns for him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 3:1</span></span>

The length of this war tried the faith and patience of David, and made
his settlement at last the more welcome. The contest between grace and
corruption in the hearts of believers, may fitly be compared to this
warfare. There is a long war between them, the flesh lusting against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; but as the work of holiness is
carried on, corruption, like the house of Saul, grows weaker and weaker;
while grace, like the house of David, grows stronger and stronger.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 3:7</span></span>

Many, like Abner, are not above committing base crimes, who are too
proud to bear reproof, or even the suspicion of being guilty. While men
go on in sin, and apparently without concern, they are often conscious
that they are fighting against God. Many mean to serve their own
purposes; and will betray those who trust them, when they can get any
advantage. Yet the Lord serves his own designs, even by those who are
thus actuated by revenge, ambition, or lust; but as they intend not to
honour him, in the end they will be thrown aside with contempt. There
was real generosity both to Michal and to the memory of Saul, in David's
receiving the former, remembering probably how once he owed his life to
her affection, and knowing that she was separated from him partly by her
father's authority. Let no man set his heart on that which he is not
entitled to. If any disagreement has separated husband and wife, as they
expect the blessing of God, let them be reconciled, and live together in
love.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 3:22</span></span>

Judgments are prepared for such scorners as Abner; but Joab, in what he
did, acted wickedly. David laid Abner's murder deeply to heart, and in
many ways expressed his detestation of it. The guilt of blood brings a
curse upon families: if men do not avenge it, God will. It is a sad
thing to die like a fool, as they do that any way shorten their own
days, and those who make no provision for another world. Who would be
fond of power, when a man may have the name of it, and must be
accountable for it, yet is hampered in the use of it? David ought to
have done his duty, and then trusted God with the issue. Carnal policy
spared Joab. The Son of David may long delay, but never fails to punish
impenitent sinners. He who now reigns upon the throne of David, has a
kingdom of a nobler kind. Whatever He doeth, is noticed by all his
willing people, and is pleasing to them.
