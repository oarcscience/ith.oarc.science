### [Psalms Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 34:0</span></span>

([Psa 34:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001).md) David praises God, and
encourages to trust him.

([Psa 34:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011).md) He exhorts to fear.

[Psalms 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 34:1</span></span>

If we hope to spend eternity in praising God, it is fit that we should
spend much of our time here in this work. He never said to any one, Seek
ye me in vain. David's prayers helped to silence his fears; many besides
him have looked unto the Lord by faith and prayer, and it has
wonderfully revived and comforted them. When we look to the world, we
are perplexed, and at a loss. But on looking to Christ depends our whole
salvation, and all things needful thereunto do so also. This poor man,
whom no man looked upon with any respect, or looked after with any
concern, was yet welcome to the throne of grace; the Lord heard him, and
saved him out of all his troubles. The holy angels minister to the
saints, and stand for them against the powers of darkness. All the glory
be to the Lord of the angels. By taste and sight we both make
discoveries, and have enjoyment; Taste and see God's goodness; take
notice of it, and take the comfort of it. He makes all truly blessed
that trust in him. As to the things of the other world, they shall have
grace sufficient for the support of spiritual life. And as to this life,
they shall have what is necessary from the hand of God. Paul had all,
and abounded, because he was content, [Phi
4:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011.md). Those who trust to
themselves, and think their own efforts sufficient for them, shall want;
but they shall be fed who trust in the Lord. Those shall not want, who
with quietness work, and mind their own business.

[Psalms 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 34:11</span></span>

Let young persons set out in life with learning the fear of the Lord, if
they desire true comfort here, and eternal happiness hereafter. Those
will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good a Master. All
aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than the present world;
for man's life on earth consists but of few days, and those full of
trouble. What man is he that would see the good of that where all bliss
is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts. That religion
promises best which creates watchfulness over the heart and over the
tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study to be useful, and
to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursue it; be willing to
deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It is the constant practice
of real believers, when in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their
constant comfort that he hears them. The righteous are humbled for sin,
and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is more needful to true godliness
than a contrite heart, broken off from every self-confidence. In this
soil every grace will flourish, and nothing can encourage such a one but
the free, rich grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous are
taken under the special protection of the Lord, yet they have their
share of crosses in this world, and there are those that hate them. Both
from the mercy of Heaven, and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the
righteous must be many. But whatever troubles befall them, shall not
hurt their souls, for God keeps them from sinning in troubles. No man is
desolate, but he whom God has forsaken.
