### [2 Chronicles Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 30:0</span></span>

([Ch2 30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001).md) Hezekiah's passover.

([Ch2 30:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013).md) The passover
celebrated.

([Ch2 30:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#021).md) The feast of
unleavened bread.

[2 Chronicles 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 30:1</span></span>

Hezekiah made Israel as welcome to the passover, as any of his own
subjects. Let us yield ourselves unto the Lord. Say not, you will do
what you please, but resolve to do what he pleases. We perceive in the
carnal mind a stiffness, an obstinacy, an unaptness to compel with God;
we have it from our fathers: this must be overcome. Those who, through
grace, have turned to God themselves, should do all they can to bring
others to him. Numbers will be scorners, but some will be humbled and
benefited; perhaps where least expected. The rich mercy of God is the
great argument by which to enforce repentance; the vilest who submit and
yield themselves to the Lord, seek his grace, and give themselves to his
service, shall certainly be saved. Oh that messengers were sent forth to
carry these glad tidings to every city and every village, through every
land!

[2 Chronicles 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 30:13</span></span>

The great thing needful in attendance upon God in solemn ordinances, is,
that we make heart-work of it; all is nothing without this. Where this
sincerity and fixedness of heart are, there may yet be many things short
of the purification of the sanctuary. These defects need pardoning,
healing grace; for omissions in duty are sins, as well as omissions of
duty. If God should deal with us in strict justice, even as to the very
best of our doings, we should be undone. The way to obtain pardon, is to
seek it of God by prayer; it must be gotten by petition through the
blood of Christ. Yet every defect is sin, and needs forgiveness; and
should be matter to humble, but not to discourage us, though nothing can
make up for the want of a heart prepared to seek the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 30:21</span></span>

Many prayers were put up to God with the peace-offerings. In these
Israel looked to God as the God of their fathers, a God in covenant with
them. There was also abundance of good preaching. The Levites read and
explained the Scriptures. Faith cometh by hearing, and true religion
preaching has abounded. They sang psalms every day: praising God should
be much of our work in religious assemblies. Having kept the seven days
of the feast in this religious manner, they had so much comfort in it,
that they kept other seven days also. This they did with gladness. Holy
duties should be done with holy gladness. And when sinners humble
themselves before the Lord, they may expect gladness in his ordinances.
Those who taste this happiness will not soon grow weary of it, but will
be glad to prolong their enjoyment.
