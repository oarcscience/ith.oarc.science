### [Joshua Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 9:0</span></span>

([Jos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md), [Jos
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#002).md) The kings combine against Israel.

([Jos 9:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003).md) The Gibeonites apply for
peace.

([Jos 9:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014).md) They obtain peace, but
are soon detected.

([Jos 9:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#022).md) The Gibeonites are to
be bondmen.

[Joshua 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 9:1</span></span>

Hitherto the Canaanites had defended themselves, but here they consult
to attack Israel. Their minds were blinded, and their hearts hardened to
their destruction. Though often at enmity with each other, yet they
united against Israel. Oh that Israel would learn of Canaanites, to
sacrifice private interests to the public welfare, and to lay aside all
quarrels among themselves, that they may unite against the enemies of
God's kingdom!

[Joshua 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 9:3</span></span>

Other people heard these tidings, and were driven thereby to make war
upon Israel; but the Gibeonites were led to make peace with them. Thus
the discovery of the glory and the grace of God in the gospel, is to
some a savour of life unto life, but to others a savour of death unto
death, [Co2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md). The same sun softens
wax and hardens clay. The falsehood of the Gibeonites cannot be
justified. We must not do evil that good may themselves to the God of
Israel, we have reason to think Joshua would have been directed by the
oracle of God to spare their lives. But when they had once said, "We are
come from a far country," they were led to say it made of skins, and
their clothes: one lie brings on another, and that a third, and so on.
The way of that sin is especially down-hill. Yet their faith and
prudence are to be commended. In submitting to Israel they submitted to
the God of Israel, which implied forsaking their idolatries. And how can
we do better than cast ourselves upon the mercy of a God of all
goodness? The way to avoid judgment is to meet it by repentance. Let us
do like these Gibeonites, seek peace with God in the rags of abasement,
and godly sorrow; so our sin shall not be our ruin. Let us be servants
to Jesus, our blessed Joshua, and we shall live.

[Joshua 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 9:14</span></span>

The Israelites, having examined the provisions of the Gibeonites,
hastily concluded that they confirmed their account. We make more haste
than good speed, when we stay not to take God with us, and do not
consult him by the word and prayer. The fraud was soon found out. A
lying tongue is but for a moment. Had the oath been in itself unlawful,
it would not have been binding; for no obligation can render it our duty
to commit a sin. But it was not unlawful to spare the Canaanites who
submitted, and left idolatry, desiring only that their lives might be
spared. A citizen of Zion swears to his own hurt, and changes not, [Psa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md). Joshua and the princes, when
they found that they had been deceived, did not apply to Eleazar the
high priest to be freed from their engagement, much less did they
pretend that no faith is to be kept with those to whom they had sworn.
Let this convince us how we ought to keep our promises, and make good
our bargains; and what conscience we ought to make of our words.

[Joshua 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 9:22</span></span>

The Gibeonites do not justify their lie, but plead that they did it to
save their lives. And the fear was not merely of the power of man; one
might flee from that to the Divine protection; but of the power of God
himself, which they saw engaged against them. Joshua sentences them to
perpetual bondage. They must be servants, but any work becomes
honourable, when it is done for the house of the Lord, and the offices
thereof. Let us, in like manner, submit to our Lord Jesus, saying, We
are in thy hand, do unto us as seemeth good and right unto thee, only
save our souls; and we shall not repent it. If He appoints us to bear
his cross, and serve him, that shall be neither shame nor grief to us,
while the meanest office in God's service will entitle us to a dwelling
in the house of the Lord all the days of our life. And in coming to the
Saviour, we do not proceed upon a peradventure. We are invited to draw
nigh, and are assured that him that cometh to Him, he will in nowise
cast out. Even those things which sound harsh, and are humbling, and
form sharp trials of our sincerity, will prove of real advantage.
