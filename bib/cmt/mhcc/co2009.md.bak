[2 Corinthians 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 9:1</span></span>

When we would have others do good, we must act toward them prudently and
tenderly, and give them time. Christians should consider what is for the
credit of their profession, and endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God
their Saviour in all things. The duty of ministering to the saints is so
plain, that there would seem no need to exhort Christians to it; yet
self-love contends so powerfully against the love of Christ, that it is
often necessary to stir up their minds by way of remembrance.

[2 Corinthians 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 9:6</span></span>

Money bestowed in charity, may to the carnal mind seem thrown away, but
when given from proper principles, it is seed sown, from which a
valuable increase may be expected. It should be given carefully. Works
of charity, like other good works, should be done with thought and
design. Due thought, as to our circumstances, and those we are about to
relieve, will direct our gifts for charitable uses. Help should be given
freely, be it more or less; not grudgingly, but cheerfully. While some
scatter, and yet increase; others withhold more than is meet, and it
tends to poverty. If we had more faith and love, we should waste less on
ourselves, and sow more in hope of a plentiful increase. Can a man lose
by doing that with which God is pleased? He is able to make all grace
abound towards us, and to abound in us; to give a large increase of
spiritual and of temporal good things. He can make us to have enough in
all things; and to be content with what we have. God gives not only
enough for ourselves, but that also wherewith we may supply the wants of
others, and this should be as seed to be sown. We must show the reality
of our subjection to the gospel, by works of charity. This will be for
the credit of our profession, and to the praise and glory of God. Let us
endeavour to copy the example of Christ, being unwearied in doing good,
and deeming it more blessed to give than to receive. Blessed be God for
the unspeakable gift of his grace, whereby he enables and inclines some
of his people to bestow upon others, and others to be grateful for it;
and blessed be his glorious name to all eternity, for Jesus Christ, that
inestimable gift of his love, through whom this and every other good
thing, pertaining to life and godliness, are freely given unto us,
beyond all expression, measure, or bounds.
