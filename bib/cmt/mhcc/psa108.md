### [Psalms Chapter 108](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 108:0</span></span>

&gt;

[Psalms 108:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 108:1</span></span>

We may usefully select passages from different psalms, as here, [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001) and [Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001), to help our devotions, and
enliven our gratitude. When the heart is firm in faith and love, the
tongue, being employed in grateful praises, is our glory. Every gift of
the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's
service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and
hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by
the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him
help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do,
whatever we gain, God must have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls
with this salvation, with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen
people.
