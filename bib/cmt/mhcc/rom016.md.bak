### [Romans Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 16:0</span></span>

(v. 1-16) The apostle recommends Phebe to the church at Rome, and greets
several friends there.

([Rom 16:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017).md) Cautions the church
against such as made divisions.

([Rom 16:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021).md) Christian salutations.

([Rom 16:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025).md) The epistle concludes
with ascribing glory to God.

[Romans 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 16:1</span></span>

Paul recommends Phebe to the Christians at Rome. It becomes Christians
to help one another in their affairs, especially strangers; we know not
what help we may need ourselves. Paul asks help for one that had been
helpful to many; he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Though
the care of all the churches came upon him daily, yet he could remember
many persons, and send salutations to each, with particular characters
of them, and express concern for them. Lest any should feel themselves
hurt, as if Paul had forgotten them, he sends his remembrances to the
rest, as brethren and saints, though not named. He adds, in the close, a
general salutation to them all, in the name of the churches of Christ.

[Romans 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 16:17</span></span>

How earnest, how endearing are these exhortations! Whatever differs from
the sound doctrine of the Scriptures, opens a door to divisions and
offences. If truth be forsaken, unity and peace will not last long. Many
call Christ, Master and Lord, who are far from serving him. But they
serve their carnal, sensual, worldly interests. They corrupt the head by
deceiving the heart; perverting the judgments by winding themselves into
the affections. We have great need to keep our hearts with all
diligence. It has been the common policy of seducers to set upon those
who are softened by convictions. A pliable temper is good when under
good guidance, otherwise it may be easily led astray. Be so wise as not
to be deceived, yet so simple as not to be deceivers. The blessing the
apostle expects from God, is victory over Satan. This includes all
designs and devices of Satan against souls, to defile, disturb, and
destroy them; all his attempts to keep us from the peace of heaven here,
and the possession of heaven hereafter. When Satan seems to prevail, and
we are ready to give up all as lost, then will the God of peace
interpose in our behalf. Hold out therefore, faith and patience, yet a
little while. If the grace of Christ be with us, who can prevail against
us?

[Romans 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 16:21</span></span>

The apostle adds affectionate remembrances from persons with him, known
to the Roman Christians. It is a great comfort to see the holiness and
usefulness of our kindred. Not many mighty, not many noble are called,
but some are. It is lawful for believers to bear civil offices; and it
were to be wished that all offices in Christian states, and in the
church, were bestowed upon prudent and steady Christians.

[Romans 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 16:25</span></span>

That which establishes souls, is, the plain preaching of Jesus Christ.
Our redemption and salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, are, without
controversy, a great mystery of godliness. And yet, blessed be God,
there is as much of this mystery made plain as will bring us to heaven,
if we do not wilfully neglect so great salvation. Life and immortality
are brought to light by the gospel, and the Sun of Righteousness is
risen on the world. The Scriptures of the prophets, what they left in
writing, is not only made plain in itself, but by it this mystery is
made known to all nations. Christ is salvation to all nations. And the
gospel is revealed, not to be talked of and disputed about, but to be
submitted to. The obedience of faith is that obedience which is paid to
the word of faith, and which comes by the grace of faith. All the glory
that passes from fallen man to God, so as to be accepted of him, must go
through the Lord Jesus, in whom alone our persons and doings are, or can
be, pleasing to God. Of his righteousness we must make mention, even of
his only; who, as he is the Mediator of all our prayers, so he is, and
will be, to eternity, the Mediator of all our praises. Remembering that
we are called to the obedience of faith, and that every degree of wisdom
is from the only wise God, we should, by word and deed, render glory to
him through Jesus Christ; that so the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ may
be with us for ever.
