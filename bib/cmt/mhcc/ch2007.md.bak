### [2 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

God's answer to Solomon's prayer.

[2 Chronicles 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 7:1</span></span>

God gave a gracious answer to Solomon's prayer. The mercies of God to
sinners are made known in a manner well suited to impress all who
receive them, with his majesty and holiness. The people worshipped and
praised God. When he manifests himself as a consuming Fire to sinners,
his people can rejoice in him as their Light. Nay, they had reason to
say, that God was good in this. It is of the Lord's mercies we are not
consumed, but the sacrifice in our stead, for which we should be very
thankful. And whoever beholds with true faith, the Saviour agonizing and
dying for man's sin, will, by that view, find his godly sorrow enlarged,
his hatred of sin increased, his soul made more watchful, and his life
more holy. Solomon prosperously effected all he designed, for adorning
both God's house and his own. Those who begin with the service of God,
are likely to go on successfully in their own affairs. It was Solomon's
praise, that what he undertook, he went through with; it was by the
grace of God that he prospered in it. Let us then stand in awe, and sin
not. Let us fear the Lord's displeasure, hope in his mercy, and walk in
his commandments.
