### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 7:0</span></span>

([Kg2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001), [Kg2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#002)) Elisha prophesies plenty.

([Kg2 7:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003)) The flight of the Syrian
army.

([Kg2 7:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#012)) Samaria plentifully
supplied.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 7:1</span></span>

Man's extremity is God's opportunity of making his own power to be
glorious: his time to appear for his people is when their strength is
gone. Unbelief is a sin by which men greatly dishonour and displease
God, and deprive themselves of the favours he designed for them. Such
will be the portion of those that believe not the promise of eternal
life; they shall see it at a distance, but shall never taste of it. But
no temporal deliverances and mercies will in the end profit sinners,
unless they are led to repentance by the goodness of God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 7:3</span></span>

God can, when he pleases, make the stoutest heart to tremble; and as for
those who will not fear God, he can make them fear at the shaking of a
leaf. Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as the Syrians
were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief would befall them,
if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity, and fear of
punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of the ungodly. These
feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in the world; but they who
have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, will not long delay to
report the good tidings to others. From love to him, not from selfish
feelings, they will gladly share their earthly good things with their
brethren.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 7:12</span></span>

Here see the wants of Israel supplied in a way they little thought of,
which should encourage us to depend upon the power and goodness of God
in our greatest straits. God's promise may be safely relied on, for no
word of his shall fall to the ground. The nobleman that questioned the
truth of Elisha's word, saw the plenty, to silence and shame his
unbelief, and therein saw his own folly; but he did not eat of the
plenty he saw. Justly do those find the world's promises fail them, who
think that the promises of God will disappoint them. Learn how deeply
God resents distrust of his power, providence, and promise: how
uncertain life is, and the enjoyments of it: how certain God's
threatenings are, and how sure to come on the guilty. May God help us to
inquire whether we are exposed to his threatenings, or interested in his
promises.
