### [Ezekiel Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 12:0</span></span>

(v. 1-16) The approaching captivity.

([Eze 12:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#017)) An emblem of the
consternation of the Jews.

([Eze 12:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#021)) Answers to the
objections of scoffers.

[Ezekiel 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 12:1</span></span>

By the preparation for removal, and his breaking through the wall of his
house at evening, as one desirous to escape from the enemy, the prophet
signified the conduct and fate of Zedekiah. When God has delivered us,
we must glorify him and edify others, by acknowledging our sins. Those
who by afflictions are brought to this, are made to know that God is the
Lord, and may help to bring others to know him.

[Ezekiel 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 12:17</span></span>

The prophet must eat and drink in care and fear, with trembling, that he
might express the condition of those in Jerusalem during the siege. When
ministers speak of the ruin coming upon sinners, they must speak as
those that know the terrors of the Lord. Afflictions are happy ones,
however grievous to flesh and blood, that improve us in the knowledge of
God.

[Ezekiel 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 12:21</span></span>

From that forbearance of God, which should have led them to repent, the
Jews hardened themselves in sin. It will not serve for an excuse in
speaking evil, to plead that it is a common saying. There is but a step
between us and an awful eternity; therefore it concerns us to get ready
for a future state. No one will be able to put from himself the evil
day, unless by seeking peace with the Lord.
