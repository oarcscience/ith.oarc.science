### [Judges Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 19:0</span></span>

The wickedness of the men of Gibeah.

[Judges 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 19:1</span></span>

The three remaining chapters of this book contain a very sad history of
the wickedness of the men of Gibeah, in Benjamin. The righteous Lord
permits sinners to execute just vengeance on one another, and if the
scene here described is horrible, what will the discoveries of the day
of judgment be! Let each of us consider how to escape from the wrath to
come, how to mortify the sins of our own hearts, to resist Satan's
temptations, and to avoid the pollutions there are in the world.
