### [Isaiah Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 15:0</span></span>

The Divine judgments about to come upon the Moabites.

[Isaiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 15:1</span></span>

This prophecy coming to pass within three years, would confirm the
prophet's mission, and the belief in all his other prophecies.
Concerning Moab it is foretold, 1. That their chief cities should be
surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones, may be made
in a very little time. 2. The Moabites would have recourse to their
idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, have no comforter. But
they are seldom brought by their terrors to approach our forgiving God
with true sorrow and believing prayer. 3. There should be the cries of
grief through the land. It is poor relief to have many fellow-sufferers,
fellow-mourners. 4. The courage of their soldiers should fail. God can
easily deprive a nation of that on which it most depended for strength
and defence. 5. These calamities should cause grief in the neighbouring
parts. Though enemies to Israel, yet as our fellow-creatures, it should
be grievous to see them in such distress. In [Isa
15:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006), the prophet describes the
woful lamentations heard through the country of Moab, when it became a
prey to the Assyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine
is usually the sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance
of this world, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how
soon it may be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape
from ruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness
of their sins.
