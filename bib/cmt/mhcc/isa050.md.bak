### [Isaiah Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 50:0</span></span>

([Isa 50:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001).md) The rejection of the
Jews.

([Isa 50:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004).md) The sufferings and
exaltation of the Messiah.

([Isa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md), [Isa
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011).md) Consolation to the believer,
and warning to the unbeliever.

[Isaiah 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 50:1</span></span>

Those who have professed to be people of God, and seem to be dealt
severely with, are apt to complain, as if God had been hard with them.
Here is an answer for such murmurings; God never deprived any of their
advantages, except for their sins. The Jews were sent into Babylon for
their idolatry, a sin which broke the covenant; and they were at last
rejected for crucifying the Lord of glory. God called on them to leave
their sins, and prevent their own ruin. Last of all, the Son came to his
own, but his own received him not. When God calls men to happiness, and
they will not answer, they are justly left to be miserable. To silence
doubts concerning his power, proofs of it are given. The wonders which
attended his sufferings and death, proclaimed that he was the Son of
God, [Mat 27:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#054.md).

[Isaiah 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 50:4</span></span>

As Jesus was God and man in one person, we find him sometimes speaking,
or spoken of, as the Lord God; at other times, as man and the servant of
Jehovah. He was to declare the truths which comfort the broken, contrite
heart, those weary of sin, harassed with afflictions. And as the Holy
Spirit was upon him, that he might speak as never man spake; so the same
Divine influence daily wakened him to pray, to preach the gospel, and to
receive and deliver the whole will of the Father. The Father justified
the Son when he accepted the satisfaction he made for the sin of man.
Christ speaks in the name of all believers. Who dares to be an enemy to
those unto whom he is a Friend? or who will contend with those whom he
is an Advocate? Thus St. Paul applies it, [Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md).

[Isaiah 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 50:10</span></span>

A child of God is afraid of incurring his displeasure. This grace
usually appears most in believers when in darkness, when other graces
appear not. Those that truly fear God, obey the voice of Christ. A
sincere servant of God may for a long time be without views of eternal
happiness. What is likely to be an effectual cure in this sad case? Let
him trust in the name of the Lord; and let him stay himself upon the
promises of the covenant, and build his hopes on them. Let him trust in
Christ, trust in that name of his, The Lord our Righteousness; stay
himself upon God as his God, in and through a Mediator. Presuming
sinners are warned not to trust in themselves. Their own merit and
sufficiency are light and heat to them. Creature-comforts are as sparks,
short-lived, and soon gone; yet the children of this world, while they
last, seek to warm themselves by them, and walk with pride and pleasure
in the light of them. Those that make the world their comfort, and their
own righteousness their confidence, will certainly meet with bitterness
in the end. A godly man's way may be dark, but his end shall be peace
and everlasting light. A wicked man's way may be pleasant, but his end
and abode for ever will be utter darkness.
