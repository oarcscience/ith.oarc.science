[Ephesians](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eph 0:0</span></span>

This epistle was written when St. Paul was a prisoner at Rome. The
design appears to be to strengthen the Ephesians in the faith of Christ,
and to give exalted views of the love of God, and of the dignity and
excellence of Christ, fortifying their minds against the scandal of the
cross. He shows that they were saved by grace, and that however wretched
they once were, they now had equal privileges with the Jews. He
encourages them to persevere in their Christian calling, and urges them
to walk in a manner becoming their profession, faithfully discharging
the general and common duties of religion, and the special duties of
particular relations.
