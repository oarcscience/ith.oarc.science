### [Genesis Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 9:0</span></span>

([Gen 9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001).md) God blesses Noah, and
grants flesh for food.

([Gen 9:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004).md) Blood, and murder
forbidden.

([Gen 9:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#008).md) God's covenant by the
rainbow.

([Gen 9:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#018).md) Noah plants a vineyard,
is drunken and mocked by Ham.

([Gen 9:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#024).md) Noah curses Canaan,
blesses Shem, prays for Japheth, His death.

[Genesis 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 9:1</span></span>

The blessing of God is the cause of our doing well. On him we depend, to
him we should be thankful. Let us not forget the advantage and pleasure
we have from the labour of beasts, and which their flesh affords. Nor
ought we to be less thankful for the security we enjoy from the savage
and hurtful beasts, through the fear of man which God has fixed deep in
them. We see the fulfilment of this promise every day, and on every
side. This grant of the animals for food fully warrants the use of them,
but not the abuse of them by gluttony, still less by cruelty. We ought
not to pain them needlessly whilst they live, nor when we take away
their lives.

[Genesis 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 9:4</span></span>

The main reason of forbidding the eating of blood, doubtless was because
the shedding of blood in sacrifices was to keep the worshippers in mind
of the great atonement; yet it seems intended also to check cruelty,
lest men, being used to shed and feed upon the blood of animals, should
grow unfeeling to them, and be less shocked at the idea of shedding
human blood. Man must not take away his own life. Our lives are God's,
and we must only give them up when he pleases. If we in any way hasten
our own death, we are accountable to God for it. When God requires the
life of a man from him that took it away unjustly, the murderer cannot
render that, and therefore must render his own instead. One time or
other, in this world or in the next, God will discover murders, and
punish those murders which are beyond man's power to punish. But there
are those who are ministers of God to protect the innocent, by being a
terror to evil-doers, and they must not bear the sword in vain, [Rom
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004.md). Wilful murder ought always to be
punished with death. To this law there is a reason added. Such remains
of God's image are still upon fallen man, that he who unjustly kills a
man, defaces the image of God, and does dishonour to him.

[Genesis 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 9:8</span></span>

As the old world was ruined, to be a monument of justice, so this world
remains to this day a monument of mercy. But sin, that drowned the old
world, will burn this. Articles of agreement among men are sealed, that
what is promised may be the more solemn, and the doing of what is
covenanted the more sure to mutual satisfaction. The seal of this
covenant was the rainbow, which, it is likely, was seen in the clouds
before, but was never a seal of the covenant till now it was made so.
The rainbow appears when we have most reason to fear the rain
prevailing; God then shows this seal of the promise, that it shall not
prevail. The thicker the cloud, the brighter the bow in the cloud. Thus,
as threatening afflictions abound, encouraging consolations much more
abound. The rainbow is the reflection of the beams of the sun shining
upon or through the drops of rain: all the glory of the seals of the
covenant are derived from Christ, the Sun of righteousness. And he will
shed a glory on the tears of his saints. A bow speaks terror, but this
has neither string nor arrow; and a bow alone will do little hurt. It is
a bow, but it is directed upward, not toward the earth; for the seals of
the covenant were intended to comfort, not to terrify. As God looks upon
the bow, that he may remember the covenant, so should we, that we may be
mindful of the covenant with faith and thankfulness. Without revelation
this gracious assurance could not be known; and without faith it can be
of no use to us; and thus it is as to the still greater dangers to which
all are exposed, and as to the new covenant with its blessings.

[Genesis 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 9:18</span></span>

The drunkenness of Noah is recorded in the Bible, with that fairness
which is found only in the Scripture, as a case and proof of human
weakness and imperfection, even though he may have been surprised into
the sin; and to show that the best of men cannot stand upright, unless
they depend upon Divine grace, and are upheld thereby. Ham appears to
have been a bad man, and probably rejoiced to find his father in an
unbecoming situation. It was said of Noah, that he was perfect in his
generations, [Gen 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009.md); but this is
meant of sincerity, not of a sinless perfection. Noah, who had kept
sober in drunken company, is now drunk in sober company. Let him that
thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We have need to be very
careful when we use God's good creatures plentifully, lest we use them
to excess, [Luk 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md). The consequence
of Noah's sin was shame. Observe here the great evil of the sin of
drunkenness. It discovers men; what infirmities they have, they betray
when they are drunk; and secrets are then easily got out of them.
Drunken porters keep open gates. It disgraces men, and exposes them to
contempt. As it shows them, so it shames them. Men say and do that when
drunken, which, when sober, they would blush to think of. Notice the
care of Shem and Japheth to cover their father's shame. There is a
mantle of love to be thrown over the faults of all, [Pe1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008.md). Beside that, there is a robe of
reverence to be thrown over the faults of parents and other superiors.
The blessing of God attends on those who honour their parents, and his
curse lights especially on those who dishonour them.

[Genesis 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 9:24</span></span>

Noah declares a curse on Canaan, the son of Ham; perhaps this grandson
of his was more guilty than the rest. A servant of servants, that is,
The meanest and most despicable servant, shall he be, even to his
brethren. This certainly points at the victories in after-times obtained
by Israel over the Canaanites, by which they were put to the sword, or
brought to pay tribute. The whole continent of Africa was peopled mostly
by the descendants of Ham; and for how many ages have the better parts
of that country lain under the dominion of the Romans, then of the
Saracens, and now of the Turks! In what wickedness, ignorance,
barbarity, slavery, and misery most of the inhabitants live! And of the
poor Negroes, how many every year are sold and bought, like beasts in
the market, and conveyed from one quarter of the world to do the work of
beasts in another! But this in no way excuses the covetousness and
barbarity of those who enrich themselves with the product of their sweat
and blood. God has not commanded us to enslave Negroes; and, without
doubt, he will severely punish all such cruel wrongs. The fulfilment of
this prophecy, which contains almost a history of the world, frees Noah
from the suspicion of having uttered it from personal anger. It fully
proves that the Holy Spirit took occasion from Ham's offence to reveal
his secret purposes. "Blessed be the Lord God of Shem." The church
should be built up and continued in the posterity of Shem; of him came
the Jews, who were, for a great while, the only professing people God
had in the world. Christ, who was the Lord God, in his human nature
should descend from Shem; for of him, as concerning the flesh, Christ
came. Noah also blesses Japheth, and, in him, the isles of the gentiles
that were peopled by his seed. It speaks of the conversion of the
gentiles, and the bringing of them into the church. We may read it, "God
shall persuade Japheth, and being persuaded, he shall dwell in the tents
of Shem." Jews and gentiles shall be united together in the gospel fold;
both shall be one in Christ. Noah lived to see two worlds; but being an
heir of the righteousness which is by faith, he now rests in hope,
waiting to see a better than either.
