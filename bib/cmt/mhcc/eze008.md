### [Ezekiel Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 8:0</span></span>

([Eze 8:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001)) The idolatries committed
by the Jewish rulers.

([Eze 8:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007)) The superstitions to
which the Jews were then devoted, the Egyptian.

([Eze 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#013), [Eze
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014)) The Phoenician.

([Eze 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#015), [Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016)) The Persian.

([Eze 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017), [Eze
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018)) The heinousness of their sin.

[Ezekiel 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 8:1</span></span>

The glorious personage Ezekiel beheld in vision, seemed to take hold
upon him, and he was conveyed in spirit to Jerusalem. There, in the
inner court of the temple, was prepared a place for some base idol. The
whole was presented in vision to the prophet. If it should please God to
give any man a clear view of his glory and majesty, and of all the
abominations committing in any one city, he would then admit the justice
of the severest punishments God should inflict thereon.

[Ezekiel 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 8:7</span></span>

A secret place was, as it were, opened, where the prophet saw creatures
painted on the walls, and a number of the elders of Israel worshipped
before them. No superiority in worldly matters will preserve men from
lust, or idolatries, when they are left to their own deceitful hearts;
and those who are soon wearied in the service of God, often grudge no
toil nor expense when following their superstitions. When hypocrites
screen themselves behind the wall of an outward profession, there is
some hole or other left in the wall, something that betrays them to
those who look diligently. There is a great deal of secret wickedness in
the world. They think themselves out of God's sight. But those are ripe
indeed for ruin, who lay the blame of their sins upon the Lord.

[Ezekiel 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 8:13</span></span>

The yearly lamenting for Tammuz was attended with infamous practices;
and the worshippers of the sun here described, are supposed to have been
priests. The Lord appeals to the prophet concerning the heinousness of
the crime; "and lo, they put the branch to their nose," denoting some
custom used by idolaters in honour of the idols they served. The more we
examine human nature and our own hearts, the more abominations we shall
discover; and the longer the believer searches himself, the more he will
humble himself before God, and the more will he value the fountain open
for sin, and seek to wash therein.
