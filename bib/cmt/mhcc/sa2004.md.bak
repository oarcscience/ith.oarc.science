### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 4:0</span></span>

([Sa2 4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001).md) Ishbosheth murdered.

([Sa2 4:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008).md) David puts to death the
murderers.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 4:1</span></span>

See how Ishbosheth was murdered! When those difficulties dispirit us,
which should sharpen our endeavours, we betray both our heavenly crowns
and our earthly lives. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty and
ruin. The idle soul is an easy prey to the destroyer. We know not when
and where death will meet us. When we lie down to sleep, we are not sure
that we may not sleep the sleep of death before we awake; nor do we know
from what hand the death-blow may come.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 4:8</span></span>

A person may be glad to obtain his just wishes, and yet really regret
the means by which he receives them. He may be sorry for the death of a
person by which he is a gainer. These men shed innocent blood, from the
basest motives. David justly executed vengeance upon them. He would not
be beholden to any to help him by unlawful practices. God had helped him
over many a difficulty, and through many a danger, therefore he depended
upon him to crown and complete his own work. He speaks of his redemption
from all adversity, as a thing done; though he had many storms yet
before him, he knew that He who had delivered, would deliver.
