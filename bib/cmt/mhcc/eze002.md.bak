### [Ezekiel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 2:0</span></span>

([Eze 2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001).md) The prophet is directed
what he is to do.

([Eze 2:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006).md) And encouraged to be
resolute, faithful, and devoted.

[Ezekiel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 2:1</span></span>

Lest Ezekiel should be lifted up with the abundance of the revelations,
he is put in mind that still he is a son of man, a weak, mortal
creature. As Christ usually called himself the Son of man, it was also
an honourable distinction. Ezekiel's posture showed reverence, but his
standing up would be a posture of greater readiness and fitness for
business. God will speak to us, when we stand ready to do what he
commands us. As Ezekiel had not strength of his own, the Spirit entered
into him. God is graciously pleased to work in us whatever he requires
of us. The Holy Spirit sets us upon our feet, by inclining our wills to
our duty. Thus, when the Lord calls upon the sinner to awake, and attend
to the concerns of his soul, the Spirit of life and grace comes with the
call. Ezekiel is sent with a message to the children of Israel. Many
might treat his message with contempt, yet they should know by the event
that a prophet had been sent to them. God will be glorified, and his
word made honourable, whether it be a savour of life unto life, or of
death unto death.

[Ezekiel 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 2:6</span></span>

Those who will do any thing to purpose in the service of God, must not
fear men. Wicked men are as briers and thorns; but they are nigh unto
cursing, and their end is to be burned. The prophet must be faithful to
the souls of those to whom he was sent. All who speak from God to
others, must obey his voice. The discoveries of sin, and the warnings of
wrath, should be matter of lamentation. And those acquainted with the
word of God, will clearly perceive it is filled with woe to impenitent
sinners; and that all the precious promises of the gospel are for the
repenting, believing servants of the Lord.
