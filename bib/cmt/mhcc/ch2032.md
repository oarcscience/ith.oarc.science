### [2 Chronicles Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 32:0</span></span>

(v. 1-23) The invasion of Sennacherib, His defeat.

([Ch2 32:24-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024)) Hezekiah's sickness,
His prosperous reign, and death.

[2 Chronicles 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 32:1</span></span>

Those who trust God with their safety, must use proper means, else they
tempt him. God will provide, but so must we also. Hezekiah gathered his
people together, and spake comfortably to them. A believing confidence
in God, will raise us above the prevailing fear of man. Let the good
subjects and soldiers of Jesus Christ, rest upon his word, and boldly
say, Since God is for us, who can be against us? By the favour of God,
enemies are lost, and friends gained.

[2 Chronicles 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 32:24</span></span>

God left Hezekiah to himself, that, by this trial and his weakness in
it, what was in his heart might be known; that he was not so perfect in
grace as he thought he was. It is good for us to know ourselves, and our
own weakness and sinfulness, that we may not be conceited, or
self-confident, but may always live in dependence upon Divine grace. We
know not the corruption of our own hearts, nor what we shall do if God
leaves us to ourselves. His sin was, that his heart was lifted up. What
need have great men, and good men, and useful men, to study their own
infirmities and follies, and their obligations to free grace, that they
may never think highly of themselves; but beg earnestly of God, that he
will always keep them humble! Hezekiah made a bad return to God for his
favours, by making even those favours the food and fuel of his pride.
Let us shun the occasions of sin: let us avoid the company, the
amusements, the books, yea, the very sights that may administer to sin.
Let us commit ourselves continually to God's care and protection; and
beg of him never to leave us nor forsake us. Blessed be God, death will
soon end the believer's conflict; then pride and every sin will be
abolished. He will no more be tempted to withhold the praise which
belongs to the God of his salvation.
