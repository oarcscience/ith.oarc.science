### [Ezekiel Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 37:0</span></span>

([Eze 37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)) God restores dried
bones to life.

([Eze 37:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015)) The whole house of
Israel is represented as enjoying the blessings of Christ's kingdom.

[Ezekiel 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 37:1</span></span>

No created power could restore human bones to life. God alone could
cause them to live. Skin and flesh covered them, and the wind was then
told to blow upon these bodies; and they were restored to life. The wind
was an emblem of the Spirit of God, and represented his quickening
powers. The vision was to encourage the desponding Jews; to predict both
their restoration after the captivity, and also their recovery from
their present and long-continued dispersion. It was also a clear
intimation of the resurrection of the dead; and it represents the power
and grace of God, in the conversion of the most hopeless sinners to
himself. Let us look to Him who will at last open our graves, and bring
us forth to judgment, that He may now deliver us from sin, and put his
Spirit within us, and keep us by his power, through faith, unto
salvation.

[Ezekiel 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 37:15</span></span>

This emblem was to show the people, that the Lord would unite Judah and
Israel. Christ is the true David, Israel's King of old; and those whom
he makes willing in the day of his power, he makes to walk in his
judgments, and to keep his statutes. Events yet to come will further
explain this prophecy. Nothing has more hindered the success of the
gospel than divisions. Let us study to keep the unity of the Spirit in
the bond of peace; let us seek for Divine grace to keep us from
detestable things; and let us pray that all nations may be obedient and
happy subjects of the Son of David, that the Lord may be our God, and we
may be his people for evermore.
