### [Psalms Chapter 150](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 150:0</span></span>

A psalm of praise.

[Psalms 150:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 150:1</span></span>

We are here stirred up to praise God. Praise God for his sanctuary, and
the privileges we enjoy by having it among us; praise him because of his
power and glory in the firmament. Those who praise the Lord in heaven,
behold displays of his power and glory which we cannot now conceive. But
the greatest of all his mighty acts is known in his earthly sanctuary.
The holiness and the love of our God are more displayed in man's
redemption, than in all his other works. Let us praise our God and
Saviour for it. We need not care to know what instruments of music are
mentioned. Hereby is meant that in serving God we should spare no cost
or pains. Praise God with strong faith; praise him with holy love and
delight; praise him with entire confidence in Christ; praise him with
believing triumph over the powers of darkness; praise him by universal
respect to all his commands; praise him by cheerful submission to all
his disposals; praise him by rejoicing in his love, and comforting
ourselves in his goodness; praise him by promoting the interests of the
kingdom of his grace; praise him by lively hope and expectation of the
kingdom of his glory. Since we must shortly breathe our last, while we
have breath let us praise the Lord; then we shall breathe our last with
comfort. Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the
Lord. Such is the very suitable end of a book inspired by the Spirit of
God, written for the work of praise; a book which has supplied the songs
of the church for more than three thousand years; a book which is quoted
more frequently than any other by Christ and his apostles; a book which
presents the loftiest ideas of God and his government, which is fitted
to every state of human life, which sets forth every state of religious
experience, and which bears simple and clear marks of its Divine origin.
