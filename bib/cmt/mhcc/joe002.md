### [Joel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md)

[Joel](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joe 2:0</span></span>

([Joe 2:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001).md) God's judgments.

([Joe 2:15-27](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015).md) Exhortations to fasting
and prayer; blessings promised.

([Joe 2:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028).md) A promise of the Holy
Spirit, and of future mercies.

[Joel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 2:1</span></span>

The priests were to alarm the people with the near approach of the
Divine judgments. It is the work of ministers to warn of the fatal
consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven against the
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking description which
follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, but may
also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by the
Chaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offending
nations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverance from
the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especially be,
to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seek to be
weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now make idols
of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame, fasting,
weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned into tears for
the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would be vain, except
their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence; by sorrow for
their sins, and separation from them. There is no question but that if
we truly repent of our sins, God will forgive them; but whether he will
remove affliction is not promised, yet the probability of it should
encourage us to repent.

[Joel 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joe 2:15</span></span>

The priests and rulers are to appoint a solemn fast. The sinner's
supplication is, Spare us, good Lord. God is ready to succour his
people; and he waits to be gracious. They prayed that God would spare
them, and he answered them. His promises are real answers to the prayers
of faith; with him saying and doing are not two things. Some understand
these promises figuratively, as pointing to gospel grace, and as
fulfilled in the abundant comforts treasured up for believers in the
covenant of grace.

[Joel 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joe 2:28</span></span>

The promise began to be fulfilled on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy
Spirit was poured out, and it was continued in the converting grace and
miraculous gifts conferred on both Jews and Gentiles. The judgments of
God upon a sinful world, only go before the judgment of the world in the
last day. Calling on God supposes knowledge of him, faith in him, desire
toward him, dependence on him, and, as evidence of the sincerity of all
this, conscientious obedience to him. Those only shall be delivered in
the great day, who are now effectually called from sin to God, from self
to Christ, from things below to things above.
