### [Job Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 12:0</span></span>

([Job 12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#001).md) Job reproves his
friends.

([Job 12:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006).md) The wicked often
prosper.

([Job 12:12-25](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012).md) Job speaks of the
wisdom and power of God.

[Job 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 12:1</span></span>

Job upbraids his friends with the good opinion they had of their own
wisdom compared with his. We are apt to call reproofs reproaches, and to
think ourselves mocked when advised and admonished; this is our folly;
yet here was colour for this charge. He suspected the true cause of
their conduct to be, that they despised him who was fallen into poverty.
It is the way of the world. Even the just, upright man, if he comes
under a cloud, is looked upon with contempt.

[Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 12:6</span></span>

Job appeals to facts. The most audacious robbers, oppressors, and
impious wretches, often prosper. Yet this is not by fortune or chance;
the Lord orders these things. Worldly prosperity is of small value in
his sight: he has better things for his children. Job resolves all into
the absolute proprietorship which God has in all the creatures. He
demands from his friends liberty to judge of what they had said; he
appeals to any fair judgment.

[Job 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 12:12</span></span>

This is a noble discourse of Job concerning the wisdom, power, and
sovereignty of God, in ordering all the affairs of the children of men,
according to the counsel of His own will, which none can resist. It were
well if wise and good men, who differ about lesser things, would see how
it is for their honour and comfort, and the good of others, to dwell
most upon the great things in which they agree. Here are no complaints,
or reflections. He gives many instances of God's powerful management of
the children of men, overruling all their counsels, and overcoming all
their oppositions. Having all strength and wisdom, God knows how to make
use, even of those who are foolish and bad; otherwise there is so little
wisdom and so little honesty in the world, that all had been in
confusion and ruin long ago. These important truths were suited to
convince the disputants that they were out of their depth in attempting
to assign the Lord's reasons for afflicting Job; his ways are
unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out. Let us remark what
beautiful illustrations there are in the word of God, confirming his
sovereignty, and wisdom in that sovereignty: but the highest and
infinitely the most important is, that the Lord Jesus was crucified by
the malice of the Jews; and who but the Lord could have known that this
one event was the salvation of the world?
