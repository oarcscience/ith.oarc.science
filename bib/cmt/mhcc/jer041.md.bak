### [Jeremiah Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 41:0</span></span>

([Jer 41:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001).md) Ishmael murders
Gedaliah.

([Jer 41:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#011).md) Johanan recovers the
captives, and purposes to retire to Egypt.

[Jeremiah 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 41:1</span></span>

Those who hate the worshippers of God, often put on the appearance of
piety, that they may the easier hurt them. As death often meets men
where they least expect it, we should continually search whether we are
in such a state and frame of mind, as we would wish to be found in when
called to appear before our Judge. Sometimes the ransom of a man's life
is his riches. But those who think to bribe death, saying, Slay us not,
for we have treasures in the field, will find themselves wretchedly
deceived. This melancholy history warns us, never to be secure in this
world. We never can be sure of peace on this side heaven.

[Jeremiah 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 41:11</span></span>

The success of villany must be short, and none can prosper who harden
their hearts against God. And those justly lose comfort in real fears,
who excuse themselves in sin by pretended fears. The removal of a
prudent and peaceable ruler, and the succession of another who is rash
and ambitious, affects the welfare of many. Only those are happy and
steady who fear the Lord and walk in his ways.
