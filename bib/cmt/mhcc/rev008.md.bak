[Revelation 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001.md)

The seventh seal is opened. There was profound silence in heaven for a
space; all was quiet in the church, for whenever the church on earth
cries through oppression, that cry reaches up to heaven; or it is a
silence of expectation. Trumpets were given to the angels, who were to
sound them. The Lord Jesus is the High Priest of the church, having a
golden censer, and much incense, fulness of merit in his own glorious
person. Would that men studied to know the fulness that is in Christ,
and endeavoured to be acquainted with his excellency. Would that they
were truly persuaded that Christ has such an office as that of
Intercessor, which he now performs with deep sympathy. No prayers, thus
recommended, was ever denied hearing and acceptance. These prayers, thus
accepted in heaven, produced great changes upon earth. The Christian
worship and religion, pure and heavenly in its origin and nature, when
sent down to earth and conflicting with the passions and worldly
projects of sinful men, produced remarkable tumults, here set forth in
prophetical language, as our Lord himself declared, [Luk
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md).

[Revelation 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 8:7</span></span>

The first angel sounded the first trumpet, and there followed hail and
fire mingled with blood. A storm of heresies, a mixture of dreadful
errors falling on the church, or a tempest of destruction. The second
angel sounded, and a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into
the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood. By this mountain
some understand leaders of the persecutions; others, Rome sacked by the
Goths and Vandals, with great slaughter and cruelty. The third angel
sounded, and there fell a star from heaven. Some take this to be an
eminent governor; others take it to be some person in power who
corrupted the churches of Christ. The doctrines of the gospel, the
springs of spiritual life, comfort, and vigour, to the souls of men, are
corrupted and made bitter by the mixture of dangerous errors, so that
the souls of men find ruin where they sought refreshment. The fourth
angel sounded, and darkness fell upon the great lights of heaven, that
give light to the world, the sun, and the moon, and the stars. The
guides and governors are placed higher than the people, and are to
dispense light, and kind influences to them. Where the gospel comes to a
people, and has not proper effects on their hearts and lives, it is
followed with dreadful judgments. God gives alarm by the written word,
by ministers, by men's own consciences, and by the signs of the times;
so that if people are surprised, it is their own fault. The anger of God
makes all comforts bitter, and even life itself burdensome. But God, in
this world, sets bounds to the most terrible judgments. Corruption of
doctrine and worship in the church are great judgments, and also are the
usual causes and tokens of other judgments coming on a people. Before
the other three trumpets were sounded, there was solemn warning how
terrible the calamities would be that should follow. If lesser judgments
do not take effect the church and the world must expect greater; and
when God comes to punish the world, the inhabitants shall tremble before
him. Let sinners take warning to flee from the wrath to come; let
believers learn to value and to be thankful for their privileges; and
let them patiently continue in well doing.
