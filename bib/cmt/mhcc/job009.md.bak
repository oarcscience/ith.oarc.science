### [Job Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 9:0</span></span>

([Job 9:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#001).md) Job acknowledges God's
justice.

([Job 9:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#014).md) He is not able to
contend with God.

([Job 9:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022).md) Men not to be judged by
outward condition.

([Job 9:25-35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#025).md) Job complains of
troubles.

[Job 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 9:1</span></span>

In this answer Job declared that he did not doubt the justice of God,
when he denied himself to be a hypocrite; for how should man be just
with God? Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could be
counted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could not
justify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actions
of his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his present
sufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgets
his complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because we
know not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which no
creature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to help
others, will not be able to help themselves against it.

[Job 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 9:14</span></span>

Job is still righteous in his own eyes, [Job
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001.md), and this answer, though it sets
forth the power and majesty of God, implies that the question between
the afflicted and the Lord of providence, is a question of might, and
not of right; and we begin to discover the evil fruits of pride and of a
self-righteous spirit. Job begins to manifest a disposition to condemn
God, that he may justify himself, for which he is afterwards reproved.
Still Job knew so much of himself, that he durst not stand a trial. If
we say, We have no sin, we not only deceive ourselves, but we affront
God; for we sin in saying so, and give the lie to the Scripture. But Job
reflected on God's goodness and justice in saying his affliction was
without cause.

[Job 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 9:22</span></span>

Job touches briefly upon the main point now in dispute. His friends
maintained that those who are righteous and good, always prosper in this
world, and that none but the wicked are in misery and distress: he said,
on the contrary, that it is a common thing for the wicked to prosper,
and the righteous to be greatly afflicted. Yet there is too much passion
in what Job here says, for God doth not afflict willingly. When the
spirit is heated with dispute or with discontent, we have need to set a
watch before our lips.

[Job 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 9:25</span></span>

What little need have we of pastimes, and what great need to redeem
time, when it runs on so fast towards eternity! How vain the enjoyments
of time, which we may quite lose while yet time continues! The
remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so will
not the remembrance of having got worldly wealth, when it is all lost
and gone. Job's complaint of God, as one that could not be appeased and
would not relent, was the language of his corruption. There is a
Mediator, a Daysman, or Umpire, for us, even God's own beloved Son, who
has purchased peace for us with the blood of his cross, who is able to
save to the uttermost all who come unto God through him. If we trust in
his name, our sins will be buried in the depths of the sea, we shall be
washed from all our filthiness, and made whiter than snow, so that none
can lay any thing to our charge. We shall be clothed with the robes of
righteousness and salvation, adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit,
and presented faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
joy. May we learn the difference between justifying ourselves, and being
thus justified by God himself. Let the tempest-tossed soul consider Job,
and notice that others have passed this dreadful gulf; and though they
found it hard to believe that God would hear or deliver them, yet he
rebuked the storm, and brought them to the desired haven. Resist the
devil; give not place to hard thoughts of God, or desperate conclusions
about thyself. Come to Him who invites the weary and heavy laden; who
promises in nowise to cast them out.
