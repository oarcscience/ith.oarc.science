### [Ezekiel Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 14:0</span></span>

([Eze 14:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001).md) Threatenings against
hypocrites.

([Eze 14:12-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#012).md) God's purpose to
punish the guilty Jews, but a few should be saved.

[Ezekiel 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 14:1</span></span>

No outward form or reformation can be acceptable to God, so long as any
idol possesses the heart; yet how many prefer their own devices and
their own righteousness, to the way of salvation! Men's corruptions are
idols in their hearts, and are of their own setting up; God will let
them take their course. Sin renders the sinner odious in the eyes of the
pure and holy God; and in his own eyes also, whenever conscience is
awakened. Let us seek to be cleansed from the guilt and pollution of
sins, in that fountain which the Lord has opened.

[Ezekiel 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 14:12</span></span>

National sins bring national judgments. Though sinners escape one
judgment, another is waiting for them. When God's professing people
rebel against him, they may justly expect all his judgments. The faith,
obedience, and prayers of Noah prevailed to the saving of his house, but
not of the old world. Job's sacrifice and prayer in behalf of his
friends were accepted, and Daniel had prevailed for the saving his
companions and the wise men of Babylon. But a people that had filled the
measure of their sins, was not to expect to escape for the sake of any
righteous men living among them; not even of the most eminent saints,
who could be accepted in their own case only through the sufferings and
righteousness of Christ. Yet even when God makes the greatest
desolations by his judgments, he saves some to be monuments of his
mercy. In firm belief that we shall approve the whole of God's dealings
with ourselves, and with all mankind, let us silence all rebellious
murmurs and objections.
