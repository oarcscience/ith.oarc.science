[Exodus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 26:1</span></span>

God manifested his presence among the Israelites in a tabernacle or
tent, because of their condition in the wilderness. God suits the tokens
of his favour, and the gifts of his grace, to his people's state and
wants. The curtains of the tabernacle were to be very rich. They were to
be embroidered with cherubim, signifying that the angels of God pitch
their tents round about the church, [Psa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md).

[Exodus 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 26:7</span></span>

The curtains of meaner materials, being made both longer and broader,
covered the others, and were defended by coverings of skins. The whole
represents the person and doctrine of Christ, and the church of true
Christians, and all heavenly things, which outwardly are mean, but
inwardly, and in the sight of God, are glorious and precious.

[Exodus 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 26:15</span></span>

The sockets of silver each weighed about 115 pounds; they were placed in
rows on the ground. In every pair of these sockets, a strong board of
shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortises and
tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the west end.
The wall was further held together by bars, which passed through rings
of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, it was
strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it was a
type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md), [Eph
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021.md).

[Exodus 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 26:31</span></span>

A vail, or curtain, separated the holy place from the most holy place.
It was hung upon pillars. This vail was for a partition between the holy
place and the most holy; which forbade any to look into the holiest of
all. The apostle tells what was the meaning of this vail, [Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008.md). That the ceremonial law could not
make the comers thereunto perfect, nor would the observance of it bring
men to heaven; the way into the holiest of all was not made manifest,
while the first tabernacle was standing. Life and immortality lay hidden
till they were brought to light by the gospel; which was signified by
the rending of this vail at the death of Christ, [Mat
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md). We have now boldness to enter
into the holiest, in all acts of worship, by the blood of Jesus; yet
such as obliges us to holy reverence. Another vail was for the outer
door of the tabernacle. This vail was all the defence the tabernacle
had. God takes care of his church on earth. A curtain shall be, if God
please to make it so, as strong a defence to his house, as gates of
brass and bars of iron. With this typical description of Christ and his
church before us, what is our judgment of these matters? Do we see any
glory in the person of Christ? any excellence in his character? any
thing precious in his salvation? or any wisdom in the doctrine of the
cross? Will our religion bear examination? and are we more careful to
approve our hearts to God than our characters toward men?
