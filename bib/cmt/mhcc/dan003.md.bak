### [Daniel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 3:0</span></span>

([Dan 3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001).md) Nebuchadnezzar's golden
image.

([Dan 3:8-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#008).md) Shadrach and his
companions refuse to worship it.

([Dan 3:19-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#019).md) They are cast into a
furnace, but are miraculously preserved.

([Dan 3:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028).md) Nebuchadnezzar gives
glory to Jehovah.

[Daniel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 3:1</span></span>

In the height of the image, about thirty yards, probably is included a
pedestal, and most likely it was only covered with plates of gold, not a
solid mass of that precious metal. Pride and bigotry cause men to
require their subjects to follow their religion, whether right or wrong,
and when worldly interest allures, and punishment overawes, few refuse.
This is easy to the careless, the sensual, and the infidel, who are the
greatest number; and most will go their ways. There is nothing so bad
which the careless world will not be drawn to by a concert of music, or
driven to by a fiery furnace. By such methods, false worship has been
set up and maintained.

[Daniel 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 3:8</span></span>

True devotion calms the spirit, quiets and softens it, but superstition
and devotion to false gods inflame men's passions. The matter is put
into a little compass, Turn, or burn. Proud men are still ready to say,
as Nebuchadnezzar, Who is the Lord, that I should fear his power?
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did not hesitate whether they should
comply or not. Life or death were not to be considered. Those that would
avoid sin, must not parley with temptation when that to which we are
allured or affrighted is manifestly evil. Stand not to pause about it,
but say, as Christ did, Get thee behind me, Satan. They did not contrive
an evasive answer, when a direct answer was expected. Those who make
their duty their main care, need not be anxious or fearful concerning
the event. The faithful servants of God find him able to control and
overrule all the powers armed against them. Lord, if thou wilt, thou
canst. If He be for us, we need not fear what man can do unto us. God
will deliver us, either from death or in death. They must obey God
rather than man; they must rather suffer than sin; and must not do evil
that good may come. Therefore none of these things moved them. The
saving them from sinful compliance, was as great a miracle in the
kingdom of grace, as the saving them out of the fiery furnace was in the
kingdom of nature. Fear of man and love of the world, especially want of
faith, make men yield to temptation, while a firm persuasion of the
truth will deliver them from denying Christ, or being ashamed of him. We
are to be meek in our replies, but we must be decided that we will obey
God rather than man.

[Daniel 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 3:19</span></span>

Let Nebuchadnezzar heat his furnace as hot as he can, a few minutes will
finish the torment of those cast into it; but hell-fire tortures, and
yet does not kill. Those who worshipped the beast and his image, have no
rest, no pause, no moment free from pain, [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md), [Rev
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011.md). Now was fulfilled in the letter
that great promise, [Isa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002.md), When
thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned. Leaving it to
that God who preserved them in the fire, to bring them out, they walked
up and down in the midst, supported and encouraged by the presence of
the Son of God. Those who suffer for Christ, have his presence in their
sufferings, even in the fiery furnace, and in the valley of the shadow
of death. Nebuchadnezzar owns them for servants of the most high God; a
God able to deliver them out of his hand. It is our God only is the
consuming fire, [Heb 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029.md). Could we
but see into the eternal world, we should behold the persecuted believer
safe from the malice of his foes, while they are exposed to the wrath of
God, and tormented in unquenchable fires.

[Daniel 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 3:28</span></span>

What God did for these his servants, would help to keep the Jews to
their religion while in captivity, and to cure them of idolatry. The
miracle brought deep convictions on Nebuchadnezzar. But no abiding
change then took place in his conduct. He who preserved these pious Jews
in the fiery furnace, is able to uphold us in the hour of temptation,
and to keep us from falling into sin.
