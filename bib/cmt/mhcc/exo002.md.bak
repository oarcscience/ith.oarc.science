### [Exodus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 2:0</span></span>

([Exo 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#001).md) Moses is born, and
exposed on the river.

([Exo 2:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005).md) He is found, and brought
up by Pharaoh's daughter.

([Exo 2:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#011).md) Moses slays an
Egyptian, and flees to Midian.

([Exo 2:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016).md) Moses marries the
daughter of Jethro.

([Exo 2:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023).md) God hears the
Israelites.

[Exodus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 2:1</span></span>

Observe the order of Providence: just at the time when Pharaoh's cruelty
rose to its height by ordering the Hebrew children to be drowned, the
deliverer was born. When men are contriving the ruin of the church, God
is preparing for its salvation. The parents of Moses saw he was a goodly
child. A lively faith can take encouragement from the least hint of the
Divine favour. It is said, [Heb 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023.md),
that the parents of Moses hid him by faith; they had the promise that
Israel should be preserved, which they relied upon. Faith in God's
promise quickens to the use of lawful means for obtaining mercy. Duty is
ours, events are God's. Faith in God will set us above the fear of man.
At three months' end, when they could not hide the infant any longer,
they put him in an ark of bulrushes by the river's brink, and set his
sister to watch. And if the weak affection of a mother were thus
careful, what shall we think of Him, whose love, whose compassion is, as
himself, boundless. Moses never had a stronger protection about him, no,
not when all the Israelites were round his tent in the wilderness, than
now, when he lay alone, a helpless babe upon the waves. No water, no
Egyptian can hurt him. When we seem most neglected and forlorn, God is
most present with us.

[Exodus 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 2:5</span></span>

Come, see the place where that great man, Moses, lay, when he was a
little child; it was in a bulrush basket by the river's side. Had he
been left there long, he must have perished. But Providence brings
Pharaoh's daughter to the place where this poor forlorn infant lay, and
inclines her heart to pity it, which she dares do, when none else durst.
God's care of us in our infancy ought to be often mentioned by us to his
praise. Pharaoh cruelly sought to destroy Israel, but his own daughter
had pity on a Hebrew child, and not only so, but, without knowing it,
preserved Israel's deliverer, and provided Moses with a good nurse, even
his own mother. That he should have a Hebrew nurse, the sister of Moses
brought the mother into the place of a nurse. Moses was treated as the
son of Pharaoh's daughter. Many who, by their birth, are obscure and
poor, by surprising events of Providence, are raised high in the world,
to make men know that God rules.

[Exodus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 2:11</span></span>

Moses boldly owned the cause of God's people. It is plain from Hebrews
11. that this was done in faith, with the full purpose of leaving the
honours, wealth, and pleasures of his rank among the Egyptians. By the
grace of God he was a partaker of faith in Christ, which overcomes the
world. He was willing, not only to risk all, but to suffer for his sake;
being assured that Israel were the people of God. By special warrant
from Heaven, which makes no rule for other cases, Moses slew an
Egyptian, and rescued an oppressed Israelites. Also, he tried to end a
dispute between two Hebrews. The reproof Moses gave, may still be of
use. May we not apply it to disputants, who, by their fierce debates,
divide and weaken the Christian church? They forget that they are
brethren. He that did wrong quarreled with Moses. It is a sign of guilt
to be angry at reproof. Men know not what they do, nor what enemies they
are to themselves, when they resist and despise faithful reproofs and
reprovers. Moses might have said, if this be the spirit of the Hebrews,
I will go to court again, and be the son of Pharaoh's daughter. But we
must take heed of being set against the ways and people of God, by the
follies and peevishness of some persons that profess religion. Moses was
obliged to flee into the land of Midian. God ordered this for wise and
holy ends.

[Exodus 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 2:16</span></span>

Moses found shelter in Midian. He was ready to help Reuel's daughters to
water their flocks, although bred in learning and at court. Moses loved
to be doing justice, and to act in defence of such as he saw injured,
which every man ought to do, as far as it is in his power. He loved to
be doing good; wherever the providence of God casts us, we should desire
and try to be useful; and when we cannot do the good we would, we must
be ready to do the good we can. Moses commended himself to the prince of
Midian; who married one of his daughters to Moses, by whom he had a son,
called Gershom, "a stranger there," that he might keep in remembrance
the land in which he had been a stranger.

[Exodus 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 2:23</span></span>

The Israelites' bondage in Egypt continued, though the murdering of
their infants did not continue. Sometimes the Lord suffers the rod of
the wicked to lie very long and very heavy on the lot of the righteous.
At last they began to think of God under their troubles. It is a sign
that the Lord is coming towards us with deliverance, when he inclines
and enables us to cry to him for it. God heard their groaning; he made
it to appear that he took notice of their complaints. He remembered his
covenant, of which he is ever mindful. He considered this, and not any
merit of theirs. He looked upon the children of Israel. Moses looked
upon them, and pitied them; but now God looked upon them, and helped
them. He had respect unto them. His eyes are now fixed upon Israel, to
show himself in their behalf. God is ever thus, a very present help in
trouble. Take courage then, ye who, conscious of guilt and thralldom,
are looking to Him for deliverance. God in Christ Jesus is also looking
upon you. A call of love is joined with a promise of the Redeemer. Come
unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest, [Mat 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md).
