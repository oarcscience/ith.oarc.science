### [Joshua Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 23:0</span></span>

([Jos 23:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001).md) Joshua's exhortation
before his death.

([Jos 23:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#011).md) Joshua warns the
people of idolatry.

[Joshua 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 23:1</span></span>

Joshua was old and dying, let them observe what he said now. He put them
in mind of the great things God had done for them in his days. He
exhorted them to be very courageous. Keep with care, do with diligence,
and regard with sincerity what is written. Also, very cautiously to
endeavour that the heathen idolatry may be forgotten, so that it may
never be revived. It is sad that among Christians the names of the
heathen gods are so commonly used, and made so familiar as they are.
Joshua exhorts them to be very constant. There might be many things
amiss among them, but they had not forsaken the Lord their God; the way
to make people better, is to make the best of them.

[Joshua 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 23:11</span></span>

Would we cleave to the Lord, we must always stand upon our guard, for
many a soul is lost through carelessness. Love the Lord your God, and
you will not leave him. Has God been thus true to you? Be not you false
to him. He is faithful that has promised, [Heb
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023.md). The experience of every
Christian witnesses the same truth. Conflicts may have been severe and
long, trials great and many; but at the last he will acknowledge that
goodness and mercy followed him all the days of his life. Joshua states
the fatal consequences of going back; know for a certainty it will be
your ruin. The first step would be, friendship with idolaters; the next
would be, marrying with them; the end of that would be, serving their
gods. Thus the way of sin is down-hill, and those who have fellowship
with sinners, cannot avoid having fellowship with sin. He describes the
destruction he warns them of. The goodness of the heavenly Canaan, and
the free and sure grant God has made of it, will add to the misery of
those who shall for ever be shut out from it. Nothing will make them see
how wretched they are, so much, as to see how happy they might have
been. Let us watch and pray against temptation. Let us trust in God's
faithfulness, love, and power; let us plead his promises, and cleave to
his commandments, then we shall be happy in life, in death, and for
ever.
