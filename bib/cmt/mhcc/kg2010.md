### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 10:0</span></span>

([Kg2 10:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001).md) Ahab's sons and
Ahaziah's brethren put to death.

([Kg2 10:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015).md) Jehu destroys the
worshippers of Baal.

([Kg2 10:29-36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#029).md) Jehu follows
Jeroboam's sins.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 10:1</span></span>

In the most awful events, though attended by the basest crimes of man,
the truth and justice of God are to be noticed; and he never did nor can
command any thing unjust or unreasonable. Jehu destroyed all that
remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his
wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind,
when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think
upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of
everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been
considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer
is, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek for happiness
from that which is the cause of all misery?

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 10:15</span></span>

Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put to
ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men,
but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in
the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves
itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at
the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked
any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters
were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out
of Israel. May we desire that it be rooted out of our hearts.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 10:29</span></span>

It is justly questionable whether Jehu acted from a good principle, and
whether he did not take some false steps in doing it; yet no services
done for God shall go unrewarded. But true conversion is not only from
gross sin, but from all sin; not only from false gods, but from false
worships. True conversion is not only from wasteful sins, but from
gainful sins; not only from sins which hurt our worldly interests, but
from those that support and befriend them; in forsaking which is the
great trial whether we can deny ourselves and trust God. Jehu showed
great care and zeal for rooting out a false religion, but in the true
religion he cared not, took no heed to please God and do his duty. Those
that are heedless, it is to be feared, are graceless. The people were
also careless, therefore it is not strange that in those days the Lord
began to cut Israel short. They were short in their duty to God,
therefore God cut them short in their extent, wealth, and power.
