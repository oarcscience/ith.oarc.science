### [Isaiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 45:0</span></span>

([Isa 45:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md) The deliverance of the
Jews by Cyrus.

([Isa 45:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005).md) God calls for obedience
to his almighty power.

([Isa 45:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011).md) The settlement of his
people.

([Isa 45:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020).md) The conversion of the
Gentiles.

[Isaiah 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 45:1</span></span>

Cyrus is called God's anointed; he was designed and qualified for his
great service by the counsel of God. The gates of Babylon which led to
the river, were left open the night that Cyrus marched his army into the
empty channel. The Lord went before him, giving entrance to the cities
he besieged. He gave him also treasures, which had been hidden in secret
places. The true God was to Cyrus an unknown God; yet God foreknew him;
he called him by his name. The exact fulfilment of this must have shown
Cyrus that Jehovah was the only true God, and that it was for the sake
of Israel that he was prospered. In all the changes of states and
kingdoms, God works out the good of his church.

[Isaiah 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 45:5</span></span>

There is no God beside Jehovah. There is nothing done without him. He
makes peace, put here for all good; and creates evil, not the evil of
sin, but the evil of punishment. He is the Author of all that is true,
holy, good, or happy; and evil, error, and misery, came into the world
by his permission, through the wilful apostacy of his creatures, but are
restrained and overruled to his righteous purpose. This doctrine is
applied, for the comfort of those that earnestly longed, yet quietly
waited, for the redemption of Israel. The redemption of sinners by the
Son of God, and the pouring out the Spirit, to give success to the
gospel, are chiefly here intended. We must not expect salvation without
righteousness; together the Lord hath created them. Let not oppressors
oppose God's designs for his people. Let not the poor oppressed murmur,
as if God dealt unkindly with them. Men are but earthen pots; they are
broken potsherds, and are very much made so by mutual contentions. To
contend with Him is as senseless as for clay to find fault with the
potter. Let us turn God's promises into prayers, beseeching him that
salvation may abound among us, and let us rest assured that the Judge of
all the earth will do right.

[Isaiah 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 45:11</span></span>

Believers may ask in prayer for what they need; if for their good, it
will not be withheld. But how common to hear God called to account for
his dealings with man! Cyrus provided for the returning Jews. Those
redeemed by Christ shall be provided for. The restoration would convince
many, and convert some; and all that truly join the Lord, find his
service perfect freedom. Though God be his people's God and Saviour, yet
sometimes he lays them under his frowns; but let them wait upon the Lord
who hides his face. There is a world without end; and it will be well or
ill with us, according as it shall be with us in that world. The Lord we
serve and trust, is God alone. All that God has said is plain,
satisfactory, and just. As God in his word calls us to seek him, so he
never denied believing prayers, nor disappointed believing expectations.
He gives grace sufficient, and comfort and satisfaction of soul.

[Isaiah 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 45:20</span></span>

The nations are exhorted to draw near to Jehovah. None besides is able
to help; he is the Saviour, who can save without the assistance of any,
but without whom none can save. If the heart is brought into the
obedience of Christ, the knee will cheerfully obey his commands. To
Christ men shall come from every nation for blessings; all that hate his
cause shall be put to shame, and all believers shall rejoice in him as
their Friend and Portion. All must come to him: may we now come to him
as the Lord our Righteousness, walking according to his commandments.
