### [Romans Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 13:0</span></span>

([Rom 13:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001).md) The duty of subjection
to governors.

([Rom 13:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008).md) Exhortations to mutual
love.

([Rom 13:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011).md) To temperance and
sobriety.

[Romans 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 13:1</span></span>

The grace of the gospel teaches us submission and quiet, where pride and
the carnal mind only see causes for murmuring and discontent. Whatever
the persons in authority over us themselves may be, yet the just power
they have, must be submitted to and obeyed. In the general course of
human affairs, rulers are not a terror to honest, quiet, and good
subjects, but to evil-doers. Such is the power of sin and corruption,
that many will be kept back from crimes only by the fear of punishment.
Thou hast the benefit of the government, therefore do what thou canst to
preserve it, and nothing to disturb it. This directs private persons to
behave quietly and peaceably where God has set them, [Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md), [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md). Christians must not use any trick
or fraud. All smuggling, dealing in contraband goods, withholding or
evading duties, is rebellion against the express command of God. Thus
honest neighbours are robbed, who will have to pay the more; and the
crimes of smugglers, and others who join with them, are abetted. It is
painful that some professors of the gospel should countenance such
dishonest practices. The lesson here taught it becomes all Christians to
learn and practise, that the godly in the land will always be found the
quiet and the peaceable in the land, whatever others are.

[Romans 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 13:8</span></span>

Christians must avoid useless expense, and be careful not to contract
any debts they have not the power to discharge. They are also to stand
aloof from all venturesome speculations and rash engagements, and
whatever may expose them to the danger of not rendering to all their
due. Do not keep in any one's debt. Give every one his own. Do not spend
that on yourselves, which you owe to others. But many who are very
sensible of the trouble, think little of the sin, of being in debt. Love
to others includes all the duties of the second table. The last five of
the ten commandments are all summed up in this royal law, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself; with the same sincerity that thou lovest
thyself, though not in the same measure and degree. He that loves his
neighbour as himself, will desire the welfare of his neighbour. On this
is built that golden rule, of doing as we would be done by. Love is a
living, active principle of obedience to the whole law. Let us not only
avoid injuries to the persons, connexions, property, and characters of
men; but do no kind or degree of evil to any man, and study to be useful
in every station of life.

[Romans 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 13:11</span></span>

Four things are here taught, as a Christian's directory for his day's
work. When to awake; Now; and to awake out of the sleep of carnal
security, sloth, and negligence; out of the sleep of spiritual death,
and out of the sleep of spiritual deadness. Considering the time; a busy
time; a perilous time. Also the salvation nigh at hand. Let us mind our
way, and mend our pace, we are nearer our journey's end. Also to make
ourselves ready. The night is far spent, the day is at hand; therefore
it is time to dress ourselves. Observe what we must put off; clothes
worn in the night. Cast off the sinful works of darkness. Observe what
we must put on; how we should dress our souls. Put on the armour of
light. A Christian must reckon himself undressed, if unarmed. The graces
of the Spirit are this armour, to secure the soul from Satan's
temptations, and the assaults of this present evil world. Put on Christ;
that includes all. Put on righteousness of Christ, for justification.
Put on the Spirit and grace of Christ, for sanctification. The Lord
Jesus Christ must be put on as Lord to rule you as Jesus to save you;
and in both, as Christ anointed and appointed by the Father to this
ruling, saving work. And how to walk. When we are up and ready, we are
not to sit still, but to appear abroad; let us walk. Christianity
teaches us how to walk so as to please God, who ever sees us. Walk
honestly as in the day; avoiding the works of darkness. Where there are
riot and drunkenness, there usually are chambering and wantonness, and
strife and envy. Solomon puts these all together, [Pro
23:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#029.md). See what provision to make.
Our great care must be to provide for our souls: but must we take no
care about our bodies? Yes; but two things are forbidden. Perplexing
ourselves with anxious, encumbering care; and indulging ourselves in
irregular desires. Natural wants are to be answered, but evil appetites
must be checked and denied. To ask meat for our necessities, is our
duty, we are taught to pray for daily bread; but to ask meat for our
lusts, is provoking God, [Psa 78:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#018.md).
