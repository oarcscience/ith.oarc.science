### [Nehemiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 7:0</span></span>

([Neh 7:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001).md) The city committed to
Hananiah.

(v. 5-73) Register of those that first returned.

[Nehemiah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 7:1</span></span>

Nehemiah, having finished the wall, returned to the Persian court, and
came to Jerusalem again with a new commission. The public safety depends
on every one's care to guard himself and his family against sin.

[Nehemiah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 7:5</span></span>

Nehemiah knew that the safety of a city, under God, depends more upon
the inhabitants than upon its walls. Every good gift and every good work
are from above. God gives knowledge, he gives grace; all is of him, and
therefore all must be to him. What is done by human prudence, must be
ascribed to the direction of Divine Providence. But woe to those who
turn back from the Lord, loving this present world! and happy those who
dedicate themselves, and their substance, to his service and glory!
