### [Ruth Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001.md)

[Ruth](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rut 2:0</span></span>

([Rut 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001).md) Ruth gleans in the field
of Boaz.

([Rut 2:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#004).md) The kindness of Boaz to
Ruth.

([Rut 2:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#017).md) Ruth returns to her
mother-in-law.

[Ruth 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 2:1</span></span>

Observe Ruth's humility. When Providence had made her poor, she
cheerfully stoops to her lot. High spirits will rather starve than
stoop; not so Ruth. Nay, it is her own proposal. She speaks humbly in
her expectation of leave to glean. We may not demand kindness as a debt,
but ask, and take it as a favour, though in a small matter. Ruth also
was an example of industry. She loved not to eat the bread of idleness.
This is an example to young people. Diligence promises well, both for
this world and the other. We must not be shy of any honest employment.
No labour is a reproach. Sin is a thing below us, but we must not think
any thing else so, to which Providence call us. She was an example of
regard to her mother, and of trust in Providence. God wisely orders what
seem to us small events; and those that appear altogether uncertain,
still are directed to serve his own glory, and the good of his people.

[Ruth 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 2:4</span></span>

The pious and kind language between Boaz and his reapers shows that
there were godly persons in Israel. Such language as this is seldom
heard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral and
corrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land,
from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conduct
of Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behave
aright in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters and
faithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion will
cause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It had
these effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed for
them. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as some
ill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returned his
courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is such good-will
as this between masters and servants. They expressed their kindness to
each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquired concerning the
stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated. Masters must take
care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but that they suffer not
their servants and those under them to do wrong. Ruth humbly owned
herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born and brought up a
heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly of ourselves, esteeming
others better than ourselves. And let us, in the kindness of Boaz to
Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ to poor sinners.

[Ruth 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rut 2:17</span></span>

It encourages industry, that in all labour, even that of gleaning, there
is profit. Ruth was pleased with what she gained by her own industry,
and was careful to secure it. Let us thus take care that we lose not
those things which we have wrought, which we have gained for our souls'
good, [Jo2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008.md). Parents should examine
their children, as Naomi did, not to frighten or discourage them, so as
to make them hate home, or tempt them to tell a lie; but to commend them
if they have done well, and with mildness to reprove and caution them if
they have done otherwise. It is a good question for us to ask ourselves
every night, Where have I gleaned to-day? What improvement have I made
in knowledge and grace? What have I done that will turn to a good
account? When the Lord deals bountifully with us, let us not be found in
any other field, nor seeking for happiness and satisfaction in the
creature. We lose Divine favours, if we slight them. Ruth dutifully
observed her mother's directions. And when the harvest was ended, she
kept her aged mother company at home. Dinah went out to see the
daughters of the land; her vanity ended in disgrace, Genesis 34. Ruth
kept at home, and helped to maintain her mother, and went out on no
other errand than to get provision for her; her humility and industry
ended in preferment.
