### [Jeremiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 24:0</span></span>

Good and bad figs represent the Jews in captivity, and those who remain
in their own land.

[Jeremiah 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 24:1</span></span>

The prophet saw two baskets of figs set before the temple, as offerings
of first-fruits. The figs in one basket were very good, those in the
other basket very bad. What creature viler than a wicked man? and what
more valuable than a godly man? This vision was to raise the spirits of
those gone into captivity, by assuring them of a happy return; and to
humble and awaken the proud and secure spirits of those yet in
Jerusalem, by assuring them of a miserable captivity. The good figs
represents the pious captives. We cannot determine as to God's love or
hatred by what is before us. Early suffering sometimes proves for the
best. The sooner the child is corrected, the better effect the
correction is likely to have. Even this captivity was for their good;
and God's intentions never are in vain. By afflictions they were
convinced of sin, humbled under the hand of God, weaned from the world,
taught to pray, and turned from sins, particularly from idolatry. God
promises that he will own them in captivity. The Lord will own those who
are his, in all conditions. God assures them of his protection in
trouble, and a glorious deliverance in due time. When our troubles are
sanctified to us, we may be sure that they will end well. They shall
return to him with their whole heart. Thus they should have liberty to
own him for their God, to pray to him, and expect blessings from him.
The bad figs were Zedekiah and those of his party yet in the land. These
should be removed for their hurt, and forsaken of all mankind. God has
many judgments, and those that escape one, may expect another, till they
are brought to repent. Doubtless, this prophecy had its fulfilment in
that age; but the Spirit of prophecy may here look forward to the
dispersion of the unbelieving Jews, in all the nations of the earth. Let
those who desire blessings from the Lord, beg that he will give them a
heart to know him.
