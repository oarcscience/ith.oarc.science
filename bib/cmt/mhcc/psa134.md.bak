### [Psalms Chapter 134](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 134:0</span></span>

An exhortation to bless the Lord.

[Psalms 134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 134:1</span></span>

We must stir up ourselves to give glory to God, and encourage ourselves
to hope for mercy and grace from him. It is an excellent plan to fill up
all our spare minutes with pious meditations, and prayers and praises.
No time would then be a burden, nor should we murder our hours by
trifling conversation and vain amusements, or by carnal indulgences. We
need desire no more to make us happy, than to be blessed of the Lord. We
ought to beg spiritual blessings, not only for ourselves, but for
others; not only, The Lord bless me, but, The Lord bless thee; thus
testifying our belief that there is enough for others as well as for us,
and showing our good will to others.
