[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 0:0</span></span>

This book is so called from Job, whose prosperity, afflictions, and
restoration, are here recorded. He lived soon after Abraham, or perhaps
before that patriarch. Most likely it was written by Job himself, and it
is the most ancient book in existence. The instructions to be learned
from the patience of Job, and from his trials, are as useful now, and as
much needed as ever. We live under the same Providence, we have the same
chastening Father, and there is the same need for correction unto
righteousness. The fortitude and patience of Job, though not small, gave
way in his severe troubles; but his faith was fixed upon the coming of
his Redeemer, and this gave him stedfastness and constancy, though every
other dependence, particularly the pride and boast of a self-righteous
spirit, was tried and consumed. Another great doctrine of the faith,
particularly set forth in the book of Job, is that of Providence. It is
plain, from this history, that the Lord watched over his servant Job
with the affection of a wise and loving father.
