### [Isaiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 25:0</span></span>

([Isa 25:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001).md) A song of praise.

([Isa 25:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006).md) A declaration of the
gospel blessings.

([Isa 25:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009).md) The destruction of the
enemies of Christ's church.

[Isaiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 25:1</span></span>

However this might show the deliverance of the Jews out of captivity, it
looked further, to the praises that should be offered up to God for
Christ's victories over our spiritual enemies, and the comforts he has
provided for all believers. True faith simply credits the Lord's
testimony, and relies on his truth to perform his promises. As God
weakens the strong who are proud and secure, so he strengthens the weak
that are humble, and stay themselves upon him. God protects his people
in all weathers. The Lord shelters those who trust in him from the
insolence of oppressors. Their insolence is but the noise of strangers;
it is like the heat of the sun scorching in the middle of the day; but
where is it when the sun is set? The Lord ever was, and ever will be,
the Refuge of distressed believers. Having provided them a shelter, he
teaches them to flee unto it.

[Isaiah 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 25:6</span></span>

The kind reception of repentant sinners, is often in the New Testament
likened to a feast. The guests invited are all people, Gentiles as well
as Jews. There is that in the gospel which strengthens and makes glad
the heart, and is fit for those who are under convictions of sin, and
mourning for it. There is a veil spread over all nations, for all sat in
darkness. But this veil the Lord will destroy, by the light of his
gospel shining in the world, and the power of his Spirit opening men's
eyes to receive it. He will raise those to spiritual life who were long
dead in trespasses and sins. Christ will himself, in his resurrection,
triumph over death. Grief shall be banished; there shall be perfect and
endless joy. Those that mourn for sin shall be comforted. Those who
suffer for Christ shall have consolations. But in the joys of heaven,
and not short of them, will fully be brought to pass this saying, God
shall wipe away all tears. The hope of this should now do away
over-sorrow, all weeping that hinders sowing. Sometimes, in this world
God takes away the reproach of his people from among men; however, it
will be done fully at the great day. Let us patiently bear sorrow and
shame now; both will be done away shortly.

[Isaiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 25:9</span></span>

With joy and praise will those entertain the glad tidings of the
Redeemer, who looked for him; and with a triumphant song will glorified
saints enter into the joy of their Lord. And it is not in vain to wait
for him; for the mercy comes at last, with abundant recompence for the
delay. The hands once stretched out upon the cross, to make way for our
salvation, will at length be stretched forth to destroy all impenitent
sinners. Moab is here put for all adversaries of God's people; they
shall all be trodden down or threshed. God shall bring down the pride of
the enemies by one humbling judgment after another. This destruction of
Moab is typical of Christ's victory, and the pulling down of Satan's
strong holds. Therefore, beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable,
always abounding in the work of the Lord; for your labour is not in vain
in the Lord.
