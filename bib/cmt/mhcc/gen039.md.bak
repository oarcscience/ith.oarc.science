### [Genesis Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 39:0</span></span>

([Gen 39:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001).md) Joseph preferred by
Potiphar.

([Gen 39:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007).md) Joseph resists
temptation.

([Gen 39:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#013).md) Joseph is falsely
accused by his mistress.

([Gen 39:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#019).md) He is cast into
prison, God is with him there.

[Genesis 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 39:1</span></span>

Our enemies may strip us of outward distinctions and ornaments; but
wisdom and grace cannot be taken from us. They may separate us from
friends, relatives, and country; but they cannot take from us the
presence of the Lord. They may shut us from outward blessings, rob us of
liberty, and confine us in dungeons; but they cannot shut us out from
communion with God, from the throne of grace, or take from us the
blessings of salvation. Joseph was blessed, wonderfully blessed, even in
the house where he was a slave. God's presence with us, makes all we do
prosperous. Good men are the blessings of the place where they live;
good servants may be so, though mean and lightly esteemed. The
prosperity of the wicked is, one way or other, for the sake of the
godly. Here was a wicked family blessed for the sake of one good servant
in it.

[Genesis 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 39:7</span></span>

Beauty either in men or women, often proves a snare both to themselves
and others. This forbids pride in it, and requires constant watchfulness
against the temptation that attends it. We have great need to make a
covenant with our eyes, lest the eyes infect the heart. When lust has
got power, decency, and reputation, and conscience, are all sacrificed.
Potiphar's wife showed that her heart was fully set to do evil. Satan,
when he found he could not overcome Joseph with the troubles and the
frowns of the world, for in them he still held fast his principle,
assaulted him with pleasures, which have ruined more than the former.
But Joseph, by the grace of God, was enabled to resist and overcome this
temptation; and his escape was as great an instance of the Divine power,
as the deliverance of the three children out of the fiery furnace. This
sin was one which might most easily beset him. The tempter was his
mistress, one whose favour would help him forward; and it was at his
utmost peril if he slighted her, and made her his enemy. The time and
place favoured the temptation. To all this was added frequent, constant
urging. The almighty grace of God enabled Joseph to overcome this
assault of the enemy. He urges what he owed both to God and his master.
We are bound in honour, as well as justice and gratitude, not in any
thing to wrong those who place trust in us, how secretly soever it may
be done. He would not offend his God. Three arguments Joseph urges upon
himself. 1. He considers who he was that was tempted. One in covenant
with God, who professed religion and relation to him. 2. What the sin
was to which he was tempted. Others might look upon it as a small
matter; but Joseph did not so think of it. Call sin by its own name, and
never lessen it. Let sins of this nature always be looked upon as great
wickedness, as exceedingly sinful. 3. Against whom he was tempted to
sin, against God. Sin is against God, against his nature and his
dominion, against his love and his design. Those that love God, for this
reason hate sin. The grace of God enabled Joseph to overcome the
temptation, by avoiding the temper. He would not stay to parley with the
temptation, but fled from it, as escaping for his life. If we mean not
to do iniquity, let us flee as a bird from the snare, and as a roe from
the hunter.

[Genesis 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 39:13</span></span>

Joseph's mistress, having tried in vain to make him a guilty man,
endeavoured to be avenged on him. Those that have broken the bonds of
modesty, will never be held by the bonds of truth. It is no new thing
for the best of men to be falsely accused of the worst of crimes, by
those who themselves are the worst of criminals. It is well there is a
day of discovery coming, in which all shall appear in their true
characters.

[Genesis 39:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 39:19</span></span>

Joseph's master believed the accusation. Potiphar, it is likely, chose
that prison, because it was the worst; but God designed to open the way
to Joseph's honour. Joseph was owned and righted by his God. He was away
from all his friends and relations; he had none to help or comfort him;
but the Lord was with Joseph, and showed him mercy. Those that have a
good conscience in a prison, have a good God there. God gave him favour
in the sight of the keeper of the prison; he trusted him to manage the
affairs of the prison. A good man will do good wherever he is, and will
be a blessing even in bonds and banishment. Let us not forget, through
Joseph, to look unto Jesus, who suffered being tempted, yet without sin;
who was slandered, and persecuted, and imprisoned, but without cause;
who by the cross ascended to the throne. May we be enabled to follow the
same path in submitting and in suffering, to the same place of glory.
