### [Micah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 4:0</span></span>

([Mic 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001).md) The peace of the kingdom
of Christ.

([Mic 4:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009).md) The judgments to come
upon Jerusalem, but the final triumph of Israel.

[Micah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 4:1</span></span>

The nations have not yet so submitted to the Prince of Peace, as to beat
their swords into ploughshares, nor has war ceased. But very precious
promises these are, relating to the gospel church, which will be more
and more fulfilled, for He is faithful that has promised. There shall be
a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the last days, in the
days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon a rock. The
Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spoken of, the
people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and delight
in doing his will. The word "halteth," describes those who walk not
according to the Divine word. The collecting the captives from Babylon
was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering the church; and the
reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by the everlasting kingdom
of heaven. Let us stir up each other to attend the ordinances of God,
that we may learn his holy ways, and walk in them, receiving the law
from his hands, which, being written in our hearts by his Spirit, may
show our interest in the Redeemer's righteousness.

[Micah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 4:9</span></span>

Many nations would assemble against Zion to rejoice in her calamities.
They would not understand that the Lord had collected them as sheaves
are gathered to be threshed; and that Zion would be strengthened to beat
them to pieces. Nothing has yet taken place in the history of the Jewish
church agreeing with this prediction. When God has conquering work for
his people to do, he will furnish them with strength and ability for it.
Believers should cry aloud under distresses, with the prayer of faith,
not with despondency.
