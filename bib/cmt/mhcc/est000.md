[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

We find in this book, that even those Jews who were scattered in the
province of the heathen, were taken care of, and were wonderfully
preserved, when threatened with destruction. Though the name of God be
not in this book, the finger of God is shown by minute events for the
bringing about his people's deliverance. This history comes in between
Ezra chapters 6 and 7.
