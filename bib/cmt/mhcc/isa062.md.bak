### [Isaiah Chapter 62](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 62:0</span></span>

([Isa 62:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001).md) God's care of his church
and people.

([Isa 62:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006).md) The office of ministers
in preaching the gospel.

([Isa 62:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010).md) Every hinderance shall
be removed from the way of salvation.

[Isaiah 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 62:1</span></span>

The Son of God here assures his church of his unfailing love, and his
pleading for her under all trails and difficulties. She shall be called
by a new name, a pleasant name, such as she was never called by before.
The state of true religion in the world, before the preaching of the
gospel, no man seemed to have any real concern for. God, by his grace,
has wrought that in his church, which makes her his delight. Let us
thence learn motives to holiness. If the Lord rejoices over us, we
should rejoice in his service.

[Isaiah 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 62:6</span></span>

God's professing people must be a praying people. He is not displeased
with us for being earnest, as men commonly are; he bids us to cry after
him, and give him no rest, [Luk 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md),
[Luk 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#006.md). It is a sign that God is
coming to a people in mercy, when he pours out a spirit of prayer upon
them. See how uncertain our creature-comforts are. See also God's mercy
in giving plenty, and peace to enjoy it. Let us delight in attending the
courts of the Lord, that we may enjoy the consolations of his Spirit.

[Isaiah 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 62:10</span></span>

Way shall be made for Christ's salvation; all difficulties shall be
removed. He brings a reward of comfort and peace with him; but a work of
humiliation and reformation before him; and they shall be called, The
holy people, and, The redeemed of the Lord. Holiness puts honour and
beauty upon any place or person, makes them admired, beloved, and sought
after. Many events may have been part fulfilments of this, as earnests
of more glorious times yet to come. The close connexion between the
blessedness of the Jews and of the Gentiles, runs through the
Scriptures. The Lord Jesus will complete his work, and he never will
forsake one whom he has redeemed and sanctified.
