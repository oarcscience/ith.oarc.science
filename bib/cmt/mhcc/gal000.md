The churches in Galatia were formed partly of converted Jews, and partly
of Gentile converts, as was generally the case. St. Paul asserts his
apostolic character and the doctrines he taught, that he might confirm
the Galatian churches in the faith of Christ, especially with respect to
the important point of justification by faith alone. Thus the subject is
mainly the same as that which is discussed in the epistle to the Romans,
that is, justification by faith alone. In this epistle, however,
attention is particularly directed to the point, that men are justified
by faith without the works of the law of Moses. Of the importance of the
doctrines prominently set forth in this epistle, Luther thus speaks: "We
have to fear as the greatest and nearest danger, lest Satan take from us
this doctrine of faith, and bring into the church again the doctrine of
works and of men's traditions. Wherefore it is very necessary that this
doctrine be kept in continual practice and public exercise, both of
reading and hearing. If this doctrine be lost, then is also the doctrine
of truth, life and salvation, lost and gone."
