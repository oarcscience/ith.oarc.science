### [Jeremiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 20:0</span></span>

([Jer 20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001).md) The doom of Pashur, who
ill-treated the prophet.

([Jer 20:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007).md) Jeremiah complains of
hard usage.

([Jer 20:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014).md) He regrets his ever
having been born.

[Jeremiah 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 20:1</span></span>

Pashur smote Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks. Jeremiah was silent
till God put a word into his mouth. To confirm this, Pashur has a name
given him, "Fear on every side." It speaks a man not only in distress,
but in despair; not only in danger, but in fear on every side. The
wicked are in great fear where no fear is, for God can make the most
daring sinner a terror to himself. And those who will not hear of their
faults from God's prophets, shall be made to hear them from their
consciences. Miserable is the man thus made a terror to himself. His
friends shall fail him. God lets him live miserably, that he may be a
monument of Divine justice.

[Jeremiah 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 20:7</span></span>

The prophet complains of the insult and injury he experienced. But [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md) may be read, Thou hast persuaded
me, and I was persuaded. Thou wast stronger than I; and didst overpower
me by the influence of thy Spirit upon me. So long as we see ourselves
in the way of God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet
with difficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in
it. The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to his
business, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up.
Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God to whom
vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was he of the
comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under, and the
Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred up himself and
others to give God the glory. Let the people of God open their cause
before Him, and he will enable them to see deliverance.

[Jeremiah 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 20:14</span></span>

When grace has the victory, it is good to be ashamed of our folly, to
admire the goodness of God, and be warned to guard our spirits another
time. See how strong the temptation was, over which the prophet got the
victory by Divine assistance! He is angry that his first breath was not
his last. While we remember that these wishes are not recorded for us to
utter the like, we may learn good lessons from them. See how much those
who think they stand, ought to take heed lest they fall, and to pray
daily, Lead us not into temptation. How frail, changeable, and sinful is
man! How foolish and unnatural are the thoughts and wishes of our
hearts, when we yield to discontent! Let us consider Him who endured the
contradiction of sinners against himself, lest we should be at any time
weary and faint in our minds under our lesser trials.
