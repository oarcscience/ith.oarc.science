[Genesis 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 50:1</span></span>

Though pious relatives and friends have lived to a good old age, and we
are confident they are gone to glory, yet we may regret our own loss,
and pay respect to their memory by lamenting them. Grace does not
destroy, but it purifies, moderates, and regulates natural affection.
The departed soul is out of the reach of any tokens of our affection;
but it is proper to show respect to the body, of which we look for a
glorious and joyful resurrection, whatever may become of its remains in
this world. Thus Joseph showed his faith in God, and love to his father.
He ordered the body to be embalmed, or wrapped up with spices, to
preserve it. See how vile our bodies are, when the soul has forsaken
them; they will in a very little time become noisome, and offensive.

[Genesis 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 50:7</span></span>

Jacob's body was attended, not only by his own family, but by the great
men of Egypt. Now that they were better acquainted with the Hebrews,
they began to respect them. Professors of religion should endeavour by
wisdom and love to remove the prejudices many have against them.
Standers-by took notice of it as a grievous mourning. The death of good
men is a loss to any place, and ought to be greatly lamented.

[Genesis 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 50:15</span></span>

Various motives might cause the sons of Jacob to continue in Egypt,
notwithstanding the prophetic vision Abraham had of their bondage there.
Judging of Joseph from the general temper of human nature, they thought
he would now avenge himself on those who hated and injured him without
cause. Not being able to resist, or to flee away, they attempted to
soften him by humbling themselves. They pleaded with him as the servants
of Jacob's God. Joseph was much affected at seeing this complete
fulfilment of his dreams. He directs them not to fear him, but to fear
God; to humble themselves before the Lord, and to seek the Divine
forgiveness. He assures them of his own kindness to them. See what an
excellent spirit Joseph was of, and learn of him to render good for
evil. He comforted them, and, to banish all their fears, he spake kindly
to them. Broken spirits must be bound up and encouraged. Those we love
and forgive, we must not only do well for, but speak kindly to.

[Genesis 50:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 50:22</span></span>

Joseph having honoured his father, his days were long in the land,
which, for the present, God had given him. When he saw his death
approaching, he comforted his brethren with the assurance of their
return to Canaan in due time. We must comfort others with the same
comforts with which we have been comforted of God, and encourage them to
rest on the promises which are our support. For a confession of his own
faith, and a confirmation of theirs, he charges them to keep his remains
unburied till that glorious day, when they should be settled in the land
of promise. Thus Joseph, by faith in the doctrine of the resurrection,
and the promise of Canaan, gave commandment concerning his bones. This
would keep up their expectation of a speedy departure from Egypt, and
keep Canaan continually in their minds. This would also attach Joseph's
posterity to their brethren. The death, as well as the life of this
eminent saint, was truly excellent; both furnish us with strong
encouragement to persevere in the service of God. How happy to set our
early in the heavenly race, to continue stedfastly, and to finish the
course with joy! This Joseph did, this we also may do. Even when the
pains of death are upon us, if we have trusted in Him upon whom the
patriarchs, prophets, and apostles depended, we need not fear to say,
"My flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of my heart, and
my portion for ever."
