### [Ezekiel Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 31:0</span></span>

([Eze 31:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001).md) The glory of Assyria.

([Eze 31:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010).md) Its fall, and the like
for Egypt.

[Ezekiel 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 31:1</span></span>

The falls of others, both into sin and ruin, warn us not to be secure or
high-minded. The prophet is to show an instance of one whom the king of
Egypt resembled in greatness, the Assyrian, compared to a stately cedar.
Those who excel others, make themselves the objects of envy; but the
blessings of the heavenly paradise are not liable to such alloy. The
utmost security that any creature can give, is but like the shadow of a
tree, a scanty and slender protection. But let us flee to God for
protection, there we shall be safe. His hand must be owned in the rising
of the great men of the earth, and we must not envy them. Though worldly
people may seem to have firm prosperity, yet it only seems so.

[Ezekiel 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 31:10</span></span>

The king of Egypt resembled the king of Assyria in his greatness: here
we see he resembles him in his pride. And he shall resemble him in his
fall. His own sin brings his ruin. None of our comforts are ever lost,
but what have been a thousand times forfeited. When great men fall, many
fall with them, as many have fallen before them. The fall of proud men
is for warning to others, to keep them humble. See how low Pharaoh lies;
and see what all his pomp and pride are come to. It is best to be a
lowly tree of righteousness, yielding fruit to the glory of God, and to
the good of men. The wicked man is often seen flourishing like the
cedar, and spreading like the green bay tree, but he soon passes away,
and his place is no more found. Let us then mark the perfect man, and
behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.
