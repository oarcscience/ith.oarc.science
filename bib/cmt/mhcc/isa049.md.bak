### [Isaiah Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 49:0</span></span>

([Isa 49:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001).md) The unbelief and
rejection of the Jews.

([Isa 49:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007).md) Gracious promise to the
Gentiles.

([Isa 49:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013).md) God's love to the
church.

([Isa 49:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018).md) Its increase.

([Isa 49:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024).md) And deliverance.

[Isaiah 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 49:1</span></span>

The great Author of redemption shows the authority for his work. The
sword of his word slays the lusts of his people, and all at enmity with
them. His sharp arrows wound the conscience; but all these wounds will
be healed, when the sinner prays to him for mercy. But even the
Redeemer, who spake as never man spake in his personal ministry, often
seemed to labour in vain. And if Jacob will not be brought back to God,
and Israel will not be gathered, still Christ will be glorious. This
promise is in part fulfilled in the calling of the Gentiles. Men perish
in darkness. But Christ enlightens men, and so makes them holy and
happy.

[Isaiah 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 49:7</span></span>

The Father is the Lord, the Redeemer, and Holy One of Israel, as sending
the Son to be the Redeemer. Man, whom he came to save, put contempt upon
him. To this he submitted for our salvation. He is a pledge for all the
blessings of the covenant; in him God was reconciling the world to
himself. Pardoning mercy is a release from the curse of the law;
renewing grace is a release from the dominion of sin: both are from
Christ. He saith to those in darkness, Show yourselves. Not only see,
but be seen, to the glory of God, and your own comforts. Though there
are difficulties in the way to heaven, yet the grace of God will carry
us over them, and make even the mountains a way. This denotes the free
invitations and the encouraging promises of the gospel, and the
outpouring of the Spirit.

[Isaiah 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 49:13</span></span>

Let there be universal joy, for God will have mercy upon the afflicted,
because of his compassion; upon his afflicted, because of his covenant.
We have no more reason to question his promise and grace, than we have
to question his providence and justice. Be assured that God has a tender
affection for his church and people; he would not have them to be
discouraged. Some mothers do neglect their children; but God's
compassions to his people, infinitely exceed those of the tenderest
parents toward their children. His setting them as a mark on his hand,
or a seal upon his arm, denotes his being ever mindful of them. As far
as we have scriptural evidence that we belong to his ransomed flock, we
may be sure that he will never forsake us. Let us then give diligence to
make our calling and election sure, and rejoice in the hope and glory of
God.

[Isaiah 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 49:18</span></span>

Zion is addressed as an afflicted widow, bereaved of her children.
Numbers flock to her, and she is assured that they come to be a comfort
to her. There are times when the church is desolate and few in number;
yet its desolations shall not last for ever, and God will repair them.
God can raise up friends for returning Israelites, even among Gentiles.
They shall bring their children, and make them thy children. Let all
deal tenderly and carefully with young converts and beginners in
religion. Princes shall protect the church. It shall appear that God is
the sovereign Lord of all. And those who in the exercise of faith, hope,
and patience, wait on God for the fulfilment of his promises, shall
never be confounded.

[Isaiah 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 49:24</span></span>

We were lawful captives to the justice of God, yet delivered by a price
of unspeakable value. Here is an express promise: Even the prey of the
terrible shall be delivered. We may here view Satan deprived of his
prey, bound and cast into the pit; and all the powers that have combined
to enslave, persecute, or corrupt the church, are destroyed; that all
the earth may know that our Saviour and Redeemer is Jehovah, the mighty
One of Jacob. And every effort we make to rescue our fellow-sinners from
the bondage of Satan, is, in some degree, helping forward that great
change.
