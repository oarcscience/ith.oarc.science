### [Joshua Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 14:0</span></span>

([Jos 14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001)) The nine tribes and a
half to have their inheritance.

([Jos 14:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006)) Caleb obtains Hebron.

[Joshua 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 14:1</span></span>

The Israelites must occupy the new conquests. Canaan would have been
subdued in vain, if it had not been inhabited. Yet every man might not
go and settle where he pleased. God shall choose our inheritance for us.
Let us survey our heritage of present mercy, our prospect for the land
of promise, eternal in the heavens. Is God any respecter of persons? Is
it not better that our place, as to earthly good or sorrow, should be
determined by the infinite wisdom of our heavenly Father, than by our
own ignorance? Should not those for whom the great mystery of godliness
was exhibited, those whose redemption was purchased by Jesus Christ,
thankfully refer their earthly concerns to his appointment?

[Joshua 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 14:6</span></span>

Caleb's request is, "Give me this mountain," or Hebron, because it was
formerly in God's promise to him, and he would let Israel knows how much
he valued the promise. Those who live by faith value that which is given
by God's promise, far above what is given by his providence only. It was
now in the Anakims' possession, and Caleb would let Israel know how
little he feared the enemy, and that he would encourage them to push on
their conquests. Caleb answered to his name, which signifies "all
heart." Hebron was settled on Caleb and his heirs, because he wholly
followed the Lord God of Israel. Happy are we if we follow him. Singular
piety shall be crowned with singular favour.
