### [1 Corinthians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co1 5:0</span></span>

([Co1 5:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001).md) The apostle blames the
Corinthians for connivance at an incestuous person.

([Co1 5:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009).md) And directs their
behaviour towards those guilty of scandalous crimes.

[1 Corinthians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 5:1</span></span>

The apostle notices a flagrant abuse, winked at by the Corinthians.
Party spirit, and a false notion of Christian liberty, seem to have
saved the offender from censure. Grievous indeed is it that crimes
should sometimes be committed by professors of the gospel, of which even
heathens would be ashamed. Spiritual pride and false doctrines tend to
bring in, and to spread such scandals. How dreadful the effects of sin!
The devil reigns where Christ does not. And a man is in his kingdom, and
under his power, when not in Christ. The bad example of a man of
influence is very mischievous; it spreads far and wide. Corrupt
principles and examples, if not corrected, would hurt the whole church.
Believers must have new hearts, and lead new lives. Their common
conversation and religious deeds must be holy. So far is the sacrifice
of Christ our Passover for us, from rendering personal and public
holiness unnecessary, that it furnishes powerful reasons and motives for
it. Without holiness we can neither live by faith in him, nor join in
his ordinances with comfort and profit.

[1 Corinthians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 5:9</span></span>

Christians are to avoid familiar converse with all who disgrace the
Christian name. Such are only fit companions for their brethren in sin,
and to such company they should be left, whenever it is possible to do
so. Alas, that there are many called Christians, whose conversation is
more dangerous than that of heathens!
