### [Joshua Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 20:0</span></span>

([Jos 20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001).md) The law concerning the
cities of refuge.

([Jos 20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007).md) The cities appointed as
refuges.

[Joshua 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 20:1</span></span>

When the Israelites were settled in their promised inheritance, they
were reminded to set apart the cities of refuge, whose use and typical
meaning have been explained, Numbers 35; Deuteronomy 19. God's spiritual
Israel have, and shall have in Christ and heaven, not only rest to
repose in, but refuge to secure themselves in. These cities were
designed to typify the relief which the gospel provides for penitent
sinners, and their protection from the curse of the law and the wrath of
God, in our Lord Jesus, to whom believers flee for refuge, [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md).

[Joshua 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 20:7</span></span>

These cities, as those also on the other side Jordan, stood so that a
man might in half a day reach one of them from any part of the country.
God is ever a Refuge at hand. They were all Levites' cities. It was
kindness to the poor fugitive, that when he might not go up to the house
of the Lord, yet he had the servants of God with him, to instruct him,
and pray for him, and to help to make up the want of public ordinances.
Some observe a significance in the names of these cities with
application to Christ our Refuge. Kedesh signifies holy, and our Refuge
is the holy Jesus. Shechem, a shoulder, and the government is upon his
shoulder. Hebron, fellowship, and believers are called into the
fellowship of Christ Jesus our Lord. Bezer, a fortification, for he is a
strong hold to all those that trust in him. Ramoth, high or exalted, for
Him hath God exalted with his own right hand. Golan, joy or exultation,
for in Him all the saints are justified, and shall glory.
