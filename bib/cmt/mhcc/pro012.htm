<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#001">Proverbs 12:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 12:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Those who have grace, will delight in the instructions given them. Those that stifle their convictions, are like brutes. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002">Proverbs 12:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 12:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The man who covers selfish and vicious designs under a profession of religion or friendship, will be condemned. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#003">Proverbs 12:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 12:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Though men may advance themselves by sinful arts, they cannot settle and secure themselves. But those who by faith are rooted in Christ, are firmly fixed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004">Proverbs 12:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 12:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A wife who is pious, prudent, and looks well to the ways of her household, who makes conscience of her duty, and can bear crosses; such a one is an honour and comfort to her husband. She that is the reverse of this, preys upon him, and consumes him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#005">Proverbs 12:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 12:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thoughts are not free; they are under the Divine knowledge, therefore under the Divine command. It is a man's shame to act with deceit, with trick and design. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#006">Proverbs 12:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">pro 12:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Wicked people speak mischief to their neighbours. A man may sometimes do a good work with one good word. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#007">Proverbs 12:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 12:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>God's blessing is often continued to the families of godly men, while the wicked are overthrown. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#008">Proverbs 12:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">pro 12:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The apostles showed wisdom by glorying in shame for the name of Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#009">Proverbs 12:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">pro 12:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>He that lives in a humble state, who has no one to wait upon him, but gets bread by his own labour, is happier than he that glories in high birth or gay attire, and wants necessaries. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010">Proverbs 12:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 12:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A godly man would not put even an animal to needless pain. But the wicked often speak of others as well used, when they would not endure like treatment for a single day. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#011">Proverbs 12:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">pro 12:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It is men's wisdom to mind their business, and follow an honest calling. But it is folly to neglect business; and the grace of God teaches men to disdain nothing but sin. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#012">Proverbs 12:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">pro 12:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>When the ungodly see others prosper by sin, they wish they could act in the same way. But the root of Divine grace, in the heart of the righteous, produces other desires and purposes. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013">Proverbs 12:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">pro 12:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Many a man has paid dear in this world for the transgression of his lips. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014">Proverbs 12:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 12:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>When men use their tongues aright, to teach and comfort others, they enjoy acceptance through Christ Jesus; and the testimony of their conscience, that they in some measure answer the end of their being. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#015">Proverbs 12:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">pro 12:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A fool, in the sense of Scripture, means a wicked man, one who acts contrary to the wisdom that is from above. His rule is, to do what is right in his own eyes. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#016">Proverbs 12:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">pro 12:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#017">Proverbs 12:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">pro 12:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#018">Proverbs 12:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">pro 12:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#019">Proverbs 12:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">pro 12:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#020">Proverbs 12:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">pro 12:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#021">Proverbs 12:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">pro 12:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#022">Proverbs 12:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">pro 12:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023">Proverbs 12:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">pro 12:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#024">Proverbs 12:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">pro 12:24</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#025">Proverbs 12:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">pro 12:25</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#026">Proverbs 12:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">pro 12:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027">Proverbs 12:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">pro 12:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028">Proverbs 12:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">pro 12:28</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.
