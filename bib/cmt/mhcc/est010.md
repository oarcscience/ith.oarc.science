### [Esther Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 10:0</span></span>

Greatness of Ahasuerus-Mordecai's advancement.

[Esther 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 10:1</span></span>

Many instances of the grandeur of Ahasuerus might have been given: these
were written in the Persian chronicles, which are long since lost, while
the sacred writings will live till time shall be no more. The concerns
of the despised worshippers of the Lord are deemed more important by the
Holy Spirit, than the exploits of the most illustrious monarch on earth.
Mordecai was truly great, and his greatness gave him opportunities of
doing the more good. He did not disown his people the Jews, and no doubt
kept to the true religion. He did not seek his own wealth, but the
welfare of his people. Few have it in their power to do so much good as
Mordecai; but all have it in their power to do hurt, and who has it not
in his power to do some good? We are not required to do what is not in
our power, or is unsuited to our station; but all are bound to live
under the influence of the tempers displayed in the saints, whose
examples are recorded in the Bible. If we live by the faith of Christ,
we shall be active according to the ability and opportunities he gives
us, in promoting his glory and the best interests of men. If our faith
be genuine, it will work by love. Wait in faith and prayer, and the
event will be safe and glorious; our salvation is sure, through our Lord
Jesus Christ.
