### [Numbers Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 18:0</span></span>

([Num 18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001).md) The charge of the
priests and Levites.

([Num 18:8-19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008).md) The priests' portion.

([Num 18:20-32](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020).md) The Levites' portion.

[Numbers 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 18:1</span></span>

The people complained of their difficulty and peril in drawing near to
God. God here gives them to understand, that the priests should come
near for them. Aaron would see reason not to be proud of his preferment,
when he considered the great care and charge upon him. Be not
high-minded, but fear. The greater the trust of work and power that is
committed to us, the greater danger there is of betraying that trust.
This is a good reason why we should neither envy others' honours, nor
desire high places.

[Numbers 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 18:8</span></span>

All believers are spiritual priests, and God has promised to take care
of them. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is. And from the
provision here made for the priests, the apostle shows that it is the
duty of Christian churches to maintain their ministers. Scandalous
maintenance makes scandalous ministers. The priests were to be wholly
devoted to their ministry, not diverted from it, or disturbed in it, by
worldly care or business. Also, that they might be examples of living by
faith, not only in God's providence, but in his ordinances. The best
should be offered for the first-fruits unto the Lord. Those who think to
save, by putting God off with the refuse, deceive themselves, for God is
not mocked.

[Numbers 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 18:20</span></span>

As Israel was a people not to be numbered among the nations, so Levi was
a tribe to be distinguished from the rest. Those who have God for their
Inheritance and their Portion for ever, ought to look with holy contempt
and indifference upon the possessions of this world. The Levites were to
give God his dues out of their tithes, as well as the Israelites out of
their increase. See, in [Num 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#031.md),
the way to have comfort in all our worldly possessions, so as to bear no
sin by reason of them. 1. We must be sure that what we have is got
honestly and in the service of God. That meat is best eaten which is
first earned; but if any will not work, neither shall he eat, [Th2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010.md). 2. We must be sure that God has
his dues out of it. We have the comfort of our substance, when we have
honoured the Lord with it. Ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye
have heaved the best from it. We should give alms of such things as we
have, that all may be holy and comfortable to us.
