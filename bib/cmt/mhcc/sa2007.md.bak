### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 7:0</span></span>

([Sa2 7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001).md) David's care for the ark.

([Sa2 7:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004).md) God's covenant with
David.

([Sa2 7:18-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018).md) His prayer and
thanksgiving.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 7:1</span></span>

David being at rest in his palace, considered how he might best employ
his leisure and prosperity in the service of God. He formed a design to
build a temple for the ark. Nathan here did not speak as a prophet, but
as a godly man, encouraging David by his private judgment. We ought to
do all we can to encourage and promote the good purposes and designs of
others, and, as we have opportunity, to forward a good work.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 7:4</span></span>

Blessings are promised to the family and posterity of David. These
promises relate to Solomon, David's immediate successor, and the royal
line of Judah. But they also relate to Christ, who is often called David
and the Son of David. To him God gave all power in heaven and earth,
with authority to execute judgment. He was to build the gospel temple, a
house for God's name; the spiritual temple of true believers, to be a
habitation of God through the Spirit. The establishing of his house, his
throne, and his kingdom for ever, can be applied to no other than to
Christ and his kingdom: David's house and kingdom long since came to an
end. The committing iniquity cannot be applied to the Messiah himself,
but to his spiritual seed; true believers have infirmities, for which
they must expect to be corrected, though they are not cast off.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 7:18</span></span>

David's prayer is full of the breathings of devout affection toward God.
He had low thoughts of his own merits. All we have, must be looked upon
as Divine gifts. He speaks very highly and honourably of the Lord's
favours to him. Considering what the character and condition of man is,
we may be amazed that God should deal with him as he does. The promise
of Christ includes all; if the Lord God be ours, what more can we ask,
or think of? [Eph 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md). He knows us
better than we know ourselves; therefore let us be satisfied with what
he has done for us. What can we say more for ourselves in our prayers,
than God has said for us in his promises? David ascribes all to the free
grace of God. Both the great things He had done for him, and the great
things He had made known to him. All was for his word's sake, that is,
for the sake of Christ the eternal Word. Many, when they go to pray,
have their hearts to seek, but David's heart was found, that is, it was
fixed; gathered in from its wanderings, entirely engaged to the duty,
and employed in it. That prayer which is from the tongue only, will not
please God; it must be found in the heart; that must be lifted up and
poured out before God. He builds his faith, and hopes to speed, upon the
sureness of God's promise. David prays for the performance of the
promise. With God, saying and doing are not two things, as they often
are with men; God will do as he hath said. The promises of God are not
made to us by name, as to David, but they belong to all who believe in
Jesus Christ, and plead them in his name.
