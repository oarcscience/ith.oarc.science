[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 0:0</span></span>

The subject of this book may be thus stated by an enlargement on the
opening verses. 1. The Proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of
Israel. 2. Which treat of the knowledge of wisdom, of piety towards God,
of instruction and moral discipline, of the understanding wise and
prudent counsels. 3. Which treat of the attainment of instruction in
wisdom, which wisdom is to be shown in the conduct of life, and consists
in righteousness with regard to our fellow-creatures. 4. Which treat of
the giving to the simple sagacity to discover what is right, by
supplying them with just principles, and correct views of virtue and
vice; and to the young man knowledge, so that he need not err through
ignorance; and discretion, so that by pondering well these precepts, he
may not err through obstinacy. Take the proverbs of other nations, and
we shall find great numbers founded upon selfishness, cunning, pride,
injustice, national contempt, and animosities. The principles of the
Proverbs of Solomon are piety, charity, justice, benevolence, and true
prudence. Their universal purity proves that they are the word of God.
