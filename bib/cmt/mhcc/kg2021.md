### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 21:0</span></span>

([Kg2 21:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001)) Wicked reign of
Manasseh.

([Kg2 21:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010)) The prophetic
denunciations against Judah.

([Kg2 21:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#019)) Wicked reign and death
of Amon.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 21:1</span></span>

Young persons generally desire to become their own masters, and to have
early possession of riches and power. But this, for the most part, ruins
their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier
when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians,
till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are
less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much
wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to
anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed.
Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The
people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and
because it suited their depraved inclinations. In the reformation of
large bodies, numbers are mere time-servers, and in temptation fall
away.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 21:10</span></span>

Here is the doom of Judah and Jerusalem. The words used represent the
city emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, but
cleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken,
yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individual
believers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off any
professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will
desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of
Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to
despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dare to
persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when they
please. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious
sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 21:19</span></span>

Amon profaned God's house with his idols; and God suffered his house to
be polluted with his blood. How unrighteous soever they were that did
it, God was righteous who suffered it to be done. Now was a happy change
from one of the worst, to one of the best of the kings of Judah. Once
more Judah was tried with a reformation. Whether the Lord bears long
with presumptuous offenders, or speedily cuts them off in their sins,
all must perish who persist in refusing to walk in his ways.
