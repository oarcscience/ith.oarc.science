### [Psalms Chapter 136](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 136:0</span></span>

([Psa 136:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001).md) God to be praised as
the Creator of the world.

([Psa 136:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#010).md) As Israel's God and
Saviour.

([Psa 136:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023).md) For his blessings to
all.

[Psalms 136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 136:1</span></span>

Forgetful as we are, things must be often repeated to us. By "mercy" we
understand the Lord's disposition to save those whom sin has rendered
miserable and vile, and all the provision he has made for the redemption
of sinners by Jesus Christ. The counsels of this mercy have been from
everlasting, and the effects of it will endure for ever, to all who are
interested in it. The Lord continues equally ready to show mercy to all
who seek for it, and this is the source of all our hope and comfort.

[Psalms 136:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 136:10</span></span>

The great things God did for Israel, when he brought them out of Egypt,
were mercies which endured long to them; and our redemption by Christ,
which was typified thereby, endures for ever. It is good to enter into
the history of God's favours, and in each to observe, and own, that his
mercy endureth for ever. He put them in possession of a good land; it
was a figure of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[Psalms 136:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 136:23</span></span>

God's everlasting mercy is here praised for the redemption of his
church; in all his glories, and all his gifts. Blessed be God, who has
provided and made known to us salvation through his Son. May we know and
feel his redeeming power, that we may serve him in righteousness all our
days. May He who giveth food to all flesh, feed our souls unto eternal
life, and enliven our affections by his grace, that we may give thanks
and praise to his holy name, for his mercy endureth for ever. Let us
trace up all the favours we receive to this true source, and offer
praise continually.
