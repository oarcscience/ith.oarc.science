### [Psalms Chapter 74](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 74:0</span></span>

([Psa 74:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001).md) The desolations of the
sanctuary.

([Psa 74:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012).md) Pleas for encouraging
faith.

([Psa 74:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018).md) Petitions for
deliverances.

[Psalms 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 74:1</span></span>

This psalm appears to describe the destruction of Jerusalem and the
temple by the Chaldeans. The deplorable case of the people of God, at
the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the
great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of
Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much
more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom
Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may
silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they
will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long
time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants
may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers,
the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those
who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most
threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest
prayer.

[Psalms 74:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 74:12</span></span>

The church silences her own complaints. What God had done for his
people, as their King of old, encouraged them to depend on him. It was
the Lord's doing, none besides could do it. This providence was food to
faith and hope, to support and encourage in difficulties. The God of
Israel is the God of nature. He that is faithful to his covenant about
the day and the night, will never cast off those whom he has chosen. We
have as much reason to expect affliction, as to expect night and winter.
But we have no more reason to despair of the return of comfort, than to
despair of day and summer. And in the world above we shall have no more
changes.

[Psalms 74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 74:18</span></span>

The psalmist begs that God would appear for the church against their
enemies. The folly of such as revile his gospel and his servants will be
plain to all. Let us call upon our God to enlighten the dark nations of
the earth; and to rescue his people, that the poor and needy may praise
his name. Blessed Saviour, thou art the same yesterday, to-day, and for
ever. Make thy people more than conquerors. Be thou, Lord, all in all to
them in every situation and circumstances; for then thy poor and needy
people will praise thy name.
