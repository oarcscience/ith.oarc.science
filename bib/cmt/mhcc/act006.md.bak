### [Acts Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 6:0</span></span>

([Act 6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001).md) The appointment of
deacons.

([Act 6:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008).md) Stephen falsely accused
of blasphemy.

[Acts 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 6:1</span></span>

Hitherto the disciples had been of one accord; this often had been
noticed to their honour; but now they were multiplied, they began to
murmur. The word of God was enough to take up all the thoughts, cares,
and time of the apostles. The persons chosen to serve tables must be
duly qualified. They must be filled with gifts and graces of the Holy
Ghost, necessary to rightly managing this trust; men of truth, and
hating covetousness. All who are employed in the service of the church,
ought to be commended to the Divine grace by the prayers of the church.
They blessed them in the name of the Lord. The word and grace of God are
greatly magnified, when those are wrought upon by it, who were least
likely.

[Acts 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 6:8</span></span>

When they could not answer Stephen's arguments as a disputant, they
prosecuted him as a criminal, and brought false witnesses against him.
And it is next to a miracle of providence, that no greater number of
religious persons have been murdered in the world, by the way of perjury
and pretence of law, when so many thousands hate them, who make no
conscience of false oaths. Wisdom and holiness make a man's face to
shine, yet will not secure men from being treated badly. What shall we
say of man, a rational being, yet attempting to uphold a religious
system by false witness and murder! And this has been done in numberless
instances. But the blame rests not so much upon the understanding, as
upon the heart of a fallen creature, which is deceitful above all things
and desperately wicked. Yet the servant of the Lord, possessing a clear
conscience, cheerful hope, and Divine consolations, may smile in the
midst of danger and death.
