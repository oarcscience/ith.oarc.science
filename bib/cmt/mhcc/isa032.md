### [Isaiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 32:0</span></span>

([Isa 32:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001)) Times of peace and
happiness.

([Isa 32:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009)) An interval of trouble,
yet comfort and blessings in the end.

[Isaiah 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 32:1</span></span>

Christ our righteous King, and his true disciples, are evidently here
intended. The consolations and graces of his Spirit are as rivers of
water in this dry land; and as the overhanging rock affords refreshing
shade and shelter to the weary traveller in the desert, so his power,
truth, and love, yield the believer the only real protection and
refreshment in the weary land through which he journeys to heaven.
Christ bore the storm himself, to keep it off from us. To him let the
trembling sinner flee for refuge; for he alone can protect and refresh
us in every trial. See what pains sinners take in sin; they labour at
it, their hearts are intent upon it, and with art they work iniquity;
but this is our comfort, that they can do no more mischief than God
permits. Let us seek to have our hearts more freed from selfishness. The
liberal soul devises liberal things concerning God, and desires that He
will grant wisdom and prudence, the comforts of his presence, the
influence of his Spirit, and in due time the enjoyment of his glory.

[Isaiah 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 32:9</span></span>

When there was so much provocation given to the holy God, bad times
might be expected. Alas! how many careless ones there are, who support
self-indulgence by shameful niggardliness! We deserve to be deprived of
the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts. Let such
tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in by the
pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then, there
will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continue until a
more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace and
quietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. True
satisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness is
real happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfect
holiness for ever. The good seed of the word shall be sown in all
places, and be watered by Divine grace; and laborious, patient labourers
shall be sent forth into God's husbandry.
