### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 26:0</span></span>

([Sa1 26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001).md) Saul goes after David,
who again spares Saul's life.

([Sa1 26:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#013).md) David exhorts Saul.

([Sa1 26:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021).md) Saul acknowledges his
sin.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 26:1</span></span>

How soon do unholy hearts lose the good impressions convictions have
made upon them! How helpless were Saul and all his men! All as though
disarmed and chained, yet nothing is done to them; they are only asleep.
How easily can God weaken the strongest, befool the wisest, and baffle
the most watchful! David still resolved to wait till God thought fit to
avenge him on Saul. He will by no means force his way to the promised
crown by any wrong methods. The temptation was very strong; but if he
yielded, he would sin against God, therefore he resisted the temptation,
and trusted God with the event.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 26:13</span></span>

David reasoned seriously and affectionately with Saul. Those who forbid
our attendance on God's ordinances, do what they can to estrange us from
God, and to make us heathens. We are to reckon that which exposes us to
sin the greatest injury that can be done us. If the Lord stirred thee up
against me, either in displeasure to me, taking this way to punish me
for my sins against him, or in displeasure to thee, if it be the effect
of that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee; let Him accept an
offering from us both. Let us join in seeking peace, and to be
reconciled with God by sacrifice.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 26:21</span></span>

Saul repeated his good words and good wishes. But he showed no evidence
of true repentance towards God. David and Saul parted to meet no more.
No reconciliation among men is firm, which is not founded in an cemented
by peace with God through Jesus Christ. In sinning against God, men play
the fool, and err exceedingly. Many obtain a passing view of these
truths, who hate and close their eyes against the light. Fair
professions do not entitle those to confidence who have long sinned
against the light, yet the confessions of obstinate sinners may satisfy
us that we are in the right way, and encourage us to persevere,
expecting our recompence from the Lord alone.
