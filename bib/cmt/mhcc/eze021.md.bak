### [Ezekiel Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 21:0</span></span>

(v. 1-17) The ruin of Judah under the emblem of a sharp sword.

([Eze 21:18-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#018).md) The approach of the
king of Babylon described.

([Eze 21:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028).md) The destruction of the
Ammonites.

[Ezekiel 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 21:1</span></span>

Here is an explanation of the parable in the last chapter. It is
declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole
land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and
rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God
against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The
example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare.
Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will
strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword
glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword
to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is in earnest in
pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himself in earnest
in publishing it.

[Ezekiel 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 21:18</span></span>

By the Spirit of prophecy Ezekiel foresaw Nebuchadnezzar's march from
Babylon, which he would determine by divination. The Lord would overturn
the government of Judah, till the coming of Him whose right it is. This
seems to foretell the overturnings of the Jewish nation to the present
day, and the troubles of states and kingdoms, which shall make way for
establishing the Messiah's kingdom throughout the earth. The Lord
secretly leads all to adopt his wise designs. And in the midst of the
most tremendous warnings of wrath, we still hear of mercy, and some
mention of Him through whom mercy is shown to sinful men.

[Ezekiel 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 21:28</span></span>

The diviners of the Ammonites made false prophecies of victory. They
would never recover their power, but in time would be wholly forgotten.
Let us be thankful to be employed as instruments of mercy; let us use
our understandings in doing good; and let us stand aloof from men who
are only skilful to destroy.
