born out of due time

(Greek, "ektrōma", "before the due time"). Paul thinks of himself here
as an Israelite whose time to be born again had not come, nationally
(compare ([Mat 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039).md) so that his
conversion by the appearing of the Lord in glory ([Act
9:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003).md) was an illustration, or
instance before the time, of the future national conversion of Israel.

See; ([Eze 20:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#034).md); ([Hos
2:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014).md); ([Zac
12:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md); ([Zac

Adam

Adam was a contrasting type of Christ, ([Co1
15:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045).md); ([Rom
5:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014).md).

\(1\) "The first man Adam was made a living soul" ([Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md); that is, he derived life from
another, that is, God. "The last Adam was a life-giving spirit." So far
from deriving life, He was Himself the fountain of life, and He gave
that life to others; ([Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004).md); ([Joh
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021).md); ([Joh
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#010).md); ([Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024).md); ([Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012).md).

\(2\) In origin the first man was of the earth, earthy; the Second Man
is the Lord from heaven.

\(3\) Each is the head of a creation, and these also are in contrast: in
Adam all die; in Christ all will be made alive; the Adamic creation is
"flesh"; the new creation, "spirit." ([Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006).md).

[1 Corinthians 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 15:24</span></span>

kingdom

Kingdom (New Testament), Summary:

See "Kingdom (Old Testament)" ([Gen
1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008).md).

Kingdom truth is developed in the New Testament in the following order:

\(1\) The promise of the kingdom to David and his seed, and described in
the prophets ([Sa2 7:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008).md); ([Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008).md) enters the New Testament
absolutely unchanged. ([Luk 1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031).md).
The King was born in Bethlehem; ([Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001).md); ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002).md) of a virgin. ([Mat
1:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018).md); ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md).

\(2\) The kingdom announced as "at hand",

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017).md),

by John the Baptist, by the King, and by the Twelve, was rejected by the
Jews, first morally,

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020).md),

and afterward, officially, ([Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042).md); ([Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043).md), and the King, crowned with
thorns, was crucified.

\(3\) In anticipation of His official rejection and crucifixion, the
King revealed the "mysteries" of the kingdom of heaven,

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011).md),

to be fulfilled in the interval between His rejection and His return in
glory ([Mat 13:1-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001).md).

\(4\) Afterward, He announced His purpose to "build" His church, ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).md), another "mystery" revealed
through Paul which is being fulfilled contemporaneously with the
mysteries of the kingdom. The "mysteries of the kingdom of heaven" and
the "mystery" of the church ([Eph
3:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009).md) occupy, historically, the same
period, that is, this present age.

\(5\) The mysteries of the kingdom will be brought to an end by "the
harvest" ([Mat 13:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#039).md); ([Mat
13:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#049).md); ([Mat
13:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#050).md) at the return of the King in
glory, the church having previously been caught up to meet Him in the
air. ([Th1 4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014).md).

\(6\) Upon His return the King will restore the Davidic monarchy in His
own person, re-gather dispersed Israel, establish His power over all the
earth, and reign one thousand years. ([Mat
24:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027).md); ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031).md); ([Act
15:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014).md); ([Rev
20:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001).md).

\(7\) The kingdom of heaven,

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md),

thus established under David's divine Son, has for its object the
restoration of the divine authority in the earth, which may be regarded
as a revolted province of the great kingdom of God.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033).md).

When this is done, ([Co1 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024).md); ([Co1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025).md), the Son will deliver up the
kingdom (of heaven), ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md), to
"God, even the Father," that "God" (That is, the triune God, Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit) "may be all in all" ([Co1
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#028).md). The eternal throne is that "of
God, and of the Lamb". ([Rev 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001).md).
The kingdom-age constitutes the seventh Dispensation.

(See Scofield) - ([Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010).md).

Then cometh

Then, finally, when he delivers up the kingdom to God, even the Father;
when he has done away with every rule, and every authority and power
(for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet), the last
enemy, death, is destroyed.

[1 Corinthians 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 15:29</span></span>

dead

That is, who, through the introductory rite of baptism, are taking the
places in the ranks left vacant by Christians who have died.

raised

Resurrection, Summary:

\(1\) The resurrection of the dead was believed by the patriarchs ([Gen
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#005).md); ([Heb
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#019).md); ([Job
19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025).md) and revealed through the
prophets; ([Isa 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019).md); ([Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002).md); ([Dan
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013).md); ([Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014).md) and miracles of the dead
restored to life are recorded in the Old Testament; ([Kg2
4:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#032).md); ([Kg2
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021).md).

\(2\) Jesus Christ restored life to the dead ([Mat
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#025).md); ([Luk
7:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#012).md); ([Joh
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#043).md); ([Joh
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#044).md) and predicted His own
resurrection; ([Joh 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018).md); ([Luk
24:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001).md).

\(3\) A resurrection of bodies followed the resurrection of Christ ([Mat
27:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052).md); ([Mat
27:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#053).md) and the apostles raised the
dead; ([Act 9:36-41](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036).md); ([Act
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#009).md); ([Act
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010).md).

\(4\) Two resurrections are yet future, which are inclusive of "all that
are in the graves" ([Joh 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028).md). These
are distinguished as "of life"; ([Co1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022).md); ([Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023).md); ([Th1
4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014).md); ([Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004).md) and "of judgment"; ([Joh
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028).md); ([Joh
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029).md); ([Rev
20:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011).md). They are separated by a
period of one thousand years ([Rev
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005).md). The "first resurrection," that
"unto life," will occur at the second coming of Christ ([Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023).md) the saints of the Old Testament
and church ages meeting Him in the air ([Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016).md); ([Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017).md) while the martyrs of the
tribulation, who also have part in the resurrection ([Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004).md) are raised at the end of the
great tribulation.

\(5\) The mortal body will be related to the resurrection body as grain
sown is related to the harvest ([Co1
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037).md); ([Co1
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038).md) that body will be
incorruptible, glorious, powerful, and spiritual ([Co1
15:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042).md); ([Co1
15:49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#049).md).

\(6\) The bodies of living believers will, at the same time, be
instantaneously changed ([Co1
15:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050).md); ([Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md); ([Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021).md). This "change" of the living,
and resurrection of the dead in Christ, is called the "redemption of the
body"; ([Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023).md); ([Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md); ([Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014).md).

\(7\) After the thousand years the "resurrection unto judgment" ([Joh
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029).md) occurs. The resurrection-body of
the wicked dead is not described. They are judged according to their
works, and cast into the lake of fire. ([Rev
20:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007).md).
