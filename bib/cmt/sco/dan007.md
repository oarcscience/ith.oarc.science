### [Daniel Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001)

[Daniel 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 7:2</span></span>

great sea

The "sea" in Scripture imagery stands for the populace, the mere
unorganized mass of mankind ([Mat
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047)); ([Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001)).

[Daniel 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 7:5</span></span>

three ribs

A reference to the three-fold dominion of the second empire, Media,
Persia, Babylonia.

devour

That is, Lydia, Babylonia, Egypt, etc.

[Daniel 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 7:6</span></span>

leopard

Swiftness of Alexander's conquests.

[Daniel 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 7:7</span></span>

horns

A horn symbolizes a king.

Compare ([Rev 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012)).

[Daniel 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 7:8</span></span>

little horn

The vision is of the end of Gentile world-dominion. The former Roman
empire (the iron kingdom of ([Dan
2:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#033)); ([Dan
2:40-44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#040)); ([Dan
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007)) will have ten horns (that is,
kings, ([Rev 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012)) corresponding to
the ten toes of the image. As Daniel considers this vision of the ten
kings, there rises up amongst them a "little horn" (king), who subdues
three of the ten kings so completely that the separate identity of their
kingdoms is destroyed.

Seven kings of the ten are left, and the "little horn." He is the "king
of fierce countenance" typified by that other "king of fierce
countenance," Antiochus Epiphanes, ([Dan
8:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023)) the "prince that shall come"
of ([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)); ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)) the "king" of ([Dan
11:36-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036)) the "abomination" of; ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011)); ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)) the "man of sin" of ([Th2
2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)) and the "Beast" of ([Rev
13:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004)).

See "Beast"; ([Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008)); ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)).

[Daniel 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 7:13</span></span>

and they

This scene is identical with that of ([Rev
5:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006)). There the ascription of
praise of the "kings and priests" (Compare ([Dan
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018)); ([Dan
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018)); ref. A) ends with the words,
"and we shall reign on the earth." Revelation 6. opens the "vexing" of
([Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)) introductory to setting the
king on Zion; ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006)); ([Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004)). The vision ([Dan
7:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009)) reverses the order of events
as they will be fulfilled. Verse 13 ([Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013)) describes the scene in heaven
(cf) ([Rev 5:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006)) which, in
fulfilment, precedes the events which Daniel sees in vision in ([Dan
7:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009)). The historic order will be:

\(1\) The investiture of the Son of Man with the kingdom ([Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013)); ([Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014)); ([Rev
5:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006)).

\(2\) the "vexing" of ([Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005));
fully described in ([Mat 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021)); ([Mat
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022)) Revelation 6-18.

\(3\) The return of the Son of Man in glory to deliver the "smiting"
blow of ([Dan 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045)); ([Dan
7:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009)); ([Rev
19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)).

\(4\) The judgement of the nations and the setting up of the kingdom
([Dan 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010)); ([Dan
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026)); ([Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027)); ([Mat
25:31-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)); ([Rev
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001)).

[Daniel 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 7:14</span></span>

him

([Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013)); ([Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014)) is identical with ([Rev
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001)) and antedates the fulfilment of
([Dan 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)); ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)); ([Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013)); ([Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014)); ([Rev
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001)) describe the investiture of the
Son of Man and Son of David with the kingdom authority, while ([Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)); ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)) describes the crushing blow
(Armageddon, ([Rev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014))) which
destroys Gentile world-power, thus clearing the way for the actual
setting up of the kingdom of heaven. ([Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)); ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)); ([Rev
19:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019)) are the same event.

[Daniel 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 7:17</span></span>

beasts

The monarch vision of Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2) covers the same historic
order as the beast vision of Daniel, but with this difference:
Nebuchadnezzar saw the imposing outward power and splendour of the
"times of the Gentiles" ([Luk 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024));
([Rev 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019)) while Daniel saw the true
character of Gentile world-government as rapacious and warlike,
established and maintained by force. It is remarkable that the heraldic
insignia of the Gentile nations are all beasts or birds of prey.

[Daniel 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 7:18</span></span>

saints

Verses ([Dan 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018)); ([Dan
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#022)); ([Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025)); ([Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027)). That church saints will also
share in the rule seems clear from; ([Act
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#017)); ([Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)); ([Ti2
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010)); ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)); ([Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)); ([Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021)); ([Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010)); ([Rev
20:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004)).

[Daniel 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 7:19</span></span>

know the truth of the fourth beast

See note 4,

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#017)).

[Daniel 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 7:26</span></span>

and they shall

The end of Gentile world-power.

\(1\) In the beast vision of Daniel 7, the fourth beast is declared to
be "the fourth kingdom," that is, the Roman empire, the "iron" kingdom
of Daniel 2. The "ten horns" upon the fourth beast (Roman empire), ([Dan
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007)) are declared to be "ten kings
that shall arise" ([Dan 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024))
answering to the ten toes of the image vision of Daniel 2. The ten
kingdoms, covering the regions formerly ruled by Rome, will constitute,
therefore, the form in which the fourth or Roman empire will exist when
the whole fabric of Gentile world-domination is smitten by the "stone
cut out without hands", signifying Christ; ([Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)); ([Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045)); ([Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009)).

\(2\) But Daniel sees a "little horn" rise up and subdue three of the
ten kings ([Dan 7:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024)). His
distinguishing mark is hatred of God and of the Saints. He is not to be
confounded with the "little horn" of Daniel 8 -- a prophecy fulfilled in
Antiochus Epiphanes.

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009)).

In Revelation 13, additional particulars of the "little horn" of Daniel
7 are given.

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001)).

everlasting kingdom

See ([Sa2 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016)); ([Psa
89:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035)); ([Dan
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#003)); ([Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013)); ([Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014)); ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031)).
