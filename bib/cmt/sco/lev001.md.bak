[Leviticus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md)

burnt-sacrifice

The burnt-offering

1\. typifies Christ offering Himself without spot to God in delight to
do His Father's will even in death.

2\. it is atoning because the believer has not had this delight in the
will of God; and

3\. substitutionary ([Lev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004).md) because
Christ did it in the sinner's stead. But the thought of penalty is not
prominent. ([Heb 9:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011).md); ([Heb
10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md); ([Psa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006).md); ([Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008).md). The emphatic words ([Lev
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003).md) are "burnt-sacrifice,"
"voluntary," "it shall be accepted for him," and "atonement." The
creatures acceptable for sacrifice are five:

\(1\) The bullock, or ox, typifies Christ as the patient and enduring
Servant ([Co1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009).md); ([Co1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010).md); ([Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002).md); ([Heb
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003).md) "obedient unto death"; ([Isa
52:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013).md); ([Phi
2:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005).md). His offering in this character
is substitutionary, for this we have not been.

\(2\) The sheep, or lamb, typifies Christ in unresisting self-surrender
to the death of the cross ([Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007).md);
([Act 8:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032).md).

\(3\) The goat typifies the sinner ([Mat
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#033).md) and, when used sacrificially,
Christ, as "numbered with the transgressors"; ([Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md); ([Luk
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#033).md) and "made sin," and "a curse";
([Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013).md); ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md) as the sinner's substitute.

(4, 5) The turtle-dove or pigeon. Naturally a symbol of mourning
innocency ([Isa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014).md); ([Isa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011).md); ([Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).md); ([Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026).md) is associated with poverty in
([Lev 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007).md) and speaks of Him who for
our sakes become poor ([Luk 9:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058).md) and
whose pathway of poverty which began with laying aside "the form of
God," ended in the sacrifice through which we became rich; ([Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009).md); ([Phi
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006).md). The sacrifice of the poor Man
becomes the poor man's sacrifice. ([Luk
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#024).md). These grades of typical
sacrifice test the measure of our apprehension of the varied aspects of
Christ's one sacrifice on the cross. The mature believer should see
Christ crucified in all these aspects.

[Leviticus 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004.md)

put his hand upon

The laying of the offerer's hand signified acceptance and identification
if himself with his offering. In type it answered to the believer's
faith accepting and identifying himself with Christ ([Rom
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005).md); ([Rom
6:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003).md). The believer is justified by
faith, and his faith is reckoned for righteousness, because his faith
identifies him with Christ, who died as his sin-offering; ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md); ([Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md).

atonement

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033).md).

[Leviticus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 1:8</span></span>

fire

Essentially as symbol of God's holiness. As such it expresses God in
three ways:

1\. In judgment upon that which His holiness utterly condemns (for
example) ([Gen 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024).md); ([Mar
9:43-48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043).md); ([Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015).md).

2\. In the manifestation of Himself, and of that which He approves ([Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002).md); ([Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007).md); ([Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021).md); and ...

3\. In purification (e.g) ([Co1
3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012).md); ([Mal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002).md); ([Mal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003).md). So, in Leviticus, the fire which
only manifests the sweet savour of the burnt-, meal-, and
peace-offerings, wholly consumes the sin-offering.

fat

That which burns most quickly - devotedness, zeal.

[Leviticus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 1:9</span></span>

sweet savour

The sweet savour offerings are so called because they typify Christ in
His own perfections, and in His affectionate devotion to the Father's
will. The non-sweet savour offerings typify Christ as bearing the whole
demerit of the sinner. Both are substantial. In our place Christ, in the
burnt-offering, makes good our lack of devotedness, and, in the sin- and
trespass-offerings, suffers because of our disobediences.
