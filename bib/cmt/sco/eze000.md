Book Introduction - Ezekiel

Ezekiel was carried away to Babylon between the first and final
deportation of Judah ([Kg2 24:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#011).md).
Like Daniel and the Apostle John, he prophesied out of the land, and his
prophecy, like theirs, follows the method of symbol and vision. Unlike
the pre-exilic prophets, whose ministry was primarily to either Judah or
the ten-tribe kingdom, Ezekiel is the voice of Jehovah to "the whole
house of Israel."

Speaking broadly, the purpose of his ministry is to keep before the
generation born in exile the national sins which had brought Israel so
low (e.g. [Eze 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#023).md); to sustain the
faith of the exiles by predictions of national restoration, of the
execution of justice upon their oppressors, and of national glory under
the Davidic monarchy.

Ezekiel is in seven great prophetic strains indicated by the expression,
"The hand of the Lord was upon me." ([Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003.md); [Eze
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014.md); [Eze
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md); [Eze
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md); [Eze
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022.md); [Eze
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md); [Eze
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001).md).

The minor divisions are indicated in the text.

The events recorded in Ezekiel cover a period of 21 years (Ussher).
