peace-offerings

In the "law of the offerings," the peace-offering is taken out of its
place as third of the sweet savour offerings, and placed alone, and
after all the non-sweet savour offerings. The explanation is as simple
as the fact is beautiful. In revealing the offerings Jehovah works from
Himself out to the sinner.

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010).md).

The whole burnt-offering comes first as meeting what is due to the
divine affections, and the trespass-offering last as meeting the
simplest aspect of sin - its injuriousness. But the sinner begins of
necessity with that which lies nearest to a newly awakened conscience-a
sense, namely, that because of sin he is at enmity with God. His first
need, therefore, is peace with God. And that is precisely the Gospel
order. Christ's first message is, "Peace" ([Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).md) afterward He shows them His
hands and His side. It is the order as ([Co2
5:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018).md) first "the word of
reconciliation," ([Lev 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019).md); then the
trespass- and sin-offering, ([Lev
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021).md). Experience thus reverses the
order of revelation.

[Leviticus 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013.md)

leaven

The use of leaven here is significant. Peace with God is something which
the believer shares with God. Christ is our peace-offering ([Eph
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013).md). Any thanksgiving for peace
must, first of all, present Him. In verse 12 ([Lev
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012).md), we have this, in type, and so
leaven is excluded. In verse 13 ([Lev
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013).md), it is the offerer who gives
thanks for his participation in the peace, and so leaven fitly
signifies, that though having peace with God through the work of
another, there is still evil in him. This is illustrated in ([Amo
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005).md) where the evil in Israel is
before God.
