Book Introduction - Joel

Joel, a prophet of Judah, probably exercised his ministry during the
reign of Joash (2 Chronicles 22 to 24). In his youth he may have known
Elijah, and he certainly was a contemporary of Elisha. The plagues of
insects, which were the token of the divine chastening, give occasion
for the unveiling of the coming "day of the Lord" ([Isa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012), refs.), in its two aspects of
judgment on the Gentiles and blessing for Israel.

Joel is in three chief parts:

1\. The plague of insects (Joel 1:1-20)

2\. The day of the Lord (Joel 2:1 - 3:8)

3\. Retrospect of the day of the Lord, and full kingdom blessing (Joel
3:9-21)
