Ashtaroth

Ashtaroth, plural of Ashtoreth ([Kg1

Phoenician goddess (the Astarte of the Greeks), which were worshipped as
idols during times of spiritual declension in Israel. ([Jdg

judges

The judges were tribesmen in Israel upon whom the Lord laid the burden
of Israel's apostate and oppressed state. They were the spiritual
ancestors of the prophets; that is to say, men raised up of God, the
theocratic King, to represent Him in the nation. They were patriots and
religious reformers because national security and prosperity were
inseparably connected with loyalty and obedience to Jehovah. Not one of
the chosen deliverers had anything whereof to glory in the flesh.
Othniel was but the son of the younger brother of Caleb; Ehud was a
left-handed man and an assassin; Shamgar, a rustic with an ox-goad;
Deborah, a woman; Gideon, of an obscure family in the smallest tribe,
etc. Each of the classes mentioned in ([Co1
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027).md); ([Co1
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028).md) is illustrated among the judges.
