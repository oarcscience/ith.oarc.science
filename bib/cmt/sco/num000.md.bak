Book Introduction - Numbers

The book derives its name from the fact that it records the enumeration
of Israel. Historically, Numbers takes up the story where Exodus left
it, and is the book of the wilderness wanderings of the redeemed people
consequent upon their failure to enter the land at Kadesh-barnea.

Typically, it is the book of service and walk, and thus completes, with
the preceding books, a beautiful moral order: Genesis, the book of the
creation and fall; Exodus, of redemption; Leviticus, of worship and
fellowship; and Numbers, of that which should follow--service and walk.

It is important to see that nothing was left to self-will. Every servant
was numbered, knew his place in the family, and had his own definitely
assigned service. The N.T. parallel is 1 Cor. 12.

The second typical lesson is that, tested by wilderness circumstances,
Israel utterly failed.

Numbers is in five chief divisions:

1\. The Order of the Host (Numbers 1:1 - 10:10).

2\. From Sinai to Kadesh-barnea (Numbers 10:11 - 12:16).

3\. Israel at Kadesh-barnea (Numbers 13:1 - 19:22).

4\. The Wilderness Wanderings (Numbers 20:1 - 33:49).

5\. Closing Instructions (Numbers 33:50 - 36:13).

The events covered in Numbers cover a period of 39 years (Ussher).
