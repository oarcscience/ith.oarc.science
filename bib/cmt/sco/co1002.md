words

\(1\) The writers of Scripture invariably affirm, where the subject is
mentioned by them at all, that the words of their writings are divinely
taught. This, of necessity, refers to the original documents, not to
translations and versions; but the labours of competent scholars have
brought our English versions to a degree of perfection so remarkable
that we may confidently rest upon them as authoritative.

\(2\) ([Co1 2:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)) gives the process
by which a truth passes from the mind of God to the minds of His people.

\(a\) The unseen things of God are undiscoverable by the natural man
([Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)).

\(b\) These unseen things God has revealed to chosen men ([Co1
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010)).

\(c\) The revealed things are communicated in Spirit-taught words ([Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013)). This implies neither mechanical
dictation nor the effacement of the writer's personality, but only that
the Spirit infallibly guides in the choice of words from the writer's
own vocabulary ([Co1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013)).

\(d\) These Spirit-taught words, in which the revelation has been
expressed, are discerned, as to their true spiritual content, only by
the spiritual among believers; ([Co1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015)); ([Co1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016));

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#019)).

[1 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 2:14</span></span>

natural man

Paul divides men into three classes:

Greek, "psuchikos", meaning "of the senses" ([Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015)); ([Jde
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019)) or "natural," that is, the
Adamic man, unrenewed through the new birth ([Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)); ([Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005)).

Greek, "pneumatikos", meaning "spiritual," that is, the renewed man as
Spirit-filled and walking in the Spirit in full communion with God ([Eph
5:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018)); and

Greek, "sarkikos", meaning "carnal," "fleshly," that is, the renewed man
who, walking "after the flesh," remains a babe in Christ ([Co1
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001)).

The "natural" man may be learned, gentle, eloquent, fascinating, but the
"spiritual" content of Scripture is absolutely hidden from him; and the
"fleshly", or "carnal", Christian is able to comprehend only its
simplest truths, "milk" ([Co1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002)).
