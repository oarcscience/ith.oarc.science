### [Hebrews Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001)

[Hebrews 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 8:8</span></span>

The New Covenant, Summary:

\(1\) "Better" than the Mosaic covenant not morally, but efficaciously
([Heb 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019)); ([Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003)); ([Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004)).

\(2\) Established on "better" (that is, unconditional) promises. In the
Mosaic Covenant, God said, "If ye will"; ([Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)); in the New Covenant, He says,
"I will"; ([Heb 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010)); ([Heb
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012)).

\(3\) Under the Mosaic Covenant, obedience sprang from fear; ([Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002)); ([Heb
12:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025)); under the New Covenant,
from a willing heart and mind. ([Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010)).

\(4\) The New Covenant secures the personal revelation of the Lord to
every believer ([Heb 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#011)).

\(5\) the complete oblivion of sins ([Heb
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012)); ([Heb
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017)); ([Heb
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#003)).

\(6\) rests upon an accomplished redemption ([Mat
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027)); ([Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028)); ([Co1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#025)); ([Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011)); ([Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012)); ([Heb
9:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018)).

\(7\) and secures the perpetuity, future conversion, and blessing of
Israel. ([Jer 31:31-40](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031)).

See also "Kingdom (Old Testament)," and ([Sa2
7:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008)).

The New Covenant is the eighth, thus speaking of resurrection and of
eternal completeness.

Covenant

I. The Eight Covenants, Summary:

\(1\) The Edenic Covenant

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026))

conditioned the life of man in innocency.

\(2\) The Adamic Covenant

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014))

conditions the life of fallen man and gives promise of a Redeemer.

\(3\) The Noahic Covenant

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001))

establishes the principle of human government.

\(4\) The Abrahamic Covenant

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018))

founds the nation of Israel, and confirms, with specific additions, the
Adamic promise of redemption.

\(5\) The Mosaic Covenant

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#025))

condemns all men, "for that all have sinned."

\(6\) The Palestinian Covenant

(See Scofield) - ([Deu 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003))

secures the final restoration and conversion of Israel.

\(7\) The Davidic Covenant

(See Scofield) - ([Sa2 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016))

establishes the perpetuity of the Davidic family (fulfilled in Christ),
([Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)); ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031)); ([Rom
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003)) and of the Davidic kingdom, over
Israel, and over the whole earth; to be fulfilled in and by Christ.
([Sa2 7:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008)); ([Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)); ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031)); ([Act
15:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014)); ([Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)).

\(8\) The New Covenant rests upon the sacrifice of Christ, and secures
the eternal blessedness, under the Abrahamic Covenant ([Gal
3:13-29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)) of all who believe. It is
absolutely unconditional, and, since no responsibility is by it
committed to man, it is final and irreversible.

II\. The relation of Christ to the eight covenants is as follows:

\(1\) To the Edenic Covenant, Christ, as the "second Man," the "last
Adam" ([Co1 15:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045)) takes the place
over all things which the first Adam lost. ([Col
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010)); ([Heb
2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007)).

\(2\) He is the "Seed of the woman" of the Adamic Covenant ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015)); ([Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)); ([Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008)); ([Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)); ([Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)) and fulfilled its conditions of
toil ([Mar 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003)) and obedience.

\(3\) As the greatest son of Shem, in Him was fulfilled supremely the
promise to Shem in the Noahic Covenant.

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)); ([Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)).

\(4\) He is the "Seed to whom the promises were made" in the Abrahamic
Covenant; the son of Abraham obedient unto death. ([Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018)); ([Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016)); ([Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008)).

\(5\) He lived sinlessly under the Mosaic Covenant and bore for us its
curse. ([Gal 3:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010)).

\(6\) He lived obediently as a Jew in the land under the Palestinian
Covenant, and will yet perform it gracious promises. ([Deu
28:1-30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001)); ([Deu
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#009)).

\(7\) He is the "Seed," "Heir," and "King" under the Davidic Covenant.
([Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)); ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031)).

\(8\) His sacrifice is the foundation of the New Covenant. ([Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028)); ([Co1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#025)).
