And I said

The vision of the candlestick and olive trees (Literally, trees of oil)
is, as we know, from ([Rev 11:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003)) a
prophecy to be fulfilled in the last days of the present age. That which
marks the ministry of the "two witnesses" ([Rev
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003)); ([Rev
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#004)) is power.

Compare ([Zac 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006)).

In measure this power would rest upon Zerubbabel, who, having begun the
restoration temple of Zechariah's time, would finish it ([Zac
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009)) laying the "headstone" amid the
shoutings of the people. The whole scene forms a precursive fulfilment
of the ministry of the two witnesses of Revelation 11 and of the coming
of the true "headstone," Prince Messiah, of whom prince Zerubbabel is a
type. Oil is a uniform symbol of the Spirit.

(See Scofield) - ([Act 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004)).

Joshua and Zerubbabel were doubtless the two olive trees for that day,
as the two witnesses of Revelation 11 may, in turn, but point to Christ
as Priest-King in the kingdom-age. ([Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012)); ([Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)).
