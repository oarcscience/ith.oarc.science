### [Matthew Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001)

[Matthew 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 25:1</span></span>

shall

This part of the Olivet discourse goes beyond the "sign" questions of
the disciples ([Mat 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003)) and presents
our Lord's return in three aspects:

\(1\) As testing profession, ([Mat
25:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001)).

\(2\) as testing service, ([Mat
25:14-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014));

\(3\) as testing the Gentile nations, ([Mat
25:31-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)).

virgins

The kingdom of heaven here is the sphere of profession, as in Matthew
13. All alike have lamps, but two facts fix the real status of the
foolish virgins: They "took no oil," and the Lord said, "I know you
not." Oil is the symbol of the Holy Spirit, and "If any man have not the
spirit of Christ, he is none of his" ([Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009)).

Nor could the Lord say to any believer, however unspiritual, "I know you
not."

heaven

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002)).

[Matthew 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 25:13</span></span>

Son of man

Also ([Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031)).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020)).

[Matthew 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 25:14</span></span>

the kingdom of heaven is

Omit the italicised words, "the kingdom of heaven is".

[Matthew 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 25:21</span></span>

Well done

The Lord's commendation may be earned by the weakest of His servants; it
is given for faithful service.

[Matthew 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 25:23</span></span>

Well done

The same commendation is gained by the servant with two talents as by
him with five; he was equally faithful though his gift was less.

[Matthew 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 25:31</span></span>

Son of man

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020)).

angels

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004)).

[Matthew 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 25:32</span></span>

And before him

This judgment is to be distinguished from the judgment of the great
white throne. Here there is no resurrection; the persons judged are
living nations; no books are opened; three classes are present, sheep,
goats, and brethren; the time is at the return of Christ ([Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)); and the scene is on the earth.
All these particulars are in contrast with ([Rev
20:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011)).

The test in this judgment is the treatment accorded by the nations to
those whom Christ here call "my brethren." These "brethren" are the
Jewish Remnant who will have preached the Gospel of the kingdom to all
nations during the tribulation.

See "Remnant" ([Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009)); ([Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)).

The test in ([Rev 20:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011)) is the
possession of eternal life.

See, for the other six judgments:

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)); ([Co1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031)).

(See Scofield) - ([Co2 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010)).

(See Scofield) - ([Eze 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#037)).

(See Scofield) - ([Jde 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012)).

[Matthew 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 25:34</span></span>

kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002)).

[Matthew 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 25:37</span></span>

righteous

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010)).

[Matthew 25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 25:41</span></span>

angels

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004)).

[Matthew 25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 25:46</span></span>

into everlasting

Judgments (the seven). ([Luk 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014));
([Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014)); ([Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012)). "Eternal" and "everlasting"
are the same word.
