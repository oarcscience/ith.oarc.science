stone of stumbling

Christ crucified is the Rock:

\(1\) Smitten that the Spirit of life may flow from Him to all who will
drink. ([Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006)); ([Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004)); ([Joh
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013)); ([Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014)); ([Joh
7:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037)).

\(2\) To the church the foundation and chief corner Stone. ([Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020)).

\(3\) To the Jews at His first coming a "stumbling stone". ([Rom
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032)); ([Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033)); ([Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023)).

\(4\) to Israel at His second coming the "headstone of the corner".
([Zac 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007)).

\(5\) To the Gentile world-power the smiting "stone cut out without
hands". ([Dan 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)).

\(6\) In the divine purpose the Stone which, after the destruction of
Gentile world-power, is to grow and fill the earth.

\(7\) To unbelievers the crushing Stone of judgment. ([Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044)).

[1 Peter 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)

priesthood

The New Testament priesthood, Summary:

\(1\) Until the law was given the head of each family was the family
priest. ([Gen 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020)); ([Gen
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025)); ([Gen
31:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#054)).

\(2\) When the law was proposed, the promise to perfect obedience was
that Israel would be unto God "a kingdom of priests" ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006)). But Israel violated the law,
and God shut up the priestly office to the Aaronic family, appointing
the tribe of Levi to minister to them, thus constituting the typical
priesthood. ([Exo 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001)).

\(3\) In the dispensation of grace, all believers are unconditionally
constituted a "kingdom of priests" ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)); ([Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)) the distinction which Israel
failed to achieve by works. The priesthood of the believer is,
therefore, a birthright; just as every descendant of Aaron was born to
the priesthood. ([Heb 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001)).

\(4\) The chief privilege of a priest is access to God. Under law the
high priest only could enter "the holiest of all," and that but once a
year ([Heb 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007)); but when Christ died,
the veil, type of Christ's human body ([Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020)) was rent, so that now the
believer-priests, equally with Christ the High Priest, have access to
God in the holiest. ([Heb 10:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019)).

The high Priest is corporeally there ([Heb
4:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014)); ([Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024)); ([Heb
10:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019)).

\(5\) In the exercise of his office the New Testament believer-priest is

a\) a sacrificer who offers a threefold sacrifice:

\(a\) his own living body. ([Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001)); ([Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017)); ([Ti2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006)); ([Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016)); ([Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027)).

\(b\) praise to God, "the fruit of the lips that make mention of His
name" (R.V.), to be offered "continually"; ([Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015)); ([Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022)) "I will commune with thee from
above the mercy seat".

\(c\) his substance. ([Heb 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016));
([Rom 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013)); ([Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006)); ([Jo3
1:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005)); ([Heb
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002)); ([Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010)); ([Tit
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#014)).

b\) The New Testament priest is also an intercessor. ([Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001)); ([Col
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012)).

this is thankworthy

Grace (imparted). ([Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007)); ([Rom
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001)); ([Pe2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#018)).
