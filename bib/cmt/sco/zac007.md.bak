they

"They," that is, of the captivity in Babylon. The mission of these Jews
of the captivity concerned a fast day instituted by the Jews in
commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem, wholly of their own will,
and without warrant from the word of God. In the beginning there was
doubtless sincere contrition in the observance of the day; now it had
become a mere ceremonial. The Jews of the dispersion would be rid of it,
but seek authority from the priests. The whole matter, like much in
modern pseudo-Christianity, was extra-Biblical, formal, and futile.
Jehovah takes the occasion to send a divine message to the dispersion.
That message is in five parts:

\(1\) Their fast was a mere religious form; they should rather have
given heed to the "former prophets" ([Zac
7:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#004).md);

Compare ([Isa 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012).md); ([Mat
15:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001).md).

\(2\) they are told why their 70 years' prayer has not been answered
([Zac 7:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#008).md). Compare ([Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018).md); ([Isa
1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014).md).

\(3\) the unchanged purpose of Jehovah, and the blessing of Israel in
the kingdom ([Zac 8:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#001).md).

Compare a like order in; ([Isa
1:24-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md); ([Isa
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001).md).

\(4\) the messengers of the captivity are exhorted to hear the prophets
of "these days," i.e, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, and to do justly;
then all their fasts and feasts will become gladness and joy ([Zac
8:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009).md).

\(5\) they are assured that Jerusalem is yet to be the religious centre
of the earth ([Zac 8:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020).md); ([Isa
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001).md); ([Zac
14:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md).
