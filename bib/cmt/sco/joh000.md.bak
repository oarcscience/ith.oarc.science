Book Introduction - John

Writer: The fourth Gospel was written by the Apostle John [Joh
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#024.md). This has been questioned on
critical grounds, but on the same grounds and with equal scholarship,
the early date and Johanean authorship have been maintained.

Date: The date of John's Gospel falls between A.D. 85 and 90. Probably
the latter.

Theme: This is indicated both in the Prologue ([Joh
1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).md), and in the last verse of the
Gospel proper ([Joh 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031).md), and is:
The incarnation of the eternal Word, and Son of life; (2) that as many
as believe on Him as "the Christ, the Son of God" ([Joh
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031).md) may have eternal life. The
prominent words are, "believed" and "life."

The book is in seven natural divisions:

1\. Prologue: The eternal Word incarnate in Jesus the Christ (John
1:1-14).

2\. The witness of John the Baptist (John 1:15-34).

3\. The public ministry of Christ (John 1:35 - 12:50).

4\. The private ministry of Christ to His own (John 13:1 - 17:26).

5\. The sacrifice of Christ (John 18:1 - 19:42).

6\. The manifestation of Christ in resurrection (John 20:1-31).

7\. Epilogue: Christ the Master of life and service (John 21:1-25).

The events recorded in this book cover a period of 7 years.
