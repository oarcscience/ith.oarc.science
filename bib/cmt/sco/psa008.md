### [Psalms Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001.md)

"Gittith", means "winepress," and so, of the harvest, in the sense of
judgment ([Isa 63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003).md); ([Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015).md); ([Psa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001).md); to which the title of Psalm 8
properly belongs, is a Psalm of judgment.

[Psalms 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md)

For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels

In Psalm 2, Christ was presented as Jehovah's Son and King, rejected and
crucified but yet to reign in Zion. In Psalm 8, while His deity is fully
recognized ([Psa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001).md), Psalm 110 with
([Mat 22:41-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041).md) He is seen as Son of
man ([Psa 8:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004).md) who, "made for a
little while lower than the angels," is to have dominion over the
redeemed creation ([Heb 2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006).md). The
authority here is racial and Adamic, rather than purely divine as in
Psalm 2, or Davidic as in Psalm 89. That which the first man lost, the
second man and "last Adam" more than regained. ([Heb
2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006).md) in connection with Psalm 8,
and ([Rom 8:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017).md) show that the "many
sons" whom He is bringing to glory, are joint heirs with Him in both the
royal right of Psalm 2 and the human right of Hebrew, see Psalm 16, next
in order of the Messianic Psalms.
