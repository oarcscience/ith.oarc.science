wanting

It is not at all a question of the presence in the assembly of persons
having the qualifications of elders, made overseers by the Holy Spirit
([Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028).md) that such persons were in
the churches of Crete is assumed; the question is altogether one of the
appointment of such persons.

These assemblies were not destitute of elders; but were "wanting," in
that they were not duly appointed. There is a progress of doctrine in
respect of the appointing of elders.

Compare ([Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005).md), note.

elders

Elder (Greek, "presbuteros") and bishop (Greek, "episcopos" means
"overseer") designate the same office, (compare ([Tit
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007).md); ([Act
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017).md); ([Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028).md), the former referring to the
man, the latter to a function of the office. The eldership in the
apostolic local churches was always plural.

There is no instance of one elder in a local church. The functions of
the elders are: to rule; ([Ti1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004).md);
([Ti1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005).md); ([Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017).md) to guard the body of revealed
truth from perversion and error ([Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009).md) to "oversee" the church as a
shepherd his flock; ([Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028).md);
([Joh 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016).md); ([Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017).md). ([Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002).md). Elders are made or "set" in the
churches by the Holy Spirit, ([Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028).md), but great stress is laid upon
their due appointment. ([Act 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023).md);
([Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005).md).

At first, they were ordained (Greek, "kathistēmi", "to elect," "to
designate with the hand,") by an apostle; for example, ([Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023).md), but in Titus and First
Timothy, the qualifications of an elder become part of the Scriptures
for the guidance of the churches in such appointment. ([Ti1
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001).md).
