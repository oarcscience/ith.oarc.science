Paul here quotes from his words to Peter when he withstood him at

That is, "we" Jews. ([Rom 3:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019).md).

Gentiles, is it therefore Christ who makes us sinners? By no means. It
is by putting ourselves again under law after seeking justification
through Christ, that we act as if we were still unjustified sinners,
seeking to become righteous through law-works. ([Gal
5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001).md).
