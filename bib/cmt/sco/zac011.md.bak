### [Zechariah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007.md)

two staves

The scene belongs to the first advent. Beauty and Bands -- literally
"graciousness and union"; the first signifying God's attitude toward His
people Israel, in sending His Son ([Mat
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037).md) the second, His purpose to
reunite Judah and Ephraim ([Eze
37:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015).md). Christ, at His first
advent, came with grace ([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017).md) to
offer union ([Mat 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017).md) and was sold
for thirty pieces of silver ([Zac
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012).md); ([Zac
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013)). "Beauty" (i.e. Graciousness.md)
was "cut in sunder" ([Zac 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010).md); ([Zac
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#011).md), signifying that Judah was
abandoned to the destruction foretold in ([Zac
11:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001).md) and fulfilled A.D. 70. After
the betrayal of the Lord for thirty pieces of silver ([Zac
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012).md); ([Zac
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013)) "Bands" (i.e. Union.md) was broken
([Zac 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#014).md), signifying the
abandonment, for the time, of the purpose to reunite Judah and Israel.
The order of Zechariah 11 is,

\(1\) the wrath against the land ([Zac
11:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001).md), fulfilled in the destruction
of Jerusalem after the rejection of Christ ([Luk
19:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041).md).

\(2\) the cause of that wrath in the sale and rejection of Christ vs.
([Zac 11:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007).md);

\(3\) the rise of the "idol shepherd," the Beast ([Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008).md); ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020).md) and his destruction ([Zac
11:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#015).md).

the one

The Old Testament Parables: Summary. A parable is a similitude used to
teach or enforce a truth. The Old Testament parables fall into three
classes:

\(1\) The story-parable, of which ([Jdg
9:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#007).md) is an instance;

\(2\) parabolic discourses; for example ([Isa
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001).md).

\(3\) parabolic actions; for example ([Eze
37:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016).md).

poor

The "poor of the flock": that is, the "remnant according to the election
of grace" ([Rom 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005).md) those Jews who
did not wait for the manifestation of Christ in glory, but believed on
Him at His first coming, and since. Of them it is said that they "waited
upon Me," and "knew." Neither the Gentiles nor the Gentile church,
corporately, are in view: only the believers out of Israel during this
age. The church, corporately, is not in Old Testament prophecy ([Eph
3:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008).md).

And the Lord

The reference to the Beast is obvious; no other personage of prophecy in
any sense meets the description. He who came in His Father's name was
rejected: the alternative is one who comes in his own name. ([Joh
5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043).md); ([Rev
13:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004).md).
