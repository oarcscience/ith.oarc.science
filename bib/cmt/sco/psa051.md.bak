### [Psalms Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 51:1</span></span>

Have

This Psalm must ever be, in its successive steps, the mould of the
experience of a sinning saint who comes back to full communion and
service. The steps are:

\(1\) sin thoroughly judged before God (vs. 1-6);

\(2\) forgiveness and cleansing through the blood (v. 7.f.c.)

\(3\) cleansing (v. 7,1,c, to 10.) Compare ([Joh
13:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004).md); ([Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026).md); ([Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009).md).

\(4\) Spirit-filled for joy and power (vs. 11,12);

\(5\) service (v. 13);

\(6\) worship (vs 14-17);

\(7\) the restored saint in fellowship with God, not about self, but
about the blessing of Zion. Personally, it was David's pathway to
restored communion after his sin with Bathsheba. Dispensationally, it
will be the pathway of returning Israel. ([Deu
30:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001).md).

[Psalms 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007.md)

Hyssop

Hyssop was the little shrub ([Kg1
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#033).md) with which the blood and water
of purification were applied. ([Lev
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#001).md); ([Num
19:1-19](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001).md). Cleansing in Scripture is
twofold:

\(1\) Of a sinner from the guilt of sin; the blood ("hyssop") aspect;

\(2\) of a saint from the defilement of sin -- the water ("wash me")
aspect;

\(3\) Under grace the sinner is purged by blood when he believes ([Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028).md); ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md); ([Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md); ([Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014).md). Both aspects of cleansing, by
blood and by water, are brought out in; ([Joh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010).md); ([Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025).md); ([Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026).md).

"He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet"; "Christ loved the
church and gave Himself for it redemption by "blood, "hyssop," the
"bath"\] that He might sanctify and cleanse "it with the washing by the
word": answering to the "wash me" of verse 7 ([Psa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#011.md)

Take not

No believer of this dispensation, aware of the promise of His abiding
([Joh 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016).md) should pray, "Take not
Thy Holy Spirit from me." ([Eph 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030).md)
but while Christian position is not found here, Christian experience in
essence is.
