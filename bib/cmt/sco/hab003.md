### [Habakkuk Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001)

[Habakkuk 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 3:1</span></span>

Prayer

Prayer in the Old Testament is in contrast with prayer in the New
Testament in two respects:

\(1\) In the former the basis of prayer is a covenant of God, or an
appeal to his revealed character as merciful, gracious, etc. In the
latter the basis is relationship: "When ye pray, say, Our Father" ([Mat
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009)).

\(2\) A comparison, for example of the prayers of Moses and Paul, will
show that one was praying for an earthly people whose dangers and
blessings were earthly; the other for a heavenly people whose dangers
and blessings were spiritual.

[Habakkuk 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#007)

[Habakkuk 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hab 3:17</span></span>

Although

That is, despite the afflictions of Israel in dispersion, the prophet
will rejoice because of the Lord, as yet to return to His temple.
