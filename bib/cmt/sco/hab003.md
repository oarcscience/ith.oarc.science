### [Habakkuk Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001.md)

[Habakkuk 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 3:1</span></span>

Prayer

Prayer in the Old Testament is in contrast with prayer in the New
Testament in two respects:

\(1\) In the former the basis of prayer is a covenant of God, or an
appeal to his revealed character as merciful, gracious, etc. In the
latter the basis is relationship: "When ye pray, say, Our Father" ([Mat
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009).md).

\(2\) A comparison, for example of the prayers of Moses and Paul, will
show that one was praying for an earthly people whose dangers and
blessings were earthly; the other for a heavenly people whose dangers
and blessings were spiritual.

Although

That is, despite the afflictions of Israel in dispersion, the prophet
will rejoice because of the Lord, as yet to return to His temple.
