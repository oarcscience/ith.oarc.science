so is

How poor are the similes of the bride as compared with those of the
Bridegroom. To him, she is a "lily among thorns; she can only say that
he is "as the apple tree among the trees of the wood."

our wall

"Our wall." The bride had returned to her own home: the Bridegroom seeks
her.

dove

There is beautiful order here. First we have what the bride is as seen
in Christ, "My dove." In herself most faulty; in Him "blameless and
harmless" ([Phi 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015).md) the very
character of the dove. The bride's place of safety, "in the clefts of
the rock" -- hidden, so to speak, in the wounds of Christ. Thirdly, her
privilege. "Stairs" speaks of access. It is not "secret places," as in
A.V, but "the secret of the stairs" -- the way and privilege of access
to His presence; ([Eph 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018).md); ([Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001).md); ([Heb
10:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).md). Fourthly, the order of
approach: she is to come near before she speaks, "Let me see thy
countenance," then "Let me hear thy voice." Lastly, now that she is near
and has spoken, He speaks a tender word of admonition: "Take us the
foxes," etc.
