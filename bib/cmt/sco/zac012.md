### [Zechariah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001)

[Zechariah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 12:1</span></span>

burden

Zechariah 12-14, from one prophecy, the general theme of which is the
return of the Lord and the establishment of the kingdom. The order is:

\(1\) The siege of Jerusalem preceding the battle of Armageddon ([Zac
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001));

\(2\) the battle itself ([Zac 12:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#004));

\(3\) the "latter rain" in the pouring out of the Spirit and the
personal revelation of Christ to the family of David and the remnant in
Jerusalem, not merely as the glorious Deliverer, but as the One whom
Israel pierced and has long rejected ([Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010));

\(4\) the godly sorrow which follows that revelation ([Zac
12:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011));

\(5\) the cleansing fountain ([Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)) then to be effectually "opened"
to Israel.

David

Kingdom in Old Testament, Summary:

I. Dominion over the earth before the call of Abraham

\(1\) Dominion over creation was given to the first man and woman ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)); ([Gen
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028)). Through the fall this dominion
was lost, Satan becoming "prince of this world"; ([Mat
4:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008)); ([Joh
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030)).

\(2\) After the flood, the principle of human government was established
under the covenant with Noah

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001)).

Biblically this is still the charter of all Gentile government.

II\. The Theocracy in Israel. The call of Abraham involved, with much
else, the creation of a distinctive people through whom great purposes
of God toward the race might be worked out.

(see "Israel" ([Gen 12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001)); ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)).

Among these purposes is the establishment of a universal kingdom. The
order of the development of Divine rule in Israel is:

\(1\) The mediatorship of Moses ([Exo
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001)); ([Exo
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009)); ([Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012)).

\(2\) The leadership of Joshua ([Jos
1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)).

\(3\) The institution of Judges ([Jdg
2:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#016)).

\(4\) The popular rejection of the Theocracy, and choice of a king --
Saul, ([Sa1 8:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001)); ([Sa1
9:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#012)).

III\. The Davidic kingdom

\(1\) The divine choice of David ([Sa1
16:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001)).

\(2\) The giving of the Davidic Covenant ([Sa2
7:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008)); ([Psa
89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003)); ([Psa
89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004)); ([Psa
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020)); ([Psa
89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021)); ([Psa
89:28-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028)).

\(3\) The exposition of the David Covenant by the prophets ([Isa
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025)); ([Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026)); ([Zac
12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006)).

See margin reference, "Kingdom" and references.

(See Scofield) - ([Isa 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025))

The kingdom as described by the prophets is:

a\) Davidic, to be established under an heir of David, who is to be born
of a virgin, therefore truly man, but also "Immanuel," "the mighty God,
the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace" ([Isa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013)); ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)); ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)); ([Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007)); ([Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)); ([Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)); ([Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023)); ([Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024)); ([Hos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004)); ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005)).

b\) A kingdom heavenly in origin, principle, and authority ([Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)); ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)); ([Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)); ([Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045)) but set up on the earth, with
Jerusalem as the capital; ([Isa
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)); ([Isa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003)); ([Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005)); ([Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023)); ([Isa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020)); ([Isa
62:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001)); ([Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)); ([Jer
31:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038)); ([Joe
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001)); ([Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016)); ([Joe
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017)).

c\) The kingdom is to be established first over regathered, restored,
and converted Israel, and then to become universal ([Psa
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006)); ([Psa
22:1-3124](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)); ([Psa
22:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)); ([Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002)); ([Isa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003)); ([Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)); ([Isa
11:10-1360](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010)); ([Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012)); ([Jer
23:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)); ([Jer
30:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007)); ([Eze
20:33-40](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#033)); ([Eze
37:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021)); ([Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010)); ([Zac
14:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016)).

d\) The moral characteristics of the kingdom are to be righteousness and
peace. The meek, not the proud, will inherit the earth; longevity will
be greatly increased; the knowledge of the Lord will be universal; beast
ferocity will be removed; absolute equity will be enforced; and
outbreaking sin visited with instant judgment; while the enormous
majority of earth's inhabitants will be saved ([Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004)); ([Isa
11:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006)); ([Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020)); ([Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009)); ([Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009)); ([Zac
14:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016)). The New Testament ([Rev
20:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001)); adds a detail of immense
significance -- the removal of Satan from the scene. It is impossible to
conceive to what heights of spiritual, intellectual, and physical
perfection humanity will attain in this, its coming age of righteousness
and peace. ([Isa 11:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004)); ([Psa
72:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)).

e\) The kingdom is to be established by power, not persuasion, and is to
follow divine judgment upon the Gentile world-powers ([Psa
2:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004)); ([Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007)); ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)); ([Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)); ([Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045)); ([Dan
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026)); ([Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027)); ([Zac
14:1-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001)) (See Scofield) - ([Zac
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011)).

f\) The restoration of Israel and the establishment of the kingdom are
connected with an advent of the Lord, yet future ([Deu
30:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003)); ([Psa
2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001)); ([Zac
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004)).

g\) The chastisement reserved for disobedience in the house of David
([Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014)); ([Psa
89:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030)) fell in the captivities and
world-wide dispersion, since which time, though a remnant returned under
prince Zerubbabel, Jerusalem has been under the overlordship of Gentile.
But the Davidic Covenant has not been abrogated ([Psa
89:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033)) but is yet to be fulfilled.
([Act 15:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014)).
