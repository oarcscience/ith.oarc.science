Book Introduction - Amos

Amos, a Jew, but prophesying (B.C. 776-763) in the northern kingdom
([Amo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); [Amo
7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014).md) exercised his ministry during
the reign of Jeroboam II, an able but idolatrous king who brought his
kingdom to the zenith of its power. Nothing could seem more improbable
than the fulfilment of Amos' warnings; yet within fifty years the
kingdom was utterly destroyed. The vision of Amos is, however, wider
than the northern kingdom, including the whole "house of Jacob."

Amos is in four parts:

1\. Judgments on the cities surrounding Palestine (Amos 1:1 - 2:3).

2\. Judgements on Judah and Israel (Amos 2:4-16).

3\. Jehovah's controversy with "the whole family" of Jacob (Amos 3:1 -
9:10).

4\. The future glory of the Davidic kingdom (Amos 9:11-15).
