### [Matthew Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 4:1</span></span>

Then was Jesus

The temptation of Christ, the "last Adam" ([Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045).md) is best understood when
contrasted with that of the "first man Adam." Adam was tempted in his
place of lord of creation, a lordship with but one reservation, the
knowledge of good and evil; ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md); ([Gen
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#016).md). Through the woman he was
tempted to add that also to his dominion. Falling, he lost all. But
Christ had taken the place of a lowly Servant, acting only from and in
obedience to the Father. ([Phi 2:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005).md);
([Joh 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019).md); ([Joh
6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057).md); ([Joh
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028).md); ([Joh
8:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#054).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Isa 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008).md).

that He might redeem a fallen race and a creation under the curse; ([Gen
3:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017).md); ([Rom
8:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019).md). Satan's one object in the
threefold temptation was to induce Christ to act from Himself, in
independency of His Father. The first two temptations were a challenge
to Christ from the god of this world to prove Himself indeed the Son of
God ([Mat 4:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003).md). The third was the
offer of the usurping prince of this world to divest himself of that
which rightfully belonged to Christ as Son of man and Son of David, on
the condition that He accept the sceptre on Satan's world-principles.

Compare ([Joh 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008).md).

Christ defeated Satan by a means open to His humblest follower, the
intelligent use of the word of God ([Mat
4:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004).md). In his second temptation Satan
also used Scripture, but a promise available only to one in the path of
obedience. The scene give emphasis to the vital importance of "rightly
dividing the word of truth" ([Ti2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015).md).

[Matthew 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md)

holy city

In the New Testament, one Greek word, "hagios", in its various forms, is
rendered, "holy," "holiness," "sanctify," "sanctified,"
"sanctification." Like the Hebrew, "qodesh", it signifies "set apart for
God." The important references follow ([Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005).md); margin reference,

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005).md).

[Matthew 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 4:8</span></span>

world

The Greek word kosmos means "order," "arrangement," and so, with the
Greeks, "beauty"; for order and arrangement in the sense of system are
at the bottom of the Greek conception of beauty.

When used in the New Testament of humanity, the "world" of men, it is
organized humanity -- humanity in families, tribes, nations -- which is
meant. The word for chaotic, unorganized humanity -- the mere mass of
man is "thalassa", the "sea" of men (for example) ([Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008).md).

For "world" (Greek, "kosmos") in the bad ethical sense, "world system"
([Joh 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007).md).

at hand

"At hand" is never a positive affirmation that the person or thing said
to be "at hand" will immediately appear, but only that no known or
predicted event must intervene. When Christ appeared to the Jewish
people, the next thing in the order of revelation as it then stood,
should have been the setting up of the Davidic kingdom. In the knowledge
of God, not yet disclosed, lay the rejection of the kingdom (and King),
the long period of the mystery-form of the kingdom, the world-wide
preaching of the cross, and the out-calling of the Church. But this was
as yet locked up in the secret counsels of God. ([Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011).md); ([Mat
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017).md); ([Eph
3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003).md).

two brethren

Peter and John were already disciples, ([Joh
1:35-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#035).md). This is a call to service.

James

Two persons are called by this name in the New Testament.

\(1\) James the son of Zebedee, an apostle ([Mat
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002).md) and the brother of the apostle
John, apart from whom he is never mentioned, and with whom, together
with Peter, he was admitted to the especial intimacy of our Lord. ([Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001).md); ([Mar
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#037).md); ([Mar
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002).md); ([Mar
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#033).md) He was martyred by Herod. ([Act
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#002).md).

\(2\) A son of Alphaeus (or Cleopas) and Mary the sister of Mary the
mother of Jesus.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016).md)

and brother of Joses. ([Mar 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040).md). He
was, therefore, a cousin of the Lord Jesus. He is called James "the
less" ([Mar 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040).md) Literally, little,
that is, Of shorter stature than James the son of Zebedee). He was an
apostle. ([Mat 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003).md) It has been
conjectured that "Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus" ([Mat
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003).md) was identical with the Juda of
([Luk 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#016).md) who is there called
"ofthat is, 'son' or 'brother' as is has been variously translated\]
James." A Juda is mentioned with a James and Joses and Simon in ([Mar
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003).md) as "brother" of our Lord

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055).md), margin
reference). ([Mat 13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055).md).

The Gospels mention no other James who could be called the brother of
the Lord Jesus, but James the less was certainly the son of Alphaeus and
Mary the sister of our Lord's mother. The conclusion seems, therefore
most probable that; ([Mat 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003).md); ([Mat
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055).md); ([Mar
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018).md); ([Mar
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003).md); ([Luk
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#015).md); ([Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013).md); ([Act
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#017).md); ([Mar
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#013).md); ([Mar
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar021.htm#018).md); ([Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019).md); ([Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009).md); ([Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012).md); ([Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001).md) refer to James the less, son of
Alphaeus and Mary, and cousin, or, according to Jewish usage, "brother"
of the Lord Jesus. He was the author of the Epistle of James.
