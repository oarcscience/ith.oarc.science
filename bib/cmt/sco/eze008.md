sixth month

visions

Visions, that is, of former profanations of the temple, and of the
wickedness because of which Israel was then in Babylon, show the prophet
that he might justify to the new generation born in Assyria and
Babylonia during the captivity, the righteousness of God in the present
national chastening. The visions are retrospective; Israel had done
these things, hence the captivities. This strain continues to ([Eze
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#020)). It is the divine view of the
national sinfulness and apostasy, revealed to Ezekiel in a series of
visions so vivid that though the prophet was by the river Chebar, ([Eze
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)); ([Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003)); ([Eze
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023)); ([Eze
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#015)); ([Eze
10:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020)); ([Eze
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#003)) It was as if he were transported
back to Jerusalem, and to the time when these things were occurring.
These visions of the sinfulness of Israel are interspersed with promises
of restoration and blessing which are yet to be fulfilled.

See "Israel"; ([Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002)); ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003)); ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)).

Also "Kingdom, (Old Testament)"; ([Gen
1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)); ([Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)).

Son of man

The combined purport of the four visions of profanation in chapter 8, is
idolatry set up in the entire temple, even in the holy of holies ([Eze
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010)); ([Eze
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011)) women given over to phallic
cults ([Eze 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014)) and nature-worship
([Exo 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#016)).
