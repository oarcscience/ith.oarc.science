Christ

The Christ, that is, that, according to the Scriptures, the Messiah must
die and rise again. That Jesus was the Messiah was the second part of
his argument.

[Acts 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 17:18</span></span>

Epicureans

Disciples of Epicurus, B.C. 342-271, who abandoned as hopeless the
search by reason for pure truth, compare ([Joh
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038).md), seeking instead true pleasure
through experience.

Stoicks

Disciples of Zeno, B.C. 280, and Chrysippus, B.C. 240. This philosophy
was founded on human self-sufficiency, inculcated stern self-repression,
the solidarily of the race, and the unity of Deity. Epicureans and
Stocis divided the apostolic world.

[Acts 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 17:29</span></span>

offspring of God

(Greek, "genos", means "race"). The reference is to the creation-work of
God in which He made man (i.e. mankind, the race in Adam) in his own
likeness, ([Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md); ([Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027).md); thus rebuking the thought that
"the Godhead is like unto gold," etc. The word "Father" is not used, not
does the passage affirm anything concerning fatherhood or sonship, which
are relationships based on faith, and the new birth.

Compare ([Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012).md); ([Joh
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013).md); ([Gal
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026).md); ([Gal
4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001).md); ([Joh
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001).md).

[Acts 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 17:30</span></span>

Repent

Repentance is the translation of a (Greek, "metanoeō")
"metanoia-metanoeo", which means "to have another mind," "to change the
mind," and is used in the New Testament to indicate a change of mind in
respect of sin, of God, and of self. This change of mind may, especially
in the case of Christians who have fallen into sin, be preceded by
sorrow ([Co2 7:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008).md) but sorrow for
sin, though it may "work" repentance, is not repentance. The son in
([Mat 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028).md); ([Mat
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029).md) illustrates true repentance.

Saving faith:

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039).md)

includes and implies that change of mind which is called repentance.

[Acts 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 17:31</span></span>

world

(Greek, "oikoumenē", means "inhabited earth").

(See Scofield) - ([Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001).md).
