Book Introduction - 1 Thessalonians

Writer: The apostle Paul ([Th1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001).md).

Date: The Epistle was written from Corinth, A.D. 54, shortly after
Paul's departure from Thessalonica (Acts 16, 17), and is the earliest of
his letters.

Theme: The theme of the Epistle is threefold:

1\. To confirm young disciples in the foundational truths already taught
them;

2\. To exhort them to go on to holiness;

3\. To comfort them concerning those who had fallen asleep. The second
coming of Christ is prominent throughout. The Epistle is incidentally
most interesting as showing the richness in doctrine of the primitive
evangelism. During a mission of about one month the apostle had taught
all the great doctrines of the Christian faith.

The divisions of the Epistle are sufficiently indicated by the Chapters.

1\. The model church, and the three tenses of the Christian life (1
Thessalonians 1:1-10).

2\. The model servant and his reward (1 Thessalonians 2:1-20).

3\. The model brother, and the believer's sanctification (1
Thessalonians 3:1-13).

4\. The model walk, and the believer's hope (1 Thessalonians 4:1-18).

5\. The model walk, and the day of Jehovah (1 Thessalonians 5:1-28).
