judged

The character and work of Samson are alike enigmatical. Announced by an
angel ([Jdg 13:1-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001).md). He was a
Nazarite; ([Num 6:1-27](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#001).md); ([Jdg
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005).md) who constantly defiled his
Nazarite separation through fleshly appetites. Called of God to judge
Israel, and endued wonderfully with the Spirit, he wrought no abiding
work for Israel, and perished in captivity to his enemies the
Philistines. What was real in the man was his mighty faith in Jehovah in
a time of doubt and apostasy, and this faith God honoured ([Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032).md).
