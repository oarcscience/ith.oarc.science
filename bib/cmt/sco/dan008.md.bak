### [Daniel Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 8:1</span></span>

vision

The eighth chapter gives details concerning the second and third
world-kingdoms: the silver and brass kingdoms of Daniel 2, the bear and
leopard kingdoms of Daniel 7, namely, the Medo-Persian and Macedonian
kingdoms of history. At the time of this vision ([Dan
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001).md) the first monarchy was nearing
its end. Belshazzar was the last king of that monarchy.

third year

About B.C. 530.

little horn

The "little horn" here is a prophecy fulfilled in Antiochus Epiphanes,
B.C. 175, who profaned the temple and terribly persecuted the Jews. He
is not to be confounded with the "little horn" of Daniel 7, who is yet
to come, and who will dominate the earth during the great tribulation.

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008).md)

concerning "The Beast".

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020).md)

and "The great tribulation," ([Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014).md).

But Antiochus is a remarkable type of the Beast, the terrible "little
horn" of the last days. Verses 24-25 ([Dan
8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024).md) go beyond Antiochus and
evidently refer to the "little horn" of Daniel 7. Both Antiochus and the
Beast, but the Beast pre-eminently, are in view in verses 24-25 ([Dan
8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024).md). That the "little horn" of
Daniel 7 cannot be the little horn of ([Dan
8:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009).md); ([Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023).md) is evident. The former comes up
among the ten horns into which the fourth empire (Roman) is to be
divided; the little horn of Daniel 8 comes out of one of the four
kingdoms into which the third (Grecian) empire was divided ([Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023).md), and in "the latter time" of the
four kingdoms ([Dan 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022).md); ([Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023).md). This was historically true of
Antiochus Epiphanes. They are alike in hatred of the Jews and of God,
and in profaning the temple.

Compare ([Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025)) (the Beast.md) with
([Dan 8:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010)) (Antiochus.md):

one of them

Anticohus Epiphanes came out of Syria, one of the "four notable"
kingdoms into which Alexander's empire was divided.

[Daniel 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 8:10</span></span>

And it waxed great

This passage ([Dan 8:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010).md) is
confessedly the most difficult in prophecy, a difficulty increased by
the present state of the text. Historically this was fulfilled in and by
Antiochus Epiphanes, but in a more intense and final sense Antiochus but
adumbrates the awful blasphemy of the "little horn" of; ([Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008).md); ([Dan
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024).md); ([Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md); ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md); ([Dan
11:36-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036).md); ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011).md). In Daniel ([Dan
8:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010).md) the actions of both "little
horns" blend.

[Daniel 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 8:12</span></span>

daily sacrifice

Compare ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md) where the Beast
comes into view:

[Daniel 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 8:13</span></span>

desolation

Seven times in Daniel the "desolation" is spoken of:

\(1\) Of the sanctuary, ([Dan 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013).md)
fulfilled by Antiochus Epiphanes, B.C. 175-170.

\(2\) Of the sanctuary, ([Dan 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017).md)
the condition in Daniel's time, when the Jews were in exile and the
sanctuary desolate.

\(3\) Generally, of the land, ([Dan
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018).md) also referring to Daniel's time.

\(4\) Of the sanctuary, ([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md)
fulfilled A.D. 70, in the destruction of city and temple after the
cutting off of Messiah. ([Luk 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020).md).

(5, 6, 7) Of the sanctuary, by the Beast, ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md); ([Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031).md); ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011).md).

Compare ([Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).md); ([Mar
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014).md); ([Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003).md); ([Th2
2:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).md); ([Rev
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014).md); ([Rev
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015).md).

one saint

Or, holy one, idem. ([Dan 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013).md); ([Dan
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017).md).

[Daniel 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 8:15</span></span>

a man

The theophanies. ([Dan 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#015).md); ([Dan
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006).md); ([Dan
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010).md); ([Dan
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#018).md); ([Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007).md); ([Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009).md).

[Daniel 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 8:19</span></span>

end

Two "ends" are in view here:

\(1\) historically, the end of the third, or Grecian empire of Alexander
out of one of the divisions of which the little horn of verse 9 ([Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009)) (Antiochus.md) arose;

\(2\) prophetically, the end of the times of the Gentiles ([Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024).md); ([Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014).md) when the "little horn" of ([Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008).md); ([Dan
7:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024).md) the Beast, will arise --
Daniel's final time of the end.

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004).md).

[Daniel 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 8:20</span></span>

ram

Verses ([Dan 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#003).md); ([Dan
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004).md).

The "higher" horn which "came up last" is Cyrus, the other "Darius the
Mede."

[Daniel 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 8:21</span></span>

first king

That is, Alexander the Great.

[Daniel 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 8:22</span></span>

four kingdoms

The four empires into which Alexander's empire was divided about B.C.
300; Greece, Asia Minor, including Syria, Egypt, the East.

[Daniel 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 8:23</span></span>

king of fierce countenance

That is, Antiochus Epiphanes who arose out of Syria, one of the "four
kingdoms," B.C. 170.
