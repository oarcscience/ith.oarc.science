Book Introduction - Hebrews

Writer: The authorship of Hebrews has been in controversy from the
earliest times. The book is anonymous, but the reference in [Pe2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015.md) seems conclusive that Paul was
the Writer. See also [Heb 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023.md). All
agree that, whether by Paul or another, the point of view is Pauline. We
undoubtedly have here the method of Paul's synagogue addresses. No book
of Scripture more fully authenticates itself as inspired.

Date: From internal evidence it is clear that Hebrews was written before
the destruction of the Temple, A.D. 70 (cf [Heb
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011).md).

Theme: The doctrinal passages reveal the purpose of the book. It was
written with a twofold intent:

1\. To confirm Jewish Christians by showing that Judaism had come to an
end through the fulfilment by Christ of the whole purpose of the law;
and

2\. The hortatory passages show that the Writer had in view the danger
ever present to Jewish professed believers of either lapsing back into
Judaism, or of pausing short of true faith in Jesus Christ. It is clear
from the Acts that even the strongest of the believers in Palestine were
held to a strange mingling of Judaism and Christianity (e.g. [Act
21:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md) and that snare would be
especially apt to entangle professed Christians amongst the Jews of the
dispersion.

The key-word is "better." Hebrews is a series of contrasts between the
good things of Judaism and the better things of Christ. Christ is
"better" than angels, than Moses, than Joshua, than Aaron; and the New
Covenant than the Mosaic Covenant. Church truth does not appear, the
ground of gathering only being stated ([Heb
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013).md). The whole sphere of Christian
profession is before the Writer; hence exhortations necessary to warn
and alarm a mere professor.

Hebrews is in six divisions, but these include five parenthetic passages
of exhortation.

1\. The great salvation (Hebrews 1:1 - 2:18 (Hebrews 2:1-4,
parenthetic)).

2\. The rest of God (Hebrews 3:1 - 4:16 (all parenthetic)).

3\. Our great High Priest (Hebrews 5:1 - 8:6 (Hebrews 5:11 - 6:12,
parenthetic)).

4\. The new covenant and the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:7 - 10:39
(Hebrews 10:26-39, parenthetic)).

5\. The superiority of the faith way (Hebrews 11:1-40).

6\. The worship and walk of the believer-priest (Hebrews 12:1 - 13:25
(Hebrews 12:3-17, parenthetic)).
