### [Leviticus Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001)

[Leviticus 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 23:2</span></span>

feasts

The feasts of Jehovah. As given to Israel, these were simply seven great
religious festivals which were to be observed every year. The first
three verses of Leviticus 23 ([Lev
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001)) do not relate to the feasts
but separate the sabbath from the feasts.

[Leviticus 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 23:5</span></span>

Passover

The Passover, ([Lev 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004)); ([Lev
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005)). This feast is memorial and
brings into view redemption, upon which all blessing rests. Typically,
it stands for "Christ our passover, sacrificed for us." ([Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007)).

first month

That is, April.

[Leviticus 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 23:6</span></span>

bread

The feast of Unleavened Bread, ([Lev
23:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#006)). This feast speaks of
communion with Christ, the unleavened wave-loaf, in the full blessing of
His redemption, and of a holy walk. The divine order here is beautiful;
first redemption, then a holy walk. ([Co1
5:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006)); ([Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001)); ([Gal
5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007)).

[Leviticus 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 23:10</span></span>

first fruits

The feast of Firstfruits, ([Lev
23:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010)). This feast is typical of
resurrection-first of Christ, then of "them that are Christ's at His
coming"; ([Co1 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023)); ([Th1
4:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013)).

[Leviticus 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 23:16</span></span>

fifty days

The feast of Pentecost, ([Lev
23:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015)). The anti-type is the
descent of the Holy Spirit to form the church. For this reason leaven is
present, because there is evil in the church; ([Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033)); ([Act
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001)); ([Act
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#010)); ([Act
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001)). Observe, it is now loaves; not
a sheaf of separate growths loosely bound together, but a real union of
particles making one homogenous body. The descent of the Holy Spirit at
Pentecost united the separated disciples into one organism. ([Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016)); ([Co1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017)); ([Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012)); ([Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013)); ([Co1
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#020)).

[Leviticus 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 23:17</span></span>

wave-loaves

The wave-loaves were offered fifty days after the wave-sheaf. This is
precisely the period between the resurrection of Christ and the
formation of the church at Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
([Act 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)); ([Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012)); ([Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013)). See "Church"; ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)); ([Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)); ([Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)). With the wave-sheaf no leaven
was offered, for there was no evil in Christ; but the wave-loaves,
typifying the church, are "baken with leaven," for in the church there
is still evil.

[Leviticus 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 23:24</span></span>

trumpets

The feast of Trumpets, ([Lev
23:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#023)). This feast is a prophetical
type and refers to the future regathering of long-dispersed Israel. A
long interval elapses between Pentecost and Trumpets, answering to the
long period occupied in the pentecostal work of the Holy Spirit in the
present dispensation. Study carefully; ([Isa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003)); ([Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013)) (with contexts); ([Isa
58:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001)) (entire chapter), and; ([Joe
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001)); ([Joe
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#021)); in connection with the
"trumpets," and it will be seen that these trumpets, always symbols of
testimony, are connected with the regathering and repentance of Israel
after the church, or pentecostal period is ended. This feast is
immediately followed by the day of atonement.

seventh month

That is, October; also ([Lev 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027));
([Lev 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034)); ([Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039)); ([Lev
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#041)).

[Leviticus 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 23:27</span></span>

atonement

The day of Atonement, ([Lev 23:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#026)).
The day is the same described in Lev. 16, but here the stress is laid
upon the sorrow and repentance of Israel. In other words, the
prophetical feature is made prominent, and that looks forward to the
repentance of Israel after her regathering under the Palestinian
Covenant, ([Deu 30:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001)) preparatory
to the second advent of Messiah and the establishment of the kingdom.
See the connection between the "trumpet" in ([Joe
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001)) and the mourning which follows in
verses ([Joe 2:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011)).

Also ([Zac 12:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)) in connection
with the atonement of ([Zac 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)).
Historically the "fountain" of ([Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)) was opened at the crucifixion,
but rejected by the Jews of that and the succeeding centuries. After the
regathering of Israel the fountain will be efficaciously "opened" to
Israel.

atonement

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033)).

[Leviticus 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">lev 23:42</span></span>

booths

The feast of Tabernacles, ([Lev
23:34-44](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034)) is (like the Lord's Supper
for the church) both memorial and prophetic -memorial as to redemption
out of Egypt ([Lev 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#043)) prophetic as
to the kingdom-rest of Israel after her regathering and restoration,
when the feast again becomes memorial, not for Israel alone, but for all
nations. ([Zac 14:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016)).
