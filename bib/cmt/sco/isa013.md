### [Isaiah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 13:1</span></span>

burden

A "burden," Hebrew, "massa", means "a heavy, weighty thing" is a
message, or oracle concerning Babylon, Assyria, Jerusalem, etc. It is
"heavy" because the wrath of God is in it, and grievous for the prophet
to declare.

Babylon

The city, Babylon is not in view here, as the immediate context shows.
It is important to note the significance of the name when used
symbolically. "Babylon" is the Greek form: invariably in the Old
Testament Hebrew, the word is simply "Babel, the meaning of which is
"confusion", and in this sense the word is used symbolically.

\(1\) In the prophets, when the actual city is not meant, the reference
is to the "confusion" into which the whole social order of the world has
fallen under Gentile world-domination. (See "Times of the Gentiles,"
([Luk 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024).md); ([Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014).md); ([Isa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004).md) gives the divine view of the
welter of warring Gentile powers. The divine order is given in Isaiah
11. Israel in her own land, the centre of the divine government of the
world and channel of the divine blessing; and the Gentiles blessed in
association with Israel. Anything else is, politically, mere "babel."

\(2\) In ([Rev 14:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008).md); ([Rev
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019).md) the Gentile world-system is in
view in connection with Armageddon; ([Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014).md); ([Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021).md) while in Revelation 17, the
reference is to apostate Christianity, destroyed by the nations ([Rev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016).md) headed up under the Beast;
([Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008).md); ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020).md) and false prophet. In Isaiah
the political Babylon is in view, literally as to the then existing
city, and symbolically as to the times of the Gentiles. In the
Revelation both the symbolical-political and symbolical-religious
Babylon are in view, for there both are alike under the tyranny of the
Beast. Religious Babylon is destroyed by political Babylon ([Rev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016).md) political Babylon by the
appearing of the Lord ([Rev 19:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019).md).
That Babylon the city is not to be rebuilt is clear from; ([Isa
13:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019).md); ([Jer
51:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#024).md); ([Jer
51:62-64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#062).md). By political Babylon is
meant the Gentile world-system. (See "World,"; ([Joh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007).md); ([Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008).md) It may be added that, in
Scripture symbolism, Egypt stands for the world as such; Babylon for the
world of corrupt power and corrupted religion; Nineveh for the pride,
the haughty glory of the world.

Day of the Lord

11:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010).md); ([Isa
13:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009).md); ([Isa
24:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021).md); ([Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020).md); ([Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021).md); ([Isa
63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001).md); ([Isa
66:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015).md); ([Rev
19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md)

And Babylon

Verses 12-16 ([Isa 13:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#012).md) look
forward to the apocalyptic judgments (Revelation 6-13). Verses 17-22
([Isa 13:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017).md) have a near and far
view. They predict the destruction of the literal Babylon then existing;
with the further statement that, once destroyed, Babylon should never be
rebuilt (cf) ([Jer 51:61-64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#061).md). All of
this has been literally fulfilled. But the place of this prediction in a
great prophetic strain looks forward to the destruction of both
politico-Babylon and ecclesio-Babylon in the time of the Beast shows
that the destruction of the actual Babylon typifies the greater
destruction yet to come upon the mystical Babylons.
