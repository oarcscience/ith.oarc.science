Comfort

The first two verses of Isaiah 40 ([Isa
40:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001).md) give the key-note of the
second part of the prophecy of Isaiah. The great theme of this section
is Jesus Christ in His sufferings, and the glory that shall follow in
the Davidic kingdom. (See "Christ in Old Testament," sufferings,) ([Gen
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004).md); ([Heb
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018).md) glory, ([Sa2
7:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008).md); ([Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008).md) Since Israel is to be
regathered, converted, and made the centre of the new social order when
the kingdom is set up, this part of Isaiah appropriately contains
glowing prophecies concerning these events. The full view of the
redemptive sufferings of Christ (for example Isaiah 53) leads to the
evangelic strain so prominent in this part of ([Isa
55:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001).md).

The change in style, about which so much has been said, is no more
remarkable than the change of theme. A prophet who was also a patriot
would not write of the sins and coming captivity of his people in the
same exultant and joyous style which he would use to describe their
redemption, blessing, and power. In ([Joh
12:37-44](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#037).md) quotations from Isaiah 53
and 6 are both ascribed to Isaiah.

circle

A remarkable reference to the sphericity of the earth. See, also, ([Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005).md); ([Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024).md); ([Isa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013).md); ([Job
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008).md); ([Psa
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002).md); ([Jer
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012).md).
