### [Jeremiah Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#001.md)

The word

The writings of Jeremiah in chapters 30 to 36, cannot with certainty be
arranged in consecutive order. Certain dates are mentioned (for example
([Jer 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001).md); ([Jer
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001).md); ([Jer
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001).md); ([Jer
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008).md); ([Jer
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001).md) but retrospectively. The
narrative, so far as Jeremiah gives a narrative, is resumed at ([Jer
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001).md). These chapters constitute a
kind of summary of prophecy concerning Israel as a nation, looking on
especially to the last days, the day of the Lord, and the kingdom-age to
follow. If the marginal references are carefully followed the order will
become clear. But these prophecies are interspersed with much historical
matter concerning Jeremiah and his time.

Write

Three "writings" by Jeremiah are to be distinguished:

\(1\) This is impersonal -- a general prophecy, and probably the
earliest. ([Jer 30:1-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#001).md); ([Jer
30:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#040).md).

\(2\) The prophecy destroyed by Jehoiakim. ([Jer
1:1-36](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001).md); ([Jer
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#023).md).

\(3\) The destroyed writing re-written doubtless the writing preserved
to us. ([Jer 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#027).md).

[Jeremiah 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#006.md)
