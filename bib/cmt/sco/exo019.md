### [Exodus Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001)

[Exodus 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 19:1</span></span>

In the third month

At Sinai Israel learned the lessons:

\(1\) of the holiness of Jehovah through the Commandments;

\(2\) of their own sinfulness and weakness through failure;

\(3\) and of the goodness of Jehovah through the provision of priesthood
and sacrifice. The Christian learns through the experience of ([Rom
7:7-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007)) what Israel learned at Sinai.
This division of Exodus should be read in light of; ([Rom
3:19-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019)); ([Rom
7:7-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007)); ([Gal
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)); ([Gal
3:6-25](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006)) explains the relation of the
law to the Abrahamic Covenant:

\(1\) the law cannot disannul that covenant;

\(2\) it was "added" to convict of sin;

\(3\) it was a child-leader unto Christ;

\(4\) it was but preparatory discipline "till the Seed should come."

third month

That is, June.

[Exodus 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 19:3</span></span>

Thus shalt thou say

It is exceedingly important to observe:

\(1\) that Jehovah reminded the people that hitherto they had been the
objects of His free grace;

\(2\) that the law is not proposed as a means of life, but as a means by
which Israel might become "a peculiar treasure" and a "kingdom of
priests";

\(3\) that the law was not imposed until it had been proposed and
voluntarily accepted. The principle is stated in ([Gal
5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001)).

[Exodus 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 19:5</span></span>

if ye will obey

(Cf) ([Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)); ([Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)); ([Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010)). What, under law, was condition,
is under grace, freely given to every believer. The "if" of ([Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)) is the essence of law as a
method of divine dealing, and the fundamental reason why "the law made
nothing perfect"; ([Rom 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003)); ([Heb
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018)); ([Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019)).

The Abrahamic: (See Scofield) - ([Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018)) and New (See Scofield) - ([Heb
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008)) covenants minister salvation and
assurance because they impose but one condition, faith.

[Exodus 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 19:8</span></span>

we will do

The Fifth Dispensation: Law. This dispensation extends from Sinai to
Calvary -- from Exodus to the Cross. The history of Israel in the
wilderness and in the land is one long record of the violation of the
law. The testing of the nation by law ended in the judgment of the
Captivities, but the dispensation itself ended at the Cross.

\(1\) Man's state at the beginning ([Exo
19:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001)).

\(2\) His responsibility ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005));
([Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006)); ([Rom
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005)).

\(3\) His failure ([Kg2 17:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007));
([Kg2 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#019)); ([Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022)); ([Act
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023)).

\(4\) The judgment ([Kg2 17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001));
([Kg2 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#020)); ([Kg2
25:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001)); ([Luk
21:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020)).

See, for the other six dispensations:

INNOCENCE ([Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028));

CONSCIENCE ([Gen 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#023));

HUMAN GOVERNMENT ([Gen 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020));

PROMISE ([Gen 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001));

GRACE ([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017));

[Exodus 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 19:25</span></span>

So Moses

The Mosaic Covenant,

\(1\) given to Israel

\(2\) in three divisions, each essential to the others, and together
forming the Mosaic Covenant, namely: the Commandments, expressing the
righteous will of God ([Exo 20:1-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001))
the "judgments," governing the social life of Israel; ([Exo
21:1-](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001); ([Exo
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#011)) and the "ordinances," governing
the religious life of Israel; ([Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012)); ([Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018)). These three elements form "the
law," as that phrase is generically used in the New Testament (for
example) ([Mat 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017)); ([Mat
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018)). The Commandments and the
ordinances formed one religious system. The Commandments were a
"ministry of condemnation" and of "death" ([Co2
3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007)) the ordinances gave, in the
high priest, a representative of the people with Jehovah; and in the
sacrifices a "cover" (see "Atonement,"

(See Scofield) - ([Lev 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#006))

for their sins in anticipation of the Cross; ([Heb
5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001)); ([Heb
9:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006)); ([Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025)); ([Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026)). The Christian is not under the
conditional Mosaic Covenant of works, the law, but under the
unconditional New Covenant of grace. ([Rom
3:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021)); ([Rom
6:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014)); ([Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016)); ([Gal
3:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010)); ([Gal
3:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016)); ([Gal
3:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024)); ([Gal
4:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021)); ([Heb
10:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011)). See NEW COVENANT.

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008))
