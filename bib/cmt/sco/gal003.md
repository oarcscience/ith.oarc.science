Wherefore then

The answer is sixfold:

\(1\) The law was added because of transgressions, that is, to give to
sin the character of transgression.

\(a\) Men had been sinning before Moses, but in the absence of law their
sins were not put to their account. ([Rom
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013)). The law gave to sin the
character of "transgression," that is, of personal guilt.

\(b\) Also, since men not only continued to transgress after the law was
given, but were provoked to transgress by the very law that forbade it;
([Rom 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008)); the law conclusively
proved the inveterate sinfulness of man's nature. ([Rom
7:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#011)).

\(2\) The law, therefore, "concluded all under sin." ([Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019)); ([Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020)); ([Rom
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023)).

\(3\) The law was an ad interim dealing, "till the seed should come".
([Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019)).

\(4\) The law shut sinful man up to faith as the only avenue of escape.
([Gal 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023)).

\(5\) The law was to the Jews what the pedagogue was in a Greek
household, a ruler of children in their minority, and it had this
character "unto" that is, until Christ. ([Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024)).

\(6\) Christ having come, the believer is no longer under the pedagogue.
([Gal 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#025)).

because of

For the sake, that is, in order that sin might be made manifest as
transgression.

See ([Rom 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015)); ([Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020)); ([Rom
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007)); ([Rom
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013)).

law

I. The law of Moses, Summary:

\(1\) The Mosaic Covenant was given to Israel in three parts:

the commandments, expressing the righteous will of God; ([Exo
20:1-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001));

the "judgments", governing the social life of Israel; ([Exo
21:1-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001)); ([Exo
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#011)); and

the "ordinances", governing the religious life of Israel. ([Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012)); ([Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018)).

\(2\) The commandments and ordinances were one complete and inseparable
whole. When an Israelite sinned, he was held "blameless" if he brought
the required offering. ([Luk 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006));
([Phi 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006)).

\(3\) Law, as a method of the divine dealing with man, characterized the
dispensation extending from the giving of the law to the death of Jesus
Christ. ([Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)); ([Gal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014)); ([Gal
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023)); ([Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024)).

\(4\) The attempt of legalistic teachers, (for example), ([Act
15:1-31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001)); ([Gal
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001)), to mingle law with grace as
the divine method for this present dispensation of grace, brought out
the true relation of the law to the Christian, namely,

II\. The Christian doctrine of the law:

\(1\) Law is in contrast with grace. Under the latter, God bestows the
righteousness which, under law, He demanded. ([Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)); ([Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021)); ([Rom
10:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003)); ([Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030)).

\(2\) The law is, in itself, holy, just, good, and spiritual. ([Rom
7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012)).

\(3\) Before the law, the whole world is guilty, and the law is
therefore of necessity a ministry of condemnation, death, and the divine
curse. ([Rom 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019)); ([Co2
3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007)); ([Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010)).

\(4\) Christ bore the curse of the law, and redeemed the believer both
from the curse and from the dominion of the law. ([Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)); ([Gal
4:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005)).

\(5\) Law neither justifies a sinner nor sanctifies a believer. ([Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016)); ([Gal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002)); ([Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003)); ([Gal
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011)); ([Gal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012)).

\(6\) The believer is both dead to the law and redeemed from it, so that
he is "not under the law, but under grace". ([Rom
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014)); ([Rom
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004)); ([Gal
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#019)); ([Gal
4:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)); ([Ti1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008)); ([Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009)).

\(7\) Under the new covenant of grace, the principle of obedience to the
divine will is inwrought. ([Heb 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#006)).
So far is the life of the believer from the anarchy of self-will that he
is "inlawed to Christ", ([Co1 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#021)),
and the new "law of Christ"; ([Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002)); ([Jo2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#005)); is his delight; while, through
the indwelling Spirit, the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in him.
([Rom 8:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002)); ([Gal
5:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016)). The commandments are used in
the distinctively Christian Scriptures as an instruction in
righteousness. ([Ti2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016)); ([Rom
13:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008)); ([Eph
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001)); ([Co1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#008)); ([Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009)).

to bring us

Omit "to bring us."

unto

Up to, or until.

[Galatians 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gal 3:25</span></span>

schoolmaster

(Greek, "paidagōgos", "child-conductor"); "among the Greeks and Romans,
persons, for the most part slaves, who had it in charge to educate and
give constant attendance upon boys till they came of age." -- H.A.W.
Meyer.

The argument does not turn upon the extent or nature of the pedagogue's
authority, but upon the fact that it wholly ceased when the "child",
([Gal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)), became a song of Solomon,
([Sol 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001)); ([Gal
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)), when the minor became an
adult. The adult "son" does voluntarily that which formerly he did in
fear of the pedagogue. But even if he does not, it is no longer a
question between the son and the pedagogue (the law), but between the
son and his Father -- God.

Compare ([Heb 12:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005)); ([Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)); ([Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002)).

(Greek, "uihos", means "sons").
