### [Genesis Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 3:1</span></span>

The serpent

The serpent, in his Edenic form, is not to be thought of as a writhing
reptile. That is the effect of the curse ([Gen
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014).md). The creature which lent itself
to Satan may well have been the most beautiful as was the most "subtle"
of creatures less than man. Traces of that beauty remain despite the
curse. Every movement of a serpent is graceful, and many species are
beautifully coloured. In the serpent, Satan first appeared as "an angel
of light" ([Co2 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014).md).

[Genesis 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014.md)

And the Lord God said

The Adamic Covenant conditions the life of fallen man -- conditions
which must remain till, in the kingdom age, "the creation also shall be
delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of
the sons of God" ([Rom 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021).md). The
elements of the Adamic Covenant are:

\(1\) The serpent, Satan's tool, is cursed ([Gen
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014).md), and becomes God's illustration
in nature of the effects of sin -- from the most beautiful and subtle of
creatures to a loathsome reptile! The deepest mystery of the atonement
is intimated here. Christ, "made sin for us," in bearing our judgment,
is typified by the brazen serpent; ([Num
21:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005).md); ([Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014).md); ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md). Brass speaks of judgment -- in
the brazen altar, of God's judgment, and in the laver, of self-judgment.

\(2\) The first promise of a Redeemer ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md). Here begins the "Highway of the
Seed," Abel, Seth, Noah ([Gen 6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008).md);
Shem ([Gen 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#026).md); ([Gen
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027).md); Abraham ([Gen
12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001).md); Isaac ([Gen
17:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#019).md) Jacob ([Gen
28:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#010).md); Judah ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md); David ([Sa2
7:5-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#005).md) Immanuel-Christ; ([Isa
7:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009).md); ([Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).md); ([Mat
1:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020).md); ([Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008).md); ([Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031).md).

\(3\) The changed state of the woman ([Gen
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016).md). In three particulars:

\(a\) Multiplied conception;

\(b\) motherhood linked with sorrow;

\(c\) the headship of the man (cf) ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md); ([Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027).md) The entrance of sin, which is
disorder, makes necessary a headship, and it is vested in man; ([Ti1
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011).md); ([Eph
5:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022).md); ([Co1
11:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007).md).

\(4\) The earth cursed ([Gen 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017).md) for
man's sake. It is better for fallen man to battle with a reluctant earth
than to live without toil.

\(5\) The inevitable sorrow of life ([Gen
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017).md).

\(6\) The light occupation of Eden ([Gen
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#015).md) changed to burdensome labour
([Gen 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018).md); ([Gen
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019).md).

\(7\) Physical death ([Gen 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019).md);
([Rom 5:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012).md);

See "Death (spiritual)" ([Gen 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017).md).

Therefore the Lord God

The Second Dispensation: Conscience. By disobedience man came to a
personal and experimental knowledge of good and evil -- of good as
obedience, of evil as disobedience to the known will of God. Through
that knowledge conscience awoke. Expelled from Eden and placed under the
second, or ADAMIC COVENANT, man was responsible to do all known good, to
abstain from all known evil, and to approach God through sacrifice. The
result of this second testing of man is stated in ([Gen
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005).md) and the dispensation ended in the
judgment of the Flood. Apparently "the east of the garden" ([Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024).md) where were the cherubims and the
flame, remained the place of worship through this second dispensation.
See for the other six dispensations:
