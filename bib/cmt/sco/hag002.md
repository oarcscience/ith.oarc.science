house in her first glory

The prophet calls upon the old men who remembered Solomon's temple to
witness to the new generation how greatly that structure exceeded the
present in magnificence; and then utters a prophecy ([Hag
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#007)) which can only refer to the
future kingdom temple described by Ezekiel. It is certain that the
restoration temple and all subsequent structures, including Herod's,
were far inferior in costliness and splendour to Solomon's. The present
period is described in ([Hos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004));
([Hos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005)).

Verse 6 ([Dan 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#006)) is quoted in ([Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026)); ([Heb
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027)).

Verse 7 ([Dan 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#007)): "I will shake all
nations," refers to the great tribulation and is followed by the coming
of Christ in glory, as in ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029)); ([Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)).

"The desire of all nations" is Christ.

(See Scofield) - ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)).

[Haggai 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009)

latter house

In a sense all the temples (i.e Solomon's; Ezra's; Herod's; that which
will be used by the unbelieving Jews under covenant with the Beast ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)); ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)); ([Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)); ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)) and Ezekiel's future kingdom
temple Ezekiel 40-47), are treated as one "house" -- the "house of the
Lord," since they all profess to be that. For that reason Christ
purified the temple of His day, erected though it was by an Idumean
usurper to please the Jews. ([Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012)); ([Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013)).

glory

Or, the future glory of this house shall be greater than the former.
