### [Romans Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)

[Romans 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004.md)

newness

Compare ([Rom 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029).md); ([Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006).md).

"The letter" is a Paulinism for the law, as "spirit" in these passages
is his word for the relationships and powers of new life in Christ
Jesus. In 2 Corinthains 3, a series is presented of contrast of law with
"spirit," of the old covenant and the new. The contrast is not between
two methods of interpretation, literal, and spiritual, but between two
methods of divine dealing: one through the law, the other through the
Holy Spirit.

when the commandment

The passage ([Rom 7:7-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007).md) is
autobiographical. Paul's religious experience was in three strongly
marked phases:

\(1\) He was a godly Jew under the law. That the passage does not refer
to that period is clear from his own explicit statements elsewhere. At
that time he held himself to be "blameless" as concerned the law ([Phi
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006).md). He had "lived in all good
conscience" ([Act 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001).md).

\(2\) With his conversion came new light upon the law itself. He now
perceived it to be "spiritual" ([Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).md). He now saw that, so far from
having kept it, he was condemned by it. He had supposed himself to be
"alive," but now the commandment really "came" ([Rom
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009).md) and he "died." Just when the
apostle passed through the experience of ([Rom
7:7-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007).md) we are not told. Perhaps
during the days of physical blindness at Damascus ([Act
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#009).md); perhaps in Arabia ([Gal
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017).md).

It is the experience of a renewed man, under the law, and still ignorant
of the delivering power of the Holy Spirit ([Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002).md).

\(3\) With the great revelations afterward embodied in Galatians and
Romans, the apostle's experience entered it third phase. He now knew
himself to be "dead to the law by the body of Christ," and, in the power
of the indwelling Spirit, "free from the law of sin and death" ([Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002).md) while "the righteousness of the
law" was wrought in him (not by him) while he walked after the Spirit
([Rom 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004).md); Romans 7 is the record of
past conflicts and defeats experience as a renewed man under law.

carnal

Compare ([Co1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001).md); ([Co1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004).md).

"Carnal" meaning "fleshly" is Paul's word for the Adamic nature, and for
the believer who "walks," that is, lives, under the power of it.
"Natural" is his characteristic word for the unrenewed man ([Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014).md) as "spiritual" designates the
renewed man who walks in the Spirit; ([Co1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001).md); ([Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 7:15</span></span>

I do I allow not

The apostle personifies the strife of the two natures in the believer,
the old or Adamic nature, and the divine nature received through the new
birth ([Pe1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023).md); ([Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004).md); ([Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020).md); ([Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027).md). The "I" which is Saul of
Tarsus, and the "I" which is Paul the apostle are at strife, and "Paul"
is in defeat. In Chapter 8, this strife is effectually taken up on the
believer's behalf by the Holy Spirit; ([Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002).md); ([Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016).md); ([Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017).md) and Paul is victorious.

Contrast ([Eph 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012).md) where the
conflict is not fleshly, but spiritual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 7:21</span></span>

law

Six "laws" are to be distinguished in Romans:

The law of Moses, which condemns ([Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019).md);

The "law" as a principle, ([Rom 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021).md);

The law of faith, which excludes self-righteousness ([Rom
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027).md);

The law of sin in the members, which is victorious over the law of the
mind ([Rom 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#021).md); ([Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023).md); ([Rom
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025).md);

The law of the mind, which consents to the law of Moses, but cannot do
it because of the law of sin in the members ([Rom
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016).md); ([Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023).md);

and, The "law of the Spirit," having power to deliver the believer from
the law of sin which is in his members, and his conscience from
condemnation by the Mosaic law.

Moreover, the Spirit works in the yielded believer the very
righteousness which Moses' law requires ([Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002).md); ([Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004).md).

Or, out of this body of death. ([Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011).md); ([Co1
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051).md); ([Co1
