These are the beasts

The dietary regulations of the covenant people must be regarded
primarily as sanitary. Israel, it must be remembered, was a nation
living on the earth under a theocratic government. Of necessity the
divine legislation concerned itself with the social as well as with the
religious life of the people. To force upon every word of that
legislation a typical meaning is to strain ([Co1
10:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001).md); ([Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023).md); ([Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024).md) beyond all reasonable
interpretation.

[Leviticus 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#006.md)

hare

Hebrew, arnebeth, an unidentified animal, but certainly not a hare,
possessing as it is said to, characteristics not possessed by the hare.
The supposed error in the text is due entirely to the translators'
assumption that the English hare and the ancient "arnebeth" were
identical.
