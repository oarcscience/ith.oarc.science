### [Acts Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md)

[Acts 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 3:19</span></span>

refreshing

"Namely, seasons in which, through the appearance of the Messiah in His
kingdom, there shall occur blessed rest and refreshment for the people
of God." -- Heinrich A. W. Meyer.

sins

Sin

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023).md).

[Acts 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 3:20</span></span>

And he shall

The appeal here is national to the Jewish people as such, not
individuals as in Peter's first sermon ([Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038).md); ([Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039).md). There those who were pricked in
heart were exhorted to save themselves from (among) the untoward nation;
here the whole people is addressed, and the promise to national
repentance is national deliverance: "and he shall send Jesus Christ" to
bring in the times which the prophets had foretold.

(See Scofield) - ([Act 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014).md).

The official answer was the imprisonment of the apostles, and the
inhibition to preach, so fulfilling ([Luk
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#014).md).

[Acts 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 3:21</span></span>

restitution

(Greek, "apokatastasis"", means "restoration", occurring here and ([Act
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006)) only..md) The meaning is limited by
the words: "Which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
prophets." The prophets speak of the restoration of Israel to the land

(See "Israel,"; ([Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002).md); ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003).md); ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026).md);

also "Palestinian Covenant," ([Deu
30:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Deu 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003).md);

and of the restoration, the theocracy, under David's Son.

(See "Davidic Covenant," ([Sa2
7:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Sa2 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016).md),

"Kingdom," ([Gen 1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008).md).

No prediction of the conversion and restoration of the wicked dead is
found in the prophets, or elsewhere.

Compare ([Rev 20:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011).md).

[Acts 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025.md)

children

(Greek, "uihos", "sons").
