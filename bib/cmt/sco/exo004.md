### [Exodus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 4:2</span></span>

rod

"Sign of the rod" means "power", ([Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002).md); ([Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009).md); ([Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027).md). It was Moses' shepherd's crook,
the tool of his calling. Cast down, it became a serpent; taken up in
faith, it became "the rod of God"; ([Exo
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020).md); ([Exo
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#012).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#012).md)

[Exodus 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 4:6</span></span>

Put now thine hand

The sign of leprosy. The heart ("bosom") stands for what we are, the
hand for what we do. What we are, that ultimately we do. It is a sign of
([Luk 6:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#043).md). The two signs, rod and
hand, speak of preparation for service:

\(1\) consecration -- our capacity taken up for God;

\(2\) the hand that holds the rod of God's power must be a cleansed hand
swayed by a new heart.

[Exodus 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 4:14</span></span>

Aaron the Levite

(Cf) ([Exo 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001).md).

[Exodus 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 4:21</span></span>

harden his heart

(Cf) ([Exo 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#015).md); ([Exo
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#032).md); ([Exo
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#034).md). In the face of the righteous
demand of Jehovah and of the tremendous attestations by miracle that He
was indeed God, and that Moses and Aaron were His representatives,
Pharaoh "hardened his heart." Instrumentally God hardened Pharaoh's
heart by forcing him to an issue against which he hardened his own heart
in refusal. Light rejected, rightful obedience refused, inevitably
hardens conscience and heart. ([Rom
9:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017).md).

[Exodus 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 4:24</span></span>

kill him

(Cf) ([Gen 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#014).md) The context ([Gen
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025).md) interprets v. 25. Moses was
forgetful of the very foundation sign of Israel's covenant relation to
Jehovah. On the eve of delivering Israel he was thus reminded that
without circumcision an Israelite was cut off from the covenant. ([Jos
5:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#003).md).
