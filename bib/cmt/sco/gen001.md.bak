### [Genesis Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 1:1</span></span>

Note: For Index to Scofield Materials

(See Scofield) - ([Hos 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009).md); ([Hos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014).md).

God

"Elohim" (sometimes "El" or "Elah"), English form "God," the first of
the three primary names of Deity, is a uni-plural noun formed from "El",
means "strength", or "the strong one", and "Alah", "to swear", "to bind
oneself by an oath", so implying "faithfulness". This uni-plurality
implied in the name is directly asserted in ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)) (plurality.md), ([Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027)) (unity.md); see also ([Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022).md). The Trinity is latent in
Elohim. As meaning primarily the Strong One it is fitly used in the
first chapter of Genesis. Used in the Old Testament about 2500 times.

created

But three creative acts of God are recorded in this chapter:

1\. heavens and the earth ([Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001).md)

2\. animal life ([Gen 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021).md)

3\. human life ([Gen 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027).md)

The first creative act refers to the dateless past, and gives scope for
all the geologic ages.

[Genesis 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 1:2</span></span>

without form and void;

([Jer 4:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023).md); ([Isa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001).md); ([Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018).md) clearly indicate that the earth
had undergone a cataclysmic change as the result of divine judgment. The
face of the earth bears everywhere the marks of such a catastrophe.
There are not wanting imitations which connect it with a previous
testing and fall of angels.

See ([Eze 28:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012).md); ([Isa
14:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009).md) which certainly go beyond the
kings of Tyre and Babylon.

[Genesis 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 1:3</span></span>

Let there be light

Neither here nor in ([Gen 1:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014).md) is
an original creative act implied. A different word is used. The sense
is, made to appear; made visible. The sun and moon were created "in the
beginning." The "light" of course came from the sun, but the vapour
diffused the light. Later the sun appeared in an unclouded sky.

[Genesis 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 1:5</span></span>

day

The word "day" is used in Scripture in three ways:

\(1\) that part of the solar day of twenty-four hours which is light
([Gen 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#005).md); ([Gen
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014).md); ([Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004).md); ([Joh
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009).md).

\(2\) such a day, set apart for some distinctive purpose, as, "day of
atonement" ([Lev 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027).md); "day of
judgment" ([Mat 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#015).md).

\(3\) a period of time, long or short, during which certain revealed
purposes of God are to be accomplished, as "day of the Lord."

evening

The use of "evening" and "morning" may be held to limit "day" to the
solar day; but the frequent parabolic use of natural phenomena may
warrant the conclusion that each creative "day" was a period of time
marked off by a beginning and ending.

[Genesis 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 1:6</span></span>

firmament

Literally, expanse (that is, of waters beneath, of vapour above).

[Genesis 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 1:8</span></span>

firmament

That is, the expanse above, the "heaven" of the clouds. ([Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011).md); ([Gen
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#002).md).

[Genesis 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 1:11</span></span>

bring forth grass

It is by no means necessary to suppose that the life-germ of seeds
perished in the catastrophic judgment which overthrew the primitive
order. With the restoration of dry land and light the earth would "bring
forth" as described. It was "animal" life which perished, the traces of
which remain as fossils. Relegate fossils to the primitive creation, and
no conflict of science with the Genesis cosmogony remains.

[Genesis 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 1:16</span></span>

greater light

The "greater light" is a type of Christ, the "Sun of righteousness"
([Mal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002).md). He will take this
character at His second advent. Morally the world is now in the state
between; ([Gen 1:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003).md); ([Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012).md); ([Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018).md); ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md). The sun is not seen, but there
is light. Christ is that light ([Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004).md); ([Joh
1:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005).md) but "shineth in darkness,"
comprehended only by faith. As "Son of righteousness" He will dispel all
darkness. Dispensationally the Church is in place as the "lesser light,"
the moon, reflecting the light of the unseen sun. The stars ([Gen
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016).md) are individual believers who are
"lights"; ([Phi 2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015).md); ([Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005).md).

A type is a divinely purposed illustration of some truth. It may be:

\(1\) a person ([Rom 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014).md)

\(2\) an event ([Co1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011).md)

\(3\) a thing ([Heb 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020).md)

\(4\) an institution ([Heb 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011).md)

\(5\) a ceremonial ([Co1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007).md).

Types occur most frequently in the Pentateuch, but are found, more
sparingly, elsewhere. The antitype, or fulfillment of the type, is
found, usually, in the New Testament .

made

The word does not imply a creative act; ([Gen
1:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014).md) are declarative of function
merely.

[Genesis 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 1:17</span></span>

heaven

That is, the "heaven" of the stars; for example ([Gen
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005).md); ([Luk
23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043).md).

[Genesis 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 1:21</span></span>

every living creature

The second clause, "every living creature," as distinguished from fishes
merely, is taken up again in ([Gen
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024).md); showing that in the second
creative act all animal life is included.

[Genesis 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 1:24</span></span>

living creature

"Creature," Hebrew, Nephesh, translated Soul in ([Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md) and usually. In itself nephesh,
or soul, implies self-conscious life, as distinguished from plants,
which have unconscious life. In the sense of self-conscious life animals
also have "soul."

See ([Gen 1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md); ([Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md); ([Gen
2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md).

[Genesis 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 1:26</span></span>

make man in our image

Man. ([Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md); ([Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027).md); gives the general, ([Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md); ([Gen
2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021).md) the particular account of the
creation of man. The revealed facts are:

\(1\) Man was created not evolved. This is

\(a\) expressly declared, and the declaration is confirmed by Christ
([Mat 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#014).md); ([Mar
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#006).md);

\(b\) "an enormous gulf, a divergence practically infinite" (Huxley)
between the lowest man and the highest beast, confirms it;

\(c\) the highest beast has no trace of God-consciousness -- the
religious nature;

\(d\) science and discovery have done nothing to bridge that "gulf."

\(2\) That man was made in the "image and likeness" of God. This image
is found chiefly in man's tri-unity, and in his moral nature. Man is
"spirit and soul and body" ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023).md).

"Spirit" is that part of man which "knows" ([Co1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011).md) and which allies him to the
spiritual creation and gives him God-consciousness. "Soul" in itself
implies self-consciousness life, as distinguished from plants, which
have unconscious life. In that sense animals also have "soul" ([Gen
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024).md). But the "soul" of man has a
vaster content than "soul" as applied to beast life. It is the seat of
emotions, desires, affections ([Psa
42:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001).md). The "heart" is, in Scripture
usage, nearly synonymous with "soul." Because the natural man is,
characteristically, the soulual or physical man, "soul" is often used as
synonymous with the individual, for example ([Gen
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005).md). The body, separable from spirit
and soul, and susceptible to death, is nevertheless an integral part of
man, as the resurrection shows; ([Joh
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028).md); ([Joh
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029).md); ([Co1
15:47-50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047).md); ([Rev
20:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011).md). It is the seat of the
senses (the means by which the spirit and soul have world-consciousness)
and of the fallen Adamic nature. ([Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023).md); ([Rom
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024).md).

DISPENSATION

A dispensation is a period of time during which man is tested in respect
of obedience to some specific revelation of the will of God. Seven such
dispensations are distinguished in Scripture.

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028).md), note 5.

And God blessed them

The First Dispensation: Innocency. Man was created in innocency, placed
in a perfect environment, subjected to an absolutely simple test, and
warned of the consequence of disobedience. The woman fell through pride;
the man deliberately. ([Ti1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014).md) God
restored His sinning creatures, but the dispensation of innocency ended
in the judgment of the Expulsion ([Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024).md) See, for the other
dispensations;

Conscience

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#023).md).

Human Government

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021).md).

Promise

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001).md).

Law

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008).md).

Grace

Kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010).md).

Be fruitful

The Edenic Covenant, the first of the eight great covenants of Scripture
which condition life and salvation, and about which all Scripture
crystallizes, has seven elements. The man and woman in Eden were
responsible:

\(1\) To replenish the earth with a new order -- man;

\(2\) to subdue the earth to human uses;

\(3\) to have dominion over the animal creation;

\(4\) to eat herbs and fruits;

\(5\) to till and keep the garden;

\(6\) to abstain from eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil;

\(7\) the penalty -- death. See, for the other seven covenants:
