righteousness of God

The righteousness of God is neither an attribute of God, not the changed
character of the believer, but Christ Himself, who fully met in our
stead and behalf every demand of the law, and who is, but the act of God
called imputation ([Lev 25:50](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#050).md); ([Jam
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023).md); "made unto us . .
righteousness" ([Co1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030).md).

"The believer in Christ is now, by grace, shrouded under so complete and
blessed a righteousness that the law from Mt. Sinai can find neither
fault nor diminution therein. This is that which is called the
righteousness of God by faith." -- Bunyan.

([Co2 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md); ([Rom
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006).md); ([Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004).md); ([Phi

sinned

Sin, Summary:

The literal meanings of the Hebrew, and (Greek, "hamartanō", "sin,"
"sinner", etc), disclose the true nature of sin in its manifold
manifestations.

Sin is transgression, an overstepping of the law, the divine boundary
between good and evil ([Psa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001).md);
([Luk 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#029).md); iniquity, an act
inherently wrong, whether expressly forbidden or not; error, a departure
from right; ([Psa 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009).md); ([Rom
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023).md); missing the mark, a failure to
meet the divine standard; trespass, the intrusion of self-will into the
sphere of divine authority ([Eph 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001).md);
lawlessness, or spiritual anarchy ([Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md); unbelief, or an insult to the
divine veracity ([Joh 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#009).md).

Sin originated with Satan ([Isa
14:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012).md); entered the world through
Adam ([Rom 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012).md); was, and is,
universal, Christ alone excepted; ([Rom
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023).md); ([Pe1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022).md); incurs the penalties of
spiritual and physical death; ([Gen
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017).md); ([Gen
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019).md); ([Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004).md); ([Eze
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020).md); ([Rom
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023).md) and has no remedy but in the
sacrificial death of Christ; ([Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026).md); ([Act
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012).md) availed of by faith ([Act
13:38](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#038).md); ([Act
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#039).md).

Sin may be summarized as threefold:

An act, the violation of, or want of obedience to the revealed will of
God;

A state, absence of righteousness;

A nature, enmity toward God.

Redemption

Redemption, "to deliver by paying a price." The New Testament doctrine.
The New Testament records the fulfilment of the Old Testament types and
prophecies of redemption through the sacrifice of Christ. The completed
truth is set forth in the three words which are translated redemption

\(1\) Greek, "agorazo", "to purchase in the market." The underlying
thought is of a slave-market. The subjects of redemption are "sold under
sin" ([Rom 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).md) but are, moreover,
under sentence of death; ([Eze 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004).md);
([Joh 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018).md); ([Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019).md); ([Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019).md); ([Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010).md); and the purchase price is the
blood of the Redeemer who dies in their stead; ([Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013).md); ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md); ([Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028).md); ([Mar
10:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#045).md); ([Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006).md); ([Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md).

\(2\) Greek, "exagorazo", "to buy out of the market." The redeemed are
never again to be exposed to sale;

\(3\) Greek, "lutroo", "to loose," "to set free by paying a price" ([Joh
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032).md); ([Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004).md); ([Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005).md); ([Gal
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#031).md); ([Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013).md); ([Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021).md). Redemption is by sacrifice and
by power

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030).md).

Christ paid the price, the Holy Spirit makes deliverance actual in
experience ([Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Isa 59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).md).

grace

Grace (in salvation), ([Rom 4:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004).md);
([Rom 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017).md).

[Romans 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 3:25</span></span>

propitiation

Literally, a propitiatory sacrifice, through faith by his blood; (Greek,
"hilastērion", "place of propitiation"). The word occurs, ([Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002).md); ([Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010).md) as the translation of the Greek,
"hilasmos", "that which propitiates," "a propitiatory sacrifice."
"Hilasterion" is used by the Septuagint, and ([Heb
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005).md) for "mercy-seat." The mercy-seat
was sprinkled with atoning blood in the day of atonement ([Lev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#014).md) in token that the righteous
sentence of the law had been (typically) carried out, so that what must
else have been a judgment-seat could righteously be a mercy-seat; ([Heb
9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011).md); ([Heb
4:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014).md); a place of communion ([Exo
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#021).md); ([Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022).md).

In fulfilment of the type, Christ is Himself the "hilasmos", "that which
propitiates," and the "hilasterion", "the place of propitiation" -- the
mercy-seat sprinkled with His own blood -- the token that in our stead
He so honoured the law by enduring its righteous sentence that God, who
ever foresaw the cross, is vindicated in having "passed over" sins from
Adam to Moses ([Rom 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013).md) and the sins
of believers under the old covenant

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033).md)

and just in justifying sinners under the covenant. There is no thought
in propitiation of placating a vengeful God, but of doing right by His
holy law and so making it possible for Him righteously to show mercy.

remission

Passing over of sins done aforetime, that is, since Adam.

Compare ([Heb 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015).md).

[Romans 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 3:26</span></span>

righteousness

"His righteousness", here, is God's consistency with His own law and
holiness in freely justifying a sinner who believes in Christ; that is,
one in whose behalf Christ has met every demand of the law ([Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004).md).

[Romans 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 3:28</span></span>

Justification

Justification, Summary:

Justification and righteousness are inseparably united in Scripture by
the fact that the same word (Greek, "dikaios", means "righteous"; Greek,
"dikaioo", means "to justify") is used for both. The believing sinner is
justified because Christ, having borne his sins on the cross, has been
"made unto him righteousness" ([Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030).md).

Justification originates in grace; ([Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).md); ([Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004).md); ([Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005).md) is through the redemptive and
propitiatory work of Christ, who has vindicated the law; ([Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).md); ([Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md); ([Rom
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009).md) is by faith, not works; ([Rom
3:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028).md); ([Rom
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005).md); ([Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001).md); ([Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016).md); ([Gal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008).md); ([Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024).md) and may be defined as the
judicial act of God whereby He justly declares righteous one who
believes on Jesus Christ. It is the Judge Himself ([Rom
8:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031).md) who thus declares. The
justified believer has been in court, only to learn that nothing is laid
to his charge. ([Rom 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001).md); ([Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033).md); ([Rom
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034).md).

[Romans 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 3:31</span></span>

Do we then

The sinner establishes the law in its right use and honour by confessing
his guilt, and acknowledging that by it he is justly condemned. Christ,
on the sinner's behalf, establishes the law by enduring its penalty,
death.

Compare ([Mat 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017).md); ([Mat
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018).md).
