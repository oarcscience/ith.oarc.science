### [Revelation Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001)

[Revelation 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 19:1</span></span>

Salvation

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)).

[Revelation 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 19:4</span></span>

beasts

Living creatures.

(See Scofield) - ([Eze 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005)).

[Revelation 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 19:7</span></span>

wife

The "Lamb's wife" here is the "bride", ([Rev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009)), the Church, identified with the
"heavenly Jerusalem", ([Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022));
([Heb 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)), and to be distinguished
from Israel, the adulterous and repudiated "wife" of Jehovah, yet to be
restored; ([Isa 54:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001)); ([Hos
2:1-17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001)); who is identified with the
earth ([Hos 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023)). A forgiven and
restored wife could not be called either a virgin ([Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)); ([Co2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003)) or a bride.

[Revelation 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 19:8</span></span>

righteousness

The garment is Scripture is a symbol of righteousness. In the bad
ethical sense, it symbolizes self-righteousness (for example, ([Isa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006)); ([Phi
3:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006)) the best that a moral and
religious man under law could do). In the good ethical sense, the
garment symbolizes "the righteousness of God. . .upon all them that
believe."

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021)).

[Revelation 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 19:11</span></span>

saw heaven opened

The vision is of the departure from heaven of Christ and the saints and
angels preparatory to the catastrophe in which Gentile world-power,
headed up in the Beast, is smitten by the "stone cut out without hands".
([Dan 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)); ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)).

white horse

Contrast ([Rev 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002)); ([Psa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004)).

Contrast ([Mat 21:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002)).

Day of the Lord

(Day of Jehovah). ([Isa 2:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010));
([Isa 4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001)); ([Isa
11:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010)); ([Isa
13:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009)); ([Isa
24:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021)); ([Isa
26:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020)); ([Isa
63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001)); ([Isa
66:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015)); ([Rev
19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)).

[Revelation 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 19:17</span></span>

Come

Armageddon (the ancient hill and valley of Megiddo, west of Jordan in
the plain of Jezreel) is the appointed place for the beginning of the
great battle in which the Lord, at His coming in glory, will deliver the
Jewish remnant besieged by the Gentile world-powers under the Beast and
False Prophet. ([Rev 16:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013)); ([Zac
12:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001)).

Apparently, the besieging hosts, whose approach to Jerusalem is
described in ([Isa 10:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028)) alarmed
by the signs which precede the Lord's coming ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029)); ([Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)) have fallen back to Megiddo,
after the events of ([Zac 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002)) where
their destruction begins; a destruction consummated in Moab and the
plains of Idumea. ([Isa 63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001)). This
battle is the first event in "the day of Jehovah" ([Isa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012)) and is the fulfilment of the
smiting-stone prophecy of ([Dan 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)).

[Revelation 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 19:19</span></span>

make war

The day of Jehovah (called, also, "that day," and "the great day") is
that lengthened period of time beginning with the return of the Lord in
glory, and ending with the purgation of the heavens and the earth by
fire preparatory to the new heavens and the new earth. ([Isa
65:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017)); ([Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022)); ([Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013)); ([Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)).

The order of events appears to be:

\(1\) The return of the Lord in glory. ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029)); ([Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)).

\(2\) the destruction of the Beast and his host, "the kings of the earth
and their armies," and the false prophet, which is the "great and
terrible" aspect of the day. ([Rev
19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)).

\(3\) the judgment of the nations. ([Zac
14:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001)); ([Mat
25:31-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)).

\(4\) the thousand years, that is, the kingdom-age. ([Rev
20:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004)).

\(5\) the Satanic revolt and its end. ([Rev
20:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007)).

\(6\) the second resurrection and final judgment ([Rev
20:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011)) and

\(7\) the "day of God," earth purged by fire. ([Pe2
3:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010)).

The day of the Lord is preceded by seven signs:

\(1\) The sending of Elijah. ([Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005)); ([Rev
11:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003)).

\(2\) cosmical disturbances. ([Joe
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001)); ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029)); ([Act
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#019)); ([Act
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#020)); ([Rev
6:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012)).

\(3\) the insensibility of the professing church. ([Th1
5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001)).

\(4\) the apostasy of the professing church, then become "Laodicea".
([Th2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)).

\(5\) the rapture of the true church. ([Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017)).

\(6\) the manifestation of the "man of sin," the Beast. ([Th2
2:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001)).

\(7\) the apocalyptic judgments. (Revelation 11-18).

make war

Armageddon (battle of).

See note, ([Rev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014)); ([Rev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017)).

Beast

The Beast, Summary:

This "Beast" is the "little horn" of ([Dan
7:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024)), and "desolator" of ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)), the "abomination of desolation"
of ([Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)), the "man of sin" of
([Th2 2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)), earth's last and most
awful tyrant, Satan's fell instrument of wrath and hatred against God
and the Jewish saints. He is, perhaps, identical with the rider on the
white horse of ([Rev 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002)), who begins
by the peaceful conquest of three of the ten kingdoms into which the
former Roman empire will then be divided, but who soon establishes the
ecclesiastical and governmental tyranny described in Daniel 7, 9, 11;
Revelation 13. To him, Satan gives the power which he offered to Christ.
([Mat 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008)); ([Mat
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009)); ([Rev
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004)).

See "The great tribulation," ([Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014)).
