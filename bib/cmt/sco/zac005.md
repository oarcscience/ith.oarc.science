### [Zechariah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001)

flying roll

A "roll," in Scripture symbolism, means the written word whether of God
or man ([Eze 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#002)); ([Jer
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#002)); ([Jer
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#004)); ([Jer
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#006)); etc: ([Eze
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001)). Zechariah's eighth vision is
of the rebuke of sin by the word of God.

The two sins mentioned really transgress both tables of the law. To
steal is to set aside our neighbor's right; to swear is to set aside
God's claim to reverence. As always the law can only curse ([Zac
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003)); ([Gal
3:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010)).

What is it

In the vision of the ephah local and prophetic elements are to be
distinguished. The elements are: an ephah or measure; a woman in the
ephah; a sealing weight upon the mouth of the ephah confining the woman,
and the stork-winged women whose only function is to bear the ephah and
woman away into Babylonia (Shinar). The thing thus symbolized was
"through all the land" ([Zac 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006)).

Symbolically, a "measure" (or "cup") stands for something which has come
to the full, so that God must judge it ([Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002)); ([Jer
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013)); ([Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006)); ([Hab
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#007)); ([Mat
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002)); ([Mat
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032)). A woman, in the bad ethical
sense, is always a symbol of that which, religiously, is out of its
place. The "woman" in ([Mat 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033)) is
dealing with doctrine, a sphere forbidden to her ([Ti1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012)). In Thyatira a woman is suffered
to teach ([Rev 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020)). The Babylon
phase of the apostate church is symbolized by an unchaste woman, sodden
with the greed and luxury of commercialism. ([Rev
17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001)); ([Rev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003)); ([Rev
18:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#011)).

The local application of Zechariah's ninth vision is, therefore,
evident. The Jews then in the land had been in captivity in Babylon.
Outwardly they had put away idolatry, but they had learned in Babylon
that insatiate greed of gain ([Neh
5:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001)); ([Mal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008)) that intense commercial spirit
which had been foreign to Israel as a pastoral people, but which was
thenceforward to characterize them through the ages. These things were
out of place in God's people and land. Symbolically He judged them as
belonging to Babylon and sent them there to build a temple -- they could
have no part in His. The "woman" was to be "set there upon her own base"
([Zac 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#011)). It was Jehovah's moral
judgment upon Babylonism in His own land and people.

Prophetically, the application to the Babylon of the Revelation is
obvious. The professing Gentile church at that time condoning every
iniquity of the rich, doctrinally a mere "confusion," as the name
indicates, and corrupted to the core by commercialism, wealth, and
luxury, falls under the judgment of God (Revelation 18).
