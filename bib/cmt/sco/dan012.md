thy people

That is, Daniel's people, the Jews.

Compare ([Dan 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015).md); ([Dan

end

The "time of the end" in Daniel. The expression, or its equivalent, "in
the end," occurs, ([Dan 8:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017).md);
([Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md); ([Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035).md); ([Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md); ([Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045).md); ([Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004).md); ([Dan
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006).md); ([Dan
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009).md).

Summary:

\(1\) The time of the end in Daniel begins with the violation by "the
prince that shall come" (that is, "little horn," "man of sin," "Beast")
of his covenant with the Jews for the restoration of the temple and
sacrifice ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md) and his
presentation of himself as God; ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md); ([Dan
11:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036).md); ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).md); ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004).md); ([Rev
13:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004).md) and ends with his destruction
by the appearing of the Lord in glory. ([Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).md); ([Rev
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019).md); ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020).md).

\(2\) The duration of the "time of the end" is three and one half years,
coinciding with the last half of the seventieth week of Daniel. ([Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md); ([Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007).md); ([Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005).md).

\(3\) This "time of the end" is the "time of Jacob's trouble." ([Jer
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007).md) "a time of trouble such as never
was since there was a nation" ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md) "great tribulation such as was
not from the beginning of the world. . . nor ever shall be" ([Mat
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021).md). The New Testament, especially
the Book of the Revelation, adds many details.

[Daniel 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 12:10</span></span>

many shall be

A prophecy describing the moral state of the world from Daniel's day to
the time of the end.

Compare ([Mat 13:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#024).md); ([Mat
13:36-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#036).md); ([Mat
13:47-49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047).md).

[Daniel 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 12:11</span></span>

abomination

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md).

[Daniel 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 12:12</span></span>

thousand three hundred and five and thirty days

Three periods of "days" date from the "abomination" (that is, The
blasphemous assumption of deity by the Beast, ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011).md); ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).md); ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004).md).

\(1\) Twelve hundred and sixty days to the destruction of the Beast
([Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md); ([Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007).md); ([Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005).md); ([Rev
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019).md); ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020).md). This is also the duration of
the great tribulation

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004).md).

\(2\) Dating from the same event is a period of 1290 days, and addition
of thirty days ([Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011).md).

\(3\) Again forty-five days are added, and with them the promise of
([Dan 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012).md). No account is directly
given of that which occupies the interval of seventy-five days between
the end of the tribulation and the full blessing of verse 12 ([Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012).md). It is suggested that the
explanation may be found in the prophetic descriptions of the events
following the battle of Armageddon. ([Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014).md); ([Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021).md). The Beast is destroyed, and
Gentile world-dominion ended, by the smiting of the "Stone cut out
without hands" at the end of the 1260 days, but the scene is, so to
speak, filled with the debris of the image which the "wind" must carry
away before full blessing comes in ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035).md).

[Daniel 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 12:13</span></span>

days

That is, of the 1260, 1290, and 1335 days.
