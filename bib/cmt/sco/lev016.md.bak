### [Leviticus Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 16:5</span></span>

goats

The two goats. The offering of the high priest for himself has no
anti-type in Christ ([Heb 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026).md); ([Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027).md). The typical interest centers
upon the two goats and the high priest. Typically...

1\. All is done by the high priest ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)) "by Himself".md), the people only
bring the sacrifice; ([Mat 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047).md);
([Mat 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024).md); ([Mat
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#025).md).

2\. The goat slain (Jehovah's lot) is that aspect of Christ's work which
vindicates the holiness and righteousness of God as expressed in the law
([Rom 3:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).md) and is expiatory.

3\. The living goat typifies that aspect of Christ's work which puts
away our sins from before God ([Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026).md); ([Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033).md); ([Rom
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034).md).

4\. The high priest entering the holiest, typifies Christ entering
"heaven itself" with "His own blood" for us ([Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011).md); ([Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md). His blood makes that to be a
"throne of grace," and "mercy seat" which else must have been a throne
of judgment.

5\. For us, the priests of the New Covenant, there is what Israel never
had, a rent veil ([Mat 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051).md); ([Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).md); ([Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020).md). So that, for worship and
blessing, we enter, in virtue of His blood, where He is, into the
holiest; ([Heb 4:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014).md); ([Heb
10:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).md). The atonement of Christ, as
interpreted by the Old Testament sacrificial types, has these necessary
elements:

\(1\) It is substitutionary-the offering takes the offerer's place in
death.

\(2\) The law is not evaded but honored-every sacrificial death was an
execution of the sentence of the law.

\(3\) The sinlessness of Him who bore our sins is expressed in every
animal sacrifice-it must be without blemish.

\(4\) The effect of the atoning work of Christ is typified

\(a\) in the promises, "it shall be forgiven him"; and

\(b\) in the peace-offering, the expression of fellowship-the highest
privilege of the saint.

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033).md)

atonement

The biblical use and meaning of the word must be sharply distinguished
from its use in theology. In theology it is term which covers the whole
sacrificial and redemptive work of Christ. In the Old Testament
atonement is the English word used to translate the Hebrew words which
mean "cover," "coverings," or "to cover." Atonement (at-one-ment) is,
therefore, not a translation of the hebrew, but a purely theologic
concept. The Levitical offerings "covered" the sins of Israel until, and
in anticipation of the Cross, but did not "take away" ([Heb
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004).md) those sins. These were the "sins
done aforetime" ("covered" meantime by the Levitical sacrifices), which
God "passed over" ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md) for
which "passing over" God's righteousness was never vindicated until, in
the Cross, Jesus Christ was "set forth a propitiation." See
"Propitiation,"

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md).

It was the Cross, not the Levitical sacrifices which made "at-one-ment."
The Old Testament sacrifices enabled God to go on with a guilty people
because they typified the Cross. To the offerer they were the confession
of his desert of death, and the expression of his faith; to God they
were the "shadows" ([Heb 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001).md) of
which Christ was the reality.

out unto the altar

dispensationally, for Israel, this is yet future; the High Priest is
still in the holiest. When He comes out to His ancient people they will
be converted and restored ([Rom
11:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023).md); ([Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md); ([Zac
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012).md); ([Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001).md); ([Rev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007).md) Meantime, believers of this
dispensation as priests ([Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md)
enter into the holiest where He is. ([Heb
10:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).md).
