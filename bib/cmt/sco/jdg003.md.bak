Groves

Groves, like high places, have been associated with idolatrous worship
from time immemorial. The Hebrew, asherah, translated, grove means also
the idol enshrined there. ([Deu
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021).md). This idol seems often to have
been a sacred tree, the figure of which is constantly found on Assyrian
monuments. In apostate Israel, however, such groves were associated with
every form of idolatry, for example ([Kg2
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016).md); ([Kg2
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#017).md),

(See Scofield) - ([Kg1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002).md)

and Ashtaroth

(See Scofield) - ([Jdg 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013).md).
