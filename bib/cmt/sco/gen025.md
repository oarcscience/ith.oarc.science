[Genesis 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001)

Keturah

As Sarah stands for "the mother of us all," that is, of those who, by
grace, are one with the true Son of promise, of whom Isaac was the type
([Joh 3:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)); ([Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026)); ([Gal
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028)); ([Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029)); ([Heb
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011)) and joint heirs of His
wealth; ([Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)); ([Rom
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016)); ([Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)); so Keturah (wedded after the
full blessing of Isaac) and her children by Abraham may well stand for
the fertility of Israel the natural seed, Jehovah's wife ([Hos
2:1-23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001)) after the future national
restoration under the Palestinian covenant.

(See Scofield) - ([Deu 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003)).

[Genesis 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 25:25</span></span>

Esau

Esau stands for the mere man of the earth. ([Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016)); ([Heb
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017)). In many respects a nobler man,
naturally, than Jacob, he was destitute of faith, and despised the
birthright because it was a spiritual thing, of value only as there was
faith to apprehend it.

[Genesis 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 25:31</span></span>

birthright

The "birthright" had three elements:

\(1\) Until the establishment of the Aaronic priesthood the head of the
family exercised priestly rights.

\(2\) The Abrahamic family held the Edenic promise of the Satan-Bruiser
([Gen 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015)). -- Abel, Seth, Shem,
Abraham, Isaac, Esau.

\(3\) Esau, as the firstborn, was in the direct line of the Abrahamic
promise of the Earth-Blesser ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003)).

For all that was revealed, in Esau might have fulfilled those two great
Messianic promises. This birthright Esau sold for a momentary fleshly
gratification. Jacob's conception of the birthright at that time was,
doubtless, carnal and inadequate, but his desire for it evidenced true
faith.
