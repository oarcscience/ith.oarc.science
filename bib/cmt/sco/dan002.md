Chaldeans

That is, the men having the ancient wisdom; the learned; Chaldeans par
excellence ([Dan 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#013).md). "wise"

Syriack \[Syriac\]

From ([Dan 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#004).md); ([Dan
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#028).md) the Book of Daniel is written in
Aramaic, the ancient language of Syria, and substantially identical with
Chaldaic, the language of ancient Babylonia. Upon this fact, together
with the occurrence of fifteen Persian, and three Greek words has been
based an argument against the historicity of Daniel, and in favour of a
date after the conquest of Palestine by Alexander (B.C. 332). It has,
however, seemed, with some modern exceptions, to the Hebrew and
Christian scholarship of the ages an unanswerable proof rather of the
Danielic authorship of the book that, living from boyhood in a land the
language of which was Chaldaic, a great part of his writing should be in
that tongue. It has often been pointed out that the Chaldaic of Daniel
is of high antiquity, as is shown by comparison with that of the
Targums. The few words of Persian and Greek in like manner confirm the
writer's residence at a court constantly visited by emissaries from
those peoples. It is noteworthy that the Aramaic section is precisely
that part of Daniel which most concerned the peoples amongst whom he
lived, and to whom a prophecy written in Hebrew would have been
unintelligible. The language returns to Hebrew in the predictive
portions which have to do with the future of Israel.

"The Hebrew of Daniel is closely related to that of Ezekiel." --
Delitzsch.

what should come

Times (of the Gentiles)

([Dan 2:29-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029).md); ([Rev
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019).md); ([Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024).md).

[Daniel 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">dan 2:31</span></span>

great image

The monarchy-vision. Nebuchadnezzar's dream, as interpreted by Daniel,
gives the course and end of "the times of the Gentiles" ([Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019).md)

That is, of Gentile world-empire. The four metals composing the image
are explained as symbolizing ([Dan
2:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038).md) four empires, not necessarily
possessing the inhabited earth, but able to do so ([Dan
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038).md), and fulfilled in Babylon,
Media-Persia, Greece (under Alexander), and Rome. The latter power is
seen divided, first into two (the legs), fulfilled in the Eastern and
Western Roman empires, and then into ten (the toes)

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026).md).

As a whole, the image gives the imposing outward greatness and splendour
of the Gentile world-power.

The smiting Stone ([Dan 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034).md); ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035).md) destroys the Gentile
world-system (in its final form) by a sudden and irremediable blow, not
by the gradual processes of conversion and assimilation; and then, and
not before, does the Stone become a mountain which fills "the whole
earth."

(Compare ([Dan 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026).md); ([Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027).md).

Such a destruction of the Gentile monarchy-system did not occur at the
first advent of Christ. On the contrary, He was put to death by the
sentence of an officer of the fourth empire, which was then at the
zenith of its power. Since the crucifixion the Roman empire has followed
the course marked out in the vision, but Gentile world dominion still
continues, and the crushing blow is still suspended. The detail of the
end-time is given in ([Dan 7:1-28](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001).md);
and Revelation 13-19. It is important to see

\(1\) that Gentile world-power is to end in a sudden catastrophic
judgment

(see "Armageddon," ([Rev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014).md); ([Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021).md).

\(2\) that it is immediately followed by the kingdom of heaven, and that
the God of the heavens does not set up His kingdom till after the
destruction of the Gentile world-system. It is noteworthy that Gentile
world-dominion begins and ends with a great image. ([Dan
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#031).md); ([Rev
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014).md); ([Rev
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015).md).

[Daniel 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">dan 2:35</span></span>

mountain

A mountain is one of the bibical symbols of a kingdom.

(See Scofield) - ([Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002).md).

[Daniel 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">dan 2:38</span></span>

wheresoever the children

This is universal dominion. It was never fully realized, but power was
given for it.

[Daniel 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">dan 2:41</span></span>

but there shall be

From the "head of gold" ([Dan 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038).md) to
the "iron" of the "fourth kingdom" (Rome) there is deterioration in
fineness, but increase of strength ([Dan
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#040).md). Then comes the deterioration of
the "fourth kingdom" in that very quality, strength.

\(1\) Deterioration by division: The kingdom is divided into two, the
legs (Eastern and Western empires), and these are again divided into
kingdoms, the number of which when the Stone smites the image will be
ten toes, ([Dan 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#042).md); Compare ([Dan
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#023).md); ([Dan
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024).md).

\(2\) Deterioration by admixture; the iron of the Roman imperium mixed
with the clay of the popular will, fickle and easily moulded. This is
precisely what has come to pass in the constitutional monarchies which,
the Republic of France and the despotism of Turkey, cover the sphere of
ancient Roman rule.

[Daniel 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">dan 2:44</span></span>

and in the days

The passage fixes authoritatively the time relative to other predicted
events, when the kingdom of the heavens will be set up. It will be "in
the days of those kings," that is, the days of the ten kings (compare
([Dan 7:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024).md) symbolized by the toes
of the image. That condition did not exist at the advent of Messiah, nor
was it even possible until the dissolution of the Roman empire, and the
rise of the present national world system.

See "Kingdom (Old Testament)"; ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md); ([Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008).md).

"Kingdom (New Testament)"; ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031).md); ([Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028).md);

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md)

note (defining "kingdom of heaven"). Verse 45 repeats the method by
which the kingdom will be set up.

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#031).md); ([Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005).md); ([Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md); ([Zac
14:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001).md); ([Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009).md).

Compare ([Gen 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001).md) Lot the
compromiser with Daniel the inflexible.
