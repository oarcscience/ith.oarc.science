Book Introduction - Colossians

Writer: The Apostle Paul ([Col 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001)).

Date: Colossians was sent by the same messenger who bore Ephesians and
Philemon, and was probably written at the same time.

Theme: Epaphras, who laboured in the Word in the assembly at Colosse,
was Paul's fellow-prisoner at Rome. Doubtless from him Paul learned the
state of that church. As to fundamentals that state was excellent ([Col
1:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003)), but in a subtle way two forms
of error were at work: The first was legality in its Alexandrian form of
asceticism, "touch not, taste not," with a trace of the Judaic
observance of "days"; the object of which was the mortification of the
body (cf [Rom 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013)). The second form
of error was false mysticism, "intruding into those things which he hath
not seen"--the result of philosophic speculation. Because these are ever
present perils, Colossians was written, not for that day only, but for
the warning of the church in all days.

The Epistle is in seven divisions:

1\. Introduction (Colossians 1:1-8).

2\. The apostolic prayer (Colossians 1:9-14).

3\. The exaltation of Christ, Creator, Redeemer, Indweller (Colossians
1:15-29).

4\. The Godhead incarnate in Christ, in whom the believer is complete
(Colossians 2:1-23).

5\. The believer's union with Christ in resurrection life and glory
(Colossians 3:1-4).

6\. Christian living, the fruit of union with Christ (Colossians 3:5 -
4:6).

7\. Christian fellowship (Colossians 4:7-18).
