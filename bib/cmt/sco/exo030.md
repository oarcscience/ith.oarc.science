### [Exodus Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001)

[Exodus 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 30:1</span></span>

incense

Altar of incense, type of Christ our intercessor ([Joh
17:1-26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001)); ([Heb
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025)) through whom our own prayers and
praises ascend to God; ([Heb 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015));
([Rev 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003)); ([Rev
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#004)) and of the believer-priest's
sacrifice of praise and worship ([Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015)).

[Exodus 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 30:5</span></span>

shittim

That is, acacia.

[Exodus 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 30:9</span></span>

strange

Compare ([Lev 10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001)); two
prohibitions are given concerning worship:

\(1\) No "strange" incense is to be offered. This speaks of simulated or
purely formal worship.

\(2\) No "strange" fire was permitted. This refers to the excitation of
"religious" feelings by merely sensuous means, and to the substitution
for devotion to Christ of any other devotion, as to religious causes, or
sects.

Compare ([Co1 1:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011)); ([Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008)); ([Col
2:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016)).

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 30:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#038)).

[Exodus 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 30:10</span></span>

atonement

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033)).

[Exodus 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 30:13</span></span>

This they shall give

Compare ([Exo 38:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025)).

Silver thus becomes a type of redemption.

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#019)).

[Exodus 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 30:18</span></span>

laver

Laver, type of Christ cleansing us from defilement, and from "every spot
or wrinkle or any such thing" ([Joh
13:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002)); ([Eph
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)). It is significant that the
priests could not enter the holy place after serving at the brazen altar
till hands and feet were cleansed.

[Exodus 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 30:31</span></span>

oil

Anointing oil, type of the Holy Spirit for service ([Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008)).

[Exodus 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 30:34</span></span>

frankincense

Frankincense is not to be confounded with incense (to which it was to be
added), as it is often used apart from incense. We are told what
composed the incense -- never in Scripture what the frankincense was.
All speaks of Christ -- the sweet spices of those perfections which we
may apprehend, the frankincense of that which God saw in Jesus
ineffable.

[Exodus 30:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">exo 30:38</span></span>

smell

What is condemned here is making worship a mere pleasure to the natural
man, whether sensuous, as in beautiful music to please the ear, or
eloquence, merely to give delight to the natural mind.

Compare ([Joh 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023)); ([Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024)).
