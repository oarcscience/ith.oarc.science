### [Acts Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)

[Acts 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 9:2</span></span>

of this way

that were of The Way, that is, Christ. ([Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)).

[Acts 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 9:4</span></span>

me?

The Lord identifies Himself with His people.

[Acts 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 9:7</span></span>

voice

Compare ([Act 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009)); ([Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014)).

A contradiction has been imagined. The three statements should be taken
together. The men heard the "voice" as a sound (Greek, "phōnē"), but did
not hear the "voice" as articulating the words, "Saul, Saul," etc).

[Acts 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 9:20</span></span>

that he is the Son of God

Compare ([Act 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036)). Peter, while
maintaining the deity of Jesus -- "God hath made that same Jesus, whom
ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ" -- gives especial prominence to
His Messiahship. Paul, fresh from the vision of the glory, puts the
emphasis on His Deity. Peter's charge was that the Jews had crucified
the Son of David ([Act 2:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025)) Paul's
that they had crucified the Lord of glory ([Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008)). In the A.V. the sense is largely
lost. The point was, not that the Christ was God, a truth plainly taught
by Isaiah. ([Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)); ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)); ([Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007)) but that Jesus, the crucified
Nazarene, was the Christ and therefore God the Son.

[Acts 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 9:22</span></span>

But Saul

It seems probable that ([Act 9:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022))
refer to Paul's labours in Damascus after his return from Arabia ([Gal
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017)).

The "many days" of verse ([Act 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023))
may represent the "three years" of ([Gal
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018)); which intervened between Paul's
return to Damascus and his visit to Peter.

[Acts 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 9:26</span></span>

gone to Jerusalem

The Acts records four visits of Paul to Jerusalem after conversion:

\(1\) ([Act 9:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023)). This seems
identical with the visit of ([Gal
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018)); ([Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019)). The "apostles" of verse ([Act
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027)) were Peter, and James, the
Lord's brother.

\(2\) ([Act 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030)). Paul may have been
in Jerusalem during the events of ([Act
12:1-24](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001)); ([Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025)).

\(3\) ([Act 15:1-30](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001)); ([Gal
2:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002)).

\(4\) ([Act 21:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#017)); ([Act
21:35](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#035)).

[Acts 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 9:29</span></span>

Grecians

Hellenists, that is, Grecian Jews.

[Acts 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 9:36</span></span>

Dorcas

That is, gazelle.

[Acts 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 9:39</span></span>

widows

Contra, ([Act 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)).
