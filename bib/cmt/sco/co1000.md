Book Introduction - 1 Corinthians

Writer: The Apostle Paul. His relation to the church at Corinth is set
forth in [Act 18:1-18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001.md) and in the
Epistles to the Corinthians.

Date: First Corinthians was written in A.D. 59, at the close of Paul's
three year's residence in Ephesus. [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md); [Co1
16:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005.md).

Theme: The subjects treated are various, but may all be classified under
the general theme, Christian conduct. Even the tremendous revelation of
the truth concerning resurrection is made to bear upon that theme [Co1
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058.md). The occasion of the Epistle was
a letter on inquiry from Corinth concerning marriage, and the use of
meats offered to idols ; [Co1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md);
[Co1 8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md) but the apostle was much
more exercised by reports of the deepening divisions and increasing
contentions in the church, and of a case of incest which had not been
judged ; [Co1 1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md); [Co1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md).

The factions were not due to heresies, but to the carnality of the
restless Corinthians, and to their Greek admiration of "wisdom" and
eloquence. The abomination of human leadership in the things of God is
here rebuked. Minor disorders were due to vanity, yielding to a childish
delight in tongue and the sign gifts, rather than to sober instruction
([Co1 14:1-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001).md). Paul defends his
apostleship because it involved the authority of the doctrine revealed
through him.

A rigid analysis of First Corinthians is not possible, The Epistle is
not a treatise, but came from the Spirit through the apostle's grief,
solicitude, and holy indignation. The following analysis may, however,
be helpful.

1\. Introduction: The believer's standing in grace (1 Corinthians
1:1-9).

2\. The contrast of their present factious state (1 Corinthians 1:10 -
4:21).

3\. Immorality rebuked; discipline enjoined (1 Corinthians 5:1 - 6:8).

4\. The sanctity of the body, and Christian marriage (1 Corinthians 6:9
- 7:40).

5\. Meats, and the limitations of Christian liberty (1 Corinthians 8:1 -
11:1).

6\. Christian order and the Lord's Supper (1 Corinthians 11:2-34).

7\. Spiritual gifts in relation to the body, the church, and Christian
ministry (1 Corinthians 12:1 - 14:40).

8\. The resurrection of the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-58).

9\. Special directions and greetings (1 Corinthians 16:1-24).
