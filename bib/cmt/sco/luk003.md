Compare ([Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)); ([Joh

[Luke 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 3:23</span></span>

son of Heli

In Matthew, where unquestionably we have the genealogy of Joseph, we are
told ([Mat 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016)); that Joseph was the
son of Jacob. In what sense, then, could he be called in Luke "the son
of Heli"? He could not be by natural generation the son both of Jacob
and of Heli. But in Luke it is not said that Heli begat Joseph, so that
the natural explanation is that Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, who
was, like himself, a descendant of David. That he should in that case be
called "son of Heli" ("son" is not in the Greek, but rightly supplied by
the translators) would be in accord with Jewish usage.

Compare ([Sa1 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016)).

The conclusion is therefore inevitable that in Luke we have Mary's
genealogy; and Joseph was "son of Heli" because espoused to Heli's
daughter. The genealogy in Luke is Mary's, whose father, Heli, was
descended from David.
