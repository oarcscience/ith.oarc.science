altar

1\. The value of the "life" is the measure of the value of the "blood."
This gives the blood of Christ its inconceivable value. When it was shed
the sinless God-man gave His life. "It is not possible that the blood of
bulls and of goats could take away sins" ([Heb
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004).md).

2\. it is not the blood in the veins of the sacrifice, but the blood
upon the altar which is efficacious. The Scripture knows nothing of
salvation by the imitation or influence of Christ's life, but only by
that life yielded up on the cross.

blood

The meaning of all sacrifice is here explained. Every offering was an
execution of the sentence of the law upon a substitute for the offender,
and every such offering pointed forward to that substitutional death of
Christ which alone vindicated the righteousness of God in passing over
the sins of those who offered the typical sacrifices ([Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).md); ([Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md); ([Exo
29:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036).md).

atonement

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033).md).
