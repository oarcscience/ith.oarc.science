heavens and new earth" for Israel. ([Isa
65:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017)); ([Isa

the Lord said in heart

The Third Dispensation: Human Government. Under Conscience, as in
Innocency, man utterly failed, and the judgment of the Flood marks the
end of the second dispensation and the beginning of the third. The
declaration of the Noahic Covenant subjects humanity to a new test. Its
distinctive feature is the institution, for the first time, of human
government -- the government of man by man. The highest function of
government is the judicial taking of life. All other governmental powers
are implied in that. It follows that the third dispensation is
distinctively that of human government. Man is responsible to govern the
world for God. That responsibility rested upon the whole race, Jew and
Gentile, until the failure of Israel under the Palestinian Covenant
(Deuteronomy 28 - ([Deu 30:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001)))
brought the judgment of the Captivities, when "the times of the
Gentiles" (See); ([Luk 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024)); ([Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014)) began, and the government of
the world passed exclusively into Gentile hands; ([Dan
2:36-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#036)); ([Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024)); ([Act
15:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014)). That both Israel and the
Gentiles have governed for self, not God, is sadly apparent. The
judgment of the confusion of tongues ended the racial testing; that of
the captivities the Jewish; while the Gentile testing will end in the
smiting of the Image (Da 2.) and the judgment of the nations ([Mat
25:31-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)).

See, for the other six dispensations:

INNOCENCE

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028))

CONSCIENCE

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#023))

PROMISE

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001))

LAW

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008))

GRACE

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017))

KINGDOM

(See Scofield) - ([Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010)).
