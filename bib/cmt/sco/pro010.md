### [Proverbs Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001)

[Proverbs 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 10:1</span></span>

foolish son

A "fool" in Scripture is never a mentally deficient person, but rather
one arrogant and self-sufficient; one who orders his life as if there
were no God. See, for illustration, ([Luk
12:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016)). The rich man was not
mentally deficient, but he was a "fool" because he supposed that his
soul could live on the things in the barn, giving no thought to his
eternal wellbeing.

[Proverbs 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#027)

(See Scofield) - ([Psa 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009)).
