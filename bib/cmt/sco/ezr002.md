are the children

Probably individuals from all of the tribes returned to Jerusalem under
Zerubbabel, Ezra and Nehemiah, but speaking broadly, the dispersion of
the ten tribes (Ephraim-Israel) still continues; nor can they now be
positively identified. They are, however, preserved distinct from other
peoples and are known to God as such, though they themselves, few in
number, know Him not ([Deu 28:62](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#062));
([Isa 11:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011)); ([Hos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004)); ([Hos
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#008)).

The order of the restoration was as follows:

\(1\) The return of the first detachment under Zerubbabel and Jeshua
(B.C. 536), Ezra 1-6, and the books of Haggai and Zechariah;

\(2\) the expedition of Ezra (B.C. 458), seventy-eight years later (Ezra
7-10);

\(3\) the commission of Nehemiah (B.C. 444), fourteen years after the
expedition of Ezra. ([Neh 2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001)).
