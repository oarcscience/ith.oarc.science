perfection

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048).md).

impossible

([Heb 6:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004).md) presents the case of
Jewish professed believers who halt short of faith in Christ after
advancing to the very threshold of salvation, even "going along with"
the Holy Spirit in His work of enlightenment and conviction. ([Joh
16:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008).md). It is not said that they had
faith. This supposed person is like the spies at Kadesh-barnea ([Deu
1:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019).md) who saw the land and had the
very fruit of it in their hands, and yet turned back.

partakers

(Greek, "metochos", "going along with").

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).md).
