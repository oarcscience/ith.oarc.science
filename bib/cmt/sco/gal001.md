### [Galatians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001)

[Galatians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 1:3</span></span>

Grace

Grace (in salvation). ([Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006));
([Gal 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015)); ([Gal
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021)); ([Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024)).

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)).

[Galatians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 1:4</span></span>

sins

Sin

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023)).

[Galatians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 1:6</span></span>

grace

The test of the Gospel is grace. If the message excludes grace, or
mingles law with grace as the means of either of justification or
sanctification, ([Gal 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021)); ([Gal
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001)), or denies the fact or guilt of
sin which alone gives grace its occasion and opportunity, it is
"another" gospel, and the preacher of it is under the anathema of God.
([Gal 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008)); ([Gal
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#009)).

[Galatians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 1:10</span></span>

For now do

The demonstration is as follows:

\(1\) The Galatians know Paul, that he is no seeker after popularity.
([Gal 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)).

\(2\) He puts his known character back of the assertion that his Gospel
of grace was a revelation from God. ([Gal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011)); ([Gal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012)).

\(3\) As for the Judaizers, Paul had been a foremost Jew, and had
forsaken Judaism for something better. ([Gal
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013)).

\(4\) He had preached grace years before he saw any of the other
apostles. ([Gal 1:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015)).

\(5\) When he did meet the other apostles they had nothing to add to his
revelations. ([Gal 2:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001)).

\(6\) The other apostles fully recognized Paul's apostleship. ([Gal
2:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#007)).

\(7\) If the legalizers pleaded Peter's authority, the answer was that
he himself had claimed none when rebuked. ([Gal
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011)).

[Galatians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 1:13</span></span>

Jews' religion

The new dispensation of grace having come in, the Mosaic system, if
still persisted in, becomes a mere "Jews' religion."

[Galatians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 1:14</span></span>

religion

In verses 13 and 14 ([Gal 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013)),
the Greek word for "the Jews' religion" is "Ioudaismos", (meaning
"Judaism"). In ([Act 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005)); ([Jam
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026)); ([Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027)), the Greek word "threskeia" --
"religious service" -- is translated as "religion," and in ([Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018)); it is translated as
"worshipping." Excepting ([Jam 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027));
"religion" has always a bad sense, and nowhere is it synonymous with
salvation or spirituality.
