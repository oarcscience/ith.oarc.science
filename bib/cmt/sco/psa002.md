king

The second Psalm gives the order of the establishment of the kingdom. It
is in six parts:

\(1\) The rage of the Gentiles, the vain imagination of "people" (Jews),
and the antagonism of rulers against Jehovah's anointed ([Psa
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001).md). The inspired interpretation of
this is in ([Act 4:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025).md) which
asserts its fulfilment in the crucifixion of Christ.

\(2\) The derision of Jehovah ([Psa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004).md) that men should suppose it
possible to set aside His covenant ([Sa2
7:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008).md) and oath ([Psa
89:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034).md).

\(3\) The vexation ([Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005).md)
fulfilled, first in the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70; and in the
final dispersion of the Jews at that time; and to be fulfilled more
completely in the tribulation ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md) which immediately precedes the
return of the King. ([Mat 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030).md).

\(4\) The establishment of the rejected King upon Zion ([Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md).

\(5\) The subjection of the earth to the King's rule ([Psa
2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007).md) and

\(6\) the present appeal to the world powers. ([Psa
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010).md). See Psalm 8, next in order
of the Messianic Psalms. (Note. Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23, 24, 40, 41, 45,
68, 69, 72, 89, 102, 110, and 118 are considered as Messianic. It is not
questioned that many other Psalms also refer to Christ.

[Psalms 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#011.md)

fear

(See Scofield) - ([Psa 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009).md).

[Psalms 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md)

trust

Trust is the characteristic Old Testament word for the New Testament
"faith," "believe." It occurs 152 times in the Old Testament, and is the
rendering of Hebrew, words signifying to take refuge (for example ([Rut
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#012)) "to lean on" (for example.md) ([Psa
56:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#003)) "to roll on" (for example.md) ([Psa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008)) "to stay upon" (for example.md)
([Job 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014).md).
