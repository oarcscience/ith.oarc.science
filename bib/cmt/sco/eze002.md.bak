### [Ezekiel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 2:1</span></span>

Son of man

"Son of man," used by our Lord of Himself seventy-nine times, is used by
Jehovah ninety one times when addressing Ezekiel.

\(1\) In the case of our Lord the meaning is clear: it is His racial
name as the representative Man in the sense of ([Co1
15:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045).md). The same thought, implying
transcendence of mere Judaism, is involved in the phrase when applied to
Ezekiel. Israel had forgotten her mission.

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#010).md); ([Eze
5:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#005).md).

Now, in her captivity, Jehovah will not forsake His people, but He will
remind them that they are but a small part of the race for whom He also
cares. Hence the emphasis upon the word "man." The Cherubim "had the
likeness of a man" ([Eze 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005).md) and when
the prophet beheld the throne of God, he saw "the likeness as the
appearance of a man above upon it" ([Eze
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020).md); ([Rev
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#012).md); ([Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013).md).

\(2\) As used of Ezekiel, the expression indicates, not what the prophet
is in himself, but what he is to God; a son of man

\(a\) chosen,

\(b\) endued with the Spirit, and

\(c\) sent of God.

All this is true also of Christ who was, furthermore, the representative
man -- the head of regenerate humanity.
