### [Matthew Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 3:2</span></span>

\(1\) The phrase, kingdom of heaven (literally, of the heavens), is
peculiar to Matthew and signifies the Messianic earth rule of Jesus
Christ, the Son of David. It is called the kingdom of the heavens
because it is the rule of the heavens over the earth ([Mat
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#010).md) The phrase is derived from
Daniel, where it is defined; ([Dan
2:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034).md); ([Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044).md); ([Dan
7:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#023).md) as the kingdom which the God
of heaven will set up after the destruction by "the stone cut out
without hands," of the Gentile world-system. It is the kingdom
covenanted to David's seed ([Sa2
7:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#007).md) described in the prophets;

(See Scofield) - ([Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008).md)

and confirmed to Jesus the Christ, the Son of Mary, through the angel
Gabriel ([Luk 1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032).md).

\(2\) The kingdom of heaven has three aspects in Matthew:

\(a\) "at hand" from the beginning of the ministry of John the Baptist
([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md) to the virtual rejection of
the King, and the announcement of the new brotherhood ([Mat
12:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046).md).

b\) in seven "mysteries of the kingdom of heaven," to be fulfilled
during the present age ([Mat 13:1-52](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001).md)
to which are to be added the parables of the kingdom of heaven which
were spoken after those of Mt. 13, and which have to do with the sphere
of Christian profession during this age;

c\) the prophetic aspect -- the kingdom to be set up after the return of
the King in glory. ([Mat 24:29-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md);
([Mat 24:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#046).md); ([Luk
19:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#012).md); ([Act
15:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014).md).

See "Kingdom (New Testament)"; ([Luk
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033).md); ([Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028).md).

Compare "Kingdom of God,"

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 3:7</span></span>

Pharisees

So called from a Hebrew, word meaning "separate." After the ministry of
the post-exilic prophets ceased, godly men called "Chasidim" (saints)
arose who sought to keep alive reverence for the law amongst the
descendants of the Jews who returned from the Babylonian captivity. This
movement degenerated into the Pharisaism of our Lord's day -- a
letter-strictness which overlaid the law with traditional
interpretations held to have been communicated by Jehovah to Moses as
oral explanations of equal authority with the law itself.

Compare ([Mat 15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002).md); ([Mar
7:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#008).md); ([Gal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014).md).

The Pharisees were strictly a sect. A member was "chaber" (i.e. "knit
together,") ([Jdg 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#011).md) and took an
obligation to remain true to the principles of Pharisaism. They were
correct, moral, zealous, and self-denying, but self-righteous ([Luk
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009).md) and destitute of the sense of
sin and need ([Luk 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#039).md). They were
the foremost prosecutors of Jesus Christ and the objects of His
unsparing denunciation (for example); ([Mat
23:13-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013).md); ([Luk
11:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042).md).

Sadducees

Not strictly a sect, but rather those amongst the Jews who denied the
existence of angels or other spirits, and all miracles, especially the
resurrection. They were the religious rationalists of the time ([Mar
12:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018).md); ([Act
5:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015).md); ([Act
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008).md) and strongly entrenched in the
Sanhedrin and priesthood; ([Act 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001).md);
([Act 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017).md). They are identified with
no affirmative doctrine, but were mere deniers of the supernatural.

Suffer it to be so

Why one who needed no repentance should insist upon receiving a rite
which signified confession ([Mat 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006).md)
and repentance ([Mat 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011).md) is nowhere
directly explained. It may be suggested:

\(1\) That Jesus was now to receive His anointing with the Holy Spirit
([Mat 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016).md) unto His threefold office
of Prophet, Priest, and King. In the Levitical order ([Exo
29:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004).md) the high priest was first
washed, then anointed. While Christ's priestly work did not begin till
He "offered Himself without spot to God" ([Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014).md) and His full manifestation as
the King-Priest after the order of Melchizedek awaits the kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018).md)

yet He was then anointed, once for all.

\(2\) But John's baptism was the voice of God to Israel, and the
believing remnant responded ([Mat
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005).md). It was an act of righteousness
on the part of Him who had become, as to the flesh, an Israelite, to
take His place with this believing remnant.

righteousness

(See Scofield) - ([Jo1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007).md).

[Matthew 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 3:16</span></span>

Jesus

For the first time the Trinity, foreshadowed in many ways in the Old
Testament, is fully manifested. The Spirit descends upon the Son, and at
the same moment the Father's voice is heard from heaven.
