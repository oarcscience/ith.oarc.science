### [Matthew Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001)

[Matthew 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 16:9</span></span>

baskets

A different Greek word from that translated "baskets" in ([Mat
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#010)).

baskets

A different Greek word from that translated "baskets" in ([Mat

Son of man

Also ([Mat 16:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027));

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 16:17</span></span>

Barjona

Son of Jonas.

[Matthew 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 16:18</span></span>

Peter

There is the Greek a play upon the words, "thou art Peter \[Greek,
"petros" -- literally 'a little rock\]', and upon this rock \[Greek,
"Petra"\] I will build my church." He does not promise to build His
church upon Peter, but upon Himself, as Peter is careful to tell us.
([Pe1 2:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004)).

church

(Greek, "ecclesia" ("ek", means "out of", "kaleo" means "to call"), an
assembly of called out ones). The word is used of any assembly; the word
itself implies no more, as, for example, the town-meeting at Ephesus
([Act 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039)) and Israel, called out of
Egypt and assembled in the wilderness ([Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038)). Israel was a true "church," but
not in any sense the New Testament church -- the only point of
similarity being that both were "called out" and by the same God. All
else is contrast.

(See Scofield) - ([Act 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038)).

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)).

hell

See (See Scofield) - ([Luk 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023)).

[Matthew 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 16:19</span></span>

keys of the kingdom

Not the keys of the church, but of the kingdom of heaven in the sense of
Matthew 13, that is, the sphere of Christian profession. A key is a
badge of power or authority (cf) ([Isa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022)); ([Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007)). The apostolic history explains
and limits this trust, for it was Peter who opened the door of Christian
opportunity to Israel on the day of Pentecost ([Act
2:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038)) and to Gentiles in the house
of Cornelius. ([Act 10:34-46](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034)). There
was no assumption by Peter of any other authority ([Act
15:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#007)). In the council James, not
Peter, seems to have presided; ([Act
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019)); ([Gal
2:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011)). Peter claimed no more for
himself than to be an apostle by gift ([Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001)) and an elder by office ([Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001)).

The power of binding and loosing was shared ([Mat
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018)); ([Joh
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023)) by the other disciples. That it
did not involve the determination of the eternal destiny of souls is
clear from ([Rev 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018)). The keys of
death and the place of departed spirits are held by Christ alone.

kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002)).

[Matthew 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 16:20</span></span>

charged

The disciples had been proclaiming Jesus as the Christ, that is, the
covenanted King of a kingdom promised to the Jews, and "at hand." The
church, on the contrary, must be built upon testimony to Him as
crucified, risen from the dead, ascended, and made "Head over all things
to the church." ([Eph 1:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020)). The
former testimony was ended, the new testimony was not yet ready, because
the blood of the new covenant had not yet been shed, but our Lord begins
to speak of His death and resurrection ([Mat
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021)). It is a turning-point of
immense significance:

Jesus

Omit "Jesus."

[Matthew 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 16:26</span></span>

world

Greek, "kosmos", means "world-system". ([Joh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008)).

[Matthew 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 16:28</span></span>

his kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002)).
