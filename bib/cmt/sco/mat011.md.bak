### [Matthew Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 11:6</span></span>

blessed

In prison, the King rejected, John's faith wavers; the Lord exhorts and
encourages His servant.

Compare ([Joh 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020).md); ([Isa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003).md).

[Matthew 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 11:11</span></span>

greater

Positionally greater, not morally. John the Baptist was as great
morally, as any man "born of woman," but as to the kingdom he but
announced it at hand. The kingdom did not then come, but was rejected,
and John was martyred, and the King presently crucified. The least in
the kingdom when it is set up in glory

(see "Kingdom (New Testament); ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031).md); ([Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md)

will be in the fullness of power and glory. It is not heaven which is in
question, but Messiah's kingdom.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033).md).

kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

suffereth violence

It has been much disputed whether the "violence" here is external, as
against the kingdom in the persons of John the Baptist and Jesus; or
that, considering the opposition of the scribes and Pharisees, only the
violently resolute would press into it. Both things are true. The King
and His herald suffered violence, and this is the primary and greater
meaning, but also, some were resolutely becoming disciples.

Compare ([Luk 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016).md).

[Matthew 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#014.md)

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010).md).

Also ([Mat 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#012).md); ([Mal

Then

The kingdom of heaven announced as "at hand" by John the Baptist, by the
King Himself, and by the twelve, and attested by mighty works, has been
morally rejected. The places chosen for the testing of the nation,
Chorazin, Bethsaida, etc. having rejected both John and Jesus, the
rejected King now speaks of judgment. The final official rejection is
later. ([Mat 27:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#031).md).

[Matthew 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 11:23</span></span>

hell

(See Scofield) - ([Luk 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023).md).

[Matthew 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 11:27</span></span>

All things

Kingdom.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003).md).

[Matthew 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 11:28</span></span>

Come

The new message of Jesus. The rejected King now turns from the rejecting
nation and offers, not the kingdom, but rest and service to such in the
nation as are conscious of the need. It is a pivotal point in the
ministry of Jesus.
