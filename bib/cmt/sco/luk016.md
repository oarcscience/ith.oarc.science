the kingdom

There

Verses ([Luk 16:19-31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019)) are not said to
be a parable. Rich men and beggars are common; there is no reason why
Jesus may not have had in mind a particular case. In no parable is an
individual named.

hell

(Greek, "hadēs", "the unseen world," is revealed as the place of
departed human spirits between death and resurrection). The word occurs,
([Mat 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023)); ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)); ([Luk
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#015)); ([Act
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027)); ([Act
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#031)); ([Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018)); ([Rev
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008)); ([Rev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013)); ([Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014)) and is the equivalent of the
Old Testament "sheol."

(See Scofield) - ([Hab 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005)).

The Septuagint invariably renders "sheol" by "hades".

Summary:

\(1\) Hades before the ascension of Christ. The passages in which the
word occurs make it clear that hades was formerly in two divisions, the
abodes respectively of the saved and of the lost. The former was called
"paradise" and "Abraham's bosom." Both designations were Talmudic, but
adopted by Christ in ([Luk 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022));
([Luk 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043)). The blessed dead were
with Abraham, they were conscious and were "comforted" ([Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025)). The believing malefactor was
to be, that day, with Christ in "paradise." The lost were separated from
the saved by a "great gulf fixed" ([Luk
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#026)). The representative man of the
lost who are now in hades is the rich man of ([Luk
16:19-31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019)). He was alive, conscious, in
the full exercise of his faculties, memory, etc, and in torment.

\(2\) Hades since the ascension of Christ. So far as the unsaved dead
are concerned, no change of their place or condition is revealed in
Scripture. At the judgment of the great white throne, hades will give
them up, they will be judged, and will pass into the lake of fire ([Rev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013)); ([Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014)). But a change has taken place
which affects paradise. Paul was "caught up to the third heaven. . .into
paradise" ([Co2 12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001)). Paradise,
therefore, is now in the immediate presence of God. It is believed that
([Eph 4:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008)) indicates the time of
the change. "When he ascended up on high he led a multitude of
captives." It is immediately added that He had previously "descended
first into the lower parts of the earth," that is, the paradise division
of Hades. During the present church-age the saved who died are "absent
from the body, at home with the Lord." The wicked dead in hades, and the
righteous dead "at home with the Lord," alike await the resurrection;
([Job 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025)); ([Co1
15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052)).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)).
