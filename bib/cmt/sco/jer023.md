restoration

This final restoration is shown to be accomplished after a period of
unexampled tribulation ([Jer 30:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#003).md)
and in connection with the manifestation of David's righteous Branch
([Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005).md) who is also
Jehovah-tsidkenu ([Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006).md). The
restoration here foretold is not to be confounded with the return of a
feeble remnant of Judah under Ezra, Nehemiah, and Zerubbabel at the end
of the 70 years ([Jer 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md). At His
first advent Christ, David's righteous Branch ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031).md) did not "execute justice and
judgment in the earth," but was crowned with thorns and crucified.
Neither was Israel the nation restored, nor did the Jewish people say,
"The Lord our righteousness." Compare ([Rom
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003).md).

The prophecy is yet to be fulfilled. ([Act
15:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014).md).
