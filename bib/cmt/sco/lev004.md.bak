[Leviticus 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md)

sin-offering

The sin-offering, though still Christ, is Christ seen laden with the
believer's sin, absolutely in the sinner's place and stead, and not, as
in the sweet savour offerings, in His own perfections. It is Christ's
death as viewed in ([Isa 53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001).md);
([Psa 22:1-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001).md); ([Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028).md); ([Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md); ([Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018).md).

But note ([Lev 6:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#024).md) how the
essential holiness of Him who was "made sin for us" ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md) is guarded. The sin-offerings
are expiatory, substitutional, efficacious ([Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012).md); ([Lev
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#029).md); ([Lev
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035).md) and have in view the vindication
of the law through substitutional sacrifice.

without the camp

Compare ([Exo 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#014).md); ([Lev
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#027).md); ([Num
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#003).md); ([Heb
13:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010).md).

The last passage is the interpretative one. The "camp" was Judaism - a
religion of forms and ceremonies. "Jesus, also, that He might sanctify
separate, or set apart for God\] the people with or 'through' His own
blood, suffered without the gate" temple gate, city gate, that is,
Judaism civil and religious\]; ([Heb
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012).md) but how does this sanctify, or
set apart, a people? "Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the
camp Judaism then, Judaized Christianity now-anything religious which
denies Him as our sin-offering\] bearing His reproach" ([Heb
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013).md). The sin-offering, "burned
without the camp," typifies this aspect of the death of Christ. The
cross becomes a new altar, in a new place, where, without the smallest
merit in themselves, the redeemed gather to offer, as believer-priests,
spiritual sacrifices. ([Heb 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015).md);
([Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005).md). The bodies of the
sin-offering beasts were not burned without the camp, as some have
fancied, because "saturated with sin," and unfit for a holy camp.
Rather, an unholy camp was an unfit place for a holy sin-offering. The
dead body of our Lord was not "saturated with sin," though in it our
sins had been borne ([Pe1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md).
