[Psalms 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 45:1</span></span>

Shoshannim

Shoshannim, "lilies," and so, the spring; the Shoshannim Psalms were
probably connected with the Passover season, and hence reminders of
redemption out of bondage, and of the origins of Israel.

king

This great psalm of the King, with Psalms 46-47, obviously looks forward
to the advent in glory. The reference in ([Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008).md); ([Heb
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009).md) is not so much to the anointing
as an event ([Mat 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016).md); ([Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017).md) as to the permanent state of the
King.

Compare ([Isa 11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md).

The divisions are:

\(1\) The supreme beauty of the King ([Psa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001).md); ([Psa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002).md);

\(2\) the coming of the King in glory ([Psa
45:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003).md); ([Rev
19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011).md).

\(3\) the deity of the King and character of His reign ([Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006).md); ([Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007).md); ([Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008).md); ([Heb
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009).md); ([Isa
11:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md).

\(4\) as associated with Him in earthly rule, the queen is presented,
([Psa 45:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009).md) and in that relation
the King is not called Elohim

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001).md)

as in verse 6 ([Psa 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006).md), but Adonai,
the husband name of Deity

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002).md).

\(5\) the virgin companions of the queen, who would seem to be the
Jewish remnant. (See Scofield) - ([Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005).md). ([Rev
14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001).md) are next seen ([Psa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014).md); ([Psa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#015).md); and

\(6\) the Psalm closes with a reference to the earthly fame of the King.

See Psalm 68, next in order of the Messianic Psalms.
