Book Introduction - Malachi

Malachi, "my messenger," the last of the prophets to the restored
remnant after the 70 years' captivity, probably prophesied in the time
of confusion during Nehemiah's absence ([Neh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006)). The burden of his message is,
the love of Jehovah, the sins of the priests and of the people, and the
day of the Lord. Malachi, like Zechariah, sees both advents and predicts
two forerunners ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001); [Mal
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005)). As a whole, Malachi gives the
moral judgement of God on the remnant restored by his grace under Ezra
and Nehemiah. He had established his house among them, but their worship
was formal and insincere.

The book is in four natural divisions:

1\. The love of God for Israel (Malachi 1:1-5).

2\. The sins of the priests rebuked (Malachi 1:6 - 2:9).

3\. The sins of the people rebuked (Malachi 2:10 - 3:18).

4\. The day of the Lord (Malachi 4:1-6).
