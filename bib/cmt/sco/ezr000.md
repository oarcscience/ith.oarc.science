Book Introduction - Ezra

Ezra, the first of the post-captivity books (Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther,
Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi), records the return to Palestine under
Zerubbabel, by decree of Cyrus, of a Jewish remnant who laid the temple
foundations (B.C. 536). Later (B.C. 458) Ezra followed, and restored the
law and ritual. But the mass of the nation, and most of the princes,
remained by preference in Babylonia and Assyria, where they were
prospering. The post-captivity books deal with that feeble remnant which
alone had a heart for God.

The book is in two parts:

1\. From the decree of Cyrus to the dedication of the restored temple
(Ezra 1:1 - 6:22).

2\. The ministry of Ezra (Ezra 7:1 - 10:44).

The events recorded in Ezra cover a period of 80 years (Ussher).
