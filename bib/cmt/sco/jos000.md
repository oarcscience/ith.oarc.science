Book Introduction - Joshua

Joshua records the consummation of the redemption of Israel of Israel
out of Egypt; for redemption has two parts: "out," and "into" ([Deu
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#023)). The key-phrase is "Moses My
servant is dead" ([Jos 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002)). Law, of
which Moses is the representative, could never give a sinful people
victory ([Heb 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019); [Rom
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014); [Rom
8:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002)).

In a spiritual sense the book of Joshua is the Ephesians of the Old
Testament. "The heavenly" of Ephesians is to the Christian what Canaan
was to the Israelite and blessing through divine power ([Jos
21:43-55](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043); [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003)).

The government, as before, was theocratic; Joshua succeeding Moses as
the ruler under God.

Joshua falls into four parts:

1\. The conquest (Joshua 1-12).

2\. The partition of the inheritance (Joshua 13-21).

3\. Incipient discord (Joshua 22).

4\. Joshua's last counsels and death (Joshua 23 - 24).

The events recorded in Joshua cover a period of 26 years (Ussher).
