[Jeremiah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001)

dearth

The significance of a drought at this time was very great. It was one of
the signs predicted in the Palestinian Covenant ([Deu
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023)); ([Deu
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#024)) and already fulfilled in part
in the reign of Ahab. ([Kg1 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001));
etc. As that sign had been followed, even though after a long interval,
by the Assyrian captivity of the northern kingdom, it should have been
received by Judah as a most solemn warning.
