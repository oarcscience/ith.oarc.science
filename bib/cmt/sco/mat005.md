### [Matthew Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001)

[Matthew 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 5:2</span></span>

And he opened his mouth

Having announced the kingdom of heaven as "at hand," the King, in
Matthew 5-7, declares the principles of the kingdom. The Sermon on the
Mount has a twofold application:

\(1\) literally, to the kingdom. In this sense it gives the divine
constitution for the righteous government of the earth. Whenever the
kingdom of heaven is established on earth it will be according to that
constitution, which may be regarded as an explanation of the word
"righteousness" as used by the prophets in describing the kingdom (for
example) ([Isa 11:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004)); ([Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001)); ([Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)) In this sense the Sermon on the
Mount is pure law, and transfers the offence from the overt act to the
motive. ([Mat 5:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021)); ([Mat
5:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#027)). Here lies the deeper reason
why the Jews rejected the kingdom. They had reduced "righteousness" to
mere ceremonialism, and the Old Testament idea of the kingdom to a mere
affair of outward splendour and power. They were never rebuked for
expecting a visible and powerful kingdom, but the words of the prophets
should have prepared them to expect also that only the poor in spirit
and the meek could share in it (for example) ([Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004)). The seventy-second Psalm, which
was universally received by them as a description of the kingdom, was
full of this. For these reasons, the Sermon on the Mount in its primary
application gives neither the privilege nor the duty of the Church.
These are found in the Epistles. Under the law of the kingdom, for
example, no one may hope for forgiveness who has not first forgiven.
([Mat 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012)); ([Mat
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014)); ([Mat
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#015)). Under grace the Christian is
exhorted to forgive because he is already forgiven. ([Eph
4:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030)).

\(2\) But there is a beautiful moral application to the Christian. It
always remains true that the poor in spirit, rather than the proud, are
blessed, and those who mourn because of their sins, and who are meek in
the consciousness of them, will hunger and thirst after righteousness,
and hungering, will be filled. The merciful are "blessed," the pure in
heart do "see God." These principles fundamentally reappear in the
teaching of the Epistles.

saying

The beatific character, unattainable by effort, is wrought in the
believer by the Spirit, ([Gal
5:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022)).

I am not come to destroy

Christ's relation to the law of Moses may be thus summarized:

\(1\) He was made under the law ([Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)).

\(2\) He lived in perfect obedience to the law ([Joh
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046)); ([Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005)); ([Pe1
2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021)).

\(3\) he was a minister of the law to the Jews, clearing it from
rabbinical sophistries, enforcing it in all its pitiless severity upon
those who professed to obey it (for example) ([Luk
10:25-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025)) but confirming the promises
made to the fathers under the Mosaic Covenant ([Rom
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008)).

\(4\) He fulfilled the types of the law by His holy life and sacrificial
death ([Heb 9:11-26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011)).

\(5\) He bore, vicariously, the curse of the law that the Abrahamic
Covenant might avail all who believe ([Gal
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)).

\(6\) He brought out by His redemption all who believe from the place of
servants under the law into the place of sons ([Gal
4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)).

\(7\) He mediated by His blood the New Covenant of assurance and grace
in which all believers stand ([Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002)); ([Heb
8:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006)) so establishing the "law of
Christ" ([Gal 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002)) with its precepts
of higher exaltation made possible by the indwelling Spirit.

[Matthew 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020)

righteousness

([Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006)); ([Mat
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010)); ([Mat

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010)).

[Matthew 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 5:22</span></span>

hell fire

Greek, "Geenna", means "Gehenna", the place in the valley of Hinnom
where, anciently, human sacrifices were offered. ([Ch2
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#006)); ([Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031)) The word occurs, ([Mat
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)); ([Mat
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029)); ([Mat
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#030)); ([Mat
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028)); ([Mat
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#009)); ([Mat
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#015)); ([Mat
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033)); ([Mar
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043)); ([Mar
9:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#045)); ([Mar
9:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#047)); ([Luk
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005)); ([Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006)). In every instance except the
last the word comes from the lips of Jesus Christ in most solemn warning
of the consequences of sin. He describes it as the place where "their"
worm never dies and of fire never to be quenched. The expression is
identical in meaning with "lake of fire". ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)); ([Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)); ([Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014)); ([Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015)).

See "Death, the second" ([Joh 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024));
([Rev 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008)); also

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008)).

(See Scofield) - ([Luk 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023)).

[Matthew 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 5:26</span></span>

paid

Compare ([Isa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002)); ([Rut
1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#021)).

[Matthew 5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mat 5:48</span></span>

perfect

The word implies full development, growth into maturity of godliness,
not sinless perfection. ([Eph
4:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012)). In this passage the Father's
kindness, not His sinlessness, is the point in question. ([Luk
6:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#035)).
