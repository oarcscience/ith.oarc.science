### [Matthew Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 13:3</span></span>

The seven parables of Matthew 13, called by our Lord, "mysteries of the
kingdom of heaven" ([Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011).md), taken
together, describe the result of the presence of the Gospel in the world
during the present age, that is, the time of seed sowing which began
with our Lord's personal ministry, and ends with the "harvest" ([Mat
13:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#040).md). Briefly, the result is
mingled tares and wheat, good fish and bad, in the sphere of Christian
profession. It is Christendom.

sower

The figure marks a new beginning. To labour in God's vineyard Israel,
([Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001).md) is one thing, to go forth
sowing the seed of the word in a field which is the world, quite another
(cf) ([Mat 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005).md). One fourth of the
seed takes permanent root, but the result is "wheat"; ([Mat
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#025).md); ([Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023).md) or "children of the kingdom"
([Mat 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038).md). This parable ([Mat
13:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003).md); ([Mat
13:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#018).md) is treated throughout as
foundational to the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. It is
interpreted by our Lord Himself.

mysteries

A "mystery" in Scripture is a previously hidden truth, now divinely
revealed; but in which a supernatural element still remains despite the
revelation. The greater mysteries are:

1\) The mysteries of the kingdom of heaven ([Mat
13:3-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003).md).

\(2\) the mystery of Israel's blindness during this age ([Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)) (with context.md);

\(3\) the mystery of the translation of living saints at the end of this
age ([Co1 15:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051).md); ([Th1
4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014).md).

\(4\) the mystery of New Testament church as one body composed of Jew
and Gentile ([Eph 3:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001).md); ([Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025).md); ([Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019).md); ([Col
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003).md).

\(5\) the mystery of the church as the bride of Christ ([Eph
5:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028).md).

\(6\) the mystery of the inliving Christ ([Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020).md); ([Col
1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026).md).

\(7\) the "mystery of God even Christ," that is, Christ as the incarnate
fullness of the Godhead embodied, in whom all the divine wisdom for man
subsists ([Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002).md); ([Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009).md); ([Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007).md).

\(8\) the mystery of the processes by which godlikeness is restored to
man ([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016).md).

\(9\) the mystery of iniquity ([Th2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007).md); ([Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033).md).

\(10\) the mystery of the seven stars ([Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020).md).

\(11\) the mystery of Babylon ([Rev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005).md); ([Rev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#007).md).

kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

[Matthew 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 13:17</span></span>

prophets

The Old Testament prophets saw in blended vision the rejection and
crucifixion of the King

(see "Christ, sacrifice,) ([Gen 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004).md);

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018).md)

and also His glory as David's Son.

(See Scofield) - ([Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008).md),

but "what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did
signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the
glory that should follow," was not revealed to them -- only that the
vision was not for themselves. ([Pe1
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010).md). That revelation Christ makes
in these parables. A period of time is to intervene between His
sufferings and His glory. That interval is occupied with the "mysteries
of the kingdom of heaven" here described.

righteous

Righteousness.

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010).md).

[Matthew 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019.md)

kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

[Matthew 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 13:24</span></span>

parable

This parable ([Mat 13:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#024).md) is also
interpreted by our Lord ([Mat
13:36-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#036).md). Here the "good seed" is not
the "word," as in the first parable ([Mat
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019).md); ([Mat
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#023).md) but rather that which the word
has produced. ([Pe1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023).md); namely: the
children of the kingdom. These are, providentially ([Mat
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#037).md) "sown," that is, scattered,
here and there in the "field" of the "world" ([Mat
13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038).md). The "world" here is both
geographical and ethnic -- the earth-world, and also the world of men.
The wheat of God at once becomes the scene of Satan's activity. Where
children of the kingdom are gathered, there "among the wheat" ([Mat
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#025).md); ([Mat
13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038).md); ([Mat
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#039).md). Satan "sows" "children of the
wicked one," who profess to be children of the kingdom, and in outward
ways are so like the true children that only the angels may, in the end,
be trusted to separate them ([Mat
13:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#028).md); ([Mat
13:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#040).md). So great is Satan's power
of deception that the tares often really suppose themselves to be
children of the kingdom ([Mat
7:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021).md). Many other parables and
exhortations have this mingled condition in view (for example); ([Mat
22:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011).md); ([Mat
25:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001).md); ([Mat
25:14-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014).md); ([Luk
18:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#010).md); ([Heb
6:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004).md).

Indeed, it characterizes Matthew from Chapter 13 to the end. The parable
of the wheat and tares is not a description of the world, but of that
which professes to be the kingdom. Mere unbelievers are never the
children of the devil, but only religious unbelievers are so called.

Compare ([Mat 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038).md); ([Joh
8:38-44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#038).md); ([Mat
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#015).md).

The kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

[Matthew 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 13:30</span></span>

Gather

The gathering of the tares into bundles for burning does not imply
immediate judgment. At the end of this age ([Mat
13:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#040).md) the tares are set apart for
burning, but first the wheat is gathered into the barn. ([Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003).md); ([Th1
4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014).md).

[Matthew 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 13:31</span></span>

Another parable

The parable of the Mustard Seed prefigures the rapid but unsubstantial
growth of the mystery form of the kingdom from an insignificant
beginning ([Act 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015).md); ([Act
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041).md); ([Co1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026).md) to a great place in the earth.
The figure of the fowls finding shelter in the branches is drawn from
([Dan 4:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#020).md). How insecure was such
a refuge the context in Daniel shows.

kingdom

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

[Matthew 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 13:33</span></span>

Another parable

That interpretation of the parable of the Leaven ([Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033).md) which makes (with variation as
to details) the leaven to be the Gospel, introduced into the world
("three measures of meal") by the church, and working subtly until the
world is converted ("till the whole was leavened") is open to fatal
objection:

\(1\) it does violence to the unvarying symbolical meaning of leaven,
and especially to the meaning fixed by our Lord Himself. ([Mat
16:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006).md); ([Mar
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015).md).

See "Leaven," ([Gen 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033).md).

\(2\) The implication of a converted world in this age ("till the whole
was leavened"), is explicitly contradicted by our Lord's interpretation
of the parables of the Wheat and Tares, and of the Net. Our Lord
presents a picture of a partly converted kingdom in an unconverted
world; of good fish and bad in the very kingdom-net itself.

\(3\) The method of the extension of the kingdom is given in the first
parable. It is by sowing seed, not by mingling leaven. The symbols have,
in Scripture, a meaning fixed by inspired usage. Leaven is the principle
of corruption working subtly; is invariably used in a bad sense.

See "Leaven,"

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003).md),

and is defined by our Lord as evil doctrine. ([Mat
16:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#011).md); ([Mar
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015).md). Meal, on the contrary, was used
in one of the sweet-savour offerings ([Lev
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001).md). And was food for the priests
([Lev 6:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#015).md). A woman, in the bad
ethical sense, always symbolizes something out of place, religiously,

(See Scofield) - ([Zac 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006).md).

In Thyatira, it was a woman teaching.

Compare ([Rev 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020).md); ([Rev
17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001).md).

Interpreting the parable by these familiar symbols, it constitutes a
warning that the true doctrine, given for nourishment of the children of
the kingdom; ([Mat 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004).md); ([Ti1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006).md); ([Pe1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002).md) would be mingled with corrupt and
corrupting false doctrine, and that officially, by the apostate church
itself; ([Ti1 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001).md); ([Ti2
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017).md); ([Ti2
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003).md); ([Pe2
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001).md).

Leaven

Summary:

\(1\) Leaven, as a symbolic or typical substance, is always mentioned in
the Old Testament in an evil sense ([Gen
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003).md);

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003).md).

\(2\) The use of the word in the New Testament explains its symbolic
meaning. It is "malice and wickedness," as contrasted with "sincerity
and truth" ([Co1 5:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006).md); it is evil
doctrine ([Mat 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#012).md) in its
three-fold form of Pharisasism, Sadduceeism, Herodianism; ([Mat
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006).md); ([Mar
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015).md). The leaven of the Pharisees was
externalism in religion. ([Mat 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014).md);
([Mat 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#016).md); ([Mat
23:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023).md); of the Sadducees,
scepticism as to the supernatural and as to the Scriptures ([Mat
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023).md); ([Mat
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029).md); of the Herodians, worldliness
-- a Herod party amongst the Jews; ([Mat
22:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016).md); ([Mar
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006).md).

\(3\) The use of the word in ([Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033).md) is congruous with its universal
meaning.

Then

The kingdom does not become the kingdom of the "Father" until Christ,
having "put all enemies under his feet," including the last enemy,
death, has "delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father" ([Co1
15:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md); ([Rev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002).md). There is triumph over death at
the first resurrection ([Co1 15:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054).md)
but death, "the last enemy," is not destroyed till the end of the
millennium. ([Rev 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014).md).

[Matthew 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 13:44</span></span>

hid

The interpretation of the parable of the treasure, which makes the buyer
of the field to be a sinner who is seeking Christ, has no warrant in the
parable itself. The field is defined ([Mat
13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038).md) to be the world. The seeking
sinner does not buy, but forsakes, the world to win Christ. Furthermore,
the sinner has nothing to sell, nor is Christ for sale, nor is He hidden
in a field, nor, having found Christ, does the sinner hide Him again.

Compare ([Mar 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024).md); ([Act
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#020).md).

At every point the interpretation breaks down.

Our Lord is the buyer at the awful cost of His blood ([Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md); and Israel, especially Ephraim
([Jer 31:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#005).md); ([Jer
31:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018).md); the lost tribes hidden in
"the field," the world ([Mat 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038).md),
is the treasure; ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md); ([Psa
135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004).md). Again, as in the separation of
tares and wheat, the angels are used; ([Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031).md); ([Jer
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016).md). The divine Merchantman buys
the field (world) for the sake of the treasure ([Mat
13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044).md); ([Rom
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028).md); beloved for the fathers'
sakes, and yet to be restored and saved. The note of joy ([Mat
13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044).md) is also that of the prophets in
view of Israel's restoration. ([Deu
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#009).md); ([Isa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013).md); ([Isa
52:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001).md); ([Isa
62:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004).md); ([Isa
62:65](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#065).md); ([Isa
62:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#018).md).

(See "Israel,") ([Gen 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#010).md); ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026).md).

[Matthew 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 13:45</span></span>

pearls

The true Church, "one body" formed by the Holy Spirit ([Co1
12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012).md). As Israel is the hid
treasure, so the Church is the pearl of great cost. Covering the same
period of time as the mysteries of the kingdom, is the mystery of the
Church; ([Rom 16:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025).md); ([Eph
3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003).md); ([Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032).md). Of the true Church a pearl is a
perfect symbol:

\(1\) A pearl is one, a perfect symbol of unity ([Co1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017).md); ([Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012).md); ([Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013).md); ([Eph
4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004).md).

\(2\) a pearl is formed by the accretion, and that not mechanically, but
vitally, through a living one, as Christ adds to the Church ([Act
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041).md); ([Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047).md); ([Act
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#014).md); ([Act
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024).md); ([Eph
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021).md); ([Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019).md).

\(3\) Christ, having given Himself for the pearl, is now preparing it
for presentation to Himself ([Eph
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025).md). The kingdom is not the
Church, but the true children of the kingdom during the fulfilment of
these mysteries, baptized by one Spirit into one body ([Co1
12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012).md) compose the true Church, the
pearl.

the kingdom of heaven

The parable of the Net (Greek, "sagēnē", "net") presents another view
from that of the wheat and tares of the mysteries of the kingdom as the
sphere of profession, but with this difference: there Satan was the
active agent; here the admixture is more the result of the tendency of a
movement to gather to itself that which is not really of it). The
kingdom of heaven is like a net which, cast into the sea of humanity,
gathers of every kind, good and bad, and these remain together in the
net ([Mat 13:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#049).md) and not merely in the
sea, until the end of the age. It is not even a converted net, much less
a converted sea. Infinite violence has been done to sound exegesis by
the notion that the world is to be converted in this age. Against that
notion stands our Lord's own interpretation of the parables of the
Sower, the Wheat and Tares, and the Net.

Such, then, is the mystery form of the kingdom.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033).md).

It is the sphere of Christian profession during this age. It is a
mingled body of true and false, wheat and tares, good and bad. It is
defiled by formalism, doubt, and worldliness. But within it Christ sees
the true children of the true kingdom who, at the end, are to "shine
forth as the sun." In the great field, the world, He sees the redeemed
of all ages, but especially His hidden Israel, yet to be restored and
blessed, Also, in this form of the kingdom, so unlike that which is to
be, He sees the Church, His body and bride, and for joy He sells all
that He has ([Co2 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009).md) and buys the
field, the treasure, and the pearl.
