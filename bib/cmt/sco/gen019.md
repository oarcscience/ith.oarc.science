### [Genesis Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)

[Genesis 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)

angel

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004)).

Lot sat

Compare ([Dan 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#049)).

Lot the compromiser with Daniel the inflexible. Lot was a great man
([Deu 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#019)); ([Deu
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#020)) in a place devoted to judgment.

Compare ([Act 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031)).

[Genesis 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#009)

And they said

The world's contempt for a worldly believer.

[Genesis 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 19:14</span></span>

Lot

Lot had utterly lost his testimony. In gaining influence ([Gen
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)) he had lost power, even in his
own family.

[Genesis 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 19:15</span></span>

angel

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004)).

[Genesis 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 19:29</span></span>

when God

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#036)).

[Genesis 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 19:32</span></span>

Come

Lot "pitched toward Sodom" ([Gen
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#012)) for worldly advantage; then
became a great man in Sodom ([Gen
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)) at the cost of his daughter's
accepting the morals of Sodom.

[Genesis 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">gen 19:36</span></span>

Thus were

Abraham and Lot are contrasted characters. Of the same stock ([Gen
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031)) subjected to the same
environment, and both justified men; ([Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006)); ([Pe2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007)); ([Pe2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008)) the contrast in character and
career is shown to be the result of their respective choices at the
crisis of their lives. Lot "chose him all the plain of Jordan" for
present advantage; Abraham "looked for a city which hath foundations";
([Heb 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010)); ([Gen
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#018)) "came and dwelt in the plain of
Mamre (fatness), which is in Hebron" (communion). The men remain types
of the worldly and spiritual believer.
