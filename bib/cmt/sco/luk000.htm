<p>Book Introduction - Luke
<p>Writer: The Writer of the third Gospel is called by Paul "the beloved physician" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014">Col 4:14</A> and, as we learn from the Acts, was Paul's frequent companion. He was of Jewish ancestry, but his correct Greek marks him as a Jew of the dispersion. Tradition says that he was a Jew of Antioch, as Paul was of Tarsus. 
<p>Date: The date of Luke falls between A.D. 63 and 68. 
<p>Theme: Luke is the Gospel of the human-divine One, as John is of the divine-human One. The key-phrase is "Son of man," and the key-verse <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010">Luk 19:10</A>. "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost." In harmony with this intent, Luke relates those things concerning Jesus which demonstrate how entirely human He was. His genealogy is traced to Adam, and the most detailed account is given of His mother, and of His infancy and boyhood. The parables peculiar to Luke have distinctively the human and the seeking note. But Luke is careful to guard the Deity and Kingship of Jesus Christ <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032">Luk 1:32-35</A>. Luke, then, is the Gospel of "the man whose name is The BRANCH" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012">Zac 6:12</A>. 
<p>Luke has six chief divisions: 
<p>1. The Evangelist's Introduction (Luke 1:1-4). 
<p>2. The human relationships of Jesus (Luke 1:5 - 2:52). 
<p>3. The baptism, ancestry, and testing of Jesus (Luke 3:1 - 4:13). 
<p>4. The ministry of the Son of man as Prophet-King in Galilee (Luke 4:14 - 9:44). 
<p>5. The final offer of the Son of man as King to israel, His rejection and sacrifice (Luke 19:45 - 23:56). 
<p>6. The resurrection, resurrection ministry, and ascension of the Son of man (Luke 24:1-53). 
<p>The events recorded in this book cover a period of 39 years.
