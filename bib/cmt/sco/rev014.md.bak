gospel

Gospel. This great theme may be summarized as follows:

I. In itself, the word Gospel means good news.

II\. Four forms of the Gospel are to be distinguished:

\(1\) The Gospel of the kingdom. This is the good news that God purposes
to set up on the earth, in fulfilment of the Davidic Covenant: ([Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016).md): a kingdom, political,
spiritual, Israelitish, universal, over which God's Son, David's heir,
shall be King, and which shall be, for one thousand years, the
manifestation of the righteousness of God in human affairs.

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

Two preachings of this Gospel are mentioned, one past, beginning with
the ministry of John the Baptist, continued by our Lord and His
disciples, and ending with the Jewish rejection of the King. The other
is yet future ([Mat 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014).md) during the
great tribulation, and immediately preceding the coming of the King in
glory.

\(2\) The Gospel of the grace of God. This is the good news that Jesus
Christ, the rejected King, has died on the cross for the sins of the
world, that He was raised from the dead for our justification, and that,
by Him, all that believe are justified from all things. This form of the
Gospel is described in many ways. It is the Gospel...

"of God" ([Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001).md) because it
originates in His love;

"of Christ" ([Co2 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#014).md) because it
flows from His sacrifice, and because He is the alone Object of Gospel
faith;

of the "grace of God" ([Act 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024).md)
because it saves those whom the law curses;

of "the glory"; ([Ti1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011).md); ([Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004).md) because it concerns Him who is in
the glory, and who is bringing the many sons to glory; ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).md);

of "our salvation" ([Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md) because
it is the "power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth";
([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).md);

of "the uncircumcision" ([Gal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#007).md)
because it saves wholly apart from forms and ordinances of "peace" ([Eph
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015).md) because through Christ it makes
peace between the sinner and God, and imparts inward peace.

\(3\) The everlasting Gospel. ([Rev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006).md). This is to be preached to the
earth-dwellers at the very end of the great tribulation and immediately
preceding the judgment of the nations ([Mat
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#031).md). It is neither the Gospel of
the kingdom, nor of grace. Though its burden is judgment, not salvation,
it is good news to Israel and to those who, during the tribulation, have
been saved; ([Rev 7:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009).md); ([Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028).md); ([Psa
96:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011).md); ([Isa
35:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004).md).

\(4\) That which Paul calls, "my Gospel" ([Rom
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016).md). This is the Gospel of the grace
of God in its fullest development, but includes the revelation of the
result of that Gospel in the outcalling of the church, her
relationships, position, privileges, and responsibility. It is the
distinctive truth of Ephesians and Colossians, but interpenetrates all
of Paul's writings.

III\. There is "another Gospel" ([Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006).md); ([Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004).md) "which is not another," but a
perversion of the Gospel of the grace of God, against which we are
warned. It has many seductive forms, but the test is one -- it
invariably denies the sufficiency of grace alone to save, keep, and
perfect, and mingles with grace some kind of human merit. In Galatia it
was law, in Colosse fanaticism ([Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).md); etc. In any form, its teachers
lie under the awful anathema of God.
