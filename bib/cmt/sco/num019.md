[Numbers 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#002)

red heifer

The red heifer: Type of the sacrifice of Christ as the ground of the
cleansing of the believer from the defilement contracted in his pilgrim
walk through this world, and illustration of the method of his
cleansing. The order is:

\(1\) the slaying of the sacrifice;

\(2\) the sevenfold sprinkling of the blood, typical public testimony
before the eyes of all of the complete and never-to-be-repeated putting
away of all the believer's sin as before God. ([Heb
9:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012)); ([Heb
10:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010)).

\(3\) the reduction of the sacrifice to ashes which are preserved and
become a memorial of the sacrifice;

\(4\) the cleansing from defilement (sin has two aspects -- guilt and
uncleanness) by sprinkling with the ashes mingled with water. Water is a
type of both the Spirit and the Word. ([Joh
7:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037)). ([Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026)). The operation typified is this:
the Holy Spirit used the Word to convict the believer of some evil
allowed in his life to the hindering of his joy, growth, and service.
Thus convicted, he remembers that the guilt of his sin has been met by
the sacrifice of Christ ([Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007)).
Instead, therefore, of despairing, the convicted believer judges and
confesses the defiling thing as unworthy a saint, and is forgiven and
cleansed; ([Joh 13:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003)); ([Jo1
1:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007)).
