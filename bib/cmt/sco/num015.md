wandering

The wilderness was part of the necessary discipline of the redeemed
people, but not the years of wandering. The latter were due wholly to
the unbelief of the people at Kadesh-barnea. The Red Sea, Marah, Elim,
Sinai, were God's ways, in development and discipline, and have, of
necessity, their counterpart in Christian experience. The Red Sea speaks
of the cross as that which -- death to Christ but life for us --
separates us from Egypt, the world ([Gal
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014).md) Marah of God's power to turn
untoward things into blessings; Elim of God's power to give rest and
refreshment by the way; Sinai of God's holiness and our deep inherent
evil, the experience of ([Rom 7:7-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007).md)
So far the path was and is of God. But from Kadesh-barnea to Jordan all
save the grace of God toward an unbelieving people, is for warning, not
imitation; ([Co1 10:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001).md); ([Heb
3:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017).md). There is a present rest of
God, of which the Sabbath and Canaan were types, into which believers
may, and therefore should, enter by faith ([Heb
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001).md); ([Heb
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016).md).

When

It is remarkable that just when the people are turning in unbelief from
the land, God gives directions for conduct when they shall have entered
it. See ([Rom 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029).md); ([Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006).md).

atonement

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033).md).

ribband of blue

The ribband of blue. Blue, the heavenly colour, used upon the borders of
the priests' garments signified that the servants of God were to be
heavenly in obedience and character, and separate from earthly ambitions
and desires.
