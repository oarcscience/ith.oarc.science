### [Exodus Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001)

[Exodus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 26:1</span></span>

fine twined linen

Fine linen typifies personal righteousness ([Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008)). The fine linen here typifies
the sinless life of Christ.

blue

Blue. Christ's heavenly origin; purple, His royalty as David's son;
scarlet, His sacrifice.

cherubims

(See Scofield) - ([Eze 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005)).

[Exodus 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 26:7</span></span>

goats' hair

Compare ([Lev 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#005)); ([Lev
16:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#007)).

The reference seems to be to the result of the ordinance of the two
goats as "covering"

(See Scofield) - ([Lev 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#005))

thus speaking of Christ in atonement

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021)).

This thought is intensified in the colour of the rams' skins, ([Exo
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014)).

[Exodus 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 26:15</span></span>

boards

The typical meaning of the boards is clear as to Christ. Acacia wood, a
desert growth, is a fitting symbol of Christ in His humanity as "a root
out of dry ground" ([Isa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002)). The
covering, gold, typifies Deity in manifestation, speaks of His divine
glory. As applied to the individual believer the meaning of the boards
is less clear. The connection may be found in; ([Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021)); ([Joh
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#022)); ([Joh
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#023)); ([Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004)); ([Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006)); ([Jo1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013)). Only as seen "in Him" could the
boards be taken as representing the believer. So viewed the type is
beautiful. In the world, and yet separated from it by the silver of
redemption; ([Gal 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004)); ([Exo
30:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011)); ([Exo
38:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025)) as the boards of the
tabernacle were separated from the earth by the sockets of silver, and
united by the "middle bar" ([Exo
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#028)) representing both the one life
([Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)) and one Spirit ([Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003)) "all the building, fitly framed
together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord." ([Eph
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021)).

[Exodus 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 26:19</span></span>

sockets of silver

Silver symbolizes redemption.

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001)).

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 38:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#027)).

All the tabernacle rests upon silver except the hangings of the gate,
the way of access.

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#017)).

[Exodus 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 26:26</span></span>

shittim

That is, acacia.

[Exodus 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 26:31</span></span>

vail

The inner veil, type of Christ's human body ([Mat
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026)); ([Mat
27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050)); ([Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020)). This veil, barring entrance
into the holiest, was the most expressive symbol of the truth that "by
the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified"; ([Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020)); ([Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008)). Rent by an unseen hand when
Christ Died ([Mat 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051)) thus giving
instant access to God to all who come by faith in Him, it was the end of
all legality; the way to God was open. It is deeply significant that the
priests must have patched together again the veil that God had rent, for
the temple services went on yet for nearly forty years. That patched
veil is Galatianism -- the attempt to put saint or sinner back under the
law.

Compare ([Gal 1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006)).

Anything but "the grace of Christ" is "another gospel," and under
anathema.

[Exodus 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 26:32</span></span>

shittim

That is, acacia.

[Exodus 26:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 26:37</span></span>

shittim

That is, acacia.

brass

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#017)).
