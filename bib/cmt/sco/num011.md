### [Numbers Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 11:4</span></span>

mixt \[mixed\]

Compare ([Exo 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038).md).

Unconverted church members, unable to desire or understand Christ as the
Bread of God ([Exo 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#035).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#035).md)

will clamour for things pleasing to the flesh in the work and way of the
church: sumptuous buildings, ornate ritual, an easy doctrine. Alas! they
lead away the unspiritual believers also.

[Numbers 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 11:6</span></span>

manna

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#035).md).

[Numbers 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 11:25</span></span>

spirit that was upon him

There was no more power than before -- only more machinery. Moses had
murmured ([Num 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#011).md) because of the
burden that God had laid upon him. God, in distributing the burden,
shows that Moses' power had, all along, been in proportion to his
burden.

[Numbers 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 11:31</span></span>

two cubits high upon the face of all the earth

The correct rendering is, "about two cubits above the face of the
earth," that is, within reach of the people that they might slay them
for food. The statement is not that the quails were piled up from the
face of the earth two cubits deep. The level of their flight was two
cubits above the earth.

[Numbers 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 11:35</span></span>

Kibroth-hattaavah

That is, graves of lust. ([Num 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#017).md).
