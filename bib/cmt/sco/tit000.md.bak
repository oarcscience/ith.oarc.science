Book Introduction - Titus

Writer: The Apostle Paul ([Tit 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001).md).

Date: Practically the same with First Timothy

Theme: Titus has much in common with First Timothy. Both Epistles are
concerned with the due order of the churches. The distinction is that in
First Timothy sound doctrine is more prominent [Ti1
1:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md) in Titus the divine order for
the local churches [Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md). The
permanent use of these Epistles lies in this twofold application, on the
one hand to churches grown careless as to the truth of God, on the
other, to churches careless as to the order of God's house. The
importance of this order is made solemnly emphatic in that the tests by
which true elders and deacons may be known are repeated ; [Ti1
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md); [Tit
1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md).

There are two divisions:

1\. The qualifications and functions of elders (Titus 1:1-16).

2\. The pastoral work of the true elder (Titus 2:1 - 3:15).
