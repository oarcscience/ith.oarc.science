Book Introduction - Judges

This book takes its name from the thirteen men raised up to deliver
Israel in the declension and disunion which followed the death of
Joshua. Through these men Jehovah continued His personal government of
Israel. The key-verse to the condition of Israel is ([Jdg
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006)), "Every man did that which was
right in his own eyes." Two facts stand out--the utter failure of
Israel; the persistent grace of Jehovah. In the choice of the Judges is
illustrated Zechariah's great word ([Zac
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006)), "not by might, nor by power, but
by My Spirit, saith the Lord"; and Paul's word ([Co1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025)), "not many wise men after the
flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called."

The book records seven apostasies, seven servitudes to seven heathen
nations, seven deliverances. The spiritual parallel is found in the
history of the professing church since the Apostles, in the rise of
sects and the lost sense of the unity of the one body ([Co1
12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012)).

Judges is in two parts:

1\. (Judges 1-16) inclusive; key-verse, [Jdg
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#018).

2\. (Judges 17-21); key-verse, [Jdg
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#025).

The events recorded in Judges cover a period of 305 years (Ussher).
