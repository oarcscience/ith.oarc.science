Book Introduction - Psalms

The simplest description of the five books of Psalms is that they were
the inspired prayer- and-praise book of Israel. They are revelations of
truth, not abstractly, but in the terms of human experience. The truth
revealed is wrought into the emotions, desires, and sufferings of the
people of God by the circumstances through which they pass. But those
circumstances are such as to constitute an anticipation of analogous
conditions through which Christ in His incarnation, and the Jewish
remnant in the tribulation (Psalms 10-21, refs), should pass; so then
many Psalms are prophetic of the sufferings, the faith, and the victory
of both. Psalms 22 and 50 are examples. The former--the holy of holies
of the Bible-- reveals all that was in the mind of Christ when He
uttered the desolate cry, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?"
The latter is an anticipation of what will be in the heart of Israel
when she shall turn to Jehovah again ([Deu
30:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001)). Other Psalms are directly
prophetic of "the sufferings of Christ, and the glories which should
follow" ([Luk 24:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025); [Luk
24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044)). Psalm 2 is a notable instance,
presenting Jehovah's Anointed as rejected and crucified ([Psa
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001); [Act
4:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024)) but afterward set as King in
Zion.

The great themes of the Psalms are, Christ, Jehovah, the Law, Creation,
the future of Israel, and the exercises of the renewed heart in
suffering, in joy, in perplexity. The promises of the Psalms are
primarily Jewish, and suited to a people under the law, but are
spiritually true in Christian experience also, in the sense that they
disclose the mind of God, and the exercises of His heart toward those
who are perplexed, afflicted, or cast down.

The imprecatory Psalms are the cry of the oppressed in Israel for
justice--a cry appropriate and right in the earthly people of God, and
based upon a distinct promise in the Abrahamic Covenant

See Scofield - [Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018), but a cry
unsuited to the church, a heavenly people who have taken their place
with a rejected and crucified Christ. ([Luk
9:52-55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052)).

The Psalms are in five books, each ending in a doxology:

1\. Book I (Psalms 1-41).

2\. Book II Psalms (42-72).

3\. Book III Psalms (Psalms 73-89).

4\. Book IV Psalms (Psalms 90-106).

5\. Book V Psalms (Psalms 107-150).
