### [Jude Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001.md)

[Jude 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001.md)

preserved

Assurance is the believer's full conviction that, through the work of
Christ alone, received by faith, he is in possession of a salvation in
which he will be eternally kept. And this assurance rests only upon the
Scripture promises to him who believes.

[Jude 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003.md)

salvation

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).md).

it was needful

Literally, constraint was upon me, that is, of the Spirit.

[Jude 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005.md)

saved

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).md).

[Jude 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006.md)

great day

The judgment of the fallen angels. The "great day" is the day of the
Lord. ([Isa 2:9-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009).md). As the final
judgment upon Satan occurs after the thousand years, and preceding the
final judgment ([Rev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010).md) it is
congruous to conclude, as to the time, that other fallen angels are
judged with him. ([Pe2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004).md); ([Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010).md). Christians are associated with
Christ in this judgment. For association with angels at judgment ([Co1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#003).md).

For other information (See Scofield) - ([Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012).md).

angels

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004).md).

[Jude 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jde 1:11</span></span>

Cain

Cain (compare ([Gen 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001).md) a type of the
religious natural man, who believes in a God, and in "religion," but
after his own will, and who rejects redemption by blood. Compelled as a
teacher of religion to explain atonement, the apostate teacher explains
it away.

error of Balaam

Balaam, the "error" of Balaam must be distinguished from his "way"

(See Scofield) - ([Pe2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015).md)

and his "doctrine"

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).md).

The "error" of Balaam was that, reasoning from natural morality and
seeing the evil in Israel, he supposed a righteous God must curse them.
He was blind to the higher morality of the Cross, through which God
maintains and enforces the authority and awful sanctions of His law, so
that He can be just and the justifier of a believing sinner. The
"reward" of ([Jde 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011).md) may not be
money, but popularity, or applause.

Core

See Numbers 16. The sin of Korah was denial of the authority of Moses as
God's chosen spokesman, and intrusion into the priest's office.

gainsaying

(Greek, "antilogia", means "against the Word").

[Jude 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jde 1:15</span></span>

sinners

Sin

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023).md).

[Jude 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jde 1:23</span></span>

flesh

Flesh, Summary:

"Flesh," in the ethical sense, is the whole natural or unregenerate man,
spirit, soul, and body, as centered upon self, prone to sin, and opposed
to God. ([Rom 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018).md).

The regenerate man is not "in the sphere of the flesh," but in the
sphere of the Spirit, ([Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009).md), but
the flesh is still in him, and he may, according to his choice, "walk
after the flesh" or "in the Spirit". ([Co1
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001).md); ([Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016).md); ([Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017).md).

In the first case, he is a "carnal," in the second case, he is a
"spiritual," Christian. Victory over the flesh will be the habitual
experience of the believer who walks in the Spirit. ([Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002).md); ([Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004).md); ([Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016).md); ([Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017).md).
