reconciliation of man.

intruding into those things

The errorists against whom Paul warns the Colossians, and against whom,
in principle, the warning has perpetual significance, were called
"Gnostics," from the Greek, "gnosis", meaning "knowledge."

These Gnostics "came most keenly into conflict with the exalted rank and
redeeming rank of Christ, to whom they did not leave His full divine
dignity, but assigned to Him merely the highest rank in the order of
spirits, while they exalted angels as concerned in bringing the
Messianic salvation." -- H.A.W. Meyer.

Paul's characteristic word, in Colossians, for the divine revelation is
the Greek, "epignosis", that is, "full knowledge", ([Col
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009).md); ([Col
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010).md); ([Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010).md) as against the pretended
"knowledge" of the errorists. The warnings apply to all extra-biblical
forms, doctrines, and customs, and to all ascetic practices.

angels

(See Scofield) - ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004).md).

world

1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027).md); ([Joh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008).md).

[Colossians 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 2:23</span></span>

not in any

Or, "which do not really honour God, but only satisfy the flesh" (that
is, by creating a reputation for superior sanctity).
