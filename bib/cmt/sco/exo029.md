### [Exodus Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 29:1</span></span>

do unto them to hallow them

The priest type of consecration. (Compare the temple type, ([Kg1
8:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001).md); ([Ch2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#004).md); ([Ch2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014).md). The order in; ([Lev
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001).md); ([Lev
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#024).md); differs from the order here. In
Leviticus the filling the hands precedes the sprinkling.

bullock, rams

[Exodus 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004.md)

Aaron

shares in the washing (i.e, symbol of regeneration), ([Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005).md); ([Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005).md); ([Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006).md).

\(1\) as needing it, be in this in contrast with Christ ([Heb
7:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026).md).

\(2\) to typify Christ's action, who received the baptism of John, not
as needing it, but as thus identifying Himself with sinners, and as
fulfilling the Aaronic type. As in Aaron's case, His anointing followed
the washing ([Exo 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004).md); ([Exo
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007).md); ([Mat
3:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#014).md).

wash

distinguish the washing from the use of the laver. ([Exo
30:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018).md)

This washing typifies regeneration;

([Tit 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005).md)

the laver, daily cleansing;

([Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009).md)

See both ([Joh 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010).md).

[Exodus 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 29:5</span></span>

garments

The priest's garments were put on in reverse order of the instructions
for making them:

\(1\) The "coat" ([Exo 28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039).md) the
oriental long garment worn next to the person, made of fine linen. ([Exo
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009).md).

\(2\) The "robe of the ephod" ([Exo
28:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#031).md) a long seamless garment of
blue linen with an opening for the head, worn over the "coat."
Pomegranates, symbol of fruitfulness, were embroidered on the skirt of
the robe in blue, purple, and scarlet, alternated with golden bells,
symbol of testimony, which gave a sound as the high priest went in and
out of the sanctuary. The robe was secured by a golden girdle.

\(3\) The ephod ([Exo 28:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#005).md) was
next put on. A short garment made of linen, embroidered with gold, blue,
purple, and scarlet, it consisted of two pieces, front and back, united
by two shoulder-pieces and by a band about the bottom. Two onyx stones,
set in gold and fastened upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, were
engraved with the names of the twelve tribes: "and Aaron shall bear
their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders (the place of
strength) for a memorial." Compare ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md); ([Luk
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004).md); ([Luk
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#005).md).

\(4\) The breastplate was a square pouch ([Exo
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#016).md) of linen to contain the Urim
and Thummim.

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030).md).

To the linen pouch was attached the oblong gold setting containing four
rows of precious stones, on each stone a tribal name. The breastplate
with the jewel work was attached at the upper corners to the
shoulder-pieces of the ephod by golden chains. Golden rings were sewn on
ephod and breastplate, and the latter was further secured to the ephod
by laces of blue through the rings. Altogether, it was called "the
breastplate of judgment" because worn by the high priest when judging
the causes of the people.

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030).md).

\(5\) A mitre (or "turban") of fine line was made ([Exo
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#037).md) to cover the head, bearing upon
the front a gold plate engraved, "Holiness to the Lord" ([Exo
29:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036).md).

\(6\) To these were added linen breeches, "from the loins even to the
thighs" ([Exo 28:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#042).md). The "coat" and
linen breeches were made for the priests, also, and were the ordinary
garments of high priest and priests as distinguished from the other
garments, which were "for glory and beauty."

gird

Symbol of service. ([Luk 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#037).md); ([Luk
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#008).md); ([Joh
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004).md); ([Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013).md).

put their hands

(See Scofield) - ([Lev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004).md)

[Exodus 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 29:33</span></span>

atonement

Hebrew, Kaphar, "to cover." The English word "atonement" (at-one-ment)
is not a translation of the Hebrew, Kaphar, but a translator's
interpretation. According to Scripture the legal sacrifice "covered" the
offerer's sin and secured the divine forgiveness; according to the
translators it made God and the sinner at-one. But the Old Testament
Sacrifices did not at-one the sinner and God. "It is not possible that
the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins." ([Heb
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004).md). The Israelite's offering
implied confession of sin and of its due desert, death; and God
"covered" (passed over," ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md)
his sin, in anticipation of Christ's sacrifice, which did, finally, "put
away" the sins "done aforetime in the forbearance of God."; ([Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md); ([Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md).

The word "atonement" does not occur in the New Testament; ([Rom
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011).md) meaning reconciliation, and so
rendered in the R.V.

See "Sacrifice," ([Gen 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004).md); and refs.

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Lev 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#005).md)

[Exodus 29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md)
