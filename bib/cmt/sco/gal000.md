Book Introduction - Galatians

Writer: The Apostle Paul (1:1).

Date: Galatians was probably written A.D. 60, during Paul's third visit
to Corinth, The occasion of the Epistle is evident. It had come to
Paul's knowledge that the fickle Galatians, who were not Greeks, but
Gauls, "a stream from the torrent of barbarians which poured into Greece
in the third century before Christ," had become the prey of the
legalizers, the Judaizing missionaries from Palestine.

Theme: The theme of Galatians is the vindication of the Gospel of the
grace of God from any admixture of law-conditions, which qualify or
destroy its character of pure grace.

The Galatian error had two forms, both of which are refuted. The first
is the teaching that obedience to the law is mingled with faith as the
ground of the sinner's justification; the second, that the justified
believer is made perfect by keeping the law. Paul meets the first form
of the error by a demonstration that justification is through the
Abrahamic Covenant ([Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018).md), and
that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after the
confirmation of that covenant, and the true purpose of which was
condemnation, not justification, cannot disannul a salvation which rests
upon the earlier covenant. Paul meets the second and more subtle form by
vindicating the office of the Holy Spirit as Sanctifier.

The book is in seven parts:

1\. Salutation (Galatians 1:1-5).

2\. Theme (Galatians 1:6-9).

3\. Paul's Gospel is a revelation (Galatians 1:10 - 2:14).

4\. Justification is by faith without law (Galatians 2:15 - 3:24).

5\. The rule of the believer's life is gracious, not legal (Galatians
3:25 - 5:15).

6\. Sanctification is through the Spirit, not the law (Galatians
5:16-24).

7\. Exhortations and conclusion (Galatians 5:25 - 6:18).
