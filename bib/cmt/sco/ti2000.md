### [2 Timothy Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti2 0:0</span></span>

Book Introduction - 2 Timothy

Writer: The Apostle Paul ([Ti2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001).md).

Date: The touching letter was written by Paul to his "dearly beloved
son" shortly before his martyrdom ([Ti2
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006).md), and contains the last words of
the great apostle which inspiration has preserved.

Theme: Second Timothy (in common with Second Peter, Jude, and Second and
Third John) has to do with the personal walk and testimony of a true
servant of Christ in a day of apostasy and declension. The key-phrases
are, "All they which are in Asia be turned away from me" ([Ti2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015).md); and, "A good soldier of Jesus
Christ" ([Ti2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003).md). The Asian churches
had not disbanded, nor ceased to call themselves Christian, but they had
turned away from the doctrines of grace distinctively revealed through
the Apostle Paul (see Introduction, p. 1189). This was the proof that
already the apostasy had set in its first form, legalism.

The natural divisions are four:

1\. The Apostle's greeting (2 Timothy 1:1-18).

2\. The pathway of an approved servant in a day of apostasy (2 Timothy
2:1-26).

3\. Apostasy and the Word (2 Timothy 3:1-17).

4\. A faithful servant and his faithful Lord (2 Timothy 4:1-22).
