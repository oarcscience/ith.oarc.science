[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa2 13:37</span></span>

But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai

([Sa1 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008)). David, in the years of
his wanderings, made a savage raid upon Geshur, and evidently bore away
Maacah, daughter of the king of Geshur. Of her was born Absalom, and in
him was her wild Bedouin blood, and the blood of a father who had been
the reckless chief of a handful of desperate men. ([Sa2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003)); ([Sa2
23:8-39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008)) and whom only the divine love
could tame. ([Sa2 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#036)). In Absalom
David reaped from his own sowing.
