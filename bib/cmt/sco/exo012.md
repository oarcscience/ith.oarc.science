### [Exodus Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001)

[Exodus 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002)

first month

That is, April.

[Exodus 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 12:11</span></span>

passover

The Passover, type of Christ our Redeemer ([Exo
12:1-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001)); ([Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)); ([Co1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006)); ([Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007)); ([Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018)); ([Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019)).

\(1\) The lamb must be without blemish, and to test this it was kept up
for four days ([Exo 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005)); ([Exo
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006)). So our Lord's public life,
under hostile scrutiny, was the testing which proved his holiness; ([Luk
11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053)); ([Luk
11:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#054)); ([Joh
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046)); ([Joh
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038)).

\(2\) The Lamb thus tested must be slain ([Exo
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006)); ([Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024)); ([Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022)).

\(3\) The blood must be applied ([Exo
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007)) This answers to appropriation by
personal faith, and refutes universalism ([Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036)).

\(4\) The blood thus applied of itself, without anything, constituted a
perfect protection from judgment ([Exo
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#013)); ([Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007)); ([Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010)); ([Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014)).

\(5\) The feast typified Christ as the bread of life, answering to the
memorial supper. ([Mat 26:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026));
([Co1 11:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023)). To observe the feast
was a duty and privilege, but not a condition of safety. As a matter of
fact, the bread was not eaten by the Israelites on the night in which,
nevertheless, they were preserved from the judgment upon the firstborn.
([Exo 12:34-39](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#034)).

[Exodus 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038)

mixed

This mixed multitude, standing for unconverted church-members, was a
source of weakness and division, then as now ([Num
11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004)).

(See Scofield) - ([Num 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004)).

There had been a manifestation of divine power, and men were drawn to it
without change of heart.

Compare ([Luk 14:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#025)).
