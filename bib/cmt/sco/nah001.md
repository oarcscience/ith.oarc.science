### [Nahum Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001)

[Nahum 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 1:1</span></span>

Nineveh

Nineveh stands in Scripture as the representative of apostate religious
Gentiledom, as Babylon represents the confusion into which the Gentile
political world-system has fallen ([Dan
2:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#041));

(See Scofield) - ([Isa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001)).

Under the preaching of Jonah, B.C. 862, the city and king had turned to
God (Elohim), ([Jon 3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003)) But in the
time of Nahum, more than a century later, the city had wholly
apostatized from God. It is this which distinguishes Nineveh from all
the other ancient Gentile cities, and which makes her the suited symbol
of the present religious Gentile world-system in the last day. Morally,
Nineveh is described in ([Rom
1:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021)). The chief deity of apostate
Nineveh was the bull-god, with the face of a man and the wings of a
bird: "an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and
four-footed beasts."

The message of Nahum, uttered about one hundred years before the
destruction of Nineveh, is, therefore, not a call to repentance, but an
unrelieved warning of judgment: "He will make an utter end: affliction
shall not rise up the second time." ([Nah
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009)); see, also, ([Nah
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010)). For there is no remedy for
apostasy but utter judgment, and a new beginning.

Compare ([Isa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004)); ([Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005)); ([Isa
1:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024)); ([Heb
6:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004)); ([Pro
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001)).

It is the way of God; apostasy is punished by catastrophic destruction.
Of this the flood and the destruction of Nineveh are witnesses. The
coming destruction of apostate Christendom is foreshadowed by these.

Compare ([Dan 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)); ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)); ([Luk
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#026)); ([Luk
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#027)); ([Rev
19:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017)).

God is jealous

The great ethical lesson of Nahum is that the character of God makes Him
not only "slow to anger," and "a stronghold to them that trust Him," but
also one who "will not at all acquit the wicked." He can be "just, and
the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus" ([Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026)) but only because His holy law
has been vindicated in the cross.

he knoweth them that trust

([Psa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006)); ([Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)).

(See Scofield) - ([Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012)).
