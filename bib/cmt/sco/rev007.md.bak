tribulation

The great tribulation is the period of unexampled trouble predicted in
the passages cited under that head from ([Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005).md) to ([Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014).md) and described in Revelation
11-18. Involving in a measure the whole earth ([Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010).md) it is yet distinctly "the time
of Jacob's trouble" ([Jer 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007).md) and
its vortex Jerusalem and the Holy Land. It involves the people of God
who will have returned to Palestine in unbelief. Its duration is three
and a half years, or the last half of the seventieth week of Daniel.

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md). ([Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002).md); ([Rev
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003).md)

The elements of the tribulation are:

\(1\) The cruel reign of the "beast out of the sea" ([Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001).md) who at the beginning of the
three and a half years, will break his covenant with the Jews (by virtue
of which they will have re-established the temple worship, ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md) and show himself in the temple,
demanding that he be worshipped as God. ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).md); ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004).md).

\(2\) The active interposition of Satan "having great wrath" ([Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012).md) who gives his power to the
Beast. ([Rev 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004).md); ([Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005).md).

\(3\) The unprecedented activity of demons ([Rev
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#002).md); ([Rev
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011).md), and

\(4\) the terrible "bowl" judgments of Revelation 16.

The great tribulation will be, however, a period of salvation. An
election out of Israel is seen as sealed for God ([Rev
7:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004).md) and, with an innumerable
multitude of Gentiles ([Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009).md) are
said to have come "out of the great tribulation" ([Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014).md). They are not of the priesthood,
the church, to which they seem to stand somewhat in the relation of the
Levites to the priests under the Mosaic Covenant. The great tribulation
is immediately followed by the return of Christ in glory, and the events
associated therewith. ([Mat 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md);
([Mat 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030).md).

See "Remnant" ([Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005).md).

"Beast"

(See Scofield) - ([Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020).md)

"Armageddon" ([Rev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017).md).

[Revelation 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 7:17</span></span>

God

Adonai Jehovah. ([Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008).md).
