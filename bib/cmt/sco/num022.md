Balaam

Balaam is the typical hireling prophet, seeking only to make a market of
his gift. This is "the way of Balaam" ([Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015).md) and characterizes false
teachers. The "error" of Balaam" ([Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011).md) was that he could see only the
natural morality -- a holy God, he reasoned, must curse such a people as
Israel. Like all false teachers he was ignorant of the higher morality
of vicarious atonement, by which God could be just and yet the justifier
of believing sinners ([Rom 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026).md). The
"doctrine of Balaam" ([Rev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).md)
refers to his teaching Balak to corrupt the people whom he could not
curse; ([Num 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016).md); ([Num
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001).md); ([Jam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004).md). Spiritually, Balaamism in
teaching never rises above natural reasonings; in practice, it is easy
world-conformity.

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).md).

not go

Compare ([Num 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#012).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003).md).

[Numbers 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022.md)

anger

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003).md).

In ([Num 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#012).md) the directive will of
Jehovah is made known to Balaam, in ([Num
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#020).md) Jehovah's permissive will. The
prophet is now free to go, but knows the true mind of the Lord about it.
The matter is wholly one between Jehovah and His servant. The permission
of ([Num 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#020).md) really constitutes a
testing of Balaam. He chose the path of self-will and self-advantage,
and Jehovah could not but gravely disapprove. The whole scene, ([Num
22:22-35](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022).md) prepared Balaam for what was
to follow.

angel

utmost

"Utmost part," etc, means the end of the encampment, the "fourth part of
Israel" ([Num 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010).md). Balak's thought,
as Grant (following Keil) points out, was not at all to permit Balaam to
see the whole of the Hebrew host. In bringing Balaam to Pisgah ([Num
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#013).md); ([Num
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#014).md). Balak corrects what,
evidently, he thought a blunder. ([Num
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013).md); ([Num
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014).md). But when the hireling sees the
whole camp he must utter a grander word than before, "He hath not beheld
iniquity in Jacob," and that with the nation in full view! What an
illustration of the truth of ([Rom
4:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005).md).
