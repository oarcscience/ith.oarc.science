### [Jeremiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 37:11</span></span>

And it came to pass

Five phases of Jeremiah's prison experiences are recorded:

\(1\) He is arrested in the gate and committed to a dungeon on the false
charge of treason ([Jer 37:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011).md).

\(2\) he is released from the dungeon, but restrained to the court of
the prison;

\(3\) he is imprisoned in the miry dungeon and kept in prison court
([Jer 38:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001).md).

\(4\) he is again released from the dungeon and kept in the prison court
([Jer 38:13-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#013).md) until the capture of
the city;

\(5\) carried in chains from the city by Nebuzar-adan, captain of the
guard, he is finally released at Ramah. ([Jer
40:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001).md).
