### [Jeremiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 7:1</span></span>

The word that came

The general character of the message in the temple gate is, like the
first and second messages, one of rebuke, warning, and exhortation, but
this message is addressed more to such in Judah as still maintaining
outwardly the worship of Jehovah; it is a message to religious Judah,
for example ([Jer 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#002)); ([Jer
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009)); ([Jer
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010)); ([Jer
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010)); ([Jer
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#011)).

[Jeremiah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 7:8</span></span>

trust

(See Scofield) - ([Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 7:22</span></span>

nor commanded

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004)), note 2,

the threefold giving of the law. The command concerning burnt-offerings
and sacrifices was not given to the people till they had broken the
decalogue, the law of obedience.

[Jeremiah 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 7:33</span></span>

carcases

See ([Jer 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011)); ([Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010)); ([Eze
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#005)). Fulfilled in part in all the
destructions of Jerusalem, but with a final look toward ([Rev
19:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017)).
