Wherefore I abhor myself

The problem, of which the book of Job is the profound discussion, finds
here its solution. Brought into the presence of God, Job is revealed to
himself. In no sense a hypocrite, but godly and possessing a faith which
all his afflictions could not shake, Job was yet self-righteous and
lacking in humility. Chapter 29 fully discloses this. But in the
presence of God he anticipates, as it were, the experience of Paul.
([Phi 3:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004).md) and the problem is
solved. The godly are afflicted that they may be brought to
self-knowledge and self-judgment. Such afflictions are not penal for
their sins, but remedial and purifying. The book of Job affords a
sublime illustration of the truth announced in; ([Co1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031).md); ([Co1
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032).md); ([Heb
12:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007).md). Best of all, such
self-knowledge and self-judgment is the prelude to greater fruitfulness.
([Job 42:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007).md); ([Joh
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002).md).

Compare ([Jos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013).md); ([Jos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014).md); ([Eze
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028).md); ([Eze
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001).md); ([Dan
10:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005).md); ([Rev
1:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017).md).
