Book Introduction - Jonah

The historical character of the man Jonah is vouched for by Jesus Christ
[Mat 12:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039.md) as also that his
preservation in the great fish was a "sign" or type of the Lord's own
entombment and resurrection. Both are miraculous and both are equally
credible. [Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md) records the
fulfilment of a prophecy by Jonah. The man himself was a bigoted Jew,
unwilling to testify to a Gentile city, and angry that God had spared
it. Typically he foreshadows the nation of Israel out of its own land; a
trouble to the Gentiles, yet witnessing to them; cast out by them, but
miraculously preserved; in their future deepest distress calling upon
Jehovah-Saviour, and finding deliverance, and then becoming missionaries
to the Gentiles. [Zac 8:7-23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007.md).

He typifies Christ as the Sent One, raised from the dead, and carrying
salvation to the Gentiles. The chapter divisions indicate the analysis
of Jonah.
