needeth

The underlying imagery is of an oriental returning from the public baths
to his house. His feet would contract defilement and require cleansing,
but not his body. So the believer is cleansed as before the law from all
sin "once for all" ([Heb 10:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001)) but
needs ever to bring his daily sins to the Father in confession, that he
may abide in unbroken fellowship with the Father and with the Son ([Jo1
1:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)). The blood of Christ answers
forever to all the law could say as to the believer's guilt, but he
needs constant cleansing from the defilement of sin, ([Eph
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)); ([Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006)). Typically, the order of approach
to the presence of God was, first, the brazen altar of sacrifice, and
then the laver of cleansing ([Exo
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#006)); ([Exo
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#007)).

See, also, the order in ([Exo
30:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017)).

Christ cannot have communion with a defiled saint, but He can and will
cleanse him.

washed

Literally, "bathed". The Greek word signifies "a complete ablution".
"Wash" is another word.

Son of man

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020)).
