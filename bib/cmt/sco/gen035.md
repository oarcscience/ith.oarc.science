### [Genesis Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 35:7</span></span>

El-beth-el

That is, the God of Bethel.

Compare ([Gen 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019).md).

There it was the place as the scene of the ladder vision which impressed
jacob. He called the place "Bethel," that is, the house of God. Now it
is the God of the place, rather than the place, and he calls it
El-Bethel, that is, "the God of the house of God." Compare ([Gen
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#020).md).

[Genesis 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 35:14</span></span>

drink offering

The first mention of the drink-offering. It is not mentioned among the
Levitical offerings of Leviticus 1-7, though included in the
instructions for sacrifice in the land ([Num
15:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#005).md). It was always "poured out,"
never drunk, and may be considered a type of Christ in the sense of;
([Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014).md); ([Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md).

[Genesis 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 35:18</span></span>

Benjamin

That is, Son of my right hand. Benjamin, "son of sorrow" to his mother,
but "son of my right hand" to his father, becomes thus a double type of
Christ. As Ben-oni He was the suffering One because of whom a sword
pierced His mother's heart ([Luk 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035).md)
as Benjamin, head of the warrior tribe ([Gen
49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027).md) firmly joined to Judah the
kingly tribe; ([Gen 49:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008).md); ([Kg1
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021).md) he becomes a type of the
victorious One. It is noteworthy that Benjamin was especially honoured
among the Gentiles ([Gen 45:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#022).md).

So manifold are the distinctions of Christ that many personal types of
Him are needed. Joseph is not complete, Benjamin standing only for
Christ the sorrowful One ([Isa 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003).md);
([Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004).md) yet have power on earth.

(Cf) (See Scofield) - ([Gen 43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034).md).
