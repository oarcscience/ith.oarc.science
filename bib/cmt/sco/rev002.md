[Revelation 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006)

Nicolaitanes

From Greek, "nikao", "to conquer," and Greek, "laos", "the people," or
"laity." There is no ancient authority for a sect of the Nicolaitanes.
If the word is symbolic, it refers to the earliest form of the notion of
a priestly order, or "clergy," which later divided an equal brotherhood
([Mat 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008)) into "priests" and
"laity." What in Ephesus was "deeds" ([Rev
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006)) had become in Pergamos a
"doctrine ([Rev 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#015)).

Nicolaitanes

The "doctrine" of Balaam

The doctrine of Balaam

Compare (See Scofield) - ([Pe2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015));

(See Scofield) - ([Jde 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011))

was his teaching Balak to corrupt the people who could not be cursed.
([Num 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#015)); ([Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016)); ([Num
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005)); ([Num
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#008)) by tempting them to marry women
of Moab, defile their separation, and abandon their pilgrim character.
It is that union with the world and the church which is spiritual
unchastity. ([Jam 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004)). Pergamos had
lost the pilgrim character and was "dwelling" ([Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013)) "where Satan's throne is," in
the world. ([Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)); ([Joh
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030)); ([Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011)).
