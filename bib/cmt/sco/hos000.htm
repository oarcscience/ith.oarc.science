<p>Book Introduction - Hosea
<p>Hosea was a contemporary of Amos in Israel, and of Isaiah and Micah in Judah, and his ministry continued after the first, or Assyrian, captivity of the northern kingdom <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029">Kg2 15:29</A>. His style is abrupt, metaphorical, and figurative. 
<p>Israel is Jehovah's adulterous wife, repudiated, but ultimately to be purified and restored. This is Hosea's distinctive message, which may be summed up in his two words, Lo-ammi, "not my people," and Ammi, "my people." Israel is not merely apostate and sinful--that is said also; but her sin takes its character from the exalted relationship into which she has been brought. 
<p>The book is in three parts: 
<p>1. The dishonoured wife (Hosea 1:1 - 3:5). 
<p>2. The sinful people (Hosea 4:1 - 13:8). 
<p>3. The ultimate blessing and glory of Israel (Hosea 13:9 - 14:9). 
<p>The events recorded in Hosea cover a period of 60 years (Ussher).
