[Numbers 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007)

and said

In the prophecies of Balaam God testifies on behalf of His people rather
than (as usual) to them. It is the divine testimony to their standing as
a redeemed people in view of the serpent "lifted up," and of the water
from the smitten rock. ([Num 21:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005));
([Num 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011)). Their state was morally
bad, but this was a matter concerning the discipline of God, not His
judgment. The interpretation of the prophecies is literal as to Israel,
typical as to Christians. Through Christ "lifted up" ([Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014)) our standing is eternally secure
and perfect, though our state may require the Father's discipline; ([Co1
11:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030)); ([Co2
1:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004)); ([Co2
1:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010)) meantime, against all
enemies, God is "for us." ([Rom 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031)).
