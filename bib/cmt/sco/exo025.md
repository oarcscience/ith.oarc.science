### [Exodus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 25:1</span></span>

the Lord spoke unto Moses

The general authority for the types of Exodus is found:

\(1\) as to the persons and events, in ([Co1
10:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001).md).

\(2\) as to the tabernacle, in ([Heb
9:1-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001).md). Having the assurance that in
the tabernacle everything is typical, the details must of necessity be
received as such. Two warnings are necessary:

\(1\) Nothing may be dogmatically asserted to be a type without explicit
New Testament authority; and

\(2\) all types not so authenticated must be recognized as having the
authority of analogy, or spiritual congruity, merely. The typical
meanings of the materials and colours of the tabernacle are believed to
be as follows: Gold, Deity in manifestation -- divine glory; silver,
redemption ([Exo 30:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 38:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#027).md),

brass, symbol of judgment, as in the brazen altar and in the serpent of
brass ([Num 21:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006).md) blue, heavenly in
nature or origin; purple, royalty; scarlet, sacrifice.

tabernacle pattern

The tabernacle, speaking comprehensively, is explained in the New
Testament As typical in three ways:

\(1\) of the Church as a habitation of God through the Spirit ([Exo
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008).md); ([Eph
2:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019).md).

\(2\) of the believer ([Co2 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016).md).

\(3\) as a figure of things in the heavens ([Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023).md); ([Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024).md). In detail, all speaks of
Christ:

\(1\) The ark, in its materials, acacia-wood

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015).md)

and gold, is a type of the humanity and deity of Christ.

\(2\) In its contents, a type of Christ, as:

\(a\) having God's law in His heart ([Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016).md).

\(b\) the wilderness food (or portion) of His people ([Exo
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#033).md)

\(c\) Himself the resurrection, of which Aaron;s rod is the symbol ([Num
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010).md).

\(3\) In its use the ark, especially the mercy-seat, was a type of God's
throne. That it was, to the sinning Israelite, a throne of grace and not
of judgment was due to the mercy-seat formed of gold and sprinkled with
the blood of atonement, which vindicated the law, and divine holiness
guarded by the cherubim ([Gen 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Eze 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005).md)

See PROPITIATION,

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md)

make an ark

All begins with the ark, which, in the completed tabernacle, was placed
in the holy of holies, because, in revelation, God begins from Himself,
working outward toward man; as, in approach, the worshipper begins from
himself, moving toward God in the holy of holies. The same order is
followed in the Levitical offerings (Le 1-5). In approach man begins at
the brazen altar, type of the Cross, where, in the fire of judgment,
atonement is made.

make an ark

The most inclusive type of Christ, "Gold", signifies "Deity"; "wood,
signifies "humanity". History:

([Num 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031).md); ([Num
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033).md); ([Jos
3:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003).md); ([Jos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#011).md); ([Jdg
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#027).md); ([Sa1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003).md); ([Sa1
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001).md); ([Sa1
5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001).md); ([Sa1
6:1-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#001).md); ([Sa1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001).md); ([Sa1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002).md); ([Sa2
6:2-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002).md); ([Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002).md); ([Sa2
15:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024).md); ([Kg1
8:1-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001).md) not carried to Babylon, ([Kg2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013).md); ([Ch2
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#003).md); not mentioned in Ezra or Neh.
Where is it? ([Rev 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019).md).

That is, acacia.

See "Propitiation."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 25:30</span></span>

shewbread

Showbread, type of Christ, the Bread of God, nourisher of the
Christian's life as a believer-priest ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md); ([Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md). In ([Joh
6:33-58](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033).md) our Lord has more in mind the
manna, that food which "came down"; but all typical meanings of "bread"
are there gathered into His words. The manna is the life-giving Christ;
the showbread, the life-sustaining Christ. The showbread typifies Christ
as the "corn of wheat" ([Joh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024).md)
ground in the mill of suffering ([Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027).md) and brought into the fire of
judgment ([Joh 12:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031).md). We, as
priests, by faith feed upon Him as having undergone that in our stead
and for our sakes. It is meditation upon Christ, as in ([Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002).md); ([Heb
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003).md).

[Exodus 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 25:31</span></span>

candlestick

Candlestick, type of Christ our Light, shining in the fullness of the
power of the sevenfold Spirit ([Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md); ([Heb
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009).md); ([Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004).md). Natural light was excluded from
the tabernacle.

Compare ([Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014).md); ([Co1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016).md)

([Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004).md).
