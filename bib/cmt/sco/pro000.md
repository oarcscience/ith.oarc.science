Book Introduction - Proverbs

This collection of sententious sayings is divine wisdom applied to the
earthly conditions of the people of God. That the Proverbs were
Solomon's ([Pro 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001)) implies no more
than that he gathered into orderly arrangement sayings already current
amongst the people, the wisdom of the Spirit, perhaps through many
centuries ([Ecc 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009)). Chapters 25-29
were current in Hezekiah's time ([Ecc
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc025.htm#001)). Chapters 30 and 31 are by Agur
and Lemuel.

The book is in six parts:

1\. To sons (Proverbs 1-7).

2\. The praise of wisdom (Proverbs 8-9).

3\. The folly of sin (Proverbs 10-19).

4\. Warnings and instructions (Proverbs 20-29).

5\. The words of Agur (Proverbs 30).

6\. The words of King Lemuel (Proverbs 31).
