### [Zechariah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#001.md)

holy mountain

Holiness, Sanctification, Summary:

In the Old Testament the words consecration, dedication, sanctification,
and holiness are various renderings of one Hebrew word, are used of
persons and of things, and have an identical meaning, that is, set apart
for God. Only when used of God himself (for example ([Lev
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#045).md), or of the holy angels (for
example ([Dan 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013).md) is any inward;
([Lev 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#045).md); ([Dan
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013).md) moral quality necessarily
implied. Doubtless a priest or other person set apart to the service of
God, whose whole will and desire went with his setting apart,
experienced progressively an inner detachment from evil; but that aspect
is distinctively of the New Testament, not of the Old Testament ([Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005).md).

these days

The "remnant" in ([Zac 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006).md); ([Zac
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#011).md); ([Zac
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#012).md) refers to the remnant of Judah
which returned from Babylon, and among whom Zechariah was prophesying.

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005).md).

repented

Repentance (Old Testament), Summary:

In the Old Testament, repentance is the English word used to translate
the Hebrew, nacham, to be "eased" or "comforted." It is used of both God
and man. Notwithstanding the literal meaning of nacham, it is evident,
from a study of all the passages, that the sacred writers use it in the
sense of metanoia in the New Testament -- a change of mind. ([Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

(See Scofield) - ([Act 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030).md).

As in the New Testament, such change of mind is often accompanied by
contrition and self-judgment. When applied to God the word is used
phenomenally according to Old Testament custom. God seems to change His
mind. The phenomena are such as, in the case of man, would indicate a
change of mind.

those days

That is, in the days when Jerusalem has been made the centre of the
earth's worship. ([Zac 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023).md) explains:
the Jew

(see "Remnant," ([Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009).md); ([Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005).md)

will then be the missionary, and to the very "nations" now called
"Christian"!
