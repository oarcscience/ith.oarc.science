### [John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

[John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 1:1</span></span>

Word

(Greek, "logos"); (Aramaic, "Memra," used in the Targums, or Hebrew,
paraphrases, for "God"). The Greek term means,

\(1\) a thought or concept;

\(2\) the expression or utterance of that thought. As a designation of
Christ, therefore, Logos is peculiarly felicitous because,

\(1\) in Him are embodied all the treasures of the divine wisdom, the
collective "thought" of God ([Co1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024)); ([Eph
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011)); ([Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)); ([Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)) and,

\(2\) He is from eternity, but especially in His incarnation, the
utterance or expression of the Person, and "thought" of Deity ([Joh
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003)); ([Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009)); ([Joh
1:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)); ([Joh
14:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009)); ([Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)).

In the Being, Person, and work of Christ, Deity is told out.

[John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 1:5</span></span>

comprehended

Or, apprehended; literally, "laid not hold of it."

[John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 1:10</span></span>

world

Greek, "kosmos" means "mankind".

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008)).

[John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 1:11</span></span>

He came

That is, He came unto his own things, and his own people received him
not.

[John 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 1:17</span></span>

grace

Grace. Summary:

\(1\) Grace is "the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man. . .
Not by works of righteousness which we have done" ([Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004)); ([Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005)).

It is, therefore, constantly set in contrast to law, under which God
demands righteousness from man, as, under grace, he gives righteousness
to man ([Rom 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021)); ([Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022)); ([Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004)); ([Plm
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm003.htm#009)). Law is connected with Moses and
works; grace with Christ and faith; ([Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)); ([Rom
10:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004)). Law blesses the good; grace
saves the bad; ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)); ([Eph
2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001)). Law demands that blessings be
earned; grace is a free gift; ([Deu
28:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001)); ([Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008)); ([Rom
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004)); ([Rom
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005)).

\(2\) As a dispensation, grace begins with the death and resurrection of
Christ ([Rom 3:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024)); ([Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004)); ([Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024)); ([Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025)). The point of testing is no
longer legal obedience as the condition of salvation, but acceptance or
rejection of Christ, with good works as a fruit of salvation, ([Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)); ([Joh
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013)); ([Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036)); ([Mat
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037)); ([Mat
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#024)); ([Joh
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022)); ([Joh
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025)); ([Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)); ([Jo1
5:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010)). The immediate result of this
testing was the rejection of Christ by the Jews, and His crucifixion by
Jew and Gentile ([Act 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027)). The
predicted end of the testing of man under grace is the apostasy of the
professing church:

(see "Apostasy"

(See Scofield) - ([Ti2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)); ([Ti2
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001));

and the resultant apocalyptic judgments.

\(3\) Grace has a twofold manifestation: in salvation ([Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024)) and in the walk and service of
the saved ([Rom 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#015)).

See, for the other six dispensations:

Innocence,

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028)).

Conscience,

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#023)).

Human Government,

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021)).

Promise,

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001)).

Law,

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008)).

Kingdom,

(See Scofield) - ([Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010)).

[John 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 1:18</span></span>

hath seen God

Compare ([Gen 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#020)); ([Exo
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010)); ([Exo
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018)); ([Jdg
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022)); ([Jdg
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#022)); ([Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004)).

The divine essence, God, veiled in angelic form, and especially as
incarnate in Jesus Christ, has been seen of men. ([Gen
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002)); ([Gen
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#022)); ([Joh
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008)); ([Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009)).

declared

Literally, led him forth, that is, into full revelation. ([Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009)).

[John 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)
