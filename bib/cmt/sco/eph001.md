### [Ephesians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001)

[Ephesians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 1:1</span></span>

in Christ

The believer's place as a member of the body of Christ, vitally united
to Him by the baptism with the Holy Spirit. ([Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012)); ([Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013)).

[Ephesians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 1:3</span></span>

in heavenly places

Literally, the heavenlies. The same Greek word is used in ([Joh
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012)) where "things" is added. In both
places, the word signifies that which is heavenly in contradistinction
to that which is earthy. In Ephesians, "places" is especially
misleading. "The heavenlies" may be defined as the sphere of the
believer's spiritual experience as identified with Christ in...

nature; ([Pe2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004));

life; ([Col 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)); ([Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012));

relationships; ([Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017)); ([Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011));

service; ([Joh 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#018)); ([Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020));

suffering; ([Phi 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029)); ([Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010)); ([Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024));

inheritance; ([Rom 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016)); ([Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)); and

future glory in the kingdom; ([Rom
8:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018)); ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)); ([Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)); ([Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010)).

The believer is a heavenly man, and a stranger and pilgrim on the earth.
([Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001)); ([Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011)).

[Ephesians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 1:5</span></span>

predestinated

Predestination is that effective exercise of the will of God by which
things before determined by Him are brought to pass.

See Election,

(See Scofield) - ([Pe1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002)).

Foreknowledge,

(See Scofield) - ([Pe1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020)).

adoption

Adoption (Greek, "huiothesia", "placing as a son") is not so much a word
of relationship as of position. The believer's relation to God as a
child results from the new birth ([Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)); ([Joh
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013)) whereas adoption is the act of
God whereby one already a child is, through redemption from the law,
placed in the position of an adult son. ([Gal
4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)).

The indwelling Spirit gives the realization of this in the believer's
present experience ([Gal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)) but the
full manifestation of the believer's sonship awaits the resurrection,
change, and translation of saints, which is called "the redemption of
the body"; ([Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023)); ([Th1
4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014)); ([Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014)); ([Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002)).

[Ephesians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 1:7</span></span>

sins

Sin

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023)).

grace

Grace (in salvation). ([Rom 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#006));
([Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007)); ([Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)); ([Rom
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007)); ([Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008)); ([Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024)).

(See Scofield) - ([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)).

[Ephesians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 1:9</span></span>

mystery

See ([Rom 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025)); ([Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026)); ([Eph
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003)).

(See Scofield) - ([Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011)).

[Ephesians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 1:10</span></span>

dispensation of the fullness of times

The Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. This, the seventh and last of
the ordered ages which condition human life on the earth, is identical
with the kingdom covenanted to David. ([Sa2
7:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008)); ([Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)).

Summary;

([Luk 1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031)); ([Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)); and gathers into itself under
Christ all past "times":

\(1\) The time of oppression and misrule ends by Christ taking His
kingdom. ([Isa 11:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003)).

\(2\) The time of testimony and divine forbearance ends in judgment.
([Mat 25:31-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)); ([Act
17:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030)); ([Rev
20:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007)).

\(3\) The time of toil ends in rest and reward. ([Th2
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006)).

\(4\) The time of suffering ends in glory. ([Rom
8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)).

\(5\) The time of Israel's blindness and chastisement ends in
restoration and conversion. ([Rom
11:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)); ([Eze
39:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#025)).

\(6\) The times of the Gentiles end in the smiting of the image and the
setting up of the kingdom of the heavens. ([Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)); ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)); ([Rev
19:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015)).

\(7\) The time of creation's thraldom ends in deliverance at the
manifestation of the sons of God. ([Gen
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017)); ([Isa
11:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006)); ([Rom
8:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)).

[Ephesians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 1:13</span></span>

sealed

The Holy Spirit is Himself, the seal. In the symbolism of Scripture, a
seal signifies:

\(1\) A finished transaction; ([Jer
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#009)); ([Jer
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010)); ([Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004)); ([Joh
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#030)).

\(2\) Ownership; ([Jer 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#011)); ([Jer
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012)); ([Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)).

\(3\) Security; ([Est 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008)); ([Dan
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#017)); ([Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030)).
