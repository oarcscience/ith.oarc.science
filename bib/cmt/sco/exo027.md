### [Exodus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)

[Exodus 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 27:1</span></span>

altar

Brazen altar, type of the Cross upon which Christ, our whole
burnt-offering offered Himself without spot to God ([Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014)).

height

(Cf) ([Exo 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010)). The altar of burnt
offering is double the height of the mercy-seat. The atonement more than
saves us -- it glorifies God ([Joh
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#014)).

shittim

That is, acacia.

wood

The wood (Christ's humanity), completely inclosed in brass, must have
become completely charred by sacrificial fires.

Compare ([Heb 10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005)).

[Exodus 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 27:2</span></span>

brass

Compare ([Num 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#009)); ([Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014)); ([Joh
12:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)), thus fixing the symbolic
meaning of brass as divine manifestation in judgment.

[Exodus 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 27:6</span></span>

shittim

That is, acacia.

[Exodus 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 27:9</span></span>

fine twined linen

The fine linen commonly typifies personal righteousness ([Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001)) ref. (d), and in the hangings of
the court stands for that measure of righteousness which God demands of
any who would, in his own righteousness, approach. Christ, figuratively
speaking, put up the hangings of the court in ([Luk
10:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025)). The only way of approach
was the "gate"; ([Exo 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016)); ([Joh
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009)). The hangings of the court bar
out equally the self-righteous man and the open sinner, for the height
was above seven feet. ([Exo 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#018)).

[Exodus 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 27:16</span></span>

gate

In the hangings of the court ([Exo
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009)), representing that practical
righteousness which God demands in the law, and which, therefore, bars
out all men; ([Rom 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019)); ([Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020)); ([Rom
10:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003)). No colours are inwrought. But
the "gate" is Christ ([Joh 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009)) and
so the colours reappear as in the veil ([Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031)).

[Exodus 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 27:17</span></span>

pillars

The fillets and hooks upholding the linen hangings are of silver

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 38:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#027))

for it is in virtue of His redemptive work that Christ is our way of
access, and not by virtue of His righteous life (symbolized by the fine
linen); but the pillars of the court rest upon brass sockets, not silver
as in the case of the boards

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#019))

and brass symbolizes divine righteousness in judgment

(See Scofield) - ([Num 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#009)).

Redemption not only displays God's mercy, but vindicates His
righteousness in showing that mercy. ([Rom
3:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021)).

[Exodus 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 27:19</span></span>

brass

(See Scofield) - ([Num 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#009)).

[Exodus 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 27:20</span></span>

oil

Oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit (Cf) ([Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)); ([Heb
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009)). In Christ the oil-fed Light ever
burns, the Light of the world ([Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)). But here we have not the world,
but the sanctuary. It is a question, not of testimony in and to the
world, but of our communion and worship as believer-priests in the
holiest ([Heb 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019)); ([Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020)). In the Tabernacle there were
two compartments, two lights: the holy place with the candlestick

(See Scofield) - ([Exo 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031))

the holy of holies with the shekinah, or manifested glory of God. These
two places are now one; ([Mat 27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050));
([Mat 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051)); ([Heb
9:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006)); ([Heb
10:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019)) but it is important to see
that there are still two lights: Christ, the Light of life ([Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)) through the Spirit giving light
upon the holy things of God, the showbread and altar of incense; and
also the shekinah, now on the face of Jesus Christ ([Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006)). Into this twofold light we, as
believer-priests, are brought ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)). We "walk in the light," not
merely which He gives, but in which He lives ([Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007)). But what of the command to
"bring pure oil" ([Exo 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020)). Because
our access, apprehension, communion, and transformation are by the
Spirit; ([Eph 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018)); ([Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014)); ([Co1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015)); ([Co2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014)); ([Phi
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001)); ([Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018)). Our title to His presence is
the blood ([Eph 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013)) but only as
filled with the Spirit ([Eph 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018)) do
we really walk in the light.
