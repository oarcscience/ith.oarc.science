Book Introduction - James

Writer: James

See Scofield - [Mat 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021).md), called "the
Just" mentioned by Paul with Cephas and John as "pillars" in the church
at Jerusalem [Gal 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md). He seems to
have been, as a religious man, austere, legal, ceremonial [Act
21:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md).

Date: Tradition fixes the martyrdom of James in the year 62, but his
Epistle shows no trace of the larger revelations concerning the church
and the distinctive doctrines of grace made through the Apostle Paul,
nor even of the discussion concerning the relation of Gentile converts
to the law of Moses, which culminated in the first council (Acts 15),
over which James presided. This presumes the very early date of James,
which may confidently be set down as "the first Epistle to
Christians."--Weston.

Theme: By "the twelve tribes scattered abroad" we are to understand, not
Jews, but Christian Jews of the Dispersion. The church began with such
[Act 2:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#005.md) and James, who seems not
to have left Jerusalem, would feel a particular pastoral responsibility
for these scattered sheep. They still resorted to the synagogues, or
called their own assemblies by that name [Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md), where "assembly" is "synagogue"
in the Gr.). It appears from [Jam
2:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md) that they still held the
synagogue courts for the trial of causes arising amongst themselves. The
Epistle, then, is elementary in the extreme. To suppose that [Jam
2:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014.md) is a polemic against Paul's
doctrine of justification is absurd. Neither Galatians nor Romans was
yet written.

James' theme, then, is "religion" (Gr., threskeia, "outward religious
service") as the expression and proof of faith. He does not exalt works
as against faith, but faith as producing works. His style is that of the
Wisdom-books of the O.T.

The divisions are five:

1\. The testing of faith (James 1:1 - 2:26).

2\. The reality of faith tested by the tongue (James 3:1-18).

3\. The rebuke of worldliness (James 4:1-17).

4\. The rich warned

5\. Hortatory
