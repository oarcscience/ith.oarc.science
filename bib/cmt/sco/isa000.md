The Prophetical Books and Introduction to Isaiah

Prophets were men raised up of God in times of declension and apostasy
in Israel. They were primarily revivalists and patriots, speaking on
behalf of God to the heart and conscience of the nation. The prophetic
messages have a twofold character: first, that which was local and for
the prophet's time; secondly, that which was predictive of the divine
purpose in future. Often the prediction springs immediately from the
local circumstances (e.g. [Isa 7:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001)
with [Isa 7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#012)).

It is necessary to keep this Israelitish character of the prophet in
mind. Usually his predictive, equally with his local and immediate
ministry, is not didactic and abstract, but has in view the covenant
people, their sin and failure, and their glorious future. The Gentile is
mentioned as used for the chastisement of Israel, as judged therefore,
but also as sharing the grace that is yet to be shown toward Israel. The
Church, corporately, is not in the vision of the O.T. prophet ([Eph
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)). The future blessing of Israel
as a nation rests upon the Palestinian Covenant of restoration and
conversion ([Deu 30:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001), refs.), and
the Davidic Covenant of the Kingship of the Messiah, David's Son ([Sa2
7:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008), refs.), and this gives to
predictive prophecy its Messianic character. The exaltation of Israel is
secured in the kingdom, and the kingdom takes its power to bless from
the Person of the King, David's Son, but also "Immanuel."

But as the King is also Son of Abraham ([Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)), the promised Redeemer, and as
redemption is only through the sacrifice of Christ, so messianic
prophecy of necessity presents Christ in a twofold character--a
suffering Messiah (e.g. Isaiah 53.), and a reigning Messiah (e.g. Isaiah
11.). This duality, suffering and glory, weakness and power, involved a
mystery which perplexed the prophets ([Pe1
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010); [Luk
24:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026)).

The solution of that mystery lies, as the New Testament makes clear, in
the two advents--the first advent to redemption through suffering; the
second advent to the kingdom glory, when the national promises to Israel
will be fulfilled ( [Mat 1:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021); [Luk
2:28-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#028); [Luk
24:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#046), with [Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031); [Luk
1:68-75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068); [Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002); [Mat
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006); [Mat
19:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#027); [Act
2:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030); [Act
15:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014)). The prophets indeed
describe the advent in two forms which could not be contemporaneous
(e.g. [Zac 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009); contra; [Zac
14:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001)), but to them it was not
revealed that between the advent to suffering, and the advent to glory,
would be accomplished certain "mysteries of the kingdom" ([Mat
13:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011)), not that, consequent upon
Messiah's rejection, the new Testament Church would be called out. These
were, to them, "mysteries hid in God" ([Eph
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)).

Speaking broadly, then, predictive prophecy is occupied with the
fulfilment of the Palestinian and Davidic Covenants; the Abrahamic
Covenant having also its place.

Gentile powers are mentioned as connected with Israel, but prophecy,
save in Daniel, Obadiah, Jonah, and Nahum, is not occupied with Gentile
world-history. Daniel, as will be see, has a distinctive character.

The predictions of the restoration from the Babylonian captivity at the
end of seventy years, must be distinguished from those of the
restoration from the present world-wide dispersion. The context is
always clear. The Palestinian Covenant Deu 28:1-30.9 is the mould of
predictive prophecy in its larger sense--national disobedience,
world-wide dispersion, repentance, the return of the Lord, the
regathering of Israel and establishment of the kingdom, the conversion
and blessing of Israel, and the judgment of Israel's oppressors.

The true division of the prophets is into pre-exilic, viz., in Judah:
Isaiah, Jeremiah (extending into the exile), Joel, Obadiah, Micah,
Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah. In Israel: Hosea, Amos, and Jonah. Exilic,
Ezekiel and Daniel, both of Judah, but prophesying to the whole nation.
Post-exilic, all of Judah: Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. The division
into major and minor prophetic writings, based upon the mere bulk of the
books, is unhistoric and non-chronological.

The keys which unlock the meaning of prophecy are: the two advents of
Messiah, the advent to suffer ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015); [Act
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009)), and the advent to reign ([Deu
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003); [Act
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009)); the doctrine of the Remnant
([Isa 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020), refs), the doctrine of
the day of the Lord ( [Isa 2:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010);
[Rev 19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)), and the doctrine of
the Kingdom (O.T.; [Gen 1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026);

See Scofield - [Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008); N.T., [Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031);

See Scofield - [Co1 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028)). Note). The
pivotal chapters, taking prophecy as a whole, are, Deuteronomy 28., 29.,
30.; Psalms2.; Daniel 2., 7.

The whole scope of prophecy must be taken into account in determining
the meaning of any particular passage ([Pe2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020)). Hence the importance of first
mastering the great themes above indicated, which, in this edition of
the Scriptures, may readily be done by tracing through the body of the
prophetic writings the subjects mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
The detail of the "time of the end," upon which all prophecy converges,
will be more clearly understood if to those subjects the student adds
the Beast ([Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)), and Armageddon ( [Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014); [Rev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017),

See Scofield - [Rev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017)).

Book Introduction - Isaiah

Isaiah is justly accounted the chief of the writing prophets. He has the
more comprehensive testimony and is distinctively the prophet of
redemption. Nowhere else in the Scriptures written under the law have we
so clear a view of grace. The New Testament Church does not appear ([Eph
3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003)), but Messiah in His Person and
sufferings, and the blessing of the Gentiles through Him, are in full
vision.

Apart from his testimony to his own time, which includes warnings of
coming judgments upon the great nations of that day, the predictive
messages of Isaiah cover seven great themes:

1\. Israel in exile and divine judgment upon Israel's oppressors.

2\. The return from Babylon.

3\. The manifestation of Messiah in humiliation (e.g. Isaiah 53).

4\. The blessing of the Gentiles.

5\. The manifestation of Messiah in judgment ("the day of vengeance of
our God").

6\. The reign of David's righteous Branch in the kingdom-age.

7\. The new heavens and the new earth.

Isaiah is in two chief divisions:

1\. Looking toward the captivities (Isaiah 1:1-39:8). Key verses,
(Isaiah 1:1-2).

2\. Looking beyond the captivities (Isaiah 40:1 - 66:24). Key verses,
(Isaiah 40:1-2).

These chief divisions fall into subdivisions, as indicated in the text.

The events recorded in Isaiah cover a period of 62 years (Ussher).
