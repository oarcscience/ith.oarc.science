Book Introduction - Mark

Writer: The Writer of the second Gospel, Mark, called also John, was the
son of one the New Testament "Marys", and nephew of Barnabas. He was an
associate of the apostles, and is mentioned in the writings of Paul and
of Luke [Act 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md); [Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md); [Act
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037.md); [Act
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039.md); [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md); [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md); [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md).

Date: The date of Mark has been variously placed between A.D. 57 and 63.

Theme: The scope and purpose of the book are evident from its contents.
In it Jesus is seen as the mighty Worker, rather than as the unique
Teacher. It is the Gospel of Jehovah's "Servant the Branch" [Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md) as Matthew is the Gospel of the
"Branch. . .unto David" [Jer 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md).

Everywhere the servant character of the incarnate Son is manifest. The
key verse is [Mar 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#045.md). "For even the
Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister." The
characteristic word is "straightway," a servant's word. There is no
genealogy, for who gives the genealogy of a servant? The distinctive
character of Christ in Mark is that set forth in [Phi
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md).

But this lowly Servant, who emptied Himself of the "form of God," "and
was found in fashion as a man," was, nevertheless, "the mighty God" [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md) as Mark distinctly declares ([Mar
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001).md) and therefore mighty works
accompanied and authenticated His ministry. As befits a Servant-Gospel,
Mark is characteristically a Gospel of deeds, rather than on words.

The best preparation of the heart for the study of Mark is the prayerful
reading of [Isa 42:1-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Isa
50:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md); [Isa
52:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md); [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md); [Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md); [Phi
2:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005.md).

Mark is in five principal divisions:

1\. The manifestation of the Servant-Son (Mark 1:1-11).

2\. The Servant-Son tested as to His fidelity (Mark 1:12-13).

3\. The Servant-Son at work (Mark 1:14 - 13:37).

4\. The Servant-Son "obedient unto death," (Mark 14:1 - 15:47).

5\. The ministry of the risen Servant-Son, now exalted to all authority
(Mark 16:1-20).

The events recorded in this book cover a period of 7 years.
