### [Romans Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001)

[Romans 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 11:1</span></span>

cast

That Israel has not been forever set aside is the theme of this chapter.

\(1\) The salvation of Paul proves that there is still a remnant ([Rom
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001))

\(2\) The doctrine of the remnant proves it ([Rom
11:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002)).

\(3\) The present national unbelief was foreseen ([Rom
11:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007)).

\(4\) Israel's unbelief is the Gentile opportunity ([Rom
11:11-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011)).

\(5\) Israel is judicially broken off from the good olive tree, Christ
([Rom 11:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017)).

\(6\) They are to be grafted in again ([Rom
11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023)).

\(7\) The promised Deliverer will come out of Zion and the nation will
be saved ([Rom 11:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)). That the
Christian now inherits the distinctive Jewish promises is not taught in
Scripture. The Christian is of the heavenly seed of Abraham; ([Gen
15:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005)); ([Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029)) and partakes of the spiritual
blessings of the Abrahamic Covenant.

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018))

but Israel as a nation always has it own place, and is yet to have its
greatest exaltation as the earthly people of God.

See "Israel" ([Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002)); ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)).

"Kingdom"; ([Gen 1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)); ([Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)).

Remnant

Remnant, Summary:

In the history of Israel, a "remnant" may be discerned, a spiritual
Israel within the national Israel. In Elijah's time, 7,000 had not bowed
the knee to Baal ([Kg1 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018)). In
Isaiah's time, it was the "very small remnant" for whose sake God still
forbore to destroy the nation ([Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009)). During the captivities, the
remnant appears in Jews like Ezekiel, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego, Esther, and Mordecai. At the end of the 70 years of Babylonian
captivity, it was the remnant which returned under Ezra and Nehemiah.

At the advent of our Lord, John the Baptist, Simeon, Anna, and "them
that looked for redemption in Jerusalem" ([Luk
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038)) were the remnant. During the
church-age, the remnant is composed of believing Jews ([Rom
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004)); ([Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)). But the chief interest in the
remnant is prophetic.

During the great tribulation, a remnant out of all Israel will turn to
Jesus as Messiah, and will become His witnesses after the removal of the
church ([Rev 7:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003)). Some of these
will undergo martyrdom ([Rev 6:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009));
some will be spared to enter the millennial kingdom ([Zac
12:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006)); ([Zac
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009)). Many of the Psalms express,
prophetically, the joys and sorrows of the tribulation remnant.

See ([Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009)).

fullness

The "fullness of the Gentiles" is the completion of the purpose of God
in this age, namely, the outcalling from among the Gentiles of a people
for Christ's name, "the church which is His body" ([Eph

1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023))

Compare ([Act 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014)); ([Eph

Jacob

Summary:

Israel, so named from the grandson of Abraham, was chosen for a fourfold
mission:

\(1\) To witness to the unity of God in the midst of universal idolatry
([Deu 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004)); ([Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010)); ([Isa
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#012));

\(2\) to illustrate to the nations the blessedness of serving the true
God ([Deu 33:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026)); ([Ch1
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#020)); ([Ch1
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#021)); ([Psa
144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015)).

\(3\) to receive, preserve, and transmit the Scripture ([Deu
4:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#005)); ([Rom
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001)); ([Rom
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002)).

\(4\) to produce, as to His humanity, the Messiah ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015)); ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003)); ([Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018)); ([Gen
28:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#010)); ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)); ([Sa2
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)); ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)); ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)); ([Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)); ([Rom
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003)). According to the prophets,
Israel, regathered from all nations, restored to her own land and
converted, is yet to have her greatest earthly exaltation and glory.

See "Kingdom (Old Testament)"; ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)).
