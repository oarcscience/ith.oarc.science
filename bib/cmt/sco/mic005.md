### [Micah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001)

[Micah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 5:1</span></span>

Now

The "word of the Lord that came to Micah" ([Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001)) having described the future
kingdom ([Mic 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001)) and glanced at
the Babylonian captivities ([Mic
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009)) goes forward into the last
days to refer to the great battle

(see "Armageddon,") ([Rev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014));

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017))

which immediately precedes the setting up of the Messianic kingdom

(see "Kingdom (Old Testament)," ([Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026))

See Scofield) - ([Zac 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008))

also, "Kingdom (New Testament), ([Luk
1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031)); ([Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028)); ([Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001)); ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002)) forms a parenthesis in which the
"word of the Lord" goes back from the time of the great battle (yet
future) to the birth and rejection of the King, Messiah-Christ ([Mat
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024)); ([Mat
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#025)); ([Mat
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037)). This is followed by the
statement that He will "give them up until the time that she which
travaileth hath brought forth" ([Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003)). There is a twofold "travail" of
Israel:

\(1\) that which brings forth the "man child" (Christ) ([Rev
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001)); ([Rev
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002)) and

\(2\) that which, in the last days, brings forth a believing "remnant"
out of the still dispersed and unbelieving nation ([Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003)); ([Jer
30:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#006)); ([Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010)). Both aspects are combined in
Isaiah 66. In ([Mic 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007)). we have the
"man-child" (Christ) of ([Rev 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001));
([Rev 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002)) in ([Mic
5:8-24](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008)) the remnant, established in
kingdom blessing. The meaning of ([Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003)) is that, from the rejection of
Christ at His first coming Jehovah will give Israel up till the
believing remnant appears; then He stands and feeds in His proper
strength as Jehovah ([Mic 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004)); He is
the defence of His people as in ([Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003)); ([Mic
4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011)) and afterward the remnant go
as missionaries to Israel and to all the world. ([Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007)); ([Mic
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008)); ([Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023)).

[Micah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 5:2</span></span>

everlasting

Compare ([Isa 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013)); ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)); ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)); ([Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007)).

The "child" was born in Bethlehem, but the "Son" was "from everlasting."

[Micah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 5:3</span></span>

remnant

(See Scofield) - ([Jer 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#021)).

[Micah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 5:7</span></span>

remnant

The ministry of the Jewish remnant ([Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005))

has a twofold aspect, "a dew from the Lord"; "a lion among the beasts."
Turning to the Lord in the great tribulation ([Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)).

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014)),

the remnant takes up the beautiful gospel of the kingdom.

(See Scofield) - ([Rev 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006))

and proclaims it under awful persecution "unto all nations, for a
witness." ([Mat 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014)). The result is
seen in ([Rev 7:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004)) This is the
"dew" aspect, and is followed by the "day of the Lord"; ([Isa
2:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010)); ([Rev
19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)). In the morning of which the
kingdom is set up in power. Again there is a world-wide preaching to Jew
and Gentile, but now it is the word that the King is on His holy hill of
Zion (Psalm 2), and the unrepentant will be broken with His rod of iron.
([Psa 2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006)). The preaching is given
in ([Psa 2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010)). This is the "lion"
aspect of the remnant's testimony. ([Rev
2:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026)). The full kingdom-age of
blessing follows the "rod of iron" aspect.
