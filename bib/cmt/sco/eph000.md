Book Introduction - Ephesians

Writer: The Apostle Paul (1:1).

Date: Ephesians was written from Rome in A.D. 64. It is the first in
order of the Prison Epistles. (Acts 20:1 - 27:44).

See Scofield - [Act 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030)) and was
sent by Tychicus, concurrently with Colossians and Philemon. It is
probable that the two greater letters had their occasion in the return
of Onesimus to Philemon. Ephesians is the most impersonal of Paul's
letters. Indeed the words, "to the Ephesians," are not in the best
manuscripts. [Col 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016) mentions an
epistle to the Laodiceans. It has been conjectured that the letter known
to us as Ephesians is really the Laodicean letter. Probably it was sent
to Ephesus and Laodicea without being addressed to any church. The
letter would then be "to the saints and the faithful in Christ Jesus"
anywhere.

Theme: The doctrine of the Epistle confirms this view. It contains the
highest church truth, but has nothing about church order. The church
here is the true church, "His body," not the local church, as in
Philippians, Corinthians, etc. Essentially, three lines of truth make up
this Epistle: the believer's exalted position through grace; the truth
concerning the body of Christ; and a walk in accordance with that
position.

There is a close spiritual affinity between Ephesians and Joshua, the
"heavenlies" answering in Christian position to Canaan in Israel's
experience. In both there is conflict, often failure, but also victory,
rest, and possession [Jos 21:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043);
[Eph 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003); [Eph
3:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014); [Eph
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016); [Eph
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#023). As befits a complete revelation,
the number seven is conspicuous in the structure of Ephesians.

The divisions are, broadly, four:

1\. The apostolic greeting (Ephesians 1:1-2).

2\. Positional; the believer's standing "Christ" and "in the heavenlies"
through pure grace (Ephesians 1:3 - 3:21).

3\. Walk and service (Ephesians 4:1 - 5:17).

4\. The walk and warfare of the Spirit-filled believer (Ephesians 5:18 -
6:24).
