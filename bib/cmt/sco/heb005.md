Melchisedec

(See Scofield) - ([Gen 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018)).

Melchisedec was a suitable type of Christ as High Priest, because:

\(1\) he was a king-priest ([Gen
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018)); ([Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012)); ([Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)).

\(2\) his name means, "my king is righteous" (compare ([Isa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005)) and he was king of Salem (that
is, "peace". (compare ([Isa 11:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006)).)

\(3\) he had no (recorded) "beginning of days" (compare ([Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)) nor "end of life" (compare ([Rom
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009)); ([Heb
7:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#023)); nor

\(4\) was he made a high priest by human appointment ([Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004)).

But the contrast between the high priesthood of Melchisedec and Aaron is
only as to person, "order" (or appointment), and duration.

In His work, Christ follows the Aaronic pattern, the "shadow" of which
Christ was the substance. ([Heb
8:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001)); ([Heb
9:1-28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001)).

[Hebrews 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 5:7</span></span>

feared

(See Scofield) - ([Psa 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009)).

[Hebrews 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 5:9</span></span>

salvation

(See Scofield) - ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)).
