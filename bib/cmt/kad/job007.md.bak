### [Job Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md)

[Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 7:1</span></span>

1 Has not a man warfare upon earth,

And his days are like the days of a hireling?

2 Like a servant who longs for the shade,

And like a hireling who waits for his wages,

3 So am I made to possess months of disappointment,

And nights of weariness are appointed to me.

The conclusion is intended to be: thus I wait for death as refreshing
and rest after hard labour. He goes, however, beyond this next point of
comparison, or rather he remains on this side of it. צבא is not service
of a labourer in the field, but active military service, then fatigue,
toil in general ([Isa 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#020.md); [Dan
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001).md). [Job
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002.md) Ewald and others translate
incorrectly: as a slave longs, etc. כּ can never introduce a comparative
clause, except an infinitive, as e.g., [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md), which can then under the regimen
of this כּ be continued by a verb. fin.; but it never stands directly
for כּאשׁר, as כּמו does in rare instances. In [Isa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003.md), שׁוא retains its primary
signification, nothingness, error, disappointment ([Job
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031).md): months that one after another
disappoint the hope of the sick. By this it seems we ought to imagine
the friends as not having come at the very commencement of his disease.
Elephantiasis is a disease which often lasts for years, and slowly but
inevitably destroys the body. On מנּוּ, adnumeraverunt = adnumeratae
sunt, vid., Ges. 137, 3\*.

[Job 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 7:4</span></span>

4 If I lie down, I think:

When shall I arise and the evening break away?

And I become weary with tossing to and fro unto the morning dawn.

5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of earth;

My skin heals up to fester again.

6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,

And vanish without hope.

Most modern commentators take מדּד as Piel from מדד: the night is
extended (Renan: la nuit se prolonge), which is possible; comp. Ges. 52,
2. But the metre suggests another rendering: מדּד constr. of מדּד from
נדד, to flee away: and when fleeing away of the evening. The night is
described by its commencement, the late evening, to make the long
interval of the sleeplessness and restlessness of the invalid prominent.
In נדדים and מדד there is a play of words (Ebrard). רמּה, worms, in
reference to the putrifying ulcers; and גּוּשׁ (with זעירא )ג, clod of
earth, from the cracked, scaly, earth-coloured skin of one suffering
with elephantiasis. The praett. are used of that which is past and still
always present, the futt. consec. of that which follows in and with the
other. The skin heals, רגע (which we render with Ges., Ew., contrahere
se); the result is that it becomes moist again. ימּאס, according to Ges.
67, rem. 4 = ימּס, [Psa 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#008.md). His days
pass swiftly away; the result is that they come to an end without any
hope whatever. ארג is like κερκίς, radius, a weaver's shuttle, by means
of which the weft is shot between the threads of the warp as they are
drawn up and down. His days pass as swiftly by as the little shuttle
passes backwards and forwards in the warp.

Next follows a prayer to God for the termination of his pain, since
there is no second life after the present, and consequently also the
possibility of requital ceases with death.

[Job 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 7:7</span></span>

7 Remember that my life is a breath,

That my eye will never again look on prosperity.

8 The eye that looketh upon me seeth me no more;

Thine eyes look for me, - I am no more!

9 The clouds are vanished and passed away,

So he that goeth down to Shel cometh not up.

10 He returneth no more to his house,

And his place knoweth him no more.

11 Therefore I will not curb my mouth;

I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;

I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

We see good, i.e., prosperity and joy, only in the present life. It ends
with death. שׁוּב with ל infin. is a synonym of הוסיף, [Job
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#009). No eye (עין femin..md) which now
sees me (prop. eye of my seer, as [Gen
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013.md), comp. [Job
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#007.md); [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md), for ראני, [Isa
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md), or ראני, [Isa
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#010.md); according to another reading,
ראי: no eye of seeing, i.e., no eye with the power of seeing, from ראי,
vision) sees me again, even if thy eyes should be directed towards me to
help me; my life is gone, so that I can no more be the subject of help.
For from Shel there is no return, no resurrection (comp. [Psa
103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016) for the expression.md); therefore
will I at least give free course to my thoughts and feelings (comp. [Psa
77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004.md); [Isa
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015), for the expression.md). The גּם,
[Job 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011.md), is the so-called גם
talionis; the parallels cited by Michalis are to the point, [Eze
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043.md); [Mal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#009.md); [Psa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007.md). Here we first meet with the name
of the lower world; and in the book of Job we learn the ancient
Israelitish conception of it more exactly than anywhere else. We have
here only to do with the name in connection with the grammatical
exposition. שׁאול (usually gen. fem.) is now almost universally derived
from שׁאל = שׁעל, to be hollow, to be deepened; and aptly so, for they
imagined the Sheôl as under ground, as [Num
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030.md), [Num
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#033.md) alone shows, on which account
even here, as from [Gen 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#035.md) onwards,
שׁאולה ירד is everywhere used. It is, however, open to question whether
this derivation is correct: at least passages like [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md); [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md); [Pro
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md)., show that in the later usage
of the language, שׁאל, to demand, was thought of in connection with it;
derived from which Sheôl signifies (1) the appointed inevitable and
inexorable demanding of everything earthly (an infinitive noun like
אלוהּ, פּקוד); (2) conceived of as space, the place of shadowy duration
whither everything on earth is demanded; (3) conceived of according to
its nature, the divinely appointed fury which gathers in and engulfs
everything on the earth. Job knows nothing of a demanding back, a
redemption from Sheôl.

[Job 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 7:12</span></span>

12 Am I a sea or a sea-monster,

That thou settest a watch over me?

13 For I said, My bed shall comfort me;

My couch shall help me to bear my complaint.

14 Then thou scaredst me with dreams,

And thou didst wake me up in terror from visions,

15 So that my soul chose suffocation,

Death rather than this skeleton.

16 I loathe it, I would not live alway;

Let me alone, for my days are breath.

Since a watch on the sea can only be designed to effect the necessary
precautions at its coming forth from the shores, it is probable that the
poet had the Nile in mind when he used ים, and consequently the
crocodile by תּנּין. The Nile is also called ים in [Isa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md), and in Homer ὠκεανός, Egyptian
oham (= ὠκεανός), and is even now called (at least by the Bedouins)
bahhr (Arab. bahr). The illustrations of the book, says von Gerlach
correctly, are chiefly Egyptian. On the contrary, Hahn thinks the
illustration is unsuitable of the Nile, because it is not watched on
account of its danger, but its utility; and Schlottman thinks it even
small and contemptible without assigning a reason. The figure is,
however, appropriate. As watches are set to keep the Nile in channels as
soon as it breaks forth, and as men are set to watch that they may seize
the crocodile immediately he moves here or there; so Job says all his
movements are checked at the very commencement, and as soon as he
desires to be more cheerful he feels the pang of some fresh pain. In
[Job 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#013.md), ב after נשׂא is partitive,
as [Num 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#017.md); Mercier correctly: non
nihil querelam meam levabit. If he hopes for such repose, it forthwith
comes to nought, since he starts up affrighted from his slumber. Hideous
dreams often disturb the sleep of those suffering with elephantiasis,
says Avicenna (in Stickel, S. 170). Then he desires death; he wishes
that his difficulty of breathing would increase to suffocation, the
usual end of elephantiasis. מחנק is absolute (without being obliged to
point it מחנק with Schlottm.), as e.g., מרמס, [Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006) (Ewald, 160, c.md). He prefers death
to these his bones, i.e., this miserable skeleton or framework of bone
to which he is wasted away. He despises, i.e., his life, [Job
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#021.md). Amid such suffering he would not
live for ever. הבל, like רוּח, [Job
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007.md).

[Job 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 7:17</span></span>

17 What is man that Thou magnifiest him,

And that Thou turnest Thy heart toward him,

18 And visitest him every morning,

Triest him every moment?

19 How long dost Thou not look away from me,

Nor lettest me alone till I swallow down my spittle?

The questions in [Job 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017.md). are in
some degree a parody on [Psa 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md),
comp. [Psa 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003.md), [Lam
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#023.md). There it is said that God exalts
puny man to a kingly and divine position among His creatures, and
distinguishes him continually with new tokens of His favour; here, that
instead of ignoring him, He makes too much of him, by selecting him,
perishable as he is, as the object of ever new and ceaseless sufferings.
כּמּה, quamdiu, [Job 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019.md), is
construed with the praet. instead of the fut.: how long will it continue
that Thou turnest not away Thy look of anger from me? as the synonymous
עד־מתי, quousque, is sometimes construed with the praet. instead of the
fut., e.g., [Psa 80:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#005.md). "Until I
swallow my spittle" is a proverbial expression for the minimum of time.

[Job 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 7:20</span></span>

20 Have I sinned - what could I do to Thee?!

O Observer of men,

Why dost Thou make me a mark to Thee,

And am I become a burden to Thee?

21 And why dost Thou not forgive my transgression,

And put away my iniquity?

For now I will lay myself in the dust,

And Thou seekest for me, and I am no more.

"I have sinned" is hypothetical (Ges. 155, 4, a): granted that I have
sinned. According to Ewald and Olsh., אפעל־לך מה defines it more
particularly: I have sinned by what I have done to Thee, in my behaviour
towards Thee; but how tame and meaningless such an addition would be! It
is an inferential question: what could I do to Thee? i.e., what harm, or
also, since the fut. may be regulated by the praet.: what injury have I
thereby done to Thee? The thought that human sin, however, can detract
nothing from the blessedness and glory of God, underlies this. With a
measure of sinful bitterness, Job calls God האדם נצר, the strict and
constant observer of men, per convicium fere, as Gesenius not untruly
observes, nevertheless without a breach of decorum divinum (Renan: O
Espion de l'homme), since the appellation, in itself worthy of God ([Isa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003).md), is used here only somewhat
unbecomingly. מפגּע is not the target for shooting at, which is rather
מטּרה ([Job 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#012.md); [Lam
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#012).md), but the object on which one
rushes with hostile violence (בּ פּגע). Why, says Job, hast Thou made me
the mark of hostile attack, and why am I become a burden to Thee? It is
not so in our text; but according to Jewish tradition, עלי, which we now
have, is only a סופרים תקון, correctio scribarum,

(Note: Vid., the Commentary on Habakkuk, S. 206-208; comp. Geiger,
Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel, S. 308ff.)

for אליך, which was removed as bordering on blasphemy: why am I become a
burden to Thee, so that Thou shouldest seek to get rid of me? This
reading I should not consider as the original, in spite of the
tradition, if it were not confirmed by the lxx, εἰμὶ δὲ ἐπὶ σοὶ φορτίον.

It is not to be objected, that he who is fully conscious of sin cannot
consider the strictest divine punishment even of the smallest sin
unjust. The suffering of one whose habitual state is pleasing to God,
and who is conscious of the divine favour, can never be explained from,
and measured according to, his infirmities: the infirmities of one who
trusts in God, or the believer, and the severity of the divine justice
in the punishment of sin, have no connection with one another.
Consequently, when Eliphaz bids Job regard his affliction as
chastisement, Job is certainly in the wrong to dispute with God
concerning the magnitude of it: he would rather patiently yield, if his
faith could apprehend the salutary design of God in his affliction; but
after his affliction once seems to him to spring from wrath and enmity,
and not from the divine purpose of mercy, after the phantom of a hostile
God is come between him and the brightness of the divine countenance, he
cannot avoid falling into complaint of unmercifulness. For this the
speech of Eliphaz is in itself not to blame: he had most feelingly
described to him God's merciful purpose in this chastisement, but he is
to blame for not having taken the right tone.

The speech of Job is directed against the unsympathetic and reproving
tone which the friends, after their long silence, have assumed
immediately upon his first manifestation of anguish. He justifies to
them his complaint (ch. 3) as the natural and just outburst of his
intense suffering, desires speedy death as the highest joy with which
God could reward his piety, complains of his disappointment in his
friends, from whom he had expected affectionate solace, but by whom he
sees he is now forsaken, and earnestly exhorts them to acknowledge the
justice of his complaint (ch. 6). But can they? Yes, they might and
should. For Job thinks he is no longer an object of divine favour: an
inward conflict, which is still more terrible than hell, is added to his
outward suffering. For the damned must give glory to God, because they
recognise their suffering as just punishment: Job, however, in his
suffering sees the wrath of God, and still is at the same time conscious
of his innocence. The faith which, in the midst of his exhaustion of
body and soul, still knows and feels God to be merciful, and can call
him "my God," like Asaph in Ps 73, - this faith is well-nigh overwhelmed
in Job by the thought that God is his enemy, his pains the arrows of
God. The assumption is false, but on this assumption Job's complaints
(ch. 3) are relatively just, including, what he himself says, that they
are mistaken, thoughtless words of one in despair. But that despair is
sin, and therefore also those curses and despairing inquiries!

Is not Eliphaz, therefore, in the right? His whole treatment is wrong.
Instead of distinguishing between the complaint of his suffering and the
complaint of God in Job's outburst of anguish, he puts them together,
without recognising the complaint of his suffering to be the natural and
unblamable result of its extraordinary magnitude, and as a sympathizing
friend falling in with it. But with regard to the complaints of God,
Eliphaz, acting as though careful for his spiritual welfare, ought not
to have met them with his reproofs, especially as the words of one
heavily afflicted deserve indulgence and delicate treatment; but he
should have combated their false assumption. First, he should have said
to Job, "Thy complaints of thy suffering are just, for thy suffering is
incomparably great." In the next place, "Thy cursing thy birth, and thy
complaint of God who has given thee thy life, might seem just if it were
true that God has rejected thee; but that is not true: even in suffering
He designs thy good; the greater the suffering, the greater the glory."
By this means Eliphaz should have calmed Job's despondency, so as to
destroy his false assumption; but he begins wrongly, and consequently
what he says at last so truly and beautifully respecting the glorious
issue of a patient endurance of chastisement, makes no impression on
Job. He has not fanned the faintly burning wick, but his speech is a
cold and violent breath which is calculated entirely to extinguish it.

After Job has defended the justice of his complaints against the
insensibility of the friends, he gives way anew to lamentation. Starting
from the wearisomeness of human life in general, he describes the
greatness of his own suffering, which has received no such recognition
on the part of the friends: it is a restless, torturing death without
hope ([Job 7:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001).md). Then he turns to
God: O remember that there is no second life after death, and that I am
soon gone for ever; therefore I will utter my woe without restraint
([Job 7:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007).md). Thus far (from [Job
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#001) onwards.md) I find in Job's speech no
trace of blasphemous or sinful despair. When he says ([Job
6:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008).md), How I would rejoice if God,
whose word I have never disowned, would grant me my request, and end my
life, for I can no longer bear my suffering, - I cannot with Ewald see
in its despair rising to madness, which ([Job
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#010).md) even increases to frantic joy.
For Job's disease was indeed really in the eyes of men as hopeless as he
describes it. In an incurable disease, however, imploring God to hasten
death, and rejoicing at the thought of approaching dissolution, is not a
sin, and is not to be called despair, inasmuch as one does not call
giving up all hope of recovery despair.

Moreover, it must not be forgotten that the book of Job is an oriental
book, and therefore some allowance must be made of the intensity and
strength of conception of the oriental nature: then that it is a
poetical book, and that frenzy and madness may not be also understood by
the intensified expression in which poetry, which idealizes the real,
clothes pain and joy: finally, that it is an Old Testament book, and
that in the Old Testament the fundamental nature of man is indeed
sanctified, but not yet subdued; the spirit shines forth as a light in a
dark place, but the day, the ever constant consciousness of favour and
life, has not yet dawned. The desire of a speedy termination of life
([Job 6:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008).md) is in [Job
7:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007.md) softened down even to a request
for an alleviation of suffering, founded on this, that death terminates
life for ever. In the Talmud (b. Bathra, 16, a) it is observed, on this
passage, that Job denies the resurrection of the dead (המתים בתחיים איוב
שׁכפר מכאן); but Job knows nothing of a resurrection of the dead, and
what one knows not, one cannot deny. He knows only that after death, the
end of the present life, there is no second life in this world, only a
being in Sheôl, which is only an apparent existence = no existence, in
which all praise of God is silent, because He no longer reveals himself
there as to the living in this world ([Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md); [Psa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010.md); [Psa
88:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md); [Psa
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017).md). From this chaotic conception
of the other side of the grave, against which even the psalmists still
struggle, the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead had not been set
forth at the time of Job, and of the author of the book of Job. The
restoration of Israel buried in exile (Ezek 37) first gave the impulse
to it; and the resurrection of the Prince of Life, who was laid in the
grave, set the seal upon it. The resurrection of Jesus Christ was first
of all the actual overthrow of Hades.

Mortis seu inferni, observes Brentius, in accordance with Scriptures, ea
conditio est, ut natura sua quoscunque comprehenderit tantisper teneat
nec dimittat, dum Christus, filius Dei, morte ad infernum descenderit,
h.e. perierit; per hunc enim devicta morte et inferno liberantur
quotquot fide renovati sunt. This great change in the destiny of the
dead was incomplete, and the better hope which became brighter and
brighter as the advent of death's Conqueror drew near was not yet in
existence. For if after death, or what is the same thing, after the
descent into Shel, there was only a non-existence for Job, it is evident
that on the one hand he can imagine a life after death only as a return
to the present world (such a return does, however, not take place), on
the other hand that no divine revelation said anything to him of a
future life which should infinitely compensate for a return to the
present world. And since he knows nothing of a future existence, it can
consequently not be said that he denies it: he knows nothing of it, and
even his dogmatizing friends have nothing to tell him about it. We shall
see by and by, how the more his friends torment him, the more he is
urged on in his longing for a future life; but the word of revelation,
which could alone change desire into hope, is wanting. The more tragic
and heart-rending Job's desire to be freed by death from his unbearable
suffering is, the more touching and importunate is his prayer that God
may consider that now soon he can no longer be an object of His mercy.
Just the same request is found frequently in the Psalms, e.g., [Psa
89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048.md), comp. [Psa
103:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md) : it involves nothing that
is opposed to the Old Testament fear of God. Thus far we can trace
nothing of frenzy and madness, and of despair only in so far as Job has
given up the hope (נואשׁ) of his restoration, - not however of real
despair, in which a man impatiently and forcibly snaps asunder the bond
of trust which unites him to God. If the poet had anywhere made Job to
go to such a length in despair, he would have made Satan to triumph over
him.

Now, however, the last two strophes follow in which Job is hurried
forward to the use of sinful language, [Job
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012.md) : Am I a sea or a sea-monster,
etc.; and [Job 7:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017.md) : What is man,
that thou accountest him so great, etc. We should nevertheless be
mistaken if we thought there were sin here in the expressions by which
Job describes God's hostility against himself. We may compare e.g., [Lam
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#009.md), [Lam
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#010.md) : "He hath enclosed my ways with
hewn stone, He hath made any paths crooked; He is to me as a bear lying
in wait, a lion in the thicket." It is, moreover, not Job's peculiar sin
that he thinks God has changed to an enemy against him; that is the view
which comes from his vision being beclouded by the conflict through
which he is passing, as is frequently the case in the Psalms. His sin
does not even consist in the inquiries, How long? and Wherefore? The
Psalms in that case would abound in sin. But the sin is that he dwells
upon these doubting questions, and thus attributes apparent
mercilessness and injustice to God. And the friends constantly urge him
on still deeper in this sin, the more persistently they attribute his
suffering to his own unrighteousness. Jeremiah (in Lamentations 3),
after similar complaints, adds: Then I repeated this to my heart, and
took courage from it: the mercies of Jehovah, they have no end; His
compassions do not cease, etc. Many of the Psalms that begin
sorrowfully, end in the same way; faith at length breaks through the
clouds of doubt. But it should be remembered that the change of
spiritual condition which, e.g., in [Psa
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md), is condensed to the narrow
limits of a lyric composition of eleven verses, is here in Job worked
out with dramatical detail as a passage of his life's history: his
faith, once so heroic, only smoulders under ashes; the friends, instead
of fanning it to a flame, bury it still deeper, until at last it is set
free from its bondage by Jehovah himself, who appears in the whirlwind.
