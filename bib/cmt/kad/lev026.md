Promises and Threats - Leviticus 26

Just as the book of the covenant, the kernel containing the fundamental
principles of the covenant fellowship, which the Lord established with
the children of Israel whom He had adopted as His nation, and the rule
of life for the covenant nation (Ex 20:22-23:19), concluded with
promises and threats ([Exo 23:20-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020).md);
so the giving of the law at Sinai, as the unfolding of the inner,
spiritual side of the whole of the covenant constitution, closes in this
chapter with an elaborate unfolding of the blessing which would be
secured by a faithful observance of the laws, and the curse which would
follow the transgression of them. But whilst the former promises and
threats (Ex 23) related to the conquest of the promised land of Canaan,
the promises in this chapter refer to the blessings which were to be
bestowed upon Israel when the land was in their possession ([Lev
26:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003).md), and the threats to the
judgments with which the Lord would visit His disobedient people in
their inheritance, and in fact drive them out and scatter them among the
heathen (vv. 14-39). When this had been done, then, as is still further
proclaimed with a prophetic look into the distant future, would they
feel remorse, acknowledge their sin to the Lord, and be once more
received into favour by Him, the eternally faithful covenant God ([Lev
26:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040).md).

(Note: When modern critics, who are carried away by naturalism, maintain
that Moses was not the author of these exhortations and warnings,
because of their prophetic contents, and assign them to the times of the
kings, the end of the eighth, or beginning of the seventh century (see
Ewald, Gesch. i. 156), they have not considered, in their antipathy to
any supernatural revelations from God in the Old Testament, that even
apart from any higher illumination, the fundamental idea of these
promises and threats must have presented itself to the mind of the
lawgiver Moses. It required but a very little knowledge of the nature of
the human heart, and a clear insight into the spiritual and ethical
character of the law, to enable him to foresee that the earthly-minded,
unholy nation would not fulfil the solemn demand of the law that their
whole life should be sanctified to the Lord God, that they would
transgress in many ways, and rebel against God and His holy laws, and
therefore that in any case times of fidelity and the corresponding
blessing would alternate with times of unfaithfulness and the
corresponding curse, but that, for all that, at the end the grace of God
would obtain the victory over the severely punished and deeply humbled
nation, and bring the work of salvation to a glorious close. It is true,
the concrete character of this chapter cannot be fully explained in this
way, but it furnishes the clue to the psychological interpretation of
the conception of this prophetic discourse, and shows us the subjective
points of contact for the divine revelation which Moses has announced to
us here. For, as Auberlen observes, "there is a marvellous and grand
display of the greatness of God in the fact, that He holds out before
the people, whom He has just delivered from the hands of the heathen and
gathered round Himself, the prospect of being scattered again among the
heathen, and that, even before the land is taken by the Israelites, He
predicts its return to desolation. These words could only be spoken by
One who has the future really before His mind, who sees through the
whole depth of sin, and who can destroy His own work, and yet attain His
end. But so much the more adorable and marvellous is the grace, which
nevertheless begins its work among such sinners, and is certain of
victory notwithstanding all retarding and opposing difficulties." The
peculiar character of this revelation, which must deeply have affected
Moses, will explain the peculiarities observable in the style, viz., the
heaping up of unusual words and modes of expression, several of which
never occur again in the Old Testament, whilst others are only used by
the prophets who followed the Pentateuch in their style.)

The blessings and curse of the law were impressed upon the hearts of the
people in a still more comprehensive manner at the close of the whole
law (Deut 28-30), and on the threshold of the promised land.

[Leviticus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 26:1</span></span>

[Lev 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md) and [Lev
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#002.md) form the introduction; and the
essence of the whole law, the observance of which will bring a rich
blessing, and the transgression of it severe judgments, is summed up in
two leading commandments, and placed at the head of the blessing and
curse which were to be proclaimed. Ye shall not make to you elilim,
nugatory gods, and set up carved images and standing images for worship,
but worship Jehovah your God with the observance of His Sabbaths, and
fear before His sanctuary. The prohibition of elilim, according to [Lev
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#004.md), calls to mind the fundamental
law of the decalogue ([Exo 20:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003.md), cf.
[Lev 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#023.md); [Exo
23:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#024).md). To pesel (cf. [Exo
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004).md) and mazzebah (cf. [Exo
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#024).md), which were not to be set up,
there is added the command not to put משׂכּית אבן, "figure-stones," in
the land, to worship over (by) them. The "figure-stone" is a stone
formed into a figure, and idol of stone, not merely a stone with an
inscription or with hieroglyphical figures; it is synonymous with
משׂכּית in [Num 33:52](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052.md), and
consequently we are to understand by pesel the wooden idol as in [Isa
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015.md), etc. The construction of
השׁתּחוה with על may be explained on the ground that the worshipper of a
stone image placed upon the ground rises above it (for על in this sense,
see [Gen 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002).md). - In [Lev
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003.md) the true way to serve God is
urged upon the Israelites once more, in words copied verbally from [Lev
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#030.md).

[Leviticus 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 26:3</span></span>

The Blessing of Fidelity to the Law. - [Lev
26:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003.md). If the Israelites walked in
the commandments of the Lord (for the expression see [Lev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003)..md), the Lord would give
fruitfulness to their land, that they should have bread to the full. "I
will give you rain-showers in season." The allusion here is to the
showers which fall at the two rainy seasons, and upon which the
fruitfulness of Palestine depends, viz., the early and latter rain ([Deu
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014).md). The former of these occurs
after the autumnal equinox, at the time of the winter-sowing of wheat
and barley, in the latter half of October or beginning of November. It
generally falls in heavy showers in November and December, and then
after that only at long intervals, and not so heavily. The latter, or
so-called latter rain, fall sin March before the beginning of the
harvest of the winter crops, at the time of sowing the summer seed, and
lasts only a few days, in some years only a few hours (see Robinson,
Pal. ii. pp. 97ff.). - On [Lev 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005.md),
[Lev 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#006.md), see [Lev
25:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#018.md).

[Leviticus 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 26:6</span></span>

The Lord would give peace in the land, and cause the beasts of prey
which endanger life to vanish out of the land, and suffer no war to come
over it, but would put to flight before the Israelites the enemies who
attacked them, and cause them to fall into their sword. שׁכב, to lie
without being frightened up by any one, is a figure used to denote the
quiet and peaceable enjoyment of life, and taken from the resting of a
flock in good pasture-ground ([Isa
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030).md) exposed to no attacks from
either wild beasts or men. מחריד is generally applied to the frightening
of men by a hostile attack ([Mic 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004.md);
[Jer 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md); [Eze
39:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#026.md); [Job
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#019).md); but it is also applied to the
frightening of flocks and animals ([Isa
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002.md); [Deu
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#026.md); [Jer
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033), etc..md). רעה חיּה: an evil animal,
for a beast of prey, as in [Gen 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#020.md).
"Sword," as the principal weapon applied, is used for war. The pursuing
of the enemy relates to neighbouring tribes, who would make war upon the
Israelites. לחרב נפל does not mean to be felled by the sword (Knobel),
but to fall into the sword. The words, "five of you shall put a hundred
to flight, and a hundred ten thousand," are a proverbial expression for
the most victorious superiority of Israel over their enemies. It is
repeated in the opposite sense and in an intensified form in [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030.md) and [Isa
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#017.md).

[Leviticus 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 26:9</span></span>

Moreover the Lord would bestow His covenant blessing upon them without
intermission. אל פּנה signifies a sympathizing and gracious regard ([Psa
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016.md); [Psa
69:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#017).md). The multiplication and
fruitfulness of the nation were a constant fulfilment of the covenant
promise ([Gen 17:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004).md) and an
establishment of the covenant ([Gen
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007).md); not merely the preservation of
it, but the continual realization of the covenant grace, by which the
covenant itself was carried on further and further towards its
completion. This was the real purpose of the blessing, to which all
earthly good, as the pledge of the constant abode of God in the midst of
His people, simply served as the foundation.

[Leviticus 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 26:10</span></span>

Notwithstanding their numerous increase, they would suffer no want of
food. "Ye shall eat that which has become old, and bring out old for
new." Multiplicabo vos et multiplicabo simul annonam vestram, adeo ut
illam prae multitudine et copia absumere non possitis, sed illam
diutissime servare adeoque abjicere cogamini, novarum frugum suavitate
et copia superveniente (C. a Lap.). הוציא vetustum triticum ex horreo et
vinum ex cella promere (Calvin).

[Leviticus 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 26:11</span></span>

"I will make My dwelling among you, and My soul will not despise you."
משׁכּן, applied to the dwelling of God among His people in the
sanctuary, involves the idea of satisfied repose.

[Leviticus 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 26:12</span></span>

God's walking in the midst of Israel does not refer to His accompanying
and leading the people on their journeyings, but denotes the walking of
God in the midst of His people in Canaan itself, whereby He would
continually manifest Himself to the nation as its God and make them a
people of possession, bringing them into closer and closer fellowship
with Himself, and giving them all the saving blessings of His covenant
of grace.

[Leviticus 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 26:13</span></span>

For He was their God, who had brought them out of the land of the
Egyptians, that they might no longer be servants to them, and had broken
the bands of their yokes and made them go upright. על מטת, lit., the
poles of the yoke (cf. [Eze 34:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#027).md),
i.e., the poles which are laid upon the necks of beasts of burden ([Jer
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002).md) as a yoke, to bend their necks
and harness them for work. It was with the burden of such a yoke that
Egypt had pressed down the Israelites, so that they could no longer walk
upright, till God by breaking the yoke helped them to walk upright
again. As the yoke is a figurative description of severe oppression, so
going upright is a figurative description of emancipation from bondage.
קוממיּוּת, lit., a substantive, an upright position; here it is an
adverb (cf. Ges. 100, 2).

[Leviticus 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 26:14</span></span>

The Curse for Contempt of the Law. - The following judgments are
threatened, not for single breaches of the law, but for contempt of all
the laws, amounting to inward contempt of the divine commandments and a
breach of the covenant ([Lev 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014.md),
[Lev 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#015).md), - for presumptuous and
obstinate rebellion, therefore, against God and His commandments. For
this, severe judgments are announced, which were to be carried to their
uttermost in a fourfold series, if the hardening were obstinately
continued. If Israel acted in opposition to the Lord in the manner
stated, He would act towards them as follows ([Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md), [Lev
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#017).md): He would appoint over them
בּחלה terror, - a general notion, which is afterwards particularized as
consisting of diseases, sowing without enjoying the fruit, defeat in
war, and flight before their enemies. Two kinds of disease are mentioned
by which life is destroyed: consumption and burning, i.e., burning
fever, πυρετός, febris, which cause the eyes (the light of this life) to
disappear, and the soul (the life itself) to pine away; whereas in [Exo
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#025.md); [Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026.md), preservation from diseases is
promised for obedience to the law. Of these diseases, consumption is at
present very rare in Palestine and Syria, though it occurs in more
elevated regions; but burning fever is one of the standing diseases. To
these there would be added the invasion of the land by enemies, so that
they would labour in vain and sow their seed to no purpose, for their
enemies would consume the produce, as actually was the case (e.g., [Jdg
6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003).md).

[Leviticus 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 26:17</span></span>

Yea, the Lord would turn His face against them, so that they would be
beaten by their enemies, and be so thoroughly humbled in consequence,
that they would flee when no man pursued (cf. [Lev
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036).md).

But if these punishments did not answer their purpose, and bring Israel
back to fidelity to its God, the Lord would punish the disobedient
nation still more severely, and chasten the rebellious for their sin,
not simply only, but sevenfold. This He would do, so long as Israel
persevered in obstinate resistance, and to this end He would multiply
His judgments by degrees. This graduated advance of the judgments of God
is so depicted in the following passage, that four times in succession
new and multiplied punishments are announced: (1) utter barrenness in
their land, - that is to say, one heavier punishment ([Lev
26:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018)); (2.md) the extermination of
their cattle by beasts of prey, and childlessness, - two punishments
([Lev 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021.md), [Lev
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022)); (3.md) war, plague, and famine, -
three punishments ([Lev 26:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#023)); (4.md)
the destruction of all idolatrous abominations, the overthrow of their
towns and holy places, the devastation of the land, and the dispersion
of the people among the heathen-four punishments which would bring the
Israelites to the verge of destruction ([Lev
26:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#027).md). In this way would the Lord
punish the stiffneckedness of His people. - These divine threats embrace
the whole of Israel's future. But the series of judgments mentioned is
not to be understood historically, as a prediction of the temporal
succession of the different punishments, but as an ideal account of the
judgments of God, unfolding themselves with inward necessity in a manner
answering to the progressive development of the sin. As the nation would
not resist the Lord continually, but times of disobedience and apostasy
would alternate with times of obedience and faithfulness, so the
judgments of God would alternate with His blessings; and as the
opposition would not increase in uniform progress, sometimes becoming
weaker and then at other times gaining greater force again, so the
punishments would not multiply continuously, but correspond in every
case to the amount of the sin, and only burst in upon the incorrigible
race in all the intensity foretold, when ungodliness gained the upper
hand.

[Leviticus 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 26:18</span></span>

First stage of the aggravated judgments. - If they did not hearken אלּה
עד, "up to these" (the punishments named in [Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md), [Lev
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#017).md), that is to say, if they
persisted in their disobedience even when the judgments reached to this
height, God would add a sevenfold chastisement on account of their sins,
would punish them seven times more severely, and break down their strong
pride by fearful drought. Seven, as the number of perfection in the
works of God, denotes the strengthening of the chastisement, even to the
height of its full measure (cf. [Pro
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016).md). עז גּאון, lit., the eminence
or pride of strength, includes everything upon which a nation rests its
might; then the pride and haughtiness which rely upon earthly might and
its auxiliaries ([Eze 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006.md), [Eze
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018.md); [Eze
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#028).md); here it signifies the pride of
a nation, puffed up by the fruitfulness and rich produce of its land.
God would make their heaven (the sky of their land) like iron and their
earth like brass, i.e., as hard and dry as metal, so that not a drop of
rain and dew would fall from heaven to moisten the earth, and not a
plant could grow out of the earth (cf. [Deu
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023).md); and when the land was
cultivated, the people would exhaust their strength for nought. תּמם,
consumi.

[Leviticus 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 26:21</span></span>

The second stage. - But if the people's resistance amounted to a hostile
rebellion against God, He would smite them sevenfold for their sin by
sending beasts of prey and childlessness. By beasts of prey He would
destroy their cattle, and by barrenness He would make the nation so
small that the ways would be deserted, that high roads would cease
because there would be no traveller upon them on account of the
depopulation of the land ([Isa 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008.md);
[Zep 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006).md), and the few inhabitants who
still remained would be afraid to venture because of the wild beasts
([Eze 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#015).md). עם קרי הלך ("to go a
meeting with a person," i.e., to meet a person in a hostile manner, to
fight against him) only occurs here in [Lev
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021.md) and [Lev
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#023.md), and is strengthened in [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024.md), [Lev
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#027.md), [Lev
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#028.md), [Lev
26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md), [Lev
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041.md) into עם בּקרי הלך, to engage in
a hostile encounter with a person. שׁבע מכּה, a sevenfold blow.
"According to your sins," i.e., answering to them sevenfold. In [Lev
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022.md) the first clause corresponds to
the third, and the second to the fourth, so that Nos. 3 and 4 contain
the effects of Nos. 1 and 2.

[Leviticus 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 26:23</span></span>

The third stage. - But if they would not be chastened by these
punishments, and still rose up in hostility to the Lord, He would also
engage in a hostile encounter with them, and punish them sevenfold with
war, plague, and hunger.

[Leviticus 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 26:25</span></span>

He would bring over them "the sword avenging (i.e., executing) the
covenant vengeance." The "covenant vengeance" was punishment inflicted
for a breach of the covenant, the severity of which corresponded to the
greatness of the covenant blessings forfeited by a faithless apostasy.
If they retreated to their towns (fortified places) from the sword of
the enemy, the Lord would send a plague over them there, and give those
who were spared by the plague into the power of the foe. He would also
"break in pieces the staff of bread," and compel them by the force of
famine to submit to the foe. The means of sustenance should become so
scarce, that ten women could bake their bread in a single oven, whereas
in ordinary times every woman would require an oven for herself; and
they would have to eat the bread which they brought home by weight,
i.e., not as much as every one pleased, but in rations weighed out so
scantily, that those who ate would not be satisfied, and would only be
able to sustain their life in the most miserable way. Calamities such as
these burst upon Israel and Judah more than once when their fortified
towns were besieged, particularly in the later times of the kings, e.g.,
upon Samaria in the reign of Joram ([Kg2
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025)..md), and upon Jerusalem through the
invasions of the Chaldeans (cf. [Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md); [Jer
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018.md); [Eze
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016.md); [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012).md).

[Leviticus 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 26:27</span></span>

Fourth and severest stage. - If they should still persist in their
opposition, God would chastise them with wrathful meeting, yea, punish
them so severely in His wrath, that they would be compelled to eat the
flesh of their sons and daughters, i.e., to slay their own children and
eat them in the extremity of their hunger, - a fact which literally
occurred in Samaria in the period of the Syrians ([Kg2
6:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#028).md), and in Jerusalem in that of
the Chaldeans ([Lam 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md); [Lam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010).md), and in the Roman war of
extermination under Titus (Josephus bell. jud. v. 10, 3) in the most
appalling manner. Eating the flesh of their own children is mentioned
first, as indicating the extremity of the misery and wretchedness in
which the people would perish; and after this, the judgment, by which
the nation would be brought to this extremity, is more minutely
described in its four principal features: viz., (1) the destruction of
all idolatrous abominations ([Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030)); (2.md) the overthrow of the towns
and sanctuaries ([Lev 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031)); (3.md) the
devastation of the land, to the amazement of the enemies who dwelt
therein ([Lev 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#032)); and (4.md) the
dispersion of the people among the heathen ([Lev
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033).md). The "high places" are altars
erected upon heights and mountains in the land, upon which sacrifices
were offered both to Jehovah in an unlawful way and also to heathen
deities. חמּנים, sun-pillars, are idols of the Canaanitish
nature-worship, either simple pillars dedicated to Baal, or idolatrous
statues of the sun-god (cf. Movers Phnizier i. pp. 343ff.). "And I give
your carcases upon the carcases of your idols." גּלּלים, lit., clods,
from גּלל to roll, a contemptuous expression for idols. With the idols
the idolaters also were to perish, and defile with their corpses the
images, which had also become corpses as it were, through their
overthrow and destruction. For the further execution of this threat, see
[Eze 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004.md). This will be your lot, for
"My soul rejects you." By virtue of the inward character of His holy
nature, Jehovah must abhor and reject the sinner.

Their towns and their sanctuaries He would destroy, because He took no
pleasure in their sacrificial worship. מקדּשׁים are the holy things of
the worship of Jehovah, the tabernacle and temple, with their altars and
the rest of their holy furniture, as in Ps. 68:36; [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md). ניחח ריח ([Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009).md) is the odour of the sacrifice;
and ריח, to smell, an anthropomorphic designation of divine satisfaction
(cf. [Amo 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021.md); [Isa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003).md).

The land was to become a wilderness, so that even the enemies who dwelt
therein would be terrified in consequence (cf. [Jer
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md); [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008).md); and the Israelites would be
scattered among the heathen, because Jehovah would draw out His sword
behind them, i.e., drive them away with a drawn sword, and scatter them
to all the winds of heaven (cf. [Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md), [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012.md); [Eze
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#014).md).

Object of the Divine Judgments in Relation to the Land and Nation of
Israel. - [Lev 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md) and [Lev
26:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#035.md). The land would then enjoy and
keep its Sabbaths, so long as it was desolate, and Israel was in the
land of its foes. השּׁמּה ימי כּל, during the whole period of its
devastation. השּׁמּה inf. Hophal with the suffix, in which the mappik is
wanting, as in [Exo 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003.md) (cf. Ewald,
131e). רצה to have satisfaction: with בּ and an accusative it signifies
to take delight, take pleasure, in anything, e.g., in rest after the
day's work is done ([Job 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006).md); here
also to enjoy rest (not "to pay its debt:" Ges., Kn.). The keeping of
the Sabbath was not a performance binding upon the land, nor had the
land been in fault because the Sabbath was not kept. As the earth groans
under the pressure of the sin of men, so does it rejoice in deliverance
from this pressure, and participation in the blessed rest of the whole
creation. וגו אשׁר את תּשׁבּת: the land "will rest (keep) what it has
not rested on your Sabbaths and whilst you dwelt in it;" i.e., it will
make up the rest which you did not give it on your Sabbaths (daily and
yearly). It is evident from this, that the keeping of the Sabbaths and
sabbatical years was suspended when the apostasy of the nation
increased, - a result which could be clearly foreseen in consequence of
the inward dislike of a sinner to the commandments of the holy God, and
which is described in [Ch2 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021.md) as
having actually occurred.

[Leviticus 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lev 26:36</span></span>

So far as the nation was concerned, those who were left when the kingdom
was overthrown would find no rest in the land of their enemies, but
would perish among the heathen for their own and their fathers'
iniquities, till they confessed their sins and bent their uncircumcised
hearts under the righteousness of the divine punishments. בּכם הנּשׁארים
(nominative abs.): "as for those who are left in (as in [Lev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#009).md), i.e., of, you," who have not
perished in the destruction of the kingdom and dispersion of the people,
God will bring despair into their heart in the lands of your enemies,
that the sound ("voice") of a moving leaf will hunt them to flee as
before the sword, so that they will fall in their anxious flight, and
stumble one over another, though no one is pursuing. The ἁπ. λεγ. מרך
from מרך, related to מרח and מרק to rub, rub to pieces, signifies that
inward anguish, fear, and despair, which rend the heart and destroy the
life, δειλία, pavor (lxx, Vulg.), what is described in [Deu
28:65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065.md) in even stronger terms as "a
trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind." There should
not be to them תּקוּמה, standi et resistendi facultas (Rosenmller),
standing before the enemy; but they should perish among the nations.
"The land of their enemies will eat them up," sc., by their falling
under the pressure of the circumstances in which they were placed (cf.
[Num 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md); [Eze
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013).md).

[Leviticus 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">lev 26:39</span></span>

But those who still remained under this oppression would pine away in
their iniquities (ימּקּוּ, lit., to rot, moulder away), and "also in the
iniquities of their fathers with them." אתּם refers to עונות, "which are
with them," which they carry with them and must atone for (see at [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).md),

[Leviticus 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">lev 26:40</span></span>

In this state of pining away under their enemies, they would confess to
themselves their own and their fathers' sins, i.e., would make the
discovery that their sufferings were a punishment from God for their
sins, and acknowledge that they were suffering what they had deserved,
through their unfaithfulness to their God and rebellion against Him, for
which He had been obliged to set Himself in hostility to them, and bring
them into the land of their enemies; or rather their uncircumcised
hearts would then humble themselves, and they would look with
satisfaction upon this fruit of their sin. The construction is the
following: וזכרתּי ([Lev 26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042).md)
corresponds to התודּוּ ([Lev 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040).md) as
the apodosis; so that, according to the more strictly logical
connection, which is customary in our language, we may unite [Lev
26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md), [Lev
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041.md) in one period with [Lev
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042.md). "If they shall confess their
iniquity...or rather their uncircumcised heart shall humble itself...I
will remember My covenant." With בּמעלם a parenthetical clause is
introduced into the main sentence explanatory of the iniquity, and
reaches as far as "into the land of their enemies." With יכּנע או־אז,
"or if, etc.," the main sentence is resumed. או, "or rather" (as in [Sa1
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003).md), bringing out the humiliation of
the heart as the most important result to which the confession of sin
ought to deepen itself. The heart is called "uncircumcised" as being
unsanctified, and not susceptible to the manifestations of divine grace.
את־עונם ירצוּ וץ̓הןךח́ףןץףי פב̀ע ב̓לבספי́בע בץ̓פש͂ם (lxx), they will take
pleasure, rejoice in their misdeeds, i.e., in the consequences and
results of them-that their misdeed have so deeply humbled them, and
brought them to the knowledge of the corruption into which they have
fallen: a bold and, so to speak, paradoxical expression for their
complete change of heart, which we may render thus: "they will enjoy
their misdeeds," as רצה may be rendered in the same way in [Lev
26:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#043.md) also.

(Note: Luther has translated עון in this sense, "punishment of
iniquity," and observes in the marginal notes, - "(Pleasure), i.e., just
as they had pleasure in their sins and felt disgust at My laws, so they
would now take pleasure in their punishment and say, 'We have just what
we deserve. This is what we have to thank our cursed sin for. It is
just, O God, quite just.' And these are thoughts and words of earnest
repentance, hating itself from the bottom of the heart, and crying out,
Shame upon me, what have I done? This pleases God, so that He becomes
gracious once more.")

But where punishment bears such fruit, God looks upon the sinner with
favour again. When Israel had gone so far, He would remember His
covenant with the fathers ("My covenant with Jacob," יעקב בּריתי: the
suffix is attached to the governing noun, as in [Lev
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#003.md), because the noun governed, being
a proper name, could not take the suffix), and remember the land
(including its inhabitants), which, as is repeated again in [Lev
26:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#043.md), would be left by them (become
desolate) and enjoy its Sabbaths whilst it was waste (depopulated) from
(i.e., away from, without) them; and they would enjoy their iniquity,
because they had despised the judgments of the Lord, and their soul had
rejected His statues.

[Leviticus 26:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">lev 26:44</span></span>

"And yet, even with regard to this, when they shall be in the land of
their enemies, have I not despised them." That is to say, if it shall
have come even so far as that they are in the land of their enemies (the
words גּם־זאת stand first in an absolute sense, and are strengthened or
intensified by ואף and more fully explained by בּהיותם וגו), I have not
rejected them, to destroy them and break My covenant with them. For I am
Jehovah their God, who, as the absolutely existing and unchangeably
faithful One, keeps His promises and does not repent of His calling
([Rom 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029).md).

[Leviticus 26:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">lev 26:45</span></span>

He would therefore remember the covenant with the forefathers, whom He
had brought out of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, to be a God to
them; and He would renew the covenant with the fathers to them (the
descendants), to gather them again out of the heathen, and adopt them
again as His nation (cf. [Deu 30:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003).md).
In this way the judgment would eventually turn to a blessing, if they
would bend in true repentance under the mighty hand of their God.

[Leviticus 26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">lev 26:46</span></span>

[Lev 26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046.md) contains the close of the
entire book, or rather of the whole of the covenant legislation from Ex
25 onwards, although the expression "in Mount Sinai" points back
primarily to [Lev 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001.md).
