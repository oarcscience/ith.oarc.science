The Book of Ecclesiastes

Introduction

If we look at the world without God, it appears what it is - a
magnificent, graduated combination of diverse classes of beings,
connected causes and effects, well-calculated means and ends. But thus
contemplated, the world as a whole remains a mystery. If, with the
atheist, we lay aside the idea of God, then, notwithstanding the law of
causation, which is grounded in our mental nature, we abandon the
question of the origin of the world. If, with the pantheist, we transfer
the idea of God to the world itself, then the effect is made to be as
one with the cause - not, however, without the conception of God, which
is inalienable in man, reacting against it; for one cannot but
distinguish between substance and its phenomena. The mysteries of the
world which meet man as a moral being remain, under this view of the
world, altogether without solution. For the moral order of the world
presupposes an absolutely good Being, from whom it has proceeded, and
who sustains it; it demands a Lawgiver and a Judge. Apart from the
reference to this Being, the distinction between good and evil loses its
depth and sharpness. Either there is no God, or all that is and happens
is a moment in the being and life of God Himself, who is identical with
the world: thus must the world-destructive power of sin remain
unrecognised. The opinion as to the state of the world will, from a
pantheistic point of view, rise to optimism; just as, on the other hand,
from an atheistic point of view, it will sink to pessimism. The
commanding power of goodness even the atheist may recognise by virtue of
the inner law peculiar to man as a moral being, but the divine
consecration is wanting to this goodness; and if human life is a journey
from nothing to nothing, then this will be the best of all goodness:
that man set himself free from the evil reality, and put his confidence
in nothing. "Him who views the world," says Buddhism, "as a
water-bubble, a phantom, the king of death does not terrify. What
pleasure, what joy is in this world? Behold the changing form-it is
undone by old age; the diseased body - it dissolves and corrupts! 'I
have sons and treasures; here will I dwell in the season of the cold,
and there in the time of the heat:' thus thinks the fool; and cares not
for, and sees not, the hindrances thereto. Him who is concerned about
sons and treasures - the man who has his heart so entangled - death
tears away, as the torrent from the forest sweeps away the slumbering
village." The view taken of the world, and the judgment formed regarding
it, in the Book of Ecclesiastes, are wholly different. While in the Book
of Esther faith in God remains so much in the background that there is
nowhere in it express mention made of God, the name of God occurs in
Ecclesiastes no fewer than thirty-seven times,

and that in such a way that the naming of Him is at the same time the
confession of Him as the True God, the Exalted above the world, the
Governor and the Ruler over all. And not only that: the book
characterizes itself as a genuine product of the Israelitish Chokma by
this, that, true to its motto, it places the command, "Fear Thou God,"
[Ecc 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006.md), [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md), [Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013.md), in the foremost rank as a
fundamental moral duty; that it makes, [Ecc
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md), the happiness of man to be
dependent thereon; that it makes, [Ecc
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md); [Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md); [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md), his final destiny to be
conditioned by his fearing God; and that it contemplates the world as
one that was created by God very good, [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md); [Ecc
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md), and as arranged, [Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014.md), and directed so that men should
fear Him. These primary principles, to which the book again and again
returns, are of special importance for a correct estimate of it.

Of like decisive importance for the right estimate of the theistic, and
at the same time also the pessimistic, view of the world presented by
Koheleth is this, that he knows of no future life compensating for the
troubles of the present life, and resolving its mystery. It is true that
he says, [Ecc 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md), that the
life-spirit of the man who dies returns to God who gave it, as the body
returns to the dust of which it is formed; but the question asked in
[Ecc 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021.md) shows that this preferring
of the life-spirit of man to that of a beast was not, in his regard,
raised above all doubt. And what does this return to God mean? By no
means such a return unto God as amounts to the annihilation of the
separate existence of the spirit of man; for, in the first place, there
is the supposition of this separate existence running through the Bible;
in the second place, נתנה, [Ecc 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md),
does not point to an emanation; and in the third place, the idea of
Hades prevailing in the consciousness of the ages before Christ, and
which is also that of Koheleth, proves the contrary. Man exists also
beyond the grave, but without the light and the force of thought and
activity characterizing his present life, [Ecc
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005.md), [Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010.md). The future life is not better,
but is worse than the present, a dense darkness enduring "for ever,"
[Ecc 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006.md); [Ecc
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#008.md); [Ecc
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005.md). It is true, indeed, that from
the justice of God, and the experiences of the present life as standing
in contradiction thereto, [Ecc 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md),
the conclusion is drawn, [Ecc 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md);
[Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md), that there is a last
decisive judgment, bringing all to light; but this great thought, in
which the interest of the book in the progress of religious knowledge
comes to a climax, is as yet only an abstract postulate of faith, and
not powerful enough to brighten the future; and therefore, also, not
powerful enough to lift us above the miseries of the present.

That the author gives utterance to such thoughts of the future as [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md) and [Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md); [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md) - to which Wisd. 3:1 ("The souls
of the righteous are in God' hand, and no trouble moves them") and [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md) ("Many that sleep in the dust of
the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
everlasting contempt") are related, as being their expansion, - warrants
the supposition that he disputes as little as Job does in chap. 14 the
reality of a better future; but only that the knowledge of such a future
was not yet given to him. In general, for the first time in the N.T.
era, the hope of a better future becomes a common portion of the
church's creed, resting on the basis of faith in the history of
redemption warranting it; and is advanced beyond the isolated prophetic
gleams of light, the mere postulates of faith that were ventured upon,
and the unconfirmed opinions, of the times preceding Christ. The N.T.
Scripture shows how altogether different this world of sin and of change
appears to be since a world of recompense and of glory has been revealed
as its background; since the Lord has pronounced as blessed those who
weep, and not those who laugh; and since, with the apostle ([Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018).md), we may be convinced that the
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
glory that shall be revealed to us. The goal of human life, with its
labour and its sufferings, is now carried beyond the grave. That which
is done under the sun appears only as a segment of the universal and
everlasting operation, governed by the wisdom of God, the separate
portions of which can only be understood in their connection with the
whole. The estimate taken of this present world, apart from its
connection with the future, must be one-sided. There are two worlds: the
future is the solution of the mystery of the present.

A N.T. believer would not be able to write such a book as that of Job,
or even as that of Ecclesiastes, without sinning against revealed truth;
without renouncing the better knowledge meanwhile made possible; without
falling back to an O.T. standpoint. The author of the Book of
Ecclesiastes is related to revealed religion in its O.T. manifestation,
- he is a believer before the coming of Christ; but not such an one as
all, or as most were, but of peculiar character and position. There are
some natures that have a tendency to joyfulness, and others to sadness.
The author of this book does not belong to the latter class; for if he
did, the call to rejoice, [Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md),
[Ecc 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md), etc., would not as it does
pervade his book, as the χαίρετε, though in a deeper sense, pervades the
Epistle to the Philippians. Neither does he belong to those superficial
natures which see almost everything in a rosy light, which quickly and
easily divest themselves of their own and of others' sorrows, and on
which the stern earnestness of life can make no deep and lasting
impressions. Nor is he a man of feeling, whom his own weakness makes a
prophet of evil; not a predominatingly passive man, who, before he could
fully know the world, withdrew from it, and now criticises it from his
own retired corner in a careless, inattentive mood; but a man of action,
with a penetrating understanding and a faculty of keen observation; a
man of the world, who, from his own experience, knows the world on all
its sides; a restless spirit, who has consumed himself in striving after
that which truly satisfies. That this man, who was forced to confess
that all science and art, all that table dainties, and the love of
women, and riches, and honour yielded him, was at last but vanity and
vexation of spirit, and who gained so deep an insight into the
transitoriness and vanity of all earthly things, into the sorrows of
this world of sin and death, and their perplexing mysteries, does not
yet conclude by resigning himself to atheism, putting "Nothing"
(Nirvna), or blind Fate, in the place of God, but firmly holds that the
fear of God is the highest duty and the condition of all true
prosperity, as it is the highest truth and the surest knowledge - that
such is the case with him may well excite our astonishment; as well as
this also, that he penetrates the known illusory character of earthly
things in no overstrained manner, despising the world in itself, and
also the gifts of God in it, but that he places his ultimatum as to the
pure enjoyment of life within the limits of the fear of God, and extends
it as widely as God permits. One might therefore call the Book of
Koheleth, "The Song of the Fear of God," rather than, as H. Heine does,
"The Song of Scepticism;" for however great the sorrow of the world
which is therein expressed, the religious conviction of the author
remains in undiminished strength; and in the midst of all the
disappointments in the present world, his faith in God, and in the
rectitude of God, and in the victory of the good, stands firm as a rock,
against which all the waves dash themselves into foam. "This book," says
another recent author,

(Note: Hartmann's Das Lied vom Ewigen, St. Galle 1859, p. 12.)

"which contains almost as many contradictions as verses, may be regarded
as the Breviary of the most modern materialism, and of extreme
licentiousness." He who can thus speak has not read the book with
intelligence. The appearance of materialism arises from this, that the
author sees in the death of man an end similar to that of beasts; and
that is certainly so far true, but it is not the whole truth. In the
knowledge of the reverse side of the matter he does not come beyond the
threshold, because His hand was not yet there - viz. the hand of the
Arisen One - which could help him over it. And as for the supposed
licentiousness, [Ecc 9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md) shows, by
way of example, how greatly the fear of God had guarded him from
concluding his search into all earthly things with the disgust of a
worn-out libertine.

But there are certainly self-contradictions in the Book of Ecclesiastes.
They have a twofold ground. They are, on the one hand, the reflection of
the self-contradicting facts which the author affirms. Thus, e.g., [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md), he says that God has set
eternity in the heart of man, but that man cannot find out from the
beginning to the end the work which God maketh; [Ecc
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md), that the best thing in this
world is for a man to enjoy life; but to be able to do this, is a gift
of God; [Ecc 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md), [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md), that it goes well with them that
fear God, but ill with the godless. But there is also the contrary -
which is just the ground-tone of the book, that everything has its But;
only the fear of God, after all that appertains to the world is found to
be as vanitas vanitatum, remains as the kernel without the shell, but
the commandment of the fear of God as a categorical imperative, the
knowledge that the fear of God is in itself the highest happiness, and
fellowship with God the highest good, remain unexpressed; the fear of
God is not combined with the love of God, as e.g., in Ps 73 it serves
only for warning and not for comfort. On the other hand, the book also
contains contradictions, which consists in contrasts which the author is
not in a condition to explain and adjust. Thus, e.g., the question
whether the spirit of a dying man, in contrast to that of a beast, takes
its way upwards, [Ecc 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021.md), is
proposed as one capable of a double answer; but [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md) answers it directly in the
affirmative; the author has good grounds for the affirmative, but yet no
absolute proofs. And while he denies the light of consciousness and the
energy of activity to those who have gone down to Hades, [Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010.md), he maintains that there is a
final decisive judgment of a holy and righteous God of all human
conduct, [Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md); [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md), which, since there is
frequently not a righteous requital given on earth, [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md), and since generally the issue
here does not bring to light, [Ecc
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md), the distinction between the
righteous and the wicked, will take place in eternity; but it is
difficult to comprehend how he has reconciled the possibility of such a
final judgment with the shadowy nature of existence after death.

The Book of Koheleth is, on the one side, a proof of the power of
revealed religion which has grounded faith in God, the One God, the
All-wise Creator and Governor of the world, so deeply and firmly in the
religious consciousness, that even the most dissonant and confused
impressions of the present world are unable to shake it; and, on the
other side, it is a proof of the inadequacy of revealed religion in its
O.T. form, since the discontent and the grief which the monotony, the
confusion, and the misery of this earth occasion, remain thus long
without a counterbalance, till the facts of the history of redemption
shall have disclosed and unveiled the heavens above the earth. In none
of the O.T. books does the Old Covenant appear as it does in the Book of
Koheleth, as "that which decayeth and waxeth old, and is ready to vanish
away" ([Heb 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013).md). If the darkness of
earth must be enlightened, then a New Covenant must be established; for
heavenly love, which is at the same time heavenly wisdom, enters into
human nature and overcomes sin, death, and Hades, and removes the
turning-point of the existence of man from this to the future life. The
finger of prophecy points to this new era. And Koheleth, from amid his
heaps of ruins, shows how necessary it is that the heavens should now
soon open above the earth.

It is a view of the world, dark, and only broken by scattered gleams of
light, not disowning its sullenness even where it recommends the happy
enjoyment of life, which runs through the book in a long series of
dissonances, and gives to it a peculiar character. It is thus
intentionally a homogeneous whole; but is it also divided into separate
parts according to a plan? That we may be able to answer this question,
we subject the contents of the book to a searching analysis, step by
step, yet steadily keeping the whole in view. This will at the same time
also serve as a preparation for the exposition of the book.

Here below, all things under the sun are vanity. The labour of man
effects nothing that is enduring, and all that is done is only a
beginning and a vanishing away again, repeating itself in a never-ending
circle: these are the thoughts of the book which stand as its motto,
[Ecc 1:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#002.md).

Koheleth-Solomon, who had been king, then begins to set forth the vanity
of all earthly things from his own experience. The striving after
secular knowledge, [Ecc 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012.md)., has
proved to him unsatisfactory, as has also the striving after happiness
in pleasure and in procuring the means of all imaginable gratifications,
[Ecc 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md); wisdom is vanity, for the
wise man falls under the stroke of death as well as the fool, and is
forgotten, [Ecc 2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md); the riches
are vanity, for they become the inheritance, one knows not whether or a
worthy or of an unworthy heir, [Ecc
2:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md); and, besides, pure enjoyment,
like wisdom and knowledge, depends not merely on the will of man, but
both are the gift of God, [Ecc 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md).
Everything has its time appointed by God, but man is unable to survey
either backwards or forwards the work of God, which fills eternity,
notwithstanding the impulse to search into it which is implanted within
him; his dependence in all things, even in pure enjoyment, must become
to him a school in which to learn the fear of God, who maintains all
things unchangeably, for forms the course of that which is done, [Ecc
3:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001.md). If he sees injustice
prevailing in the place of justice, God's time for righteous
interference has not yet come, [Ecc
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md). If God wishes to try men,
they shall see that they are dependent like the beasts, and liable to
death without any certain distinction from the beasts - there is nothing
better than that this fleeting life should be enjoyed as well as may be,
[Ecc 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md).

Koheleth now further records the evils that are under the sun:
oppression, in view of which death is better than life, and not to have
been at all is better than both, [Ecc
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md); envy, [Ecc
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004.md); the restlessness of labour, from
which only the fool sets himself free, [Ecc
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005.md); the aimless trouble and
parsimony of him who stands alone, [Ecc
4:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007.md); the disappointment of the
hopes placed on an upstart who has reached the throne, [Ecc
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013.md).

Up to this point there is connection. There now follow rules, externally
unconnected, for the relation of man to Him who is the Disposer of all
things; regarding his frequenting the house of God, [Ecc
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md); prayer, [Ecc
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md); and praise, [Ecc
5:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#003.md).

Then a catalogue of vanities is set forth: the insatiable covetous
plundering of the lowly by those who are above them in despotic states,
whereat the author praises, [Ecc
5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md), the patriarchal state based on
agriculture; and the nothingness and uncertainty of riches, which do not
make the rich happier than the labourer, [Ecc
5:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md); which sometimes are lost
without any to inherit them, [Ecc
5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012.md); and which their possessor, at
all events, must leave behind him when he dies, [Ecc
5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015.md). Riches have only a value when
by means of them a purer enjoyment is realized as the gift of God, [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md). For it happens that God gives to
a man riches, but to a stranger the enjoyment thereof, [Ecc
6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001.md). An untimely birth is better
than a man who has an hundred children, a long life, and yet who has no
enjoyment of life even to his death, [Ecc
6:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003.md). desire stretching on into the
future is torment; only so much as a man truly enjoys has he of all his
labour, [Ecc 6:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007.md); what man shall be
is predestinated, all contendings against it are useless: the knowledge
of that which is good for him, and of the future, is in the power of no
man, [Ecc 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010.md).

There now follow, without a premeditated plan, rules for the practical
conduct of life, loosely connecting themselves with the "what is good,"
[Ecc 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md), by the catchword "good:"
first six (probably originally seven) proverbs of two things each,
whereof the one is better than the other, [Ecc
7:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md); then three with the same
catch-word, but without comparison, [Ecc
7:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md).

This series of proverbs is connected as a whole, for their ultimatum is
a counsel to joy regulated by the fear of God within the narrow limits
of this life, constituted by God of good and bad days, and terminating
in the darkness of death. But this joy is also itself limited, for the
deep seriousness of the memento mori is mingled with it, and sorrow is
declared to be morally better than laughter.

With [Ecc 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md), the I, speaking from
personal experience, again comes into the foreground; but counsels and
observations also here follow each other aphoristically, without any
close connection with each other. Koheleth warns against an extreme
tendency to the side of good as well as to that of evil: he who fears
God knows how to avoid extremes, [Ecc
7:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md). Nothing affords a stronger
protection than wisdom, for (?) with all his righteousness a man makes
false steps, [Ecc 7:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md). Thou shalt
not always listen, lest thou hear something about thyself, - also thou
thyself hast often spoken harshly regarding others, [Ecc
7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#021.md). He has tried everything, but
in his strivings after wisdom, and in his observation of the distinction
between wisdom and folly, he has found nothing more dangerous than the
snares of women; among a thousand men he found one man; but one woman
such as she ought to be, he found not; he found in general that God made
men upright, but that they have devised many kinds of by-ways, [Ecc
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023.md).

As the wise man considers women and men in general, wisdom teaches him
obedience to the king to whom he has sworn fealty, and, under despotic
oppression, patient waiting for the time of God's righteous
interference, [Ecc 8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md). In the time
of despotic domination, it occurs that the godless are buried with
honour, while the righteous are driven away and forgotten, [Ecc
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010.md). God's sentence is to be waited
for, the more deliberately men give themselves to evil; God is just,
but, in contradiction to His justice, it is with the righteous as with
the wicked, and with the wicked as with the righteous, here on earth,
[Ecc 8:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md). In view of these
vanities, then, it is the most desirable thing for a man to eat and
drink, and enjoy himself, for that abides with him of his labour during
the day of his life God has given him, [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md). Restless labour here leads to
nothing; all the efforts of man to comprehend the government of God are
in vain, [Ecc 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016.md). For on closer
consideration, it appears that the righteous also, with all their
actions, are ruled by God, and generally that in nothing, not even in
his affections, is man his own master; and, which is the worst thing of
all, because it impels men to a wicked, mad abuse of life, to the
righteous and the unrighteous, death at last comes alike; it is also the
will of God towards man that he should spend this transient life in
cheerful enjoyment and in vigorous activity before it sinks down into
the night of Hades, [Ecc 9:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md). The
fruits of one's labour are not to be gained by force, even the best
ability warrants it not, an incomprehensible fate finally frustrates
all, [Ecc 9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md).

There now follows, but in loose connection as to thought with the
preceding, a section relating to wisdom and folly, and the discordances
as to the estimate of both here below, along with diverse kinds of
experiences and proverbs, Eccl 9:13-10:15. Only one proverb is out of
harmony with the general theme, viz., [Ecc
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md), which commends resignation under
the abullition of the wrath of the ruler. The following proverb, [Ecc
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md), returns to the theme, but
connecting itself with the preceding; the relation of rulers and the
ruled to each other is kept principally in view by Koheleth.

With a proverb relating to kings and princes, good and bad, a new
departure is made. Riotous living leads to slothfulness; and in contrast
to this (but not without the intervention of a warning not to curse the
king) follow exhortations to provident, and, at the same time, bold, and
all-attempting activity; for the future is God's, and not to be reckoned
on, Eccl 10:16-11:6. The light is sweet; and life, however long it may
last, in view of the uncertain dark future, is worthy of being enjoyed,
[Ecc 11:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md). Thus Koheleth, at the end
of this last series of proverbs, has again reached his Ceterum censeo;
he formulates it, in an exhortation to a young man to enjoy his life -
but without forgetting God, to whom he owes it, and to whom he has to
render an account - before grey-haired old age and death overtake him,
into a full-toned finale, 11:9-12:7. The last word of the book, [Ecc
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008.md), is parallel with the first ([Ecc
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001).md): "O! vanity of vanities; All is
vain!"

An epilogue, from the same hand as the book seals its truth: it is
written as from the very soul of Solomon; it issues from the same
fountain of wisdom. The reader must not lose himself in reading many
books, for the sum of all knowledge that is of value to man is
comprehended in one sentence: "Fear God, for He shall bring every work
into judgment," [Ecc 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009.md).

If we look back on this compendious reproduction of the contents and of
the course of thought of the book, there appears everywhere the same
view of the world, along with the same ultimatum; and as a pictorial
overture opens the book, a pictorial finale closes it. But a gradual
development, a progressive demonstration, is wanting, and so far the
grouping together of the parts is not fully carried out; the connection
of the thoughts if more frequently determined by that which is external
and accidental, and not unfrequently an incongruous element is
introduced into the connected course of kindred matters. The Solomonic
stamp impressed on chap. 1 and 2 begins afterwards to be effaced. The
connection of the confessions that are made becomes aphoristic in chap.
3; and the proverbs that are introduced do not appropriately fall into
their place. The grounds, occasions, and views which determine the
author to place confessions and moral proverbs in such an order after
one another, for the most part withdraw themselves from observation. All
attempts to show, in the whole, not only oneness of spirit, but also a
genetic progress, an all-embracing plan, and an organic connection, have
hitherto failed, and must fail.

(Note: "Ajunt Hebraei, quum inter cetera scripta Salomonis, quae
antiquata sunt nec in memoria duraverunt, et hic liber obliterandus
videretur, et quod vanas assereret Dei creaturas et totum putaret esse
pro nihilo, et potum et cibum et delicias transeuntes praeferret
omnibus, ex hoc uno capitulo ([Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013).md) meruisse auctoritatem, ut in
divinorum voluminum numero poneretur." - Jerome.)

In presenting this view of the spirit and plan of the Book of Koheleth,
we have proceeded on the supposition that it is a post-exilian book,
that it is one of the most recent of the books of the O.T. It is true,
indeed, that tradition regards it as Solomonic. According to Bathra 15a,
the Hezekiah-Collegium vid., Del. on Proverbs, p. 5\] must have
"written" - that is, collected into a written form - the Book of Isaiah,
as also the Proverbs, the Song, and Koheleth. The Midrash regards it as
Solomon's, and as written in the evening of his days; while the Song was
written in his youth, and the Proverbs when he was in middle age
(Jalkut, under [Pro 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001).md). If in Rosch
haschana 21b it is said that Koheleth sought to be a second Moses, and
to open the one of the fifty gates of knowledge which was unopened by
Moses, but that this was denied to him, it is thereby assumed that he
was the incomparable king, as Moses was the incomparable prophet. And
Bloch, in his work on the origin and era of the Book of Koheleth (1872),
is right in saying that all objections against the canonicity of the
book leave the Solomonic authorship untouched. In the first Christian
century, the Book of Koheleth was an antilegomenon. In the Introduction
to the Song we have traced to their sources the two collections of legal
authorities according to which the question of the canonicity of the
Book of Koheleth is decided. The Synod of Jabne (Jamnia), about 90,
decided the canonicity of the book against the school of Shammai. The
reasons advanced by the latter against the canonicity are seen from
Shabbath 30b, and Megilla 7a. From the former we learn that they
regarded the words of the book, particularly [Ecc
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md) (where they must have read
מהוּלּל, "worthy to be praised"), cf. [Ecc
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#003.md), and [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md), 22, as contradictory (cf.
Proverbs, p. 31); and from the latter, that they hence did not recognise
its inspiration. According to the Midrash Koheleth, under [Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md), they were stumbled also by the
call to the enjoyment of pleasure, and to walk in the way of the desire
of the heart, which appeared to stand in contradiction to the Tra (cf.
[Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md) with [Num
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#039).md), and to savour of heresy. But
belief in the Solomonic authorship remained, notwithstanding, uninjured;
and the admonitions to the fear of God, with reference to the future
judgment, carried them over the tendency of these observations. Already,
at the time of Herod the Great (Bathra 4a), and afterwards, in the time
of R. Gamaliel (Shabbath 30b), the book was cited as Holy Scripture; and
when, instead of the book, the author was named, the formula of citation
mentioned the name of Solomon; or the book was treated as equally
Solomonic with Proverbs and the Song (Erubin 21b).

Even the doubtfulness of its contents could give rise to no manner of
doubt as to the author. Down till the new era beginning with
Christianity, and, in the main, even till the Reformation-century, no
attention was paid to the inner and historico-literary marks which
determine the time of the origin of a book. The Reformation first called
into existence, along with the criticism of dogmatic traditions, at the
same time also biblical criticism, which it raised to the place of an
essential part of the science of Scripture. Luther, in his Tischreden
(Table-Talk), is the first who explained the Preacher as one of the most
recent books of the O.T.: he supposed that the book had not reached us
in its completed form; that it was written by Sirach rather than by
Solomon; and that it might be, "as a Talmud, collected from many books,
perhaps from the library of King Ptolemy Euergetes, in Egypt."

(Note: Tischreden, ed. Frstemann-Bindseil, p. 400f. The expression here
almost appears as if Luther had confounded Ecclesiastes (Koheleth) with
Ecclesiasticus (Sirach). At a later period he maintained that the book
contained a collection of Solomonic sayings, not executed, however, by
Solomon himself.)

These are only passing utterances, which have no scientific value; among
his contemporaries, and till the middle of the century following, they
found no acceptance. Hugo Grotius (1644) is the first who, like Luther,
rejects its Solomonic authorship, erroneously supposing, with him, that
it is a collection of diverse sayings of the wise, περὶ τῆς εὐδαιμονίας;
but on one point he excellently hits the nail on the head: Argumentum
ejus rei habeo multa vocabula, quae non alibi quam in Daniele, Esdra et
Chaldaeis interpretibus reperias. This observation is warranted. If the
Book of Koheleth were of old Solomonic origin, then there is no history
of the Hebrew language. But Bernstein (Quaestiones nonnullae
Kohelethanae, 1854) is right in saying that the history of the Hebrew
language and literature is certainly divided into two epochs by the
Babylonish exile, and that the Book of Koheleth bears the stamp of the
post-exilian form of the language.

these forms are common in the Mishna, and have there their special
meanings proceeding from the fundamental idea of seeing.

רדף, Niph. part., only [Ecc 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015.md).

Reuth, besides the Chald. parts of Ezra, occurs only seven times in the

parts of Daniel and in the Targ.

שׁ, this in and of itself is in no respect modern, but, as the
Babyl.-Assyr. אש, the Phoen. sa, shows, is the relative (originally
demonstrative) belonging to the oldest period of the language, which in
the Mishna has altogether supplanted the אשׁר of the older Heb.
book-language. It is used in the Book of Koheleth quite in the same way
as in the Mishna, but thus, that it stands first on the same line (rank)
with אשׁר, and makes it doubtful whether this or that which occurs more
frequently in the book (שׁ, according to Herzfeld, 68 times, and אשׁר 89
times) has the predominance (cf. e.g., [Ecc
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013.md)., [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md); [Ecc
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#014), where both are used promiscue.md).
The use of asher as a relative pronoun and relative conjunction is not
different from the use of this in the older literature: 'ad asher lo, in
the sense of "before," [Ecc 12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md),
[Ecc 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#006.md), Mishnic עד שׁלא, is only a
natural turn to the fundamental meaning "till that not" ([Sa2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#013.md); [Kg1
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017).md); and mibeli asher lo = nisi
quod non, [Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md) (cf. bilti, [Dan
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#018).md), for which the Mishnic ובלבד
שלא (e.g., Erubin i. 10), is only accidentally not further demonstrable.
But how far the use of שׁ has extended, will be seen by the following
survey, from which we exclude s, standing alone as a relative pronoun or
relative conjunction:-

Beshekvar, [Ecc 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md). Beshel asher, eo

with the Greek ὑφ ̓ ἡλίῳ, ορ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον.

Takkiph, in the O.T. Heb. only [Ecc

Takan, [Ecc 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#015.md); Pih. [Ecc

12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009.md), a Mishna-word used in the Pih.
and Hiph., whence tikkun ("putting right," e.g., in the text-hist.
terminus technicus, tikkun sopherim, and "arrangement," e.g., Gittin iv.
2, "the ordering of the world") and tikkānāh (e.g., Gittin iv. 6,
"welfare," frequently in the sense of "direction," "arrangement").

This survey of the forms peculiar to the Book of Koheleth, and only
found in the most recent books of the O.T., partly only in the Chaldee
portions of these, and in general use in the Aramaic, places it beyond
all doubt that in this book we have a product of the post-exilian
period, and, at the earliest, of the time of Ezra-Nehemiah. All that
Wagenmann (Comm. 1856), von Essen (Der Predeger Salomo's, 1856), Bhl (De
Aramaismis libri Coheleth, 1860), Hahn (Comm. 1860), Reusch (Tbinger
Quartalschr. 1860), Warminski (Verfasser u. Abfassungszeit des B.
Koheleth, 1867), Prof. Taylor Lewis (in the American ed. of Lange's
Bibelwerk, 1869), Schfer (Neue Untersuchungen d. B. Koheleth, 1870),
Vegni (L'Ecclesiaste secondo il testo Ebraico, Florenz 1871) have
advanced to the contrary, rests on grounds that are altogether
untenable. If we possessed the original work of Sirach, we should then
see more distinctly than from fragments

(Note: Vid., the collection of the Heb. fragments of the Book of
Ben-Sira in my Gesch. der jd. Poesie, p. 204f.)

that the form of the language found in Koheleth, although older, is yet
one that does not lie much further back; it is connected, yet loosely,
with the old language, but at the same time it is in full accord with
that new Heb. which we meet with in the Mishna and the
Barajtha-Literature, which groups itself around it. To the modern
aspects of the Heb. language the following forms belong: -

1\. Verbs Lamed-Aleph, which from the first interchange their forms with
those of verbs Lamed-He, are regularly treated in certain forms of
inflexion in the Mishna as verbs Lamed-He; e.g., יצאהis not used, but
יצתה.

(Note: Vid., Geiger's Lehrbuch der Mishna-Sprache, p. 46.)

This interchange of forms found in the later language reveals itself
here in יצא, [Ecc 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md), used instead
of יצאת; and if, according to the Masora, חוטא (חטא) is to be always
written like מוצא at [Ecc 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md) (except
[Ecc 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026).md), the traditional text
herein discloses a full and accurate knowledge of the linguistic
character of the book. The Aram. ישׁנא for ישׁנה, at [Ecc
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md), is not thus to be accounted for.

2\. The richness of the old language in mood-forms is here disappearing.
The optative of the first person (the cohortative) is only represented
by אחכּמה, [Ecc 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023.md). the form of the
subjunctive (jussive) is found in the prohibitive clauses, such as [Ecc
7:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md); [Ecc
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md); but elsewhere the only certain
examples found are שׁיּלך, quod auferat secum, [Ecc
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014.md), and וגּיד, [Ecc
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#010.md). In [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md), וישׁב may also be read, although
וישׁב, under the influence of "ere ever" ([Ecc
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#006).md), is also admissible. On the
contrary, יהוּא, [Ecc 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md), is indic.
after the Mishn. יהא, and so also is וינאץ (derived from נצץ, not נצץ),
[Ecc 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005.md). Yet more characteristic,
however, is the circumstance that the historic tense, the so-called fut.
consecutivum, which has wholly disappeared from the Mishna-language,
also here, notwithstanding the occasions for its frequent use, occurs
only three times, twice in the unabbreviated form, [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md), [Ecc
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007.md), and once in the form lengthened
by the intentional ah, [Ecc 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017.md),
which before its disappearance was in frequent use. It probably belonged
more to the written than to the spoken language of the people (cf. the
[Sol 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009).md).

3\. The complexion of the language peculiar to the Book of Koheleth is
distinguished also by this, that the designation of the person already
contained in the verbal form is yet particularly expressed, and without
there being a contrast occasioning this emphasis, by the personal
pronoun being added to and placed after it, e.g., [Ecc
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md); [Ecc
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md), [Ecc
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md), [Ecc
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md), [Ecc
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md), [Ecc
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020.md); [Ecc
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017.md); [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md), [Ecc
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004.md), [Ecc
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007.md); [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md); [Ecc
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md); [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md); [Ecc
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015.md). Among the more ancient authors,
Hosea has the same peculiarity (cf. the [Sol
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005).md); but there the personal pronoun
stands always before the verb, e.g., [Ecc
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#013.md); [Ecc
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011.md). The same thing is found in [Psa
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011.md); [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md), etc. The inverse order of the
words is found only at [Ecc 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014.md),
after the scheme of [Job 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#015.md), as also
2:15 follows the scheme of [Gen 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027.md).
Mishna-forms of expressions such as מודרני, Nedarim i. 1, מקבּלני,
Jebamoth xvi. 7, are not homogeneous with that manner of subordinating
the personal pronoun (cf. [Ecc 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md);
[Ecc 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002).md). Thus we have here before us
a separation of the subject and the predicate, instead of which, in the
language of the Mishna, the form אמר הייתי (אני) and the like (e.g.,
Berachoth i. 5) is used, which found for itself a place in the language
of Koheleth, in so far as this book delights in the use of the
participle to an extent scarcely met with in any other book of Scripture
(vid., e.g., [Ecc 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#006.md); [Ecc
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md); [Ecc
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019).md).

4\. The use of the demonstrative pronoun זה bears also a Mishnic stamp.
We lay no particular stress on the fact that the author uses it, as
regularly as the Mishna, always without the article; but it is
characteristic that he always, where he does not make use of the
masculine form in a neuter sense (as [Ecc
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md), [Ecc
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md), [Ecc
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md); [Ecc
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009.md); [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md); [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md), keeping out of view cases
determined by attraction), employs no other feminine form than זה,
Mishnic זו, in this sense, [Ecc 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md);
[Ecc 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015.md), [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md); [Ecc
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023.md); [Ecc
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013.md). In other respects also the use
of the pronouns approaches the Mishna language. In the use of the
pronoun also in [Ecc 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#010.md) and [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md) there is an approach to the
Mishnic זהוּ, nic est, and זהי, haec est. And the use of הוּא and המּה
for the personal verb reaches in [Ecc
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md); [Ecc
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004) (vid., Comm..md), the extreme.

The enumeration of linguistic peculiarities betokening a late origin is
not yet exhausted; we shall meet with many such in the course of the
Exposition. Not only the language, however, but also the style and the
artistic form of the book, show that it is the most recent product of
the Bibl. Chokma literature, and belongs to a degenerated period of art.
From the fact that the so-called metrical accent system of the three
books - Psalms, Job, and Proverbs - is not used in Ecclesiastes, it does
not follow that it is not a poetical book in the fullest sense of the
word; for the Song and Lamentations, these masterpieces of the שׁיר and
קינה, the Minne-song and the Elegy, are also excluded from that more
elevated, more richly expressive, and more melodious form of discourse,
perhaps to preserve the spiritual character of the one, and not to
weaken the elegiac character of the other, to which a certain melancholy
monotone andante is suitable. So also, to apply that system of
accentuation to the Book of Koheleth was not at all possible, for the
symmetrical stichs to which it is appropriate is for the most part
wanting in Koheleth, which is almost wholly written in eloquent prose:
unfolding its instruction in the form of sentences without symmetrical
stichs. - It is, so to speak, a philosophical treatise in which "I saw,"
and the like, as the expression of the result of experience; "I said,"
as the expression of reflection on what was observed; "I perceived," as
the expression of knowledge obtained as a conclusion from a process of
reasoning; and "this also," as the expression of the result, - repeat
themselves nearly terminologically. The reasoning tone prevails, and
where the writer passes into gnomic poetry he enters into it suddenly,
e.g., [Ecc 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md), or holds himself ready
to leave it quickly again, e.g., [Ecc
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012.md); [Ecc
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013.md). Always, indeed, where the Mashal
note is struck, the discourse begins to form itself into members
arranged in order; and then the author sometimes rises in language, and
in the order of his words, into the true classic form of the proverb set
forth in parallel members, e.g., [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md), [Ecc
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#009.md); [Ecc
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#008.md). The symmetry of the members is
faultless, [Ecc 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#005.md); [Ecc
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md); [Ecc
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md); but in other places, as [Ecc
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md); [Ecc
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md); [Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md), it fails, and in the long run
the book, altogether peculiar in its stylistic and artistic character,
cannot conceal its late origin: in the elevated classical style there
quickly again intermingles that which is peculiar to the author, as
representing the age in which he lived, e.g., [Ecc
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md); [Ecc
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#002.md), [Ecc
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#006.md), [Ecc
10:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#008.md), [Ecc
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md)., [Ecc
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md), [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md). That in the age of the Mishna
they knew how to imitate classic masterpieces, is seen from the
beautiful enigma, in the form of a heptastich, by Bar-Kappara, jer. Mod
katan iii. 1, and the elegy, in the form of a hexastich on the death of
R. Abina, by Kar-Kippuk, b. Mod katan 25b.

(Note: Given and translated in Wissenschaft, Kunst, Judenthum (1838), p.
231f.)

One would thus be in error if he regarded such occasional classical
pieces in the Book of Koheleth as borrowed. The book, however
fragmentary it may seem to be on a superficial examination, is yet the
product of one author.

(Note: Renan, in his Histoire des Langues Smitiques, supposes that a
work of so bold a scepticism as Ecclesiastes could not have originated
in the post-exilian period of the severely legal rabbinical Judaism; it
may be an old Solomonic work, but as it now lies before us, revised by a
more recent hand-an untenable expedient for establishing an arbitrary
supposition.)

In its oratorical ground-form, and in the proverbs introduced into it,
it is a side-piece to Prov 1-9. We have shown, in the introduction to
the Book of Proverbs, that in these proverbial discourses which form the
introduction to the older Solomonic Book of Proverbs, which was probably
published in the time of Jehoshaphat, the Mashal appears already
rhetorically decomposed. This decomposition is much further advanced in
the Book of Ecclesiastes. To it is applicable in a higher degree what is
there (Proverbs, p. 10f.) said of Prov 1-9. The distich is represented
in the integral, [Ecc 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013.md),
synonymous, [Ecc 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004.md), and synthetic,
[Ecc 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md), and also, though rarely, in
the antithetic form, [Ecc 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#004.md); but of
the emblematic form there is only one example, [Ecc
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md). The author never attempted the
beautiful numerical and priamel forms; the proverbial form also, beyond
the limits of the distich, loses the firmness of its outline. The
tetrastich, [Ecc 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md), is, however, a
beautiful exception to this. But splendour of form would not be
appropriate to such a sombre work as this is. Its external form is truly
in keeping with its spirit. In the checkered and yet uniform manner of
the book is reflected the image of the author, who tried everything and
yet was satisfied with nothing; who hastened from one thing to another
because nothing was able to captivate him. His style is like the view he
takes of the world, which in its course turned to him only its dark
side. He holds fast to the fear of God, and hopes in a final judgment;
but his sceptical world-sorrow remains unmitigated, and his forced
eudaemonism remains without the right consecration: these two stars do
not turn the night into day; the significance of the book, with
reference to the history of redemption, consists in the actual proof
that humanity, in order to its being set free from its unhappiness,
needs to be illuminated by the sun of a new revelation. But although the
manner of the author's representation is the reflection of his own inner
relation to the things represented, yet here and there he makes his
representation, not without consciousness and art, the picture of his
own manner of thought. Thus, e.g., the drawling tautologies in [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md); [Ecc
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009.md), certainly do not escape from him
against his will. And as was rightly remarked under [Gen
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001.md), that the discourse there is
extended, and forms itself into a picture of rest after the work of the
creation, so Koheleth, in [Ecc 1:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004.md)
and [Ecc 12:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#002.md), shows himself a
master of eloquence; for in the former passage he imitates in his style
the everlasting unity of the course of the world, and in the latter he
paints the exhausted and finally shattered life of man.

Not only, however, by the character of its thought and language and
manner of representation, but also by other characteristic features, the
book openly acknowledges that it was not written by Solomon himself, but
by a Jewish thinker of a much later age, who sought to conceive of
himself as in Solomon's position, and clothed his own life-experiences
in the confessions of Solomon. The very title of the book does not leave
us in doubt as to this. It is in these words: The words of Koheleth, the
son of David, king in Jerusalem. The apposition, "king in Jerusalem,"
appertains, like e.g., [Ch2 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#003.md), to
the name of the speaker who is introduced; for nothing is here said as
to the place in life held by David, but to that held by him who is thus
figuratively named. The indeterminate "king" of itself would be
untenable, as at [Pro 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md). As there
the words "king of Massa" are to be taken together, so here "king" is
determined by "in Jerusalem" added to it, so far that it is said what
kind of king Koheleth was. That by this name Solomon is meant, follows,
apart from [Ecc 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012.md)., from this, that
David had only one son who was king, viz., Solomon. The opinion of
Krochmal, that a later David, perhaps a governor of Jerusalem during the
Persian domination, is meant,

(Note: Vid., Kerem chemed v. 89, and his More necobhe ha-seman (Director
errnatium nostrae aetatis), edited by Zunz, 1851, 4.)

is one of the many superfluities of this learned author. Koheleth is
Solomon, but he who calls him "king in Jerusalem" is not Solomon
himself. Solomon is called "king of Israel," e.g., [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013.md); and as in [Ecc
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012.md) he names himself "king over
Israel," so, [Neh 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#026.md), he is called
"king of Israel," and along with this designation, "king over all
Israel;" but the title, "king in Jerusalem," nowhere else occurs. We
read that Solomon "reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel," [Kg1
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#042.md), cf. [Kg1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021.md); the title, "king in Jerusalem,"
is quite peculiar to the title of the book before us. Eichhorn supposes
that it corresponds to the time subsequent to the division of the
kingdom, when there were two different royal residences; but against
this view Bloch rightly remarks, that the contrasted "in Samaria" occurs
only very rarely (as [Kg2 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023).md). We
think that in this expression, "king in Jerusalem," there is revealed a
time in which Israel had ceased to be an independent kingdom, in which
Jerusalem was no more a royal city.

That the book was not composed immediately by Solomon, is indicated by
the circumstance that he is not called Solomon, nor Jedidiah ([Sa2
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#025).md), but is designated by a
hitherto unheard of name, which, by its form, shows that it belongs, at
earliest, to the Ezra-Nehemiah age, in which it was coined. We consider
the name, first, without taking into account its feminine termination.
In the Arab., ḳahal (cogn. ḳaḥal) signifies to be dry, hard, from the
dryness and leather-like toughness of the skin of an old man; and,
accordingly, Dindorf (Quomodo nomen Coheleth Salomoni tribuatur, (1791)
and others understand Koheleth of an old man whose life is worn out;
Coccejus and Schultens, with those of their school, understand it of the
penitent who is dead to the world. But both views are opposed by this,
that the form קהל (קהל, cf. כּהל) would be more appropriate; but above
all by this, that קהל, in this meaning aridum, marcidum esse, is a
verbal stem altogether foreign to the northern Semitic. The verb קהל
signifies, in the Heb., Aram., and Assyr., to call (cf. the Syr.
kahlonitho, a quarrelsome woman), and particularly to call together;
whence קהל, of the same Sanscrit-Semit. root as the words εκ-κλη-σία and
con-cil-ium,

(Note: Vid., Friedr. Delitzsch's Indogermanisch-Semitische Studien, p.
90.)

\- an extension of the root קל, which, on another side, is extended in
the Arab. ḳalaḥ, Aethiop. kaleḥa, to cry. This derivation of the name
Koheleth shows that it cannot mean συναθροιστής (Grotius, not Aquila),
in the sense of collector sententiarum; the Arab. translation alajam'at
(also van Dyk) is faultless, because jam' can signify, to collect men as
well as things together; but קהל is not used in that sense of in unum
redigere. In close correspondence with the Heb. word, the lxx
translates, ὁ ἐκκλησιαστής; and the Graec. Venet., ἡ ἐκκλησιάστρια ([Ecc
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009) : ἡ ἐκκλησιἀζουσα.md). But in the
nearest signification, "the collector," this would not be a significant
name for the king represented as speaking in this book. In Solomon's
reign there occurred an epoch-making assembly in Jerusalem, [Kg1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md); [Ch2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#002.md) - viz for the purpose of
consecrating the temple. The O.T. does not afford any other historical
reference for the name; for although, in [Pro
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#014.md); [Pro
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#026.md), בּקהל signifies coram populo,
publice, yet it does not occur directly of the public appearance of
Wisdom; the expressions for this are different, [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md)., [Ecc
8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md); [Ecc
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#003.md), though cognate. But on that great
day of the consecration of the temple, Solomon not only called the
people together, but he also preached to them - he preached indirectly,
for he consecrated the temple by prayer; and directly, for he blessed
the people, and exhorted them to faithfulness, [Kg1
8:55-61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#055.md).

Thus Solomon appears not only as the assembler, but also as the preacher
to those who were assembled; and in this sense of a teacher of the
people (cf. [Ecc 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009).md), Koheleth is an
appropriate name of the king who was famed for his wisdom and for his
cultivation of the popular Mashal. It is known that in proper names the
Kal is frequently used in the sense of the Hiph. thus Koheleth is not
immediately what it may be etymologically = קרא, caller, proclaimer; but
is = מקהלת, from הקהיל, to assemble, and to speak to the assembly,
contionari; according to which Jerome, under [Ecc
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md), rightly explains: ἐκκλησιαστής,
Graeco sermone appellatur qui coetum, id est ecclesiam congregat, quem
nos nuncupare possumus contionatorem, eo quod loquatur ad populum et
ejus sermo non specialiter ad unum, sed ad universos generaliter
dirigatur. The interpretation: assembly = academy or collectivum, which
Dderlein (Salomon's Prediger u. Hoheslied, 1784) and Kaiser (Koheleth,
Das Collectivum der Davidischen Knige in Jerusalem, 1823), published,
lightly disregards the form of the n. agentis; and Spohn's (Der Prediger
Salomo, 1785) "O vanity of vanities, said the philosopher," itself
belongs to the vanities.

Knobel in his Comm. (1836) has spoken excellently regarding the feminine
form of the name; but when, at the close, he says: "Thus Koheleth
properly signifies preaching, the office and business of the public
speaker, but is then = קהל, מקהיל, public speaker before an assembly,"
he also, in an arbitrary manner, interchanges the n. agentis with the n.
actionis. His remark, that "the rule that concreta, if they have a fem.
termination, become abstraccta, must also hold for participia," is a
statement that cannot be confirmed. As חתמת signifies that which
impresses (a seal), and כּתרת that which twines about (chapiter), so
also חברת, [Exo 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#010.md), that which
joins together (the coupling); one can translate such fem. particip.,
when used as substantives, as abstracta, e.g., כּלה (from כּלה),
destruction, utter ruin; but they are abstracta in themselves as little
as the neutra in τὸ ταὐτόν, which may be translated by "identity," or in
immensum altitudinis, by immensity (in height). Also Arab names of men
with fem. forms are concreta. To the participial form Koheleth
correspond, for the most part, such names as (Arab.) rawiyaton, narrator
of tradition (fem. of rawyn); but essentially cogn. also are such words
as 'allamat, greatly learned man; also khalyfaton, which is by no means
an inf. noun, like the Heb. חליפה, but is the fem. of the verbal adj.
khalyf, successor, representative. The Arabic grammarians say that the
fem. termination gives to the idea, if possible, a collective
signification, e.g., jarrar, the puller, i.e., the drawer of a ship
(Helciarius), and jarrarat, the multitude drawing, the company (taife)
drawing the boat up the stream; or it also serves "as an exhaustive
designation of the properties of the genus;" so that, e.g., ‛allamat
means one who unites in himself that which is peculiar to the very
learned, and represents in his own person a plurality of very learned
men. They also say that the fem. termination serves in such cases to
strengthen the idea. But how can this strengthening result from a change
in the gender? Without doubt the fem. in such cases discharges the
function of a neut.; and since doctissimus is heightened to doctissimum,
it is thereby implied that such an one is a pattern of a learned man-the
reality of the idea, or the realized ideal of such an one.

From these Arab. analogues respecting the import of the name Koheleth,
it follows that the fem. is not to be referred to Chokma in such a way
as that Solomon might be thereby designated as the representative, and,
as it were, the incarnation of wisdom (Ewald, Hitzig, etc.), - an idea
which the book by no means supports; for it the author had designed, in
conformity with that signification of the name, to let Wisdom herself
speak through Solomon's mouth, he would have let him speak as the author
of Prov 1-9 speaks when he addresses the reader by the title, "my son,"
he would not have put expressions in his mouth such as [Pro
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md); [Pro
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#023.md). One should not appeal to [Ecc
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027.md); for there, where the subject is
the dangers of the love of women, Koheleth, in the sense of Wisdom
preaching, is as little appropriate as elsewhere; just here as the
masculine gender of the speaker to be accented, and Amrah Koheleth is
thus an incorrect reading for Amar HakKoheleth ([Ecc
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008).md). The name Koheleth, without
Chokma being supplied, is a man's name, of such recent formation as
Sophereth, [Neh 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md), for which [Ezr
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#055.md), Hassophereth; cf. also [Ezr
2:57](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#057.md), 'פּך הץ. The Mishna goes yet
further in the coining of such names for men generis fem. As it
generally prefers to use the part. passivi in an active sense, e.g.,
סבוּר, thinking; רכוּב, riding; שׁתוּי, having drunk; so also it forms
fem. plurals with a masculine signification, - as Hadruchoth,
press-treaders, Terumoth iii. 4; Hammeshuhhoth, surveyors, Erubin iv.
11; Halleuzoth, speakers in a foreign tongue, Megilla ii. 1, - and
construes these with mas. predicates.

(Note: Vid., Geiger, Lehrbuch, xvi. 6, and cf. Weiss' Studien, p. 90,
who arbitrarily explains away this linguistic usage. Duke, in his
Sprache der Mishna, p. 75, avoids the difficulty by the supposition of
inadmissible ellipses.)

In these there can be nowhere anything said of a heightening of the idea
effected by the transition to fem. forms. But the persons acting,
although they are men, are thought of as neut.; and they appear,
separated from the determination of their gender, as the representatives
of the activity spoken of. According to this, Koheleth is, without
regard to the gender, a preaching person. The Book of Koheleth thus
bears, in its second word, as on its very forehead, the stamp of the
Ezra-Nehemiah era to which it belongs.

As the woman of Endor, when she raised Samuel out of Hades at the
request of Saul, sees "gods ascending out of the earth" ([Sa1
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#013).md), so it is not the veritable
Solomon who speaks in this book, but his spirit, for which this neut.
name Koheleth is appropriate. When he says, [Ecc
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012.md), "I, Koheleth, have been king
over Israel in Jerusalem," he recognises himself not as the reigning
monarch, but as having been king. The Talmudic Aggada has joined to this
הייתי, the fable that Solomon was compelled to descend from the throne
on account of his transgression of the law, which was then occupied by
an angel in his stead, but externally bearing his likeness; and that he
now went about begging, saying: "I, Koheleth, have been king over Israel
in Jerusalem;" but that they struck him with a stick, and set before him
a plate of groats; for they said to him: "How canst thou speak thus?
There the king sits in his palace on this throne."

(Note: Jer. Sanhedrin ii. 6 goes further into the story; b. Gittin 68b,
where the angel is designated by the Persian name Ashmodee, cf.
Jellinek's Sammlung kleiner Midrashim 2. xxvi.)

In this fiction there is at least grammatical intelligence. For it is a
vain delusion for one to persuade himself that Solomon in his advanced
age could say, with reference to the period of his life as ruler, "I
have been king," fui rex - he was certainly always so during the forty
years of his reign, and on to the last moment of his life. Or can the
words מלך הייתי means sum rex? The case is as follows: הייתי is never
the expression of the abstract present, or of existence without regard
to time; "I am king" is expressed in this sense by the substantival
clause ani mělěk. In every case where one can translate הייתי by "I am,"
e.g., [Psa 88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md), the present being is
thought of as the result of an historical past (sum = factus sum). But
at the most, הייתי, when it looks from the present back upon the past,
out of which it arose, signifies "I have become," [Gen
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011.md); [Psa
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#008.md); [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md); or when it looks back into the
past as such, "I have been," [Jos 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005.md);
[Jdg 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#002.md); [Psa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025.md). Whether this word, in the
former sense, corresponds to the Greek perfect, and in the latter to the
Greek aorist, is determined only by the situation and connection. Thus
in [Exo 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#022.md) it signifies, "I have
become a stranger" (γέγονα = εἰμί); while, on the other hand, in [Deu
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#008.md), "thou hast been a stranger"
(ἐγένου, fuisti). That where the future is spoken of, הייתי can, by
virtue of the consecutio temporum, also acquire the meaning of "I shall
become, I shall be," e.g., [Kg1 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#021.md),
cf. [Ch1 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#012.md), is of no importance to
us here. In the more modern language the more delicate syntax, as well
as that idea of "becoming," primarily inherent in the verb היה, is
disappearing, and הייתי signifies either the past purely, "I have been,"
[Neh 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006.md), or, though not so
frequently, the past along with the present, "I was," e.g., [Neh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011.md). Accordingly, Solomon while still
living would be able to say מלך הייתי only in the sense of "I have
become (and still am) king;" but that does not accord with the following
retrospective perfects.

(Note: If ואתּן followed, then הייתי (as Reusch and Hengstenberg
interpret) might be a circumstantial perfect; vid., under [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002)..md)

This also does not harmonize with the more modern linguistic usage which
is followed by Koheleth, e.g., [Ecc
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009.md), מה־שׁ, id quod fuit; [Ecc
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#010.md), היה כבד, pridem fuit. In
conformity with this, the lxx translates הייתי by ἐγενόμην, and the
Graec. Venet. by ὑπῆρξα. But "I have been king," Solomon, yet living,
cannot say, only Salomo redivivus here introduced, as the preacher can
use such an expression.

The epilogue, [Ecc 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009.md)., also
furnishes an argument in favour of the late composition of this book, on
the supposition that it is an appendix, not by another hand, but by the
author himself. But that it is from the author's own hand, and does not,
as Grtz supposes, belong to the period in which the school of Hillel had
established the canonicity of the book, follows from this, that it is
composed in a style of Hebrew approaching that used in the Mishna, yet
of an earlier date than the Mishna; for in the Talmuds it is, clause by
clause, a subject of uncertain interpretation, - the language used is
plainly, for the Talmudic authorities, one that is antiquated, the
expressions of which, because not immediately and unambiguously clear,
need, in order to their explanation, to be translated into the language
then in use. The author of the book makes it thus manifest that here in
the epilogue, as in the book itself, Solomon is intentionally called
Koheleth; and that the manner of expression, as well as of the formation
of the sentences in this epilogue, can in all particulars be supported
from the book itself. In "fear God," [Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013.md), the saying in [Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006.md), which is similarly formed, is
repeated; and "this is the whole of man," [Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013.md), a thought written as it were
more in cipher than in extenso, is in the same style as [Ecc
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010). The word יותר ("moreover".md),
frequently used by the author and בעל, used in the formation of
attributive names, [Ecc 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md), [Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md); [Ecc
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010.md), [Ecc
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012.md); [Ecc
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md), we meet with also here. And as at
[Ecc 12:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009.md) a third idea connected
ἀσυνδέτως follows two ideas connected by vav, so also at [Ecc
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#007.md); [Ecc
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005.md). But if this epilogue is the
product of the author's own hand, then, in meaning and aim, it presents
itself as its sequel. The author says that the Koheleth who appears in
this book as "wise" is the same who composed the beautiful people's-book
Mishle; that he sought out not only words of a pleasing form, but also
all words of truth; that the words of the wise are like goads and nails
which stand in collected rows and numbers - they are given from one
Shepherd. The author of the book thereby denotes that the sentences
therein collected, even though they are not wholly, as they lie before
us, the words of Solomon, yet that, with the Proverbs of Solomon, and of
the wise men generally, they go back to one giver and original author.
The epilogue thus, by its historic reference to Solomon, recognises the
fiction, and gives the reader to understand that the book loses nothing
in its value from its not having been immediately composed by Solomon.

Of untruthfulness, of a so-called pia fraus, we cannot therefore speak.
From early times, within the sphere of the most ancient Israelitish
authorship, it was regarded as a justifiable undertaking for an author
to reproduce in a rhetorical or poetical form the thoughts and feelings
of memorable personages on special occasions. The Psalter contains not a
few psalms bearing the superscription le-David, which were composed not
by David himself, but by unknown poets, placing themselves, as it were,
in David's position, and representing him, such e.g., as 144, which in
the lxx excellently bears the superscription pro's to'n Golia'd. The
chronicler, when he seeks to give the reader an idea of the music at the
festival of the consecration of the tabernacle and then of the completed
temple, allows himself so great freedom, that he puts into the mouth of
David the Beracha of the fourth book of the Psalms ([Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048).md), along with the preceding
verse of Ps 106 ([Ch1 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#035)..md), and
into Solomon's mouth verses of Ps 132 ([Ch2
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041)..md). And the prophetical discourses
communicated in the O.T. historical books are certainly partly of this
sort, that they either may be regarded as original, as e.g., [Sa1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md)., or must be so regarded, as 2
Kings 18-20; but not merely where the utterances of the prophets are in
general terms reproduced, as at [Jdg
6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008.md); [Kg2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013.md); [Kg2
21:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010.md), but also elsewhere in most
of the prophetic discourses which we read in the Books of Kings and
Chronicles, the style of the historian makes itself perceptible.
Consequently (as also Caspari in his work on the Syro-Ephraimite War,
1849, finds) the discourses in the Chronicles, apart from those which
are common to them, bear an altogether different homogeneous character
from those of the Book of Kings. It is the same as with the speeches,
for instance, which are recorded in Thucydides, Dionysius of
Halicarnassus, Livy, and other Greek and Roman historians. Classen may
be right in the opinion, that the speeches in Thucydides are not mere
inventions, but that, nevertheless, as they lie before us, they are the
work of the historian; even the letters that passed between Pausanias
and Xerxes bear his stamp, although he composed them on the ground of
the verbal reports of the Spartans. It is thus also in the speeches
found in Tacitus. They are more Ciceronian than his own style is, and
the discourses of Germans have less elaborated periods than those of the
Romans; but so greatly was the writing of history by the ancients
influenced by this custom of free reproduction, that even a speech of
the Emperor Claudius, which is found engraven on brass, is given by
Tacitus not in this its original, but in another and freer form,
assimilated to his own manner of representation. So also sacred history,
which in this respect follows the general ancient custom, depends not on
the identity of the words, but of the spirit: it does not feign what it
represents the historical person as saying, it follows traditions; but
yet it is the power of its own subjectivity which thus recalls the past
in all that was essential to it in actual life. The aim is not
artistically to represent the imitation which is made as if it were
genuine. The arts by which it is sought to impart to that which is
introduced into a more recent period the appearance of genuineness, were
unknown to antiquity. No pseudonymous work of antiquity shows any such
imitation of an ancient style as, e.g., does Meinhold's Bernsteinhexe,
or such a forgery as Wagenfeld's Sanchuniathon. The historians reproduce
always in their own individual way, without impressing on the speeches
of different persons any distinct individual character. They abstain
from every art aimed at the concealment of the actual facts of the case.
It is thus also with the author of the Book of Koheleth. As the author
of the "Wisdom of Solomon" openly gives himself out to be an
Alexandrian, who makes Solomon his organ, so the author of the Book of
Koheleth is so little concerned purposely to veil the fiction of the
Solomon-discourse, in which he clothes his own peculiar
life-experiences, that he rather in diverse ways discovers himself as
one and the same person with the Salomo redivivus here presenting
himself.

We do not reckon along with these such proverbs as have for their object
the mutual relationship between the king and his subjects, [Ecc
8:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003.md); [Ecc
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md), [Ecc
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md)., 20, cf. [Ecc
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md); these do not betray in the
speaker one who is an observer of rulers and not a ruler himself; for
the two collections of "Proverbs of Solomon" in the Book of Proverbs
contain a multitude of proverbs of the king, [Pro
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010.md), [Pro
16:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012.md); [Pro
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012.md); [Pro
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002.md), [Pro
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008.md), [Pro
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026.md), [Pro
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#028.md); [Pro
25:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002.md)., 6f., which, although
objectively speaking of the king, may quite well be looked on as old
Solomonic-for is there not a whole princely literature regarding
princely government, as e.g., Friedrich II's Anti-Machiavel? But in the
complaints against unrighteous judgment, [Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md); [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md); [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md), one is to be seen who suffers
under it, or who is compelled to witness it without the power to change
it; they are not appropriate in the mouth of the ruler, who should
prevent injustice. It is the author himself who here puts his complaints
into the mouth of Solomon; it is he who has to record life-experiences
such as [Ecc 10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md). The time in which
he lived was one of public misgovernment and of dynastic oppression, in
contrast with which the past shone out in a light so much the rosier,
[Ecc 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md), and it threw long dark
shadows across his mind when he looked out into the world, and mediately
also upon the confessions of his Koheleth. This Koheleth is not the
historical Solomon, but an abstraction of the historical; he is not the
theocratic king, but the king among the wise men; the actual Solomon
could not speak, [Ecc 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md), of the
heir to his throne as of "the man that shall be after him," - and he who
has led astray by his wives into idolatry, and thus became an apostate
([Kg1 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004).md), must have sounded an
altogether different note of penitential contrition from that which we
read at [Ecc 7:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md). This Solomon who
tasted all, and in the midst of his enjoyment maintained the position of
a wise man ([Ecc 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009).md), is described by
the author of this book from history and from sayings, just as he needs
him, so as to make him an organ of himself; and so little does he think
of making the fiction an illusion difficult to be seen through, that he
represents Koheleth, [Ecc 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md); [Ecc
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007.md), [Ecc
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009.md), as speaking as if he had behind
him a long line of kings over the whole of Israel and Judah, while yet
not he, but the author of the book, who conceals himself behind Salomo
redivivus, could look back on such a series of kings in Jerusalem.

When did this anonymous author, who speaks instead of his Solomon, live
and write? Let us first of all see what conclusion may be gathered
regarding the book from the literary references it contains. In its
thoughts, and in the form of its thoughts, it is an extremely original
work. It even borrows nothing from the Solomonic Book of Proverbs, which
in itself contains so many repetitions; proverbs such as [Pro
7:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016.md) and [Pro
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007.md) are somewhat like, but only
accidentally. On the contrary, between [Ecc
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014.md) and [Job
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md), as well as between [Job
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#014.md) and [Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md), there undoubtedly exists some
kind of connection; here there lie before us thoughts which the author
of the Book of Koheleth may have read in the Book of Job, and have
quoted them from thence - also the mention of an untimely birth, [Ecc
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003.md), cf. [Job
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#016.md), and the expression "one among a
thousand," [Ecc 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028.md), cf. [Job
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003.md); [Job
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md), may perhaps be reminiscences
from the Book of Job occurring unconsciously to the author. This is not
of any consequence as to the determination of the time of the
composition of the Book of Koheleth, for the Book of Job is in any case
much older. Dependence on the Book of Jeremiah would be of greater
importance, but references such as [Jer
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#002.md), cf. [Jer
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#008.md); [Jer
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#011.md), cf. [Jer
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022.md), are doubtful, and guide to no
definite conclusion. And who might venture, with Hitzig, to derive the
golden lamp, [Ecc 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#010.md), from the
vision of [Zac 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002.md), especially since
the figure in the one place has an altogether different signification
from what it has in the other? But we gain a more certain terminus a quo
by comparing [Ecc 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#005.md) with [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md). Malachi there designates the
priests as messengers (delegated) of Jahve of hosts, along with which
also there is the designation of the prophets as God's messengers, [Ecc
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001.md); [Hag
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013.md). With the author of the Book of
Koheleth "the messenger" is already, without any name of God being
added, a priestly title not to be misunderstood; מלאך (messenger)

(Note: Vid., my dissertation: Die Discussion der Amtsfrage im Mishna u.
Gemara, in the Luth. Zeitschrift 1854, pp. 446-449.)

denotes the priest as vicarius Dei, the delegate of God, שׁלוח דרחמנא,
according to the later title (Kiddushin 23b). And a terminus ad quem,
beyond which the reckoning of the time of its composition cannot extend,
is furnished by the "Wisdom of Solomon," which is not a translation, but
a work written originally in Alexandrine Greek; for that this book is
older than the Book of Koheleth, as Hitzig maintains, is not only in
itself improbable, since the latter shows not a trace of Greek
influence, but in the light of the history of doctrine is altogether
impossible, since it represents, in the history of the development of
the doctrine of wisdom and the last things, the stage immediately
preceding the last b.c., as Philo does the last; it is not earlier than
the beginning of the persecution of the Jews by the Egyptians under
Ptolemy VII, Physkon (Joseph. c. Ap. ii. 5), and at all events was
written before Philo, since the combination of the Sophia and the Logos
is here as yet incomplete. This Book of Wisdom must stand in some kind
of historical relation to the Book of Koheleth. The fact that both
authors make King Solomon the organ of their own peculiar view of the
world, shows a connection that is not accidental. Accident is altogether
excluded by the circumstance that the Alexandrian author stands in the
same relation to the Palestinian that James stands in to the Pauline
letters. As James directs himself not so much against Paul as against a
Paulinism misleading to fatal consequences, so that Book of Wisdom is
certainly not directly a work in opposition to the Book of Koheleth, as
is assumed by J. E. Ch. Schmidt (Salomo's Prediger, 1794), Kelle (Die
salom. Schriften, 1815), and others; but, as Knobel and Grimm assert,
against a one-sided extreme interpretation of views and principles as
set forth by Koheleth, not without an acquaintance with this book. The
lovers of pleasure, who speak in Wisd. 2:1-9, could support that saying
by expressions from the Book of Koheleth, and the concluding words there
sound like an appropriation of the words of Koheleth [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017) (cf. lxx.md); it is true they break
off the point of the Book of Koheleth, for the exhortation to the fear
of God, the Judge of the world, is not echoed; but to break off this
point did not lie remote, since the old Chokma watchword, "fear God,"
hovered over the contents of the book rather than penetrated them. It is
as if the author of the Book of Wisdom, 1-5, wished to show to what
danger of abuse in the sense of a pure materialistic eudaemonism the
wisdom presented in the Book of Koheleth is exposed. But he also opposes
the pessimistic thoughts of Koheleth in the decided assertions of the
contrary: (1) Koheleth says: "There is one event to the righteous and to
the wicked," [Ecc 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md); but he says:
there is a difference between them wide as the heavens, Wisd. 3:2f.,
4:7; 5:15f.; (2) Koheleth says: "He that increaseth knowledge increaseth
sorrow," 1:18; but he says: wisdom bringeth not sorrow, but pure joy
with it, Wisd. 8:16; (3) Koheleth says that wisdom bringeth neither
respect nor favour, [Ecc 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md); but he
says: it brings fame and honour, Wisd. 8:10; (4) Koheleth says: "There
is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever," [Ecc
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md); but he says of wisdom in
contrast to folly: "I shall obtain by it a deathless name, and shall
leave to my descendants an everlasting remembrance," Wisd. 8:13.

The main distinction between the two books lies in this, that the
comfortless view of Hades running through the Book of Koheleth is
thoroughly surmounted by a wonderful rising above the O.T. standpoint by
the author of the Book of Wisdom, and that hence there is in it an
incomparably more satisfying Theodicee (cf. Wisd. 12:2-18 with [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md); [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014).md), and a more spiritual relation
to this present time (cf. Wisd. 8:21; 9:17, with [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md); [Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013), etc..md). The "Wisdom of Solomon"
has indeed the appearance of an anti-Ecclesiastes, a side-piece to the
Book of Koheleth, which aims partly at confuting it, partly at going
beyond it; for it represents, in opposition to Koheleth not rising above
earthly enjoyment with the But of the fear of God, a more ideal, more
spiritual Solomon. If Koheleth says that God "hath made everything
beautiful in his time," [Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md), and
hath made mad upright, [Ecc 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md); so,
on the other hand, Solomon says that He hath made all things εἰς τὸ
εἶναι, Wisd. 1:14, and hath made man ἐπ ̓ ἀφθαρσίᾳ, 2:23. There are many
such parallels, e.g., [Ecc 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md), cf.
Koh. [Ecc 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#013.md), [Ecc
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005.md), cf. Koh. [Ecc
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#012.md); [Ecc
9:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013.md), cf. Koh. [Ecc
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010.md)., but particularly Solomon's
confession, 7:1-21, with that of Koheleth, [Ecc
1:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012.md). Here, wisdom appears as a
human acquisition; there (which agrees with [Kg1
3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#011).md), as a gracious gift obtained
in answer to prayer, which brings with it all that can make happy. If
one keeps in his eye this mutual relation between the two books, there
can be no doubt as to which is the older and which the younger. In the
Book of Koheleth the Old Covenant digs for itself its own grave. It is
also a "school-master to Christ," in so far as it awakens a longing
after a better Covenant than the first.

(Note: Vid., Oehler's Theol. des A.T., II, p. 324.)

But the Book of Wisdom is a precursor of this better covenant. The
composition of the Book of Koheleth falls between the time of Malachi,
who lived in the time of Nehemiah's second arrival at Jerusalem,
probably under Darius Nothus (423-405 b.c.), and the Book of Wisdom,
which at the earliest was written under Ptolemy Physkon (145-117), when
the O.T. was already for the most part translated into the Greek
language.

(Note: Cf. Wisd 2:12a with [Isa 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md),
lxx, and Wisd 15:10a with [Isa 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#020.md),
lxx.)

Hitzig does not venture to place the Book of Koheleth so far back into
the period of the Ptolemies; he reaches with his chain of evidence only
the year 204, that in which Ptolemy Epiphanes (204-181), gained, under
the guardianship of the Romans, the throne of his father, - he must be
the minor whom the author has in his eye, [Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016.md). But the first link of his chain
of proof is a falsum. For it is not true that Ptolemy Lagus was the
first ruler who exacted from the Jews the "oath of God," [Ecc
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md), i.e., the oath of fidelity; for
Josephus (Antt. xii. 1. 1) says directly, that Ptolemy Lagus did this
with reference to the fidelity with which the Jews had kept to Alexander
the Macedonian the oath of allegiance they had sworn to Darius, which he
particularly describes, Antt. xi. 8. 3; besides, the covenant, e.g.,
[Sa2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003.md), concluded in the presence of
Jahve with their own native kings included in it the oath of allegiance,
and the oath of vassalage which, e.g., Zedekiah swore to Nebuchadnezzar,
[Ch2 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013.md), cf. [Eze
17:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013.md), had at the same time binding
force on the citizens of the state that was in subjection. Also that
"the oath of God" must mean the oath of allegiance sworn to a foreign
ruler, and not that sworn to a native ruler, which would rather be
called "the oath of Jahve," does not stand the test: the author of the
Book of Koheleth drives the cosmopolitism of the Chokma so far, that he
does not at all make use of the national name of God connected with the
history of redemption, and Nehemiah also, [Neh
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#025.md), uses an oath "of God" where one
would have expected an oath "of Jahve." The first link of Hitzig's chain
of proof, then, shows itself on all sides to be worthless. The author
says, [Ecc 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md), substantially the same
as Paul, [Rom 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#005.md), that one ought to
be subject to the king, not only from fear of punishment, but for
conscience' sake.

Thus, then, [Ecc 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010.md) will also stand
without reference to the carrying away of the Jews captive by Ptolemy
Lagus, especially since the subject there is by no means that of a
mass-deportation; and, besides, those who were carried into Egypt by
Lagus were partly from the regions round about Jerusalem, and partly
from the holy city itself (Joseph. Antt. 12. 1. 1). And the old better
times, [Ecc 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md), were not those of
the first three Ptolemies, especially since there are always men, and
even in the best and most prosperous times, who praise the old times at
the expense of the new. And also women who were a misfortune to their
husbands or lovers there have always been, so that in [Ecc
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md) one does not need to think of
that Agathoclea who ruled over Ptolemy Philopator, and even had in her
hands the power of life and death.

Passages such as [Ecc 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md) and [Ecc
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md) afford no help in reference to
the chronology. On the other hand, the author in [Ecc
9:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013.md) relates, to all appearance,
what he himself experienced. But the little city is certainly not the
fortified town of Dora, on the sea-coast to the west of Carmel, which
was besieged by Antiochus the Great (Polybius, v. 66) in the year 218,
as at a later period, in the year 138, it was by Antiochus VII, Sidetes
(Joseph. Bell. i. 2. 2); for this Dora was not then saved by a poor wise
man within it, - of whom Polybius knows nothing, - but "by the strength
of the place, and the help of those with Nicholaus." A definite
historical event is also certainly found in [Ecc
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013.md). Hitzig sees in the old
foolish king the spiritually contracted, but so much the more covetous,
high priest Onias, under Ptolemy Euergetes; and in the poor but wise
youth, Joseph (the son of Tobias), who robbed Onias of his place in the
state, and raised himself to the office of general farmer of taxes. But
here nothing agrees but that Onias was old and foolish, and that Joseph
was then a young wise man (Joseph. Antt. xii. 4. 2); of the poverty of
the latter nothing is heard-he was the nephew of Onias. And besides, he
did not come out of the house "of prisoners" (הסוּרים); this word is
pointed by Hitzig so as to mean, out of the house "of fugitives"
(הסּוּרים), perhaps, as he supposes, an allusion to the district Φιχόλα,
which the author thus interprets as if it were derived from φεύγειν.
Historical investigation has here degenerated into the boldest
subjectivism. The Heb. tongue has never called "fugitives" הסורים; and
to whom could the Heb. word פיקולה (cf. Berachoth 28b) suggest - as
Φύγελα did to Pliny and Mela - the Greek φεύγειν!

We have thus, in determining the time of the authorship of this book, to
confine ourselves to the period subsequent to the Diadochs. It may be
regarded as beyond a doubt that it was written under the Persian
domination. Kleinert (Der Prediger Salomo, 1864) is in general right in
saying that the political condition of the people which the book
presupposes, is that in which they are placed under Satraps; the
unrighteous judgment, [Ecc 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md); and
the despotic oppression, [Ecc 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md);
[Ecc 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009.md); [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md); the riotous court-life, [Ecc
10:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md); the raising of mean men to
the highest places of honour, [Ecc
10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md); the inexorable severity of the
law of war-service, [Ecc 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md);

(Note: Vid., Herod. iv. 84, vii. 38f.)

the prudence required by the organized system of espionage

existing at such a time, - all these things were characteristic of this
period. But if the Book of Koheleth is not at all older than Malachi,
then it was written somewhere within the last century of the Persian
kingdom, between Artaxerxes I, Longimanus (464-424), and Darius
Codomannus (335-332): the better days for the Jewish people, of the
Persian supremacy under the first five Achaemenides, were past ([Ecc
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010).md).

Indeed, in [Ecc 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003.md) there appear to be
reminiscences of Artaxerxes II, Mnemon (died about 360), who was 94
years old, and, according to Justin (x. 1), had 115 sons, and of
Artaxerxes III, Ochus his successor, who was poisoned by the chief
eunuch Bagoas, who, according to Aelian, Var. Hist. vi. 8, threw his
(Ochus') body to the cats, and caused sword-handles to be made from his
bones. The book altogether contains many examples to which concrete
instances in the Persian history correspond, from which they might be
abstracted, in which strict harmony on all sides with historical fact is
not to be required, since it did not concern the author. The event
recorded [Ecc 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013.md). refers to Cyrus
rising to the supremacy of world-ruler (after dispossessing the old
Median King Astyages), who left

(Note: According to Nicolaus of Damascus (Mller's Fragm. hist. Graec.
III 398), Cyrus was the child of poor parents; by "prison-house" ([Ecc
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014).md), reference is made to his
confinement in Persia, where access to him was prevented by guards
(Herod. i. 123). Justin, i. 5: "A letter could not be openly brought to
him, since the guards appointed by the king kept possession of all
approaches to him.")

nothing but misery to posterity. Such a rich man as is described in [Ecc
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002.md), who had to leave all his
treasures to a stranger, was Croesus, to whom Solon, as [Ecc
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008) (cf. Herod. i. 32, 86.md), said that
no one ought to be praised before his end. A case analogous at least to
[Ecc 9:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#014.md), was the deliverance of
Athens by the counsel of Themistocles (Justin, ii. 12), who finally,
driven from Athens, was compelled to seek the protection of the Persian
king, and ended his life in despair.

(Note: Vid., Spiegel's Ernische Alterthumskunde, II pp. 409, 413.
Bernstein suggests the deliverance of Potidea (Herod. viii. 128) or
Tripolis (Diodor. xvi. 41); but neither of these cities owed its
deliverance to the counsel of a wise man. Burger (Comm. in Ecclesiasten,
1864) thinks, with greater probability, of Themistocles, who was
celebrated among the Persians (Thucyd. i. 138), which Ewald also finds
most suitable, provided the author had a definite fact before his eye.)

If we were not confined, for the history of the Persian kingdom and its
provinces, from Artaxerxes I to the appearance of Alexander of Macedon,
to only a few and scanty sources of information (we know no Jewish
events of this period, except the desecration of the temple by Bagoses,
described by Josephus, Antt. xi. 7), we might probably be better able to
understand many of the historical references of the Book of Koheleth. We
should then be able to say to whom the author refers by the expression,
"Woe to thy land when thy king is a child," [Ecc
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md); for Artaxerxes I, who, although
only as yet a boy at the time of the murder of his father Xerxes
(Justin, iii. 1), soon thereafter appeared manly enough, cannot be
thought of. We should then, perhaps, be also in possession of the
historical key to [Ecc 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010.md); for with
the reference to the deportation of many thousands of Jewish prisoners
(Josephus, c. Ap. i. 22) - which, according to Syncellus and Orosius,
must have occurred under Artaxerxes III, Ochus - the interpretation of
that passage does not accord.

(Note: Vid., Bernstein's Quaestiones Kohelethanae, p. 66.)

We should then also, perhaps, know to what political arrangement the
author points when he says, [Ecc 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md),
that wisdom is a stronger protection to a city than "ten mighty men;"
Grtz refers this to the decuriones of the Roman municipal cities and
colonies; but probably it refers to the dynasties

(Note: Vid., Duncker's Gesch. des Alterthums, II p. 910.)

(cf. Assyr. salat, governor) placed by the Persian kings over the cities
of conquered countries. And generally, the oppressed spirit pervading
the book would be so much clearer if we knew more of the sacrifices
which the Jewish people in the later time of the Persians had to make,
than merely that the Phoenicians, at the same time with "The Syrians in
Palestine," had to contribute (Herod. vii. 87) to Xerxes for his Grecian
expedition three hundred triremes; and also that the people who "dwelt
in the Solymean mountains" had to render him assistance in his
expedition against Greece (Joseph. c. Ap. i. 22).

The author was without doubt a Palestinian. In Eccl 4:17 he speaks of
himself as dwelling where the temple was, and also in the holy city,
[Ecc 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010.md); he lived, if not actually
in it, at least in its near neighbourhood, [Ecc
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#015.md); although, as Kleinert remarks,
he appears, [Ecc 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md), to make use of
a similitude taken from the corn trade of a seaport town. From [Ecc
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008.md) the supposition is natural that he
was alone in the land, without children or brothers or sisters; but from
the contents and spirit of the whole book, it appears more certain that,
like his Koheleth, he was advanced in years, and had behind him a long
checkered life. The symptoms of approaching death presenting themselves
in old age, which he describes to the young, [Ecc
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#002.md)., he probably borrowed from his
own experience. The whole book bears the marks of age, - a production of
the Old Covenant which was stricken in age, and fading away.

The literature, down to 1860, of commentaries and monographs on the Book
of Koheleth is very fully set forth in the English Commentary of
Ginsburg, and from that time to 1867, in Zckler's Commentary, which
forms a part of Lange's Bibelwerk. Keil's Einleitung, 3rd ed. 1873,
contains a supplement to these, among which, however, the Bonner
Theolog. Literaturblatt, 1874, Nr. 7, misses Pusey's and Reusch's (cf.
the Tbingen Theol. Quartalschrift, 1860, pp. 430-469). It is not
possible for any man to compass this literature. Aedner's Catalogue of
the Hebrew books in the Library of the British Museum, 1867, contains a
number of Jewish commentaries omitted by Ginsburg and Zckler, but far
from all. For example, the Commentary of Ahron B. Josef (for the first
time printed at Eupatoria, 1834) now lies before me, with those of Moses
Frankel (Dessau, 1809), and of Samuel David Luzzatto, in the journal,
Ozar Nechmad 1864. Regarding the literature of English interpretation,
see the American translation, by Tayler Lewis (1870), of Zckler's
Commentary. The catalogue there also is incomplete, for in 1873 a
Commentary by Thomas Pelham Dale appeared; and a Monograph on [Ecc
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md), under the title of The Dirge
of Coheleth, by the Orientalist C. Taylor, appeared in 1874. The fourth
volume of the Speaker's Commentary contains a Commentary on the Song by
Kingsbury, and on Ecclesiastes by W. T. Bullock, who strenuously
maintains its Solomonic authorship. The opinion that the book represents
the conflict of two voices, the voice of true wisdom and that of
pretended wisdom, has lately found advocates not only in a Hebrew
Commentary by Ephraim Hirsch (Warsaw, 1871), but also in the article
"Koheleth" by Schenkel in his Bibellexikon (vol. III, 1871). For the
history and refutation of this attempt to represent the book in the form
of a dialogue, we might refer to Zckler's Introd. to his Commentary.

The old translations have been referred to at length by Ginsburg.
Frederick Field, in his Hexapla (Poet. vol. 1867), has collected
together the fragments of the Greek translations. Ge. Janichs, in his
Animadversiones criticae (Breslau, 1871), has examined the Peshito of
Koheleth and Ruth; vid., with reference thereto, Nldeke's Anzeige in the
Liter. Centralblatt 1871, Nr. 49, and cf. Middeldorpf's Symbolae
exegetico-criticae ad librum Ecclesiastis, 1811. The text of the Graecus
Venetus lies before us now in a more accurate form than that by
Villoison (1784), in Gebhardt's careful edition of certain Venetian
manuscripts (Leipzig, Brockhaus 1874), containing this translation of
the O.T. books.
