### [Malachi Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md)

[Malachi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 3:1</span></span>

Coming of the Lord to judgment. [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md). "Behold, I send my messenger,
that he may prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, will
suddenly come to His temple, and the angel of the covenant, whom ye
desire; behold he comes, saith Jehovah of hosts." To the question, Where
is or remains the God of judgment? the Lord Himself replies that He will
suddenly come to His temple, but that before His coming He will send a
messenger to prepare the way for Him. The announcement of this messenger
rests upon the prophecy in [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md).,
as the expression וּפנּה דרך, which is borrowed from that passage,
clearly shows. The person whose voice Isaiah heard calling to make the
way of Jehovah in the desert, that the glory of the Lord might be
revealed to all flesh, is here described as מלאך, whom Jehovah will send
before Him, i.e., before His coming. This maleâkh is not a heavenly
messenger, or spiritual being (Rashi, Kimchi), nor the angel of Jehovah
κατ ̓ ἐξοχήν, who is mentioned afterwards and called maleakh habberı̄th,
but an earthly messenger of the Lord, and indeed the same who is called
the prophet Elijah in [Mal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md), and
therefore not "an ideal person, viz., the whole choir of divine
messengers, who are to prepare the way for the coming of salvation, and
open the door for the future grace" (Hengst.), but a concrete
personality - a messenger who was really sent to the nation in John the
Baptist immediately before the coming of the Lord. The idea view is
precluded not only by the historical fact, that not a single prophet
arose in Israel during the whole period between Malachi and John, but
also by the context of the passage before us, according to which the
sending of the messenger was to take place immediately before the coming
of the Lord to His temple. It is true that in [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md) the priest is also called a
messenger of Jehovah; but the expression הנני שׁלח (behold I send)
prevents our understanding the term maleâkh as referring to the priests,
or even as including them, inasmuch as "sending" would not apply to the
priests as the standing mediators between the Lord and His people.
Moreover, it was because the priests did not fulfil their duty as the
ordinary ambassadors of God that the Lord was about to send an
extraordinary messenger. Preparing the way (פּנה דרך, an expression
peculiar to Isaiah: compare [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md);
also, [Isa 57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014.md) and [Isa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010).md), by clearing away the
impediments lying in the road, denotes the removal of all that retards
the coming of the Lord to His people, i.e., the taking away of enmity to
God and of ungodliness by the preaching of repentance and the conversion
of sinners. The announcement of this messenger therefore implied, that
the nation in its existing moral condition was not yet prepared for the
reception of the Lord, and therefore had no ground for murmuring at the
delay of the manifestation of the divine glory, but ought rather to
murmur at its own sin and estrangement from God. When the way shall have
been prepared, the Lord will suddenly come. פּתאם, not statim,
immediately (Jerome), but unexpectedly. "This suddenness is repeated in
all the acts and judgments of the Lord. The Lord of glory always comes
as a thief in the night to those who sleep in their sins" (Schmieder).
"The Lord" (hâ'âdōn) is God; this is evident both from the fact that He
comes to His temple, i.e., the temple of Jehovah, and also from the
relative clause "whom ye seek," which points back to the question,
"Where is the God of judgment?" ([Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017).md). The Lord comes to His temple
(hēkhâl, lit., palace) as the God-king of Israel, to dwell therein for
ever (cf. [Eze 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md); [Eze
37:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026).md). And He comes as the angel
of the covenant, for whom the people are longing. The identity of the
angel of the covenant with the "Lord" (hâ'âdōn) is placed beyond the
reach of doubt by the parallelism of the clauses, and the notion is
thereby refuted that the "covenant angel" is identical with the person
previously mentioned as מלאכי (Hitzig, Maurer, etc.). This identity does
not indeed exclude a distinction of person; but it does exclude a
difference between the two, or the opinion that the angel of the
covenant is that mediator whom Isaiah had promised ([Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006).md) as the antitype of Moses, and
the mediator of a new, perfect, and eternally-enduring covenant relation
between God and Israel (Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i. p. 183). For it was
not for a second Moses that the people were longing, or for a mediator
of the new covenant, but for the coming of God to judgment. The coming
of the Lord to His temple is represented as a coming of the covenant
angel, with reference to the fact that Jehovah had in the olden time
revealed His glory in His Maleakh in a manner perceptible to the senses,
and that in this mode of revelation He had not only redeemed Israel out
of the hand of Egypt ([Exo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006)..md), gone
before the army of Israel ([Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019).md), and led Israel through the
desert to Canaan ([Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md)., [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014)..md), but had also filled the
temple with His glory. The covenant, in relation to which the Maleakh,
who is of one essence with Jehovah, is here called the angel of the
covenant, is not the new covenant promised in [Jer
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md)., but the covenant of Jehovah
with Israel, according to which Jehovah dwells in the midst of Israel,
and manifests His gracious presence by blessing the righteous and
punishing the ungodly (cf. [Exo 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008.md);
[Lev 25:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#011.md); [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014)): (Koehler.md). The words "Behold
he (the covenant angel) cometh" serve to confirm the assurance, and are
still further strengthened by אמר יי צ (saith Jehovah of hosts). This
promise was fulfilled in the coming of Christ, in whom the angel of the
covenant, the Logos, became flesh, and in the sending of John the
Baptist, who prepared the way for Him. (See also at [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006).md)

[Malachi 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 3:2</span></span>

With the coming of the Lord the judgment will also begin; not the
judgment upon the heathen, however, for which the ungodly nation was
longing, but the judgment upon the godless members of the covenant
nation. [Mal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md). "And who endures the
day of His coming? and who can stand at His appearing? for He is like
the smelter's fire, and like washers' lye: [Mal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003.md). And will sit smelting and
purifying silver, and will purify the children of Levi, and refine like
gold and silver, that they may be offering to Jehovah His sacrifice in
righteousness. [Mal 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#004.md). And the
sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant, as in the days of the
olden time, and as in the years of the past." The question "who endures
the day" has a negative meaning, like מי in [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md) : no one endures it (for the fact
itself compare [Joe 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011).md). The prophet
is speaking to the ungodly. The second clause is synonymous. עמד, to
remain standing, in contrast with falling, or sinking under the burden
of the judgment. The reason for this is given in the second hemistich.
The Lord when He comes will be like a smelter's fire, which burns out
all the corrupt ingredients that are mixed with the gold and silver (cf.
[Zac 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009).md), and like the lye or
alkaline salt by which clothes are cleansed from dirt (cf. [Isa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004).md). The double figure has but one
meaning; hence only the first figure is carried out in [Mal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003.md), a somewhat different turn being
given to it, since the Lord is no longer compared to the fire, but
represented as a smelter. As a smelter purifies gold and silver from the
dross adhering to it, so will the Lord refine the sons of Levi, by whom
the priests are principally intended. The yâshabh (sit) serves as a
pictorial description, like ‛âmad (stand) in [Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md). The participles metsârēph and
metahēr describe the capacity in which He sits, viz., as a smelter and
purifier of silver. זקּק: to strain, or filter; a term transferred to
metals, because in smelting the pure metal is allowed to flow off, so
that the earthy ingredients are left in the crucible ([Psa
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007.md); [Job
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001), etc..md). The fact that the sons of
Levi are named, as the object of the refining action of the Lord, is to
be explained from what is mentioned in [Mal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006.md). concerning their degeneracy.
Since they, the supporters and promoters of the religious life of the
nation, were quite corrupt, the renovation of the national life must
begin with their purification. This purification, however, does not
consist merely in the fact, that the individuals who are displeasing to
God will be cut off from among them (Koehler), nor merely in their being
cleansed from the sins and crimes adhering to them (Hitzig), but in
both, so that those who are corrigible are improved, and the
incorrigible cut off. This is implied in the idea of purification, and
is confirmed by the result of the refining work of the Lord, as given in
the last clause of the verse. They are to become to the Lord offerers of
sacrifices in righteousness. Bitsedâqâh does not refer to the nature of
the sacrifices, viz., righteous sacrifices, i.e., such as correspond to
the law, but to the moral character of the offerers, viz., that they
will attend to the offering of sacrifice in a proper state of heart, as
in [Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md). היוּ מגּישׁי is a
constructio periphr. to denote the permanence of the action (cf. Ewald,
168, c). The tsaqeph-qaton does not compel us to separate היוּ ליהוה
(compare, on the contrary, [Gen 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006.md)
for example). Then, namely when the priests offer sacrifices in
righteousness again, will the sacrificing of the whole nation be
pleasant to the Lord, as was the case in the olden time. The days of the
olden time and years of the past are the times of Moses, or the first
years of the sojourn in the desert ([Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002).md), possibly also the times of David
and of the first years of the reign of Solomon; whereas now, i.e., in
the time of Malachi, the sacrifices of the nation were displeasing to
God, not merely on account of the sins of the people ([Mal
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#013).md), but chiefly on account of the
badness of the sacrificing priests ([Mal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#010.md), [Mal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013).md). Moreover, we must not infer
from [Mal 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003.md) and [Mal
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#004.md), that Malachi imagined that the
Old Testament worship would be continued during the Messianic times; but
his words are to be explained from the custom of the prophets, of using
the forms of the Old Testament worship to depict the reverence for God
which would characterize the new covenant.

[Malachi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 3:5</span></span>

[Mal 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005.md). "And I will draw near to you
to judgment, and will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and
against the adulterers, and against those who swear for deceit, and
those who press down the wages of the hireling, the widow and the
orphan, and bow down the foreigner, and fear not me, saith Jehovah of
hosts. [Mal 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md). For I Jehovah, I
change not; and ye sons of Israel, ye are not consumed." The refining
which the Lord will perform at His coming will not limit itself to the
priests, but become a judgment upon all sinners. This judgment is
threatened against those who wanted the judgment of God to come,
according to [Mal 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md). To these the
Lord will draw near to judgment, and rise up as a swift witness against
all the wicked who do not fear Him. The word קרבתּי does not imply that
the judgment announced will actually commence at once. The drawing near
to judgment takes place in the day of His coming ([Mal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002).md), and this is preceded by the
sending of the messenger to prepare the way. The words affirm nothing as
to the time of the coming, because this was not revealed to the prophet.
Nor is there any intimation on this point in the word ממהר, but simply
the announcement that the Lord will come with unexpected rapidity, in
contrast with the murmuring of the people at the delay of judgment ([Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017).md). ממהר answers substantially to
פּתאם in [Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md). God comes as a
practical witness against the wicked, convicting them of their guilt by
punishing them. The particular sins mentioned here are such as were
grievous sins in the eye of the law, and to some extent were punishable
with death. On sorcerers and adulterers see [Exo
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#017.md); [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md); [Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md). That sorcery was very common
among the Jews after the captivity, is evident from such passages as
[Act 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009.md); [Act
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#006.md), and from Josephus, Ant. xx. 6,
de bell. Jud. ii. 12, 23; and the occurrence of adultery may be inferred
from the condemnation of the marriages with heathen wives in [Mal
2:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md). On false swearing compare
[Lev 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012.md). The expression to press
the wages of the labourer is unusual, since the only other passage in
which עשׁק is construed with a neuter object is [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002.md), and in every other case it is
applied to persons; for עשׁק שׂכיר compare [Lev
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#013.md) and [Deu
24:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014.md), to which the reproof refers.
אלמנה ויתום are not genitives dependent upon שׂכר, but further objects
to עשׁקי. For the fact itself compare [Exo
22:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021.md); [Deu
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017.md); [Deu
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#019.md). To מטּי גר we are not to supply
משׁפּט, after [Deu 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017.md) and [Deu
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#019.md); but הטּה is used of the person
as in [Amo 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012.md) : to bow down the
stranger, i.e., to oppress him unjustly. The words, "and fear not me,"
point to the source from which all these sins flowed, and refer to all
the sinners mentioned before. This threat of judgment is explained in
[Mal 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md) in the double clause: that
Jehovah does not change, and the sons of Israel do not perish. Because
Jehovah is unchangeable in His purposes, and Israel as the people of God
is not to perish, therefore will God exterminate the wicked out of
Israel by means of judgment, in order to refine it and shape it
according to its true calling. The perfects are used to express
established truths. The unchangeableness of God is implied in the name
Jehovah, "who is that He is," the absolutely independent and absolutely
existing One (see at [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004).md). For
the fact itself compare [Num 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md);
[Sa1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029.md); [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md). Jehovah is in apposition to 'ănı̄
(I), and not a predicate in the sense of "I am Jehovah" (Luther,
Hengstenberg, etc.); this is evident from the parallel ואתּם בּני יעקב
(and ye, the sons of Jacob), where no one thinks of taking בני יעק (sons
of Jacob) as a predicate. Kâlâh, to come to an end, to be destroyed, as
the parallel passage, [Jer 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md),
which floated before the prophet's mind, clearly shows. The name "sons
of Jacob" (poetical for sons of Israel) is used emphatically, denoting
the true members of the people of God, who rightly bear the name of
Israel. These do not perish, because their existence rests upon the
promise of the unchangeable God (cf. [Rom
11:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028).md).

[Malachi 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mal 3:7</span></span>

After the Lord has announced to the murmuring people that He will
suddenly draw near to judgment upon the wicked, He proceeds to explain
the reason why He has hitherto withheld His blessing and His salvation.
[Mal 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007.md). "From the days of your
fathers ye have departed from mine ordinances, and have not kept them.
Return to me, and I will return to you, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye
say, Wherein shall we return? [Mal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md). Dare a man indeed defraud God,
that ye have defrauded me? and ye say, In what have we defrauded Thee?
In the tithes and the heave-offering. [Mal
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#009.md). Ye are cursed with the curse, and
yet ye defraud me, even the whole nation." The reason why Israel waits
in vain for the judgment and the salvation dawning with it, is not to be
found in God, but in the people, in the fact, that from time immemorial
they have transgressed the commandments of God (see [Isa
43:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#027.md); [Eze
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003.md); [Hos
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009).md). And yet they regard themselves
as righteous. They reply to the call to repentance by saying, בּמּה
נשׁוּב, wherein, i.e., in what particular, shall we turn? The prophet
thereupon shows them their sin: they do what no man should presume to
attempt - they try to defraud God in the tithe and heave-offering,
namely, by either not paying them at all, or not paying them as they
should into the house of God. קבע, which only occurs here and at [Pro
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#023.md), signifies to defraud, to
overreach. המּעשׂר וגתר is either an accusative of free subordination,
or else we must supply the preposition ב from the question itself. On
the tithe see [Lev 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md)., [Num
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md)., and [Deu
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md). (see also my Bibl. Ant. i. p.
337ff.); and on the heave-offering (terūmâh), the portion of his income
lifted off from the rest, for the purposes of divine worship, see my
Bibl. Ant. i. p. 245. And this they do, notwithstanding the fact that
God has already visited them with severe punishment, viz., with the
curse of barrenness and of the failure of the harvest. We may see from
[Mal 3:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md), that the curse with
which they were smitten consisted in this. ואתי is adversative: yet ye
defraud me, and indeed the whole nation, and not merely certain
individuals.

[Malachi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mal 3:10</span></span>

[Mal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md). "Bring ye all the tithe
into the treasure-house, that there may be consumption in my house, and
prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I do not open you the
sluices of heaven, and pour you out a blessing to superabundance. [Mal
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#011.md). And I will rebuke the devourer
for you, that he may not destroy the fruit of your ground; and your vine
will not miscarry in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts. [Mal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#012.md). And all nations will call you
blessed; for ye will be a land of good pleasure, saith Jehovah of
hosts." In [Mal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md) the emphasis lies
upon kol: the whole of the tithe they are to bring, and not merely a
portion of it, and so defraud the Lord; for the tithe was paid to
Jehovah for His servants the Levites ([Num
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#024).md). It was delivered, at least
after the times of the later kings, at the sanctuary, where
store-chambers were built for the purpose (cf. [Ch2
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#011.md).; [Neh
10:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#038.md); [Neh
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044.md); [Neh
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#012).md). Tereph signifies here food, or
consumption, as in [Pro 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#015.md); [Psa
111:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#005.md). בּזאת, through this, i.e.,
through their giving to God what they are under obligation to give Him,
they are to prove God, whether in His attitude towards them He is no
longer the holy and righteous God ([Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md); [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006).md). Then will they also learn, that
He causes the promised blessing to flow in the richest abundance to
those who keep His commandments. אם לא is not a particle of asseveration
or oath (Koehler), but an indirect question: whether not. Opening the
sluices of heaven is a figure, denoting the most copious supply of
blessing, so that it flows down from heaven like a pouring rain (as in
[Kg2 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#002).md). עד בּלי די, till there is
no more need, i.e., in superabundance. This thought is individualized in
[Mal 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#011.md). Everything that could
injure the fruits of the land God will take away. גּער, to rebuke
practically, i.e., to avert the intention. אכל, the devourer, is here
the locust, so called from its insatiable voracity. Shikkēl, to
miscarry, is affirmed of the vine, when it has set a good quantity of
grapes, which perish and drop off before they ripen. In consequence of
this blessing, all nations will call Israel blessed ([Mal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#012).md), because its land will be an
object of pleasure to every one (cf. [Zac
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md); [Zac
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013.md), [Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023).md).

[Malachi 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mal 3:13</span></span>

The impatient murmuring of the nation. - [Mal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#013.md). "Your words do violence to me,
saith Jehovah; and ye say, What do we converse against Thee? [Mal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md). Ye say, It is vain to serve God;
and what gain is it, that we have kept His guard, and have gone about in
deep mourning before Jehovah of hosts? [Mal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015.md). And now we call the proud
blessed: not only have the doers of wickedness been built up, but they
have also tempted God and have been saved." After the Lord has disclosed
to the people the cause of His withholding His blessing, He shows them
still further, that their murmuring against Him is unjust, and that the
coming day of judgment will bring to light the distinction between the
wicked and those who fear God. חזק with על, to be strong over any one,
does not mean to be harsh or burdensome, but to do violence to a person,
to overpower him (cf. [Exo 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#033.md); [Sa2
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#004), etc..md). The niphal nidbar has a
reciprocal meaning, to converse with one another (cf. [Eze
33:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030).md). The conversations which they
carry on with one another take this direction, that it is useless to
serve God, because the righteous have no advantage over sinners. For
שׁמר משׁמרתּו see the comm. on [Gen
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#005.md). Hâlakh qedōrannı̄th, to go about
dirty or black, either with their faces and clothes unwashed, or wrapped
in black mourning costume (saq), is a sign of mourning, here of fasting,
as mourning for sin (cf. [Psa
35:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013.md); [Psa
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#007.md); [Job
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#028); 1 Maccabees 3:48.md). מפּני יהוה,
from awe of Jehovah. The fasting, and that in its external form, they
bring into prominence as a special sign of their piety, as an act of
penitence, through which they make reparation for certain sins against
God, by which we are not to understand the fasting prescribed for the
day of atonement, but voluntary fasting, which was regarded as a special
sign of piety. What is reprehensible in the state of mind expressing
itself in these words, is not so much the complaint that their piety
brings them no gain (for such complaints were uttered even by believing
souls in their hours of temptation; cf. [Psa
73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013).md), as the delusion that their
merely outward worship, which was bad enough according to what has
already been affirmed, is the genuine worship which God must acknowledge
and reward. This disposition to attribute worth to the opus operatum of
fasting it attacked even by Isaiah, in [Isa
58:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md); but after the captivity it
continued to increase, until it reached its culminating point in
Pharisaism. How thoroughly different the persons speaking here are from
the believing souls under temptation, who also appeal to their
righteousness when calling upon God in their trouble, is especially
clear from their further words in [Mal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015.md). Because God does not reward
their fasting with blessing and prosperity, they begin to call the proud
sinners, who have happiness and success, blessed. ועתּה is the particle
of inference. The participle מאשּׁרים has the force of a futurum instans
(cf. Ewald, 306, d), denoting what men prepare to do. Zēdı̄m, the haughty
or proud, are the heathen, as in [Isa
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011.md), who are called עשׂי רשׁעה in
the following clause. The next two clauses are placed in a reciprocal
relation to one another by gam ... gam (cf. [Jer
12:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#016.md); [Exo
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#021).md), and also, notwithstanding the
fact that they have tempted God, are delivered when they fall into
misfortune. Bâchan Elohim, to prove or test God, i.e., to call out His
judgment through their wickedness.

[Malachi 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mal 3:16</span></span>

With these foolish speeches the prophet proceeds in [Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016.md). to contrast the conduct of those
who fear God, pointing to the blessing which they derive from their
piety. [Mal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016.md). "Then those who
feared Jehovah conversed with one another, and Jehovah attended and
heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for those who
fear Jehovah and reverence His name. [Mal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017.md). And they will be to me as a
possession, saith Jehovah of hosts, for the day that I create, and I
will spare them as a man spareth his son that serveth him. [Mal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018.md). And ye will again perceive the
difference between the righteous and the wicked, between him that
serveth God and him that serveth Him not." אז, then, indicates that the
conversation of those who feared God had been occasioned by the words of
the ungodly. The substance of this conversation is not described more
minutely, but may be gathered from the context, namely, from the
statement as to the attitude in which Jehovah stood towards them. We may
see from this, that they strengthened themselves in their faith in
Jehovah, as the holy God and just Judge who would in due time repay both
the wicked and the righteous according to their deeds, and thus
presented a great contrast to the great mass with their blasphemous
sayings. This description of the conduct of the godly is an indirect
admonition to the people, as to what their attitude towards God ought to
be. What was done by those who feared Jehovah ought to be taken as a
model by the whole nation which called Jehovah its God. Jehovah not only
took notice of these conversations, but had them written in a book of
remembrance, to reward them for them in due time. Writing in a book of
remembrance recals to mind the custom of the Persians, of having the
names of those who deserved well of the king entered in a book with a
notice of their merits, that they might be rewarded for them at some
future time ([Est 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001).md); but it rests
upon the much older idea, that the names and actions of the righteous
are written in a book before God (cf. [Psa
56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009.md); [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010).md). This book was written לפניו,
before Jehovah, i.e., not in His presence, but in order that it might
lie before Jehovah, and remind Him of the righteous and their deeds.
ליראי is a dat. com.: "for those who fear God," i.e., for their good.
חשׁב שׁם, to consider or value the name of the Lord (cf. [Isa
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017.md); [Isa
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008).md). This writing was done because
the Lord would make them His own on the day of His coming, and show them
mercy. Layyōm: for the day = on the day; the lamed denoting the time, as
in [Isa 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003.md); [Gen
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002.md), etc. The day which Jehovah makes
is the day of the judgment which attends His coming. Segullâh is the
object, not to ‛ōseh, as we might suppose according to the accents, but
to hâyū: they will be my possession on the day which I create. This is
evident partly from a comparison of [Mal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003.md), where the words יום אשׁר אני עשׂה
recur, and partly from the original passage in [Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md) : ye will be to me segullâh,
i.e., a valued possession (see the comm.). The righteous will then be a
possession for Jehovah, because on that day the glory of the children of
God will first be revealed, and the Israel of God will reach the mark of
its heavenly calling (see [Col 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004).md).
The Lord will spare them in the judgment as a father spares his son who
serves him. The expression to spare may be explained from the contrast
to the punishment of the ungodly. In [Mal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018.md) the prophet bids the murmurers
consider what has been said concerning the righteous, by telling them
that they will then see the difference between the righteous who serve
God, and the wicked who do not serve Him, that is to say, will learn
that it is always profitable to serve God. שׁבתּם before ראיתם is to be
taken adverbially: ye will see again. The expression "again" presupposes
that the difference between those who feared God and the ungodly was to
be seen before, and that the Lord had already made it manifest by former
judgments. This had been the case in Egypt, where the Lord had caused
such a separation to be made ([Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007).md). The words do not imply that the
persons addressed had previously stood in a different relation to this
question from that in which they were standing then (Koehler). ראה בין
does not mean to look in between (Hitzig), but בּין is used in the sense
of a substantive, signifying that which is between the two, the
difference between the two. That בּין was originally a noun is evident
from the dual הבּינים in [Sa1 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#004.md),
[Sa1 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#023.md).
