Jephthah Elected as Prince; Negotiations with the Ammonites; Victory,
Vow, and Office of Judge - Judges 11-12:7

(Note: On the nature of the sources from which the author drew this
tolerably elaborate history of Jephthah, all that can be determined with
certainty is, that they sprang from some contemporary of this judge,
since they furnish so clear and striking a picture of his life and
doings. Bertheau's hypothesis, that the section extending from [Jdg
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012.md) to [Jdg
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#028.md) is founded upon some historical
work, which is also employed in Num 21; Deut 2:1-3:29, and here and
there in the book of Joshua, has really no other foundation than the
unproved assumption that the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua were
written towards the close of the period of the kings. For the marked
agreement between Jephthah's negotiations with the king of the Ammonites
concerning the possession of the land to the east of the Jordan, and the
account given in the Pentateuch, especially in Num 20-21, may be
explained very simply and very perfectly, on the supposition that the
author possessed the Pentateuch itself. And the account which is wanting
in the Pentateuch, namely, that Israel petitioned the king of Moab also
for permission to go through his land ([Jdg
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#017).md), may have bee added from oral
tradition, as those glorious victories gained by Israel under Moses were
celebrated in verse by contemporaneous poets (see [Num
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014.md), [Num
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017.md), [Num
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027).md); and this certainly contributed
not a little to keep alive the memory of those events in the nation for
centuries long.)

[Judges 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 11:1</span></span>

Election of Jephthah as Prince and Judge of Israel. - [Jdg
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md). The account begins with his
descent and early mode of life. "Jephthah (lxx Ἰεφθά) the Gileadite was
a brave hero" (see [Jdg 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#012.md); [Jos
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014), etc..md); but he was the son of a
harlot, and was begotten by Gilead, in addition to other sons who were
born of his wife. Gilead is not the name of the country, as Bertheau
supposes, so that the land is mythically personified as the forefather
of Jephthah. Nor is it the name of the son of Machir and grandson of
Manasseh ([Num 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029).md), so that the
celebrated ancestor of the Gileadites is mentioned here instead of the
unknown father of Jephthah. It is really the proper name of the father
himself; and just as in the case of Tola and Puah, in [Jdg
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md), the name of the renowned
ancestor was repeated in his descendant. We are forced to this
conclusion by the fact that the wife of Gilead, and his other sons by
that wife, are mentioned in [Jdg 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#002.md).
These sons drove their half-brother Jephthah out of the house because of
his inferior birth, that he might not share with them in the paternal
inheritance; just as Ishmael and the sons of Keturah were sent away by
Abraham, that they might not inherit along with Isaac ([Gen
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md)., [Gen
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006).md).

[Judges 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 11:3</span></span>

Jephthah departed from his brothers into the land of Tob, i.e.,
according to [Sa2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md), [Sa2
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#008.md), a district in the north-east of
Perea, on the border of Syria, or between Syria and Ammonitis, called
Τώβιον in 1 Macc. 5:13, or more correctly Τουβίν, according to 2 Macc.
12:17, where loose men gathered round him (cf. [Jdg
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004).md), and "went out with him," viz.,
upon warlike and predatory expeditions like the Bedouins.

[Judges 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 11:4</span></span>

But when the Ammonites made war upon Israel some time afterwards, the
elders of Gilead (= "the princes of Gilead," [Jdg
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#018).md) went to fetch Jephthah out of
the land of Tob, to make this brave warrior their leader. In [Jdg
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#004.md) the account of the war between
the Ammonites and Israel, which is mentioned in [Jdg
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md), is resumed, and its progress
under Jephthah is then more fully described. "In process of time"
(מיּמים, a diebus, i.e., after the lapse of a long period, which cannot
be more precisely defined), sc., after the expulsion of Jephthah from
his home (see [Jdg 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#008.md); [Jdg
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#001.md); [Jos
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001).md). קצין signifies a leader in war
([Jos 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024).md), and is therefore
distinguished in [Jdg 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011.md) from ראשׁ,
a chief in peace and war.

[Judges 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 11:7</span></span>

Jephthah expressed to the elders his astonishment that they had formerly
hated and expelled him, and now came to him in their distress, sc., to
make him their leader in time of war. Thus he lays his expulsion upon
the shoulders of the elders of Gilead, although it was only by his
brethren that he had been driven away from his father's house, inasmuch
as they had either approved of it, or at all events had not interfered
as magistrates to prevent it. We cannot indeed infer from this reproach,
that the expulsion and disinheriting of Jephthah was a legal wrong; but
so much at all events is implied, namely, that Jephthah looked upon the
thing as a wrong that had been done to him, and found the reason in the
hatred of his brethren. The Mosaic law contained no regulation upon this
matter, since the rule laid down in [Deu
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015.md) simply applied to the sons of
different wives, and not to a son by a harlot.

[Judges 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 11:8</span></span>

The elders replied, "Therefore (לכן, because we have formerly done thee
wrong) we have now come to thee again to make thee our head, if thou
comest with us and fightest against the Ammonites." The clauses והלכתּ,
ונלהמתּ, and והיית, which are formally co-ordinate, are logically to be
subordinated to one another, the first two expressing the condition, the
third the consequence, in this sense, "If thou go with us and fight, ...
thou shalt be head to us, namely, to all the inhabitants of Gilead,"
i.e., to the two tribes and a half on the east of the Jordan.

[Judges 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 11:9</span></span>

Jephthah assented to this: "If ye will take me back to make war upon the
Ammonites, and Jehovah shall give them up to me (lit. 'before me,' as in
[Jos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md); [Deu
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#031), etc..md), I will be your head." "I"
is emphatic as distinguished from he; and there is no necessity to
regard the sentence as a question, with which the expression in [Jdg
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#010.md), "according to thy words," which
presuppose an affirmative statement on the part of Jephthah, and not a
question, would be altogether irreconcilable.

[Judges 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 11:10</span></span>

The elders promised this on oath. "Jehovah be hearing between us," i.e.,
be hearer and judge of the things concerning which we are negotiating;
"truly according to thy word so will we do" (לא אם, a particle used in
connection with an oath).

[Judges 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 11:11</span></span>

Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, "and the people (i.e., the
inhabitants of Gilead) made him head and captain, and Jephthah spoke all
his words before Jehovah at Mizpeh:" i.e., he repeated in a solemn
assembly of the people, before God at Mizpeh, the conditions and
obligations under which he would accept the honour conferred upon him.
"Before Jehovah" does not necessarily presuppose the presence of the ark
at Mizpeh; nor can we possibly assume this, since the war was resolved
upon primarily by the eastern tribes alone, and they had no ark at all.
It merely affirms that Jephthah performed this act, looking up to God,
the omnipresent head of Israel. Still less do the words warrant the
assumption that there was an altar in Mizpeh, and that sacrifices were
offered to confirm the treaty, of which there is not the slightest
indication in the text. "'Before Jehovah' implies nothing more than that
Jephthah confirmed all his words by an oath" (Hengstenberg, Diss. ii.
pp. 35, 36).

[Judges 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 11:12</span></span>

Jephthah's Negotiations with the King of the Ammonites. - [Jdg
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012.md). Before Jephthah took the sword,
he sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, to make complaints to
him of his invasion of the land of the Israelites. "What have we to do
with one another ('what to me and thee?' see [Jos
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#024.md); [Sa2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010).md), that thou hast come to me to
fight against my land?" Jephthah's ambassadors speak in the name of the
nation; hence the singulars "me" and "my land."

[Jdg 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md)

The king of the Ammonites replied, that when Israel came up out of
Egypt, they had taken away his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok (on the
north), and to the Jordan (on the west), and demanded that they should
now restore these lands in peace. The plural אתהן (them) refers ad
sensum to the cities and places in the land in question. The claim
raised by the king of the Ammonites has one feature in it, which appears
to have a certain colour of justice. The Israelites, it is true, had
only made war upon the two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, and
defeated them, and taken possession of their kingdoms and occupied them,
without attacking the Ammonites and Moabites and Edomites, because God
had forbidden their attacking these nations ([Deu
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#005.md), [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md),[Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019).md); but one portion of the
territory of Sihon had formerly been Moabitish and Ammonitish property,
and had been conquered by the Amorites and occupied by them. According
to [Num 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md), Sihon had made war upon
the previous king of Moab, and taken away all his land as far as the
Arnon (see the comm. on this passage). And although it is not expressly
stated in the Pentateuch that Sihon had extended his conquests beyond
Moabitis into the land of the Ammonites, which was situated to the east
of Moab, and had taken a portion of it from them, this is pretty clearly
indicated in [Jos 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025.md), since,
according to that passage, the tribe of Gad received in addition to
Jaezer and all the towns of Gilead, half the land of the children of
Ammon, namely, the land to the east of Gilead, on the western side of
the upper Jabbok (Nahr Ammn: see at [Jos
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026).md).

(Note: The explanation which Masius gives of this passage (Eatenus moao
sursum in Galaaditidem exporrectam jacuisse Gaditarum haereditatem,
quatenus dimidia Ammonitarum ditio Galaaditidem ab oriente ambiebat) is
not sufficiently in keeping with the words, and too unnatural, to be
regarded as correct, as it is by Reland (Pal. ill. p. 105) and
Hengstenberg (Dissertations on the Pentateuch, ii. p. 29); and the
reasons assigned by Masius, viz., "that the Israelites were prohibited
from occupying the land of the Ammonites," and "the Ammonites are not
mentioned in [Num 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md)," are too weak
to establish anything. The latter is an argumentum e silentio, which
loses all significance when we bear in mind, that even the allusion to
the land of the Moabites in [Num 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md)
is only occasioned by the prominence given to Heshbon, and the poetical
saying founded upon its fall. But the prohibition against taking the
land of the Ammonites from them had just as much force in relation to
the land of the Moabites, and simply referred to such land as these
tribes still possessed in the time of Moses, and not to that which the
Amorites had taken from them.)

[Jdg 11:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#014.md)

Jephthah then sent ambassadors again to explain to him the true state of
the case, namely, that Israel had neither taken away the land of Moab
nor the land of the Ammonites. As a proof of this, Jephthah adduced the
leading facts connected with the journey of the Israelites through the
desert of Arabia to Canaan, by which this assertion was confirmed, in
exact agreement with the accounts of the Pentateuch respecting the
matter in dispute.

[Jdg 11:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#016.md)

On leaving Egypt, Israel passed through the desert to the Red Sea, and
came to Kadesh ([Num 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001).md). They then
sent messengers to the king of Edom, to obtain permission to pass
through his land; and this the king of Edom refused ([Num
20:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014).md). They also sent to the king
of Moab, who sent back a similar refusal. The embassy to the king of
Moab is not mentioned in the Pentateuch, as it had no direct bearing
upon the further course of the Israelites (see Pentateuch, p. 741, note
1). "And Israel abode in Kadesh" (word for word, as in [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001).md), and "then passed through the
desert," namely to Mount Hor, then down the Arabah to the Red Sea, and
still farther past Oboth to Ijje-abarim in the desert (Num 20:22-21:11).
In this way they went round the land of Edom and the land of Moab (יסב,
like סבב in [Num 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004).md); and came from
the east to the land of Moab (i.e., along the eastern boundary, for
Ijje-abarim was situated there, according to [Num
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#011).md); and encamped on the other side
of the Arnon ([Num 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013).md), i.e., on
the upper course of the Arnon where it still flows through the desert
(see Pent. p. 749). On this march, therefore, they did not enter the
territory of Moab, as the Arnon formed the boundary of Moab, i.e., the
boundary between Moab and the territory of the Amorites ([Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013).md).

[Jdg 11:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#019.md)

[Jdg 11:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#019.md) are almost verbatim the
same as [Num 21:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md). Israel then
sent messengers to Sihon the king of the Amorites at Heshbon, to ask
permission to pass through his land. "Into my place," i.e., into the
land of Canaan, that Jehovah has appointed for me. But Sihon "trusted
not Israel to pass through his land," i.e., he did not trust to the
assurance of Israel that they only wanted to pass peaceably through his
land, but supposed the petition to cover an intention to take forcible
possession of it. (In [Num 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023.md) we
have נתן לא instead of האמין לא.) He did not confine himself, therefore,
to a refusal of the permission they asked for, but collected his men of
war, and marched against the Israelites to the desert as far as Jahza,
on the east of Medeba and Dibon (see at [Num
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023).md), and fought with them. But he
was defeated, and lost all his land, from the Arnon (Mojeb) on the south
to the Jabbok (Zerka) on the north, and from the desert on the east to
the Jordan on the west, of which the Israelites took possession.

[Jdg 11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#023.md)

From these facts Jephthah drew this simple but indisputable conclusion:
"Jehovah the God of Israel has rooted out the Amorites before His people
Israel, and thou wilt take possession of it (viz., the land of the
Amorites)." The suffix to תּירשׁנּוּ refers to האמרי, the Amorites,
i.e., their land. The construction of ירשׁ with the accusative of the
people (as in [Deu 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012.md), [Deu
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#021.md); [Deu
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001).md) may be explained on the simple
ground, that in order to take possession of a country, it is necessary
first of all to get the holders of it into your power. Jephthah then
proved still further how unwarrantable the claim of the king of the
Ammonites was, and said to him ([Jdg
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024).md), "Is it not the fact (הלא,
nonne), that what thy god Chemosh gives thee for a possession, of that
thou takest possession; and all that Jehovah makes ownerless before us,
of that we take possession?" - an appeal the validity of which could not
be disputed. For Chemosh, see at [Num
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029.md). The verb הורישׁ combines the
three meanings: to drive out of a possession, to deprive of a possessor,
and to give for a possession; inasmuch as it is impossible to give a
land for a possession without driving away or exterminating its former
possessor.

[Jdg 11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#025.md)

But not contenting himself with this conclusive deduction, Jephthah
endeavoured to remove the lost appearance of right from the king's claim
by a second and equally conclusive argument. "And now art thou better
than Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab? Did he strive (רוב, inf.
abs. of ריב or רוּב) with Israel, or did he fight against them?" By the
repetition of ועתּה ([Jdg 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#025.md), cf.
[Jdg 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#023).md), the new argument is
attached to the previous one, as a second deduction from the facts
already described. Balak, the king of the Moabites, had indeed bribed
Balaam to destroy Israel by his curses; but he did so not so much with
the intention of depriving them of the territory of the Amorites which
they had conquered, as from the fear that the powerful Israelites might
also conquer his still remaining kingdom. Balak had neither made war
upon Israel on account of the territory which they had conquered from
the Amorites, nor had he put forward any claim to it as his own
property, which he certainly might have done with some appearance of
justice, as a large portion of it had formerly belonged to the Moabites
(see [Num 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md) and the comm. on this
passage). If therefore Balak the king of the Moabites never thought of
looking upon this land as being still his property, or of asking it back
from the Israelites, the king of the Ammonites had no right whatever to
lay claim to the land of Gilead as belonging to him, or to take it away
from the Israelites by force, especially after the lapse of 300 years.
"As Israel dwells in Heshbon, ... and in all the cities by the side of
the Arnon for three hundred years, why have ye not taken away (these
towns and lands) within that time" (i.e., during these 300 years)? If
the Ammonites had had any right to it, they ought to have asserted their
claim in Moses' time. It was much too late now, after the expiration of
300 years. For "if no prescriptive right is to be admitted, on account
of length of time, and if long possession gives no title, nothing would
ever be held in safety by any people, and there would be no end to wars
and dissension" (Clericus). On Heshbon and its daughters, see at [Num
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025.md). Aror (ערעור, another form for
ערער, or possibly only a copyist's error) is Aror of Gad, before Rabbah
([Jos 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025).md), and is to be sought for
in the Wady Nahr Ammn, on the north-east of Ammn (see at Josh. l. c.),
not Aror of Reuben, on the border of the valley of Arnon ([Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md); [Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md); [Deu
4:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#048.md); [Jos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002.md); [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009).md). This is evident from the fact,
that it is distinguished from "all the cities on the side (ידי על, see
at [Num 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003).md) of the Arnon," which
included Aror of Reuben. Aror of Gad, with its daughter towns, was
probably Ammonitish territory before the time of Sihon. On the 300
years, a round number that comes very near the reality, see the Chronol.
p. 285.

[Jdg 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#027.md)

After Jephthah had adduced all that could be said, to prove that the
Israelites were the rightful possessors of the land of Gilead,

(Note: "Jephthah urged everything that could be pleaded in support of
their prescriptive right: possession, length of time, the right of
conquest, and undisputed occupation." - Rosenmller.)

he closed with these words: "I (i.e., Israel, whose cause Jephthah was
pleading) have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong in that
thou makest war against me. Let Jehovah the Judge be judge this day
(now) between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon." God
should decide between the two nations, by giving the victory in war to
the side whose cause was the just one.

[Jdg 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#028.md)

But the king of the Ammonites did not hearken to the words of Jephthah
"which he had sent to him," i.e., had instructed his messengers to
address to him; so that it was necessary that Jehovah should decide for
Israel in battle.

[Judges 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 11:29</span></span>

Jephthah's Victory over the Ammonites. - As the negotiations with the
king of the Ammonites were fruitless, Jephthah had no other course left
than to appeal to the sword.

[Jdg 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md)

In the power of the Spirit of Jehovah which came upon him (see [Jdg
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010).md), he passed through Gilead (the
land of the tribes of Reuben and Gad between the Arnon and the Jabbok)
and Manasseh (northern Gilead and Bashan, which the half tribe of
Manasseh had received for a possession), to gather together an army to
battle, and then went with the assembled army to Mizpeh-Gilead, i.e.,
Ramoth-mizpeh, where the Israelites had already encamped before his call
([Jdg 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017).md), that he might thence
attach the Ammonites. עבר (to pass over) with an accusative signifies to
come over a person in a hostile sense.

[Jdg 11:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#030.md)

Before commencing the war, however, he vowed a vow to the Lord: "If Thou
givest the Ammonites into my hand, he who cometh to meet me out of the
doors of my house, when I return safely (in peace, shalom) from the
Ammonites, shall belong to the Lord, and I will offer him for a
burnt-offering." By the words אשׁר היּוצא, "he that goeth out," even if
Jephthah did not think "only of a man, or even more definitely still of
some one of his household," he certainly could not think in any case of
a head of cattle, or one of his flock. "Going out of the doors of his
house to meet him" is an expression that does not apply to a herd or
flock driven out of the stall just at the moment of his return, or to
any animal that might possibly run out to meet him. For the phrase לקראת
יצא is only applied to men in the other passages in which it occurs.

(Note: Augustine observes in his Quaest. xlix. in l. Jud.: "He did not
vow in these words that he would offer some sheep, which he might
present as a holocaust, according to the law. For it is not, and was
not, a customary thing for sheep to come out to meet a victorious
general returning from the war. Nor did he say, I will offer as a
holocaust whatever shall come out of the doors of my house to meet me;
but he says, 'Whoever comes out, I will offer him;' so that there can be
no doubt whatever that he had then a human being in his mind.")

Moreover, Jephthah no doubt intended to impose a very difficult vow upon
himself. And that would not have been the case if he had merely been
thinking of a sacrificial animal. Even without any vow, he would have
offered, not one, but many sacrifices after obtaining a victory.

(Note: "What kind of vow would it be if some great prince or general
should say, 'O God, if Thou wilt give me this victory, the first calf
that meets me shall be Thine!' Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus
mus!" - Pfeiffer, dubia vex. p. 356.)

If therefore he had an animal sacrifice in his mind, he would certainly
have vowed the best of his flocks. From all this there can be no doubt
that Jephthah must have been thinking of some human being as at all
events included in his vow; so that when he declared that he would
dedicate that which came out of his house to meet him, the meaning of
the vow cannot have been any other than that he would leave the choice
of the sacrifice to God himself. "In his eagerness to smite the foe, and
to thank God for it, Jephthah could not think of any particular object
to name, which he could regard as great enough to dedicate to God; he
therefore left it to accident, i.e., to the guidance of God, to
determine the sacrifice. He shrank from measuring what was dearest to
God, and left this to God himself" (P. Cassel in Herzog's Real-encycl.).
Whomsoever God should bring to meet him, he would dedicate to Jehovah,
and indeed, as is added afterwards by way of defining it more precisely,
he would offer him to the Lord as a burnt-offering. The ו before
העליתיהוּ is to be taken as explanatory, and not as disjunctive in the
sense of "or," which ו never has. But whether Jephthah really thought of
his daughter at the time, cannot be determined either in the affirmative
or negative. If he did, he no doubt hoped that the Lord would not demand
this hardest of all sacrifices.

[Jdg 11:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#032.md)

After seeking to ensure the help of the Lord by this vow, he went
against the Ammonites to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them
into his hand, so that Jephthah smote them in a very great slaughter
"from Aror (or Nahr Ammn; see [Jdg
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#026).md) to the neighbourhood of ('till
thou come to;' see at [Gen 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#019).md)
Minnith, (conquering and taking) twenty cities, and to Abel Keramim (of
the vineyards)." Minnith, according to the Onom. (s. v. Mennith), was a
place called Manith in the time of Eusebius, four Roman miles from
Heshbon on the road to Philadelphia, with which the account given by
Buckingham of the ruins of a large city a little to the east of Heshbon
may be compared (see v. Raum. Pal. p. 265). The situation of Abel
Keramim (plain of the vineyards: Luther and Eng. Ver.) cannot be
determined with the same certainty. Eusebius and Jerome mention two
places of this name (Onom. s. v. Abel vinearum), a villa Abela vinetis
consita (κώμη ἀμπελοφόρος Ἄβελ) seven Roman miles from Philadelphia, and
a civitas nomine Abela vini fertilis twelve Roman miles to the east of
Gadara, and therefore in the neighbourhood of the Mandhur. Which of the
two is referred to here remains uncertain, as we have no precise details
concerning the battle. If the northern Abela should be meant, Jephthah
would have pursued the foe first of all towards the south to the
neighbourhood of Heshbon, and then to the north to the border of Bashan.
Through his victory the Ammonites were completely subdued before the
Israelites.

Jephthah's Vow. - [Jdg 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md), [Jdg
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#035.md). When the victorious hero
returned to Mizpeh, his daughter came out to meet him "with timbrels and
in dances," i.e., at the head of a company of women, who received the
conqueror with joyous music and dances (see at [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020).md): "and she was the only one; he
had neither son nor daughter beside her." ממּנּוּ cannot mean ex se, no
other child of his own, though he may have had children that his wives
had brought him by other husbands; but it stands, as the great Masora
has pointed it, for ממּנּה, "besides her," the daughter just
mentioned-the masculine being used for the feminine as the nearest and
more general gender, simply because the idea of "child" was floating
before the author's mind. At such a meeting Jephthah was violently
agitated. Tearing his clothes (as a sign of his intense agony; see at
[Lev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006).md), he exclaimed, "O my
daughter! thou hast brought me very low; it is thou who troublest me"
(lit. thou art among those who trouble me, thou belongest to their
class, and indeed in the fullest sense of the word; this is the meaning
of the so-called בּ essentiae: see Ges. Lehrgeb. p. 838, and such
passages as [Sa2 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031.md); [Psa

to the Lord (i.e., have uttered a vow to Him: compare [Psa

30:3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003.md)., [Deu

revoke it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 11:36</span></span>

The daughter, observing that the vow had reference to her (as her father
in fact had, no doubt, distinctly told her, though the writer has passed
this over because he had already given the vow itself in [Jdg
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#031).md), replied, "Do to me as has gone
out of thy mouth (i.e., do to me what thou hast vowed), since Jehovah
has procured the vengeance upon thine enemies the Ammonites." She then
added ([Jdg 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#037).md), "Let this thing be
done for me (equivalent to, Let this only be granted me); let me alone
two months and I will go," i.e., only give me two months to go, "that I
may go down to the mountains (i.e., from Mizpeh, which stood upon an
eminence, to the surrounding mountains and their valleys) and bewail my
virginity, I and my friends." בּתוּלים does not mean "youth" (נעוּרים),
but the condition of virginity (see [Lev
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#013).md). The Kethibh רעיתי is a less
common form of רעותי (Keri).

At the end of two months she returned to her father again, "and he did
to her the vow that he had vowed, and she knew no man." I consequence of
this act of Jephthah and his daughter, "it became an ordinance (a
standing custom) in Israel: from year to year (see [Exo
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#010).md) the daughters of Israel go to
praise the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
תּנּה does not mean θρηνεῖν, to lament or bewail (lxx, Chald., etc.),
but to praise, as R. Tanchum and others maintain.

With regard to Jephthah's vow, the view expressed so distinctly by
Josephus and the Chaldee was the one which generally prevailed in the
earlier times among both Rabbins and fathers of the church, viz., that
Jephthah put his daughter to death and burned her upon the altar as a
bleeding sacrifice to Jehovah. It was not till the middle ages that Mos.
and Dav. Kimchi and certain other Rabbins endeavoured to establish the
view, that Jephthah merely dedicated his daughter to the service of the
sanctuary of Jehovah in a lifelong virginity. And lastly, Ludov.
Cappellus, in his Diatriba de voto Jephtae, Salm. 1683 (which has been
reprinted in his Notae critic. in Jud. xvi., and the Critici Sacri, tom.
i.), has expressed the opinion that Jephthah put his daughter to death
in honour of the Lord according to the law of the ban, because human
beings were not allowed to be offered up as burnt-sacrifices. Of these
different opinions the third has no foundation in the text of the Bible.
For supposing that Jephthah had simply vowed that on his return he would
offer to the Lord whatever came to meet him out of his house, with such
restrictions only as were involved in the very nature of the case -
viz., offering it as a burnt-offering if it were adapted for this
according to the law; and if it were not, then proceeding with it
according to the law of the ban, - the account of the fulfilment of this
vow would certainly have defined with greater precision the manner in
which he fulfilled the vow upon his daughter. The words "he did to her
his vow which he had vowed," cannot be understood in any other way than
that he offered her as עולה, i.e., as a burnt-offering, to the Lord.
Moreover, the law concerning the ban and a vow of the ban could not
possibly give any individual Israelite the right to ban either his own
child or one of his household to the Lord, without opening a very wide
door to the crime of murder. The infliction of the ban upon any man
presupposed notorious wickedness, so that burnt-offering and ban were
diametrically opposed the one to the other. Consequently the other two
views are the only ones which can be entertained, and it is not easy to
decide between them. Although the words "and I offer him as a
burnt-offering" appear to favour the actual sacrifice so strongly, that
Luther's marginal note, "some affirm that he did not sacrifice her, but
the text is clear enough," is perpetually repeated with peculiar
emphasis; yet, on looking more closely into the matter, we find
insuperable difficulties in the way of the literal interpretation of the
words. Since יצא אשׁר היּוצא cannot be taken impersonally, and therefore
when Jephthah uttered his vow, he must at any rate have had the
possibility of some human being coming to meet him in his mind; and
since the two clauses "he shall be the Lords," and "I will offer him up
for a burnt-offering," cannot be taken disjunctively in such a sense as
this, it shall either be dedicated to the Lord, or, if it should be a
sacrificial animal, I will offer it up as a burnt-offering, but the
second clause simply contains a more precise definition of the
first-Jephthah must at the very outset have contemplated the possibility
of a human sacrifice. Yet not only were human sacrifices prohibited in
the law under pain of death as an abomination in the sight of Jehovah
([Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md); [Lev
20:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md); [Deu
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031.md); [Deu
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010).md), but they were never heard of
among the Israelites in the early times, and were only transplanted to
Jerusalem by the godless kings Ahaz and Manasseh.

(Note: "Human sacrifices do not even belong to heathenism generally, but
to the darkest night of heathenism. They only occur among those nations
which are the most thoroughly depraved in a moral and religious sense."
This remark of Hengstenberg (Diss. iii. p. 118) cannot be set aside by a
reference to Euseb. praep. ev. iv. 16; Baur, Symb. ii. 2, pp. 293ff.;
Lasaulx, Shnopfer der Griechen und Rmer, 1841, pp. 8-12; Ghillany, die
Menschenopfer der alten Hebrer, 1842, pp. 107ff., as Kurtz supposes,
since the uncritical character of the proofs collected together in these
writings is very obvious on a closer inspection, and Eusebius has simply
taken his examples from Porphyry, and other writings of a very recent
date.)

If Jephthah therefore vowed that he would offer a human sacrifice to
Jehovah, he must either have uttered his vow without any reflection, or
else have been thoroughly depraved in a moral and religious sense. But
what we know of this brave hero by no means warrants any such
assumptions, His acts do not show the slightest trace of impetuosity and
rashness. He does not take to the sword at once, but waits till his
negotiations with the king of the Ammonites have been without effect.
Nor does he utter his vow in the midst of the confusion of battle, so
that we might fancy he had made a vow in the heat of the conflict
without fully weighting his words, but he uttered it before he set out
against the Ammonites (see [Jdg 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#030.md)
and [Jdg 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#032).md). So far as the
religious training of Jephthah was concerned, it is true that he had led
the life of a freebooter during his exile from his country and home, and
before his election as the leader of the Israelites; but the analogous
circumstances connected with David's life preclude us from inferring
either moral depravity or religious barbarism from this. When David was
obliged to fly from his country to escape from Saul, he also led a life
of the same kind, so that all sorts of people came to him, not pious and
virtuous people, but all who were in distress and had creditors, or were
embittered in spirit ([Sa1 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002).md); and
yet, even under these circumstances, David lived in the law of the Lord.
Moreover, Jephthah was not destitute of the fear of God. This is proved
first of all by the fact, that when he had been recalled from his exile
he looked to Jehovah to give him the victory over the Ammonites, and
made a treaty with the elders of Gilead "before Jehovah" ([Jdg
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#009.md) and [Jdg
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#010).md); and also by the fact, that he
sought to ensure the help of God in war through the medium of a vow. And
again, we have no right to attribute to him any ignorance of the law.
Even if Kurtz is correct in his opinion, that the negotiations with the
king of the Ammonites, which show the most accurate acquaintance with
the Pentateuch, were not carried on independently and from his own
knowledge of the law, and that the sending of messengers to the hostile
king was resolved upon in the national assembly at Mizpeh, with the
priests, Levites, and elders present, so that the Levites, who knew the
law, may have supplied any defects in his own knowledge of the law and
of the early history of his people; a private Israelite did not need to
study the whole of the law of the Pentateuch, and to make himself master
of the whole, in order to gain the knowledge and conviction that a human
sacrifice was irreconcilable with the substance and spirit of the
worship of Jehovah, and that Jehovah the God of Israel was not a Moloch.
And again, even if we do not know to what extent the men and fathers of
families in Israel were acquainted and familiar with the contents of the
Mosaic law, the opinion is certainly an erroneous one, that the
Israelites derived their knowledge of the law exclusively from the
public reading of the law at the feast of tabernacles in the sabbatical
year, as enjoined in [Deu 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010.md).; so
that if this public reading, which was to take place only once in seven
years, had been neglected, the whole nation would have been left without
any instruction whatever in the law. The reason for this Mosaic precept
was a totally different one from that of making the people acquainted
with the contents of the law (see the commentary on this passage). And
again, though we certainly do not find the law of the Lord so thoroughly
pervading the religious consciousness of the people, received as it were
in succum et sanguinem, in the time of the judges, that they were able
to resist the bewitching power of nature-worship, but, on the contrary,
we find them repeatedly falling away into the worship of Baal; yet we
discover no trace whatever of human sacrifices even in the case of those
who went a whoring after Baalim. And although the theocratical knowledge
of the law seems to have been somewhat corrupted even in the case of
such men as Gideon, so that this judge had an unlawful ephod made for
himself at Ophrah; the opinion that the Baal-worship, into which the
Israelites repeatedly fell, was associated with human sacrifices, is one
of the many erroneous ideas that have been entertained as to the
development of the religious life not only among the Israelites, but
among the Canaanites, and which cannot be supported by historical
testimonies or facts. That the Canaanitish worship of Baal and Astarte,
to which the Israelites were addicted, required no human sacrifices, is
indisputably evident from the fact, that even in the time of Ahab and
his idolatrous wife Jezebel, the daughter of the Sidonian king Ethbaal,
who raised the worship of Baal into the national religion in the kingdom
of the ten tribes, persecuting the prophets of Jehovah and putting them
to death, there is not the slightest allusion to human sacrifices. Even
at that time human sacrifices were regarded by the Israelites as so
revolting an abomination, that the two kings of Israel who besieged the
king of the Moabites - not only the godly Jehoshaphat, but Jehoram the
son of Ahab and Jezebel - withdrew at once and relinquished the
continuance of the war, when the king of the Moabites, in the extremity
of his distress, sacrificed his son as a burnt-offering upon the wall
([Kg2 3:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#026).md). With such an attitude
as this on the part of the Israelites towards human sacrifices before
the time of Ahaz and Manasseh, who introduced the worship of Moloch into
Jerusalem, we cannot, without further evidence, impute to Jephthah the
offering of a bloody human sacrifice, the more especially as it is
inconceivable, with the diametrical opposition between the worship of
Jehovah and the worship of Moloch, that God should have chosen a
worshipper of Moloch to carry out His work, or a man who was capable of
vowing and offering a human-being sacrifice. The men whom God chose as
the recipients of His revelation of mercy and the executors of His will,
and whom He endowed with His Spirit as judges and leaders of His people,
were no doubt affected with infirmities, faults, and sins of many kinds,
so that they could fall to a very great depth; but nowhere is it stated
that the Spirit of God came upon a worshipper of Moloch and endowed him
with His own power, that he might be the helper and saviour of Israel.

We cannot therefore regard Jephthah as a servant of Moloch, especially
when we consider that, in addition to what has already been said, the
account of the actual fulfilment of his vow is apparently irreconcilable
with the literal interpretation of the words עולה והעליתיהוּ, as
signifying a bleeding burnt-offering. We cannot infer anything with
certainty as to the mode of the sacrifice, from the grief which Jephthah
felt and expressed when his only daughter came to meet him. For this is
quite as intelligible, as even the supporters of the literal view of
these words admit, on the supposition that Jephthah was compelled by his
vow to dedicate his daughter to Jehovah in a lifelong virginity, as it
would be if he had been obliged to put her to death and burn her upon
the altar as a burnt-offering. But the entreaty of the daughter, that he
would grant her two months' time, in order that she might lament her
virginity upon the mountains with her friends, would have been
marvellously out of keeping with the account that she was to be put to
death as a sacrifice. To mourn one's virginity does not mean to mourn
because one has to die a virgin, but because one has to live and remain
a virgin. But even if we were to assume that mourning her virginity was
equivalent to mourning on account of her youth (which is quite
untenable, as בּתוּלים is not synonymous with נעוּרים), "it would be
impossible to understand why this should take place upon the mountains.
It would be altogether opposed to human nature, that a child who had so
soon to die should make use of a temporary respite to forsake her father
altogether. It would no doubt be a reasonable thing that she should ask
permission to enjoy life for two months longer before she was put to
death; but that she should only think of bewailing her virginity, when a
sacrificial death was in prospect, which would rob her father of his
only child, would be contrary to all the ordinary feelings of the human
heart. Yet, inasmuch as the history lays special emphasis upon her
bewailing her virginity, this must have stood in some peculiar relation
to the nature of the vow. When a maiden bewails her virginity, the
reason for this can only be that she will have to remain a bud that has
not been allowed to unfold itself, prevented, too, not by death, but by
life" (P. Cassel, p. 473). And this is confirmed by the expression, to
bewail her virginity "upon the mountains." "If life had been in
question, the same tears might have been shed at home. But her
lamentations were devoted to her virginity, and such lamentations could
not be uttered in the town, and in the presence of men. Modesty required
the solitude of the mountains for these. The virtuous heart of the
maiden does not open itself in the ears of all; but only in sacred
silence does it pour out its lamentations of love" (P. Cassel, p. 476).

And so, again, the still further clause in the account of the fulfilment
of the vow, "and she knew no man," is not in harmony with the assumption
of a sacrificial death. This clause would add nothing to the description
in that case, since it was already known that she was a virgin. The
words only gain their proper sense if we connect them with the previous
clause, he "did with her according to the vow which he had vowed," and
understand them as describing what the daughter did in fulfilment of the
vow. The father fulfilled his vow upon her, and she knew no man; i.e.,
he fulfilled the vow through the fact that she knew no man, but
dedicated her life to the Lord, as a spiritual burnt-offering, in a
lifelong chastity. It was this willingness of the daughter to sacrifice
herself which the daughters of Israel went every year to
celebrate-namely, upon the mountains whither her friends had gone with
her to lament her virginity, and which they commemorated there four days
in the year. And the idea of a spiritual sacrifice is supported not only
by the words, but also most decisively by the fact that the historian
describes the fulfilment of the vow in the words "he did to her
according to his vow," in such a manner as to lead to the conclusion
that he regarded the act itself as laudable and good. But a prophetic
historian could never have approved of a human sacrifice; and it is
evident that the author of the book of Judges does not conceal what was
blameable even in the judges themselves, from his remarks concerning the
conduct of Gideon ([Jdg 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027).md), which
was only a very small offence in comparison with the abomination of a
human sacrifice. To this we have to add the difficulties connected with
such an act. The words "he did to her according to his vow" presuppose
undoubtedly that Jephthah offered his daughter as עולה to Jehovah. But
burnt-offerings, that is to say bleeding burnt-offerings, in which the
victim was slaughtered and burnt upon the altar, could only be offered
upon the lawful altar at the tabernacle, or before the ark, through the
medium of the Levitical priests, unless the sacrifice itself had been
occasioned by some extraordinary manifestation of God; and that we
cannot for a moment think of here. But is it credible that a priest or
the priesthood should have consented to offer a sacrifice upon the altar
of Jehovah which was denounced in the law as the greatest abomination of
the heathen? This difficulty cannot be set aside by assuming that
Jephthah put his daughter to death, and burned her upon some secret
altar, without the assistance and mediation of a priest; for such an act
would not have been described by the prophetic historian as a fulfilment
of the vow that he would offer a burnt-offering to the Lord, simply
because it would not have been a sacrifice offered to Jehovah at all,
but a sacrifice slaughtered to Moloch.

(Note: Auberlen's remarks upon this subject are very good. "The history
of Jephthah's daughter," he says, "would hardly have been thought worth
preserving in the Scriptures if the maiden had been really offered in
sacrifice; for, in that case, the event would have been reduced, at the
best, into a mere family history, without any theocratic significance,
though in truth it would rather have been an anti-theocratic
abomination, according to [Deu 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031.md)
(cf. [Jdg 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#009.md); [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md); [Lev
20:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001).md). Jephthah's action would in
that case have stood upon the same platform as the incest of Lot ([Gen
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030)..md), and would owe its adoption
into the canon simply to genealogical considerations, or others of a
similar kind. But the very opposite is the case here; and if, from the
conclusion of the whole narrative in [Jdg
11:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#039.md), the object of it is supposed
to be simply to explain the origin of the feast that was held in honour
of Jephthah's daughter, even this would tell against the ordinary view.
In the eye of the law the whole thing would still remain an abomination,
and the canonical Scriptures would not stoop to relate and beautify an
institution so directly opposed to the law.")

All these circumstances, when rightly considered, almost compel us to
adopt the spiritual interpretation of the words, "offer as a
burnt-offering." It is true that no exactly corresponding parallelisms
can be adduced from the Old Testament in support of the spiritual view;
but the germs of this view, as met with in the Psalms and the writings
of the prophets, are contained in the demand of God addressed to Abraham
to offer Him his only son Isaac as a burnt-offering, when compared with
the issue of Abraham's temptation-namely, that God accepted his
willingness to offer up his son as a completed sacrifice, and then
supplied him with a ram to offer up as a bleeding sacrifice in the place
of his son. As this fact teaches that what God demands is not a
corporeal but a spiritual sacrifice, so the rules laid down in the law
respecting the redemption of the first-born belonging to the Lord, and
of persons vowed to Him ([Exo 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001.md),
[Exo 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013.md); [Num
18:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015.md); [Lev
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001)..md), show clearly how the
Israelites could dedicate themselves and those who belonged to them to
the Lord, without burning upon the altar the persons who were vowed to
Him. And lastly, it is evident, from the perfectly casual reference to
the women who ministered at the tabernacle ([Exo
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008.md); [Sa1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022).md), that there were persons in
Israel who dedicated their lives to the Lord at the sanctuary, by
altogether renouncing the world. And there can be no doubt that Jephthah
had such a dedication as this in his mind when he uttered his vow; at
all events in case the Lord, to whom he left the appointment of the
sacrifice, should demand the offering up of a human being. The word עולה
does not involve the idea of burning, like our word burnt-offering, but
simply that of going up upon the altar, or of complete surrender to the
Lord. עולה is a whole offering, as distinguished from the other
sacrifices, of which only a part was given up to the Lord. When a
virgin, therefore, was set apart as a spiritual עולה, it followed, as a
matter of course, that henceforth she belonged entirely to the Lord:
that is to say, was to remain a virgin for the remainder of her days.
The fact that Nazarites contracted marriages, even such as were
dedicated by a vow to be Nazarites all their lives, by no means warrants
the conclusion that virgins dedicated to the Lord by a vow were also
free to marry if they chose. It is true that we learn nothing definite
from the Old Testament with regard to this spiritual sacrificial
service; but the absence of any distinct statements upon the subject by
no means warrants our denying the fact. Even with regard to the
spiritual service of the women at the tabernacle we have no precise
information; and we should not have known anything about this
institution, if the women themselves had not offered their mirrors in
the time of Moses to make the holy laver, or if we had not the account
of the violation of such women by the sons of Eli. In this respect,
therefore, the remarks of Clericus, though too frequently disregarded,
as very true: "It was not to be expected, as I have often observed, that
so small a volume as the Old Testament should contain all the customs of
the Hebrew, and a full account of all the things that were done among
them. There are necessarily many things alluded to, therefore, which we
do not fully understand, simply because they are not mentioned
elsewhere."
