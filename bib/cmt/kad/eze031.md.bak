The Glory and Fall of Asshur a Type of Egypt

In two months minus six days from the time when the preceding word of
God was uttered, Ezekiel received another threatening word against the
king and the people of Egypt, in which the former announcement of the
destruction of the might of Egypt was confirmed by a comparison drawn
between the power of Egypt and that of Asshur. Ezekiel having opened his
prophecy with the question, whom does Pharaoh with his might resemble
([Eze 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#002).md), proceeds to depict Asshur
as a mighty towering cedar ([Eze
31:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003).md) which has been felled and cast
down by the prince of the nations on account of its height and pride
([Eze 31:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010).md), so that everything
mourned over its fall, because many nations went down with it to hell
([Eze 31:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015).md). The question, whom
Pharaoh resembles, is then repeated in [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md); and from the preceding
comparison the conclusion is drawn, that he will perish like that lofty
cedar. - The reminiscence of the greatness of the Assyrian empire and of
its destruction was well adapted to overthrow all reliance upon the
might and greatness of Egypt. The fall of that great empire was still so
fresh in the mind at the time, that the reminiscence could not fail to
make a deep impression upon the prophet's hearers.

[Ezekiel 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 31:1</span></span>

The might of Pharaoh resembles the greatness and glory of Asshur. - [Eze
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md). In the eleventh year, in the
third (month), on the first of the month, the word of Jehovah came to
me, saying, [Eze 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#002.md). Son of man, say
to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to his tumult, Whom art thou like in
thy greatness? [Eze 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md). Behold,
Asshur was a cedar-tree upon Lebanon, beautiful in branches, a shadowing
thicket, and its top was high in growth, and among the clouds. [Eze
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004.md). Water brought him up, the flood
made him high, its streams went round about its plantation, and it sent
its channels to all the trees of the field. [Eze
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#005.md). Therefore its growth became
higher than all the trees of the field, and its branches became great,
and its boughs long from many waters in its shooting out. [Eze
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006.md). In its branches all the birds of
the heaven made their nests, and under its boughs all the beasts of the
field brought forth, and in its shadow sat great nations of all kinds.
[Eze 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#007.md). And he was beautiful in his
greatness, in the length of his shoots; for his root was by many waters.
[Eze 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md). Cedars did not obscure him
in the garden of God, cypresses did not resemble his branches, and
plane-trees were not like his boughs; no tree in the garden of God
resembled him in his beauty. [Eze
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009.md). I had made him beautiful in the
multitude of his shoots, and all the trees of Eden which were in the
garden of God envied him. - The word of God is addressed to King Pharaoh
and to המונו, his tumult, i.e., whoever and whatever occasions noise and
tumult in the land. We must not interpret this, however, as Hitzig has
done, as signifying the ruling classes and estates in contrast with the
quiet in the land, for no such use of המון is anywhere to be found. Nor
must we regard the word as applying to the multitude of people only, but
to the people with their possessions, their riches, which gave rise to
luxury and tumult, as in [Eze 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#010.md).
The inquiry, whom does Pharaoh with his tumult resemble in his
greatness, is followed in the place of a reply by a description of
Asshur as a glorious cedar ([Eze
31:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003).md). It is true that Ewald has
followed the example of Meibom (vanarum in Cod. Hebr. interprett. spec.
III p. 70) and J. D. Michaelis, and endeavours to set aside the allusion
to Asshur, by taking the word אשּׁוּר in an appellative sense, and
understanding אשּׁוּר ארז as signifying a particular kind of cedar,
namely, the tallest species of all. But apart altogether from there
being no foundation whatever for such an explanation in the usage of the
language, there is nothing in the fact to justify it. For it is not
anywhere affirmed that Pharaoh resembled this cedar; on the contrary,
the question, whom does he resemble? is asked again in [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018) (Hitzig.md). Moreover, Michaelis is
wrong in the supposition that "from [Eze
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md) onwards it becomes perfectly
obvious that it is not Assyria but Egypt itself which is meant by the
cedar-tree previously described." Under the figure of the felling of a
cedar there is depicted the overthrow of a king or monarchy, which has
already taken place. Compare [Eze
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md) and [Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md), where the past is indicated
quite as certainly as the future in [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md). And as [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md) plainly designates the overthrow
of Pharaoh and his power as still in the future, the cedar, whose
destruction is not only threatened in [Eze
31:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md), but declared to have already
taken place, can only be Asshur, and not Egypt at all.

The picture of the glory of this cedar recalls in several respects the
similar figurative description in Ezekiel 17. Asshur is called a cedar
upon Lebanon, because it was there that the most stately cedars grew.
חרשׁ מצל, a shade-giving thicket (מצל is a Hiphil participle of צלל),
belongs to יפה ענף as a further expansion of ענף, corresponding to the
further expansion of גּבהּ קמה by "its top was among the clouds." If we
bear this in mind, the reasons assigned by Hitzig for altering חרשׁ into
an adjective הרשׁ, and taking מצל as a substantive formation after the
analogy of מסב, lose all their force. Analogy would only require an
adjective in the construct state in the event of the three statements
'יפה ע, 'הרשׁ מ, and 'גּבהּ גּבהּ ק being co-ordinate with one another.
But what is decisive against the proposed conjecture is the fact that
neither the noun מצל nor the adjective הרשׁ is ever met with, and that,
in any case, מצל cannot signify foliage. The rendering of the Vulgate,
"frondibus nemorosus," is merely guessed at, whilst the Seventy have
omitted the word as unintelligible to them. For עבתים, thicket of
clouds, see the comm. on [Eze 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#011.md);
and for צמּרת, that on [Eze 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md). The
cedar grew to so large a size because it was richly watered ([Eze
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004).md). A flood poured its streams
round about the place where the cedar was planted, and sent out brooks
to all the trees of the field. The difficult words את־נהרתיה וגו' are to
be taken literally thus: as for its (the flood's) streams, it (the
flood) was going round about its plantation, i.e., round about the
plantation belonging to the flood or the place situated near it, where
the cedar was planted. את is not to be taken as a preposition, but as a
sign of the accusative, and את־נהרתיה dna , as an accusative used for
the more precise definition of the manner in which the flood surrounded
the plantation. It is true that there still remains something striking
in the masculine הלך, since תּהום, although of common gender, is
construed throughout as a feminine, even in this very verse. But the
difficulty remains even if we follow Ewald, and take הלך to be a
defectively written or irregular form of the Hiphil הוליך; a conjecture
which is precluded by the use of הוליך, to cause to run = to cause to
flow away, in [Eze 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014.md). מטּעהּ, its
(the flood's) plantation, i.e., the plantation for which the flood
existed. תּהום is used here to signify the source of starting-point of a
flood, as in [Deu 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md), where תּהמות
are co-ordinate with עינות. - While the place where the cedar was
planted was surrounded by the streams of the flood, only the brooks and
channels of this flood reached to the trees of the field. The cedar
therefore surpassed all the trees of the field in height and luxuriance
of growth ([Eze 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#005).md). fגּבהאheb&gt;,
an Aramean mode of spelling for גּבהה heb&gt;; and asרעפּתheb&gt;, ἁπ.
λεγ.., an Aramean formation with ר inserted, for סעפת, branches. For
פּארת, see the comm. on [Eze 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006.md).
בּשׁלּחו cannot mean "since it (the stream) sent out the water" (Ewald);
for although תּהום in [Eze 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004.md) is
also construed as a masculine, the suffix cannot be taken as referring
to תּהום, for this is much too far off. And the explanation proposed by
Rosenmller, Hvernick, Kliefoth, and others, "as it (the tree) sent them
(the branches) out," is open to this objection, that בּשׁלּחו would then
contain a spiritless tautology; since the stretching out of the branches
is already contained in the fact of their becoming numerous and long.
the tautology has no existence if the object is left indefinite, "in its
spreading out," i.e., the spreading not only of the branches, but also
of the roots, to which שׁלּח is sometimes applied (cf. [Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008).md). By the many waters which made
the cedar great, we must not understand, either solely or especially,
the numerous peoples which rendered Assyria great and mighty, as the
Chaldee and many of the older commentators have done. It must rather be
taken as embracing everything which contributed to the growth and
greatness of Assyria. It is questionable whether the prophet, when
describing the flood which watered the cedar plantation, had the
description of the rivers of Paradise in [Gen
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010.md). floating before his mind. Ewald
and Hvernick think that he had; but Hitzig and Kliefoth take a decidedly
opposite view. There is certainly no distinct indication of any such
allusion. We meet with this for the first time from [Eze
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md) onwards.

In [Eze 31:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006.md) the greatness and glory
of Asshur are still further depicted. Upon and under the branches of the
stately tree, all creatures, birds, beasts, and men, found shelter and
protection for life and increase ([Eze
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006.md); cf. [Eze
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023.md) and [Dan
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#009).md). In כּּל־גּוים רבּים, all kinds
of great nations, the fact glimmers through the figure. The tree was so
beautiful (ויּיף from יפה) in its greatness, that of all the trees in
the garden of God not one was to be compared with it, and all envied it
on that account; that is to say, all the other nations and kingdoms in
God's creation were far inferior to Asshur in greatness and glory. גּן
אלהים is the garden of Paradise; and consequently עדן in [Eze
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009.md), [Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md), and [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md) is also Paradise, as in [Eze
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013.md). There is no ground for
Kliefoth's objection, that if עדן be taken in this sense, the words
"which are in the garden of God" will contain a superfluous pleonasm, a
mere tautology. In [Gen 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008.md) a
distinction is also made between עדן and the garden in Eden. It was not
all Eden, but the garden planted by Jehovah in Eden, which formed the
real paradisaical creation; so that the words "which are in the garden
of God" give intensity to the idea of the "trees of Eden." Moreover, as
Hvernick has correctly pointed out, there is a peculiar emphasis in the
separation of בּגן אלהים from ארזים in [Eze
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md) : "cedars...even such as were
found in the garden of God." Not one even of the other and most glorious
trees, viz., cypresses and planes, resembled the cedar Asshur, planted
by God by many waters, in its boughs and branches. It is not stated in
so many words in [Eze 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md) and [Eze
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009.md) that the cedar Asshur stood in
the garden of God; but it by no means follows from this, that by the
garden of God we are to understand simply the world and the earth as the
creation of God, as Kliefoth imagines, and in support of which he argues
that "as all the nations and kingdoms of the world are regarded as trees
planted by God, the world itself is quite consistently called a garden
or plantation of God." The very fact that a distinction is made between
trees of the field ([Eze 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004.md) and [Eze
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#005).md) and trees of Eden in the garden
of God ([Eze 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md) and [Eze
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009).md), shows that the trees are not
all regarded here as being in the same sense planted by God. If the
garden of God stood for the world, where should we then have to look for
the field (השּׂדה)? The thought of [Eze
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md) and [Eze
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009.md) is not that "not a single tree in
all God's broad earth was to be compared to the cedar Asshur," but that
even of the trees of Paradise, the garden in Eden, there was not one so
beautiful and glorious as the cedar Asshur, planted by God by many
waters.

The Felling of this Cedar, or the Overthrow of Asshur on Account of Its
Pride

[Eze 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md). Therefore thus said the
Lord Jehovah, Because thou didst exalt thyself in height, and he
stretched his top to the midst of the clouds, and his heart exalted
itself in its height, [Eze 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md). I
will give him into the hand of the prince of the nations; he shall deal
with him: for his wickedness I rejected him. [Eze
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md). And strangers cut him down,
violent ones of the nations, and cast him away: upon the mountains and
in all the valleys his shoots fell, and his boughs were broken in pieces
into all the deep places of the earth; and all the nations of the earth
withdrew from his shadow, and let him lie. [Eze
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#013.md). Upon his fallen trunk all the
birds of the heaven settle, and all the beasts of the field are over his
branches: [Eze 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014.md). That no trees by
the water may exalt themselves on account of their height, or stretch
their top to the midst of the clouds, and no water-drinkers stand upon
themselves in their exaltation: for they are all given up to death into
hell, in the midst of the children of men, to those that go into the
grave. - In the description of the cause of the overthrow of Asshur
which commences with יען אשׁר, the figurative language changes in the
third clause into the literal fact, the towering of the cedar being
interpreted as signifying the lifting up of the heart in his height, -
that is to say, in his pride. In the first clause the tree itself is
addressed; but in the clauses which follow, it is spoken of in the third
person. The direct address in the first clause is to be explained from
the vivid manner in which the fact presented itself. The divine sentence
in [Eze 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md) and [Eze
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md) is not directed against Pharaoh,
but against the Assyrian, who is depicted as a stately cedar; whilst the
address in [Eze 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md), and the
imperfect (future) in [Eze 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md), are
both to be accounted for from the fact that the fall of Asshur is
related in the form in which it was denounced on the part of Jehovah
upon that imperial kingdom. The perfect אמר is therefore a preterite
here: the Lord said...for His part: because Asshur has exalted itself in
the pride of its greatness, I give it up. The form ואתנהוּ is not to be
changed into ואתנהוּ, but is defended against critical caprice by the
imperfect יעשׂה which follows. That the penal sentence of God is not to
be regarded as being first uttered in the time then present, but belongs
to the past, - and therefore the words merely communicate what God had
already spoken, - is clearly shown by the preterites commencing with
גּרשׁתּיהוּ, the historical tenses ויּכרתהוּ and ויּטּשׁהוּ, and the
preterite נפלוּ, which must not be turned into futures in violation of
grammar. גּבהּ בּקומה does not mean, to be high in its height, which
would be a tautology; but to exalt itself (be proud) in, or on account
of, its height. And in the same way is רוּם also affirmed of the heart,
in the sense of exultation from pride. For the fact itself, compare [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md). אל גּוים does not mean God, but
a powerful one of the nations, i.e., Nebuchadnezzar. אל is a simple
appellative from אוּל, the strong one; and is neither a name of God nor
a defective form for איל, the construct state of איל, a ram. For this
defective form is only met with once in the case of איל, a ram, namely,
in [Job 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#008.md), where we have the plural
אלים, and nowhere else; whereas, in the case of אל, אלים, in the sense
of a strong one, the scriptio plena very frequently alternates with the
defectiva. Compare, for example, [Job
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#008.md), where both readings occur just
as in this instance, where many MSS have איל (vid., de Rossi, variae
lectt. ad h. l.); also [Exo 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015.md) and
[Eze 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013.md), אילי, compared with אלי in
[Eze 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021.md), after the analogy of נירי,
[Sa2 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#029.md), and גּירים, [Ch2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016.md). עשׂו is not a relative clause,
"who should treat him ill," nor is the w relat. omitted on account of
the preceding עשׂו, as Hitzig imagines; but it is an independent
sentence, and יעשׂה is a forcible expression for the imperative: he will
deal with him, equivalent to, "let him deal with him." עשׂה ל, to do
anything to a person, used here as it frequently is in an evil sense;
compare [Psa 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005.md). בּרשׁעו-or כּרשׁעו,
which Norzi and Abarbanel (in de Rossi, variae lectt. ad. h. l.) uphold
as the reading of many of the more exact manuscripts and editions -
belongs to גּרשׁתּיהוּ: for, or according to, his wickedness, I rejected
him.

In [Eze 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md) the figure of the tree
is resumed; and the extinction of the Assyrian empire is described as
the cutting down of the proud cedar. זרים עריצי גּוים as in [Eze
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007.md) and [Eze
30:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#011.md). ויּטּשׁהוּ: they cast him
away and let him lie, as in [Eze 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005.md);
[Eze 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#004.md); so that in the first
sentence the idea of casting away predominates, and in the second that
of letting lie. By the casting away, the tree became so shattered to
atoms that its boughs and branches fell upon the mountains and on the
low ground and valleys of the earth, and the nations which had sat under
its shadow withdrew. ויּרדוּ (they descended) is to be explained from
the idea that the three had grown upon a high mountain (namely Lebanon);
and Hitzig is mistaken in his conjecture that ויּרדוּ was the original
reading, as נדד, to fly, is not an appropriate expression for עמּים. On
the falling of the tree, the birds which had made their nests in its
branches naturally flew away. If, then, in [Eze
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#013.md), birds and beasts are said to
settle upon the fallen trunk, as several of the commentators have
correctly observed, the description is based upon the idea of a corpse,
a מפּלת ([Jdg 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#008).md), around which both
birds and beasts of prey gather together to tear it in pieces (cf. [Eze
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#004.md) and [Isa
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#006).md). היה אל, to come towards or over
any one, to be above it. The thought expressed is, that many nations
took advantage of the fall of Asshur and rose into new life upon its
ruins. - [Eze 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014.md). This fate was
prepared for Asshur in order that henceforth no tree should grow up to
the sky any more, i.e., that no powerful one of this earth (no king or
prince) should strive after superhuman greatness and might. למען אשׁר is
dependent upon גּרשׁתּיהוּ in [Eze
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md); for [Eze
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md) and [Eze
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#013.md) are simply a further expansion
of the thought expressed in that word. עצי מים are trees growing near
the water, and therefore nourished by water. For 'לא , see [Eze
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md). The words 'ולא יעמדוּ are
difficult. As אליהם, with Tzere under א, to which the Masora calls
attention, cannot be the preposition אל with the suffix, many have taken
אליהם to be a noun, in the sense of fortes, principes, or terebinthi
(vid., [Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003).md), and have rendered
the clause either ut non perstent terebinthi eorum in altitudine sua,
omnes (ceterae arbores) bibentes aquam (Vatabl., Starck, Maurer, and
Kliefoth), or, that their princes may not lift themselves up in their
pride, all the drinkers of water (Hvernick). But both renderings founder
on the simple fact that they leave the suffix הם in אליהם either
unnoticed or unexplained. As only the trees of the water have been
spoken of previously, the suffix must be taken as referring to them. But
the water-trees have neither terebinths nor princes; on the contrary,
these are what they must either be, or signify. Terebinths, or princes
of the water-trees, would be senseless ideas. Ewald has therefore taken
אליהם as the object, and rendered it thus: "and (that) no water-drinkers
may contend with their gods in their pride." He has not proved, however,
but has simply asserted, that עמד is to endure = to contend (!). The
only remaining course is to follow the lxx, Targum, and many
commentators, and to take אליהם as a pronoun, and point it אליהם. עמד
אל: to station oneself against, or upon = עמד על ([Eze
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#026).md), in the sense of resting, or
relying upon anything. The suffix is to be taken in a reflective sense,
as in [Eze 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md), etc. (vid., Ewald,
314c), and precedes the noun to which it refers, as in [Pro
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020.md) for example. בּגבהם, as in [Eze
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md), referring to pride. כּל־שׁתי
מים, the subject of the sentence, is really synonymous with כּל־עצי מים,
except that the figure of the tree falls into the background behind the
fact portrayed. The rendering of the Berleburg Bible is very good: "and
no trees abounding in water stand upon themselves (rely upon themselves)
on account of their height." The water-drinkers are princes of this
earth who have attained to great power through rich resources. "As a
tree grows through the moisture of water, so men are accustomed to
become proud through their abundance, not reflecting that these waters
have been supplied to them by God" (Starck). The reason for this warning
against proud self-exaltation is given in [Eze
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014.md) in the general statement, that
all the proud great ones of this earth are delivered up to death. כּלּם,
all of them, the water-drinkers or water-trees already named, by whom
kings, earthly potentates, are intended. ארץ תּחתּית = ארץ תּח ([Eze
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020).md). בּתוך בּני אדם: in the midst
of the children of men, i.e., like all other men. "Thus the prophet
teaches that princes must die as well as the people, that death and
decomposition are common to both. Hence he takes all ground of proud
boasting away" (Starck).

Impression Made upon the Nations by the Fall of Asshur; and Its
Application to Pharaoh

[Eze 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015.md). Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, In the day that he went down to hell I caused a mourning:
covered the flood for his sake, and stopped its streams, and the great
waters were held back: I caused Lebanon to blacken itself for him, and
all the trees of the field pined for him. [Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md). I made the nations tremble at
the noise of his fall, when I cast him down to hell to those who go into
the grave: and they comforted themselves in the nether world, even all
the trees of Eden, the choice and most beautiful of Lebanon, all the
water-drinkers. [Eze 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#017.md). They also
went with him into hell, to those pierced with the sword, who sat as his
helpers in his shade among the nations. [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md). Whom dost thou thus resemble in
glory and greatness among the trees of Eden? So shalt thou be thrust
down to the trees of Eden into the nether world, and lie among
uncircumcised ones with those pierced with the sword. This is Pharaoh
and all his tumult, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - In order that
the overthrow of the Assyrian, i.e., the destruction of the Assyrian
empire, may be placed in the clearest light, a picture is drawn of the
impression which it made upon the whole creation. There is no necessity
to understand כּה אמר in a past sense, as in [Eze
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md). What God did on the overthrow
of Asshur He may even now, for the first time, make known through the
prophet, for a warning to Pharaoh and the people of Israel. That this is
the way in which the words are to be interpreted, is evident from the
use of the perfect האבלתּי, followed by the historical imperfects, which
cannot be taken in a prophetical sense, as Kliefoth supposes, or turned
into futures. It is contrary to Hebrew usage to connect האבלתּי and
כּסּתי together as asyndeton, so as to form one idea, viz., "to veil in
mourning" as Ewald and Hvernick propose. The circumstances under which
two verbs are joined together to form one idea are of a totally
different kind. In this instance האבלתּי is placed first as an absolute;
and in the sentences which follow, it is more specifically defined by a
detail of the objects which were turned into mourning. כּסּה עליו
את־תּהום cannot mean her, "to cover the flood upon (over) him" (after
[Eze 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#007.md) and [Eze
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#019).md); for this is altogether
unsuitable to either the more remote or the more immediate context. The
tree Asshur was not destroyed by a flood, but cut down by strangers. The
following clauses, "I stopped its streams," etc., show very plainly that
the connection between the flood (תּהום) and the tree which had been
felled is to be understood in accordance with [Eze
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004.md). A flood, which poured its נהרות
round about its plantation, made the cedar-tree great; and now that the
tree has been felled, God covers the flood on its account. כּסּה is to
be explained from כּסּה שׂק, to veil or wrap in mourning, as Raschi,
Kimchi, Vatablus, and many others have shown. The word שׂק is omitted,
because it appeared inappropriate to תּהום. The mourning of the flood is
to be taken as equivalent to drying up, so that the streams which issued
from it were deprived of their water. Lebanon, i.e., the cedar-forest
([Isa 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034).md), and all the other trees,
mourned over the fall of the cedar Asshur. הקדּיר, to clothe in black,
i.e., to turn into mourning. עלפּה is regarded by Ewald as a Pual formed
after the Aramean mode, that is to say, by attaching the syllable ae
instead of doubling the middle radical; whilst Hitzig proposes to change
the form into עלּפּה. In any case the word must be a perfect Pual, as a
nomen verbale appears unsuitable; and it must also be a third person
feminine, the termination ־ה being softened into ־ה, as in זוּרה ([Isa
59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005).md), and the doubling of the ל being
dropped on account of the Sheva; so that the plural is construed with
the singular feminine (Ewald, 317a). עלּף, to faint with grief (cf. [Isa
51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020).md). The thought is the following:
all nature was so painfully affected by the fall of Asshur, that the
whole of the resources from which its prosperity and might had been
derived were dried up. To interpret the different figures as specially
relating to princes and nations appears a doubtful procedure, for the
simple reason that in [Eze 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md) the
trembling of the nations is expressly named.

Whilst all the nations on the surface of the earth tremble at the fall
of Assyria, because they are thereby warned of the perishable nature of
all earthly greatness and of their own destruction, the inhabitants of
the nether world console themselves with the thought that the Assyrian
is now sharing their fate (for this thought, compare [Eze
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#031.md) and [Isa
14:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009).md). "All the trees of Eden" are
all the powerful and noble princes. The idea itself, "trees of Eden," is
explained by the apposition, "the choice and beautiful ones of Lebanon,"
i.e., the picked and finest cedars, and still further strengthened by
the expression כּל־שׁתי (cf. [Eze
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014).md). מבחר are connected, as in [Sa1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002.md); and both words are placed side by
side in the construct state, as in [Dan
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004) (cf. Ewald, 339b.md). They comfort
themselves because they have gone down with him into Sheol, so that he
has no advantage over them. They come thither to those pierced with the
sword, i.e., to the princes and peoples whom Asshur slew in wars to
establish his imperial power. וּזרעו might also belong to ירדוּ as a
second subject. In that case ישׁבוּ בצלּו should be taken in a relative
sense: "and his arm," i.e., his resources, "which sat in his shadow
among the nations." With this explanation זרעו would be different from
הם, and could only denote the army of the Assyrian. But this does not
harmonize with the sitting in his shadow among the nations, for these
words obviously point back to [Eze
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006.md); so that זרעו is evidently meant
to correspond to כּּל־גוים רבּים ([Eze
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006).md), and is actually identical with
הם, i.e., with all the trees of Eden. We therefore agree with Osiander,
Grotius, and others, in regarding the whole of the second hemistich as
more precisely determining the subject, - in other words, as a
declaration of the reason for their descending into hell along with the
Assyrians, - and render the passage thus: "for as his arm (as his might)
they sat in his shadow among the nations;" so that the cop. w is used in
place of a causal particle. In any case, the conjecture which Ewald has
adopted from the lxx and the Syriac, viz., וזרעו, and his seed, in
support of which appeal might be made to [Isa
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021.md), is unsuitable, for the simple
reason that the statement, that it sat in his shadow among the nations,
does not apply. - After this description of the greatness and the
destruction of the imperial power of Assyria, Ezekiel repeats in [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md) the question already asked in
[Eze 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md) : to whom is Pharaoh like?
כּכה, so, i.e., under such circumstances, when the glorious cedar Asshur
has been smitten by such a fate (Hitzig). The reply to this question is
really contained in the description given already; so that it is
immediately followed by the announcement, "and thou wilt be thrust
down," etc. ערלים, uncircumcised, equivalent to ungodly heathen 'הוּא פ,
not "he is," as that would require פּרעה הוּא; but הוּא is the
predicate: this is (i.e., so does it happen to) Pharaoh. המונו, as in
[Eze 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#002.md).
