[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 28:0</span></span>

David in the Army of the Philistines. Attack upon Israel. Saul and the
Witch of Endor - 1 Samuel 28

The danger into which David had plunged through his flight into the land
of the Philistines, and still more through the artifice with which he
had deceived the king Achish as to his real feelings, was to be very
soon made apparent to him. For example, when the Philistines went to war
again with Israel, Achish summoned him to go with his men in the army of
the Philistines to the war against his own people and land, and David
could not disregard the summons. But even if he had not brought himself
into this danger without some fault of his own, he had at any rate only
taken refuge with the Philistines in the greatest extremity; and what
further he had done, was only done to save his own life. The faithful
covenant God helped him therefore out of this trouble, and very soon
afterwards put an end to his persecution by the fact that Saul lost his
life in the war.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 28:1</span></span>

"In those days," i.e., whilst David was living in the land of the
Philistines, it came to pass that the Philistines gathered their armies
together for a campaign against Israel. And Achish sent word to David
that he was to go with him in his army along with his men; and David
answered ([Sa1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#002).md), "Thereby (on
this occasion) thou shalt learn what thy servant will do." This reply
was ambiguous. The words "what thy servant will do" contained no
distinct promise of faithful assistance in the war with the Israelites,
as the expression "thy servant" is only the ordinary periphrasis for "I"
in conversation with a superior. And there is just as little ground for
inferring from [Sa1 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008.md) that David
was disposed to help the Philistines against Saul and the Israelites;
for, as Calovius has observed, even there he gives no such promise, but
"merely asks for information, that he may discover the king's intentions
and feelings concerning him: he simply protests that he has done nothing
to prevent his placing confidence in him, or to cause him to shut him
out of the battle." Judging from his previous acts, it would necessarily
have been against his conscience to fight against his own people.
Nevertheless, in the situation in which he was placed he did not venture
to give a distinct refusal to the summons of the king. He therefore gave
an ambiguous answer, in the hope that God would show him a way out of
this conflict between his inmost conviction and his duty to obey the
Philistian king. He had no doubt prayed earnestly for this in his heart.
And the faithful God helped His servant: first of all by the fact that
Achish accepted his indefinite declaration as a promise of unconditional
fidelity, as his answer "so (לכן, itaque, i.e., that being the case, if
thy conduct answers to thy promise) "I will make thee the keeper of my
head" (i.e., of my person) implies; and still more fully by the fact
that the princes of the Philistines overturned the decision of their
king ([Sa1 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003)..md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 28:3</span></span>

Saul with the witch at Endor. - The invasion of Israel by the
Philistines, which brought David into so difficult a situation, drove
king Saul to despair, so that in utter helplessness he had recourse to
ungodly means of inquiring into the future, which he himself had
formerly prohibited, and to his horror had to hear the sentence of his
own death. This account is introduced with the remark in [Sa1
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#003.md) that Samuel was dead and had been
buried at Ramah (cf. [Sa1 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001.md);
וּבעירו, with an explanatory vav, and indeed in his own city), and that
Saul had expelled "those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out
of the land" (on the terms employed, oboth and yiddonim, see at [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031).md). He had done this in accordance
with the law in [Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031.md); [Lev
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027.md), and [Deu
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md).

[Sa1 28:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#004.md)

When the Philistines advanced and encamped at Shunem, Saul brought all
Israel together and encamped at Gilboa, i.e., upon the mountain of that
name on the north-eastern edge of the plain of Jezreel, which slopes off
from a height of about 1250 feet into the valley of the Jordan, and is
not far from Beisan. On the north of the western extremity of this
mountain was Shunem, the present Sulem or Solam (see at [Jos
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018).md); it was hardly two hours
distant, so that the camp of the Philistines might be seen from Gilboa.
When Saul saw this, he was thrown into such alarm that his heart greatly
trembled. As Saul had been more than once victorious in his conflicts
with the Philistines, his great fear at the sight of the Philistian army
can hardly be attributed to any other cause than the feeling that God
had forsaken him, by which he was suddenly overwhelmed.

[Sa1 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006.md)

In his anxiety he inquired of the Lord; but the Lord neither answered
him by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets, that is to say, not by any
of the three media by which He was accustomed to make known His will to
Israel. בּיהוה שׁאל is the term usually employed to signify inquiring
the will and counsel of God through the Urim and Thummim of the high
priest (see at [Jdg 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001).md); and this is
the case here, with the simple difference that here the other means of
inquiring the counsel of God are also included. On dreams, see at [Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md). According to [Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md), Urim denotes divine revelation
through the high priest by means of the ephod. But the high priest
Abiathar had been with the ephod in David's camp ever since the murder
of the priests at Nob ([Sa1 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020.md).,
[Sa1 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006.md); [Sa1
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007).md). How then could Saul inquire of
God through the Urim? This question, which was very copiously discussed
by the earlier commentators, and handled in different ways, may be
decided very simply on the supposition, that after the death of
Ahimelech and the flight of his son, another high priest had been
appointed at the tabernacle, and another ephod made for him, with the
choshen or breastplate, and the Urim and Thummim. It is no proof to the
contrary that there is nothing said about this. We have no continuous
history of the worship at the tabernacle, but only occasional notices.
And from these it is perfectly clear that the public worship at the
tabernacle was not suspended on the murder of the priests, but was
continued still. For in the first years of David's reign we find the
tabernacle at Gibeon, and Zadok the son of Ahitub, of the line of
Eleazar, officiating there as high priest ([Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039.md), compared with [Ch1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#008.md) and [Ch1
6:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#053).md); from which it follows with
certainty, that after the destruction of Nob by Saul the tabernacle was
removed to Gibeon, and the worship of the congregation continued there.
From this we may also explain in a very simple manner the repeated
allusions to two high priests in David's time ([Sa2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017.md); [Sa2
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md), [Sa2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#029.md), [Sa2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#035.md); [Ch1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011.md); [Ch1
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#016).md). The reason why the Lord did
not answer Saul is to be sought for in the wickedness of Saul, which
rendered him utterly unworthy to find favour with God.

[Sa1 28:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007.md)

Instead of recognising this, however, and searching his own heart, Saul
attempted to obtain a revelation of the future in ungodly ways. He
commanded his servants ([Sa1 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007).md) to
seek for a woman that had a familiar spirit. Baalath-ob: the mistress
(or possessor) of a conjuring spirit, i.e., of a spirit with which the
dead were conjured up, for the purpose of making inquiry concerning the
future (see at [Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031).md). There was
a woman of this kind at Endor, which still exists as a village under the
old name upon the northern shoulder of the Duhy or Little Hermon (see at
[Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011).md), and therefore only two
German (ten English) miles from the Israelitish camp at Gilboa.

[Sa1 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#008.md)

Saul went to this person by night and in disguise, that he might not be
recognised, accompanied by two men; and said to her, "Divine to me
through necromancy, and bring me up whomsoever I tell thee." The words
"bring me up," etc., are an explanation or more precise definition of
"divine unto me," etc. Prophesying by the Ob was probably performed by
calling up a departed spirit from Sheol, and obtaining prophecies, i.e.,
disclosures concerning one's own fate, through the medium of such a
spirit. On the form קסומי (Chethibh), see at [Jdg
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008.md).

[Sa1 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#009.md)

Such a demand placed the woman in difficulty. As Saul had driven the
necromantists out of the land, she was afraid that the unknown visitor
(for it is evident from [Sa1 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#012.md)
that she did not recognise Saul at first) might be laying a snare for
her soul with his request, to put her to death, i.e., might have come to
her merely for the purpose of spying her out as a conjurer of the dead,
and then inflicting capital punishment upon her according to the law
([Lev 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027).md).

[Sa1 28:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#010.md)

But when Saul swore to her that no punishment should fall upon her on
that account (יקּרך אם, "shall assuredly not fall upon thee"), an oath
which showed how utterly hardened Saul was, she asked him, "Whom shall I
bring up to thee?" and Saul replied, "Bring me up Samuel," sc., from the
region of the dead, or Sheol, which was thought to be under the ground.
This idea arose from the fact that the dead were buried in the earth,
and was connected with the thought of heaven as being above the earth.
Just as heaven, regarded as the abode of God and the holy angels and
blessed spirits, is above the earth; so, on the other hand, the region
of death and the dead is beneath the ground. And with our modes of
thought, which are so bound up with time and space, it is impossible to
represent to ourselves in any other way the difference and contrast
between blessedness with God and the shade-life in death.

[Sa1 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#012.md)

The woman then commenced her conjuring arts. This must be supplied from
the context, as [Sa1 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#012.md) merely
states what immediately ensued. "When the woman saw Samuel, she cried
aloud," sc., at the form which appeared to her so unexpectedly. These
words imply most unquestionably that the woman saw an apparition which
she did not anticipate, and therefore that she was not really able to
conjure up departed spirits or persons who had died, but that she either
merely pretended to do so, or if her witchcraft was not mere trickery
and delusion, but had a certain demoniacal background, that the
appearance of Samuel differed essentially from everything she had
experienced and effected before, and therefore filled her with alarm and
horror. The very fact, whoever, that she recognised Saul as soon as
Samuel appeared, precludes us from declaring her art to have been
nothing more than jugglery and deception; for she said to him, "Why hast
thou cheated me, as thou art certainly Saul?" i.e., why hast thou
deceived me as to thy person? why didst thou not tell me that thou wast
king Saul? Her recognition of Saul when Samuel appeared may be easily
explained, if we assume that the woman had fallen into a state of
clairvoyance, in which she recognised persons who, like Saul in his
disguise, were unknown to her by face.

[Sa1 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#013.md)

The king quieted her fear, and then asked her what she had seen;
whereupon she gave him a fuller description of the apparition: "I saw a
celestial being come up from the earth." Elohim does not signify gods
here, nor yet God; still less an angel or a ghost, or even a person of
superior rank, but a celestial (super-terrestrial), heavenly, or
spiritual being.

[Sa1 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#014.md)

Upon Saul's further inquiry as to his form, she replied, "An old man is
ascending, and he is wrapped in a mantle." Mel is the prophet's mantle,
such as Samuel was accustomed to wear when he was alive (see [Sa1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#027).md). Saul recognised from this that
the person who had been called up was Samuel, and he fell upon his face
to the ground, to give expression to his reverence. Saul does not appear
to have seen the apparition itself. But it does not follow from this
that there was no such apparition at all, and the whole was an invention
on the part of the witch. It needs an opened eye, such as all do not
possess, to see a departed spirit or celestial being. The eyes of the
body are not enough for this.

[Sa1 28:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md)

Then Samuel said, "Why hast thou disturbed me (sc., from my rest in
Hades; cf. [Isa 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009).md), to bring me
up?" It follows, no doubt, from this that Samuel had been disturbed from
his rest by Saul; but whether this had been effected by the conjuring
arts of the witch, or by a miracle of God himself, is left undecided.
Saul replied, "I am sore oppressed, for the Philistines fight against
me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, either by
prophets or by dreams; then I had thee called (on the intensified form
ואקראה, vid., Ewald, 228, c.), to make known to me what I am to do." The
omission of any reference to the Urim is probably to be interpreted very
simply from the brevity of the account, and not from the fact that Saul
shrank from speaking about the oracle of the high priest, on account of
the massacre of the priests which had taken place by his command. There
is a contradiction, however, in Saul's reply: for if God had forsaken
him, he could not expect any answer from Him; and if God did not reply
to his inquiry through the regularly appointed media of His revelation,
how could he hope to obtain any divine revelation through the help of a
witch? "When living prophets gave no answer, he thought that a dead one
might be called up, as if a dead one were less dependent upon God than
the living, or that, even in opposition to the will of God, he might
reply through the arts of a conjuring woman. Truly, if he perceived that
God was hostile to him, he ought to have been all the more afraid, lest
His enmity should be increased by his breach of His laws. But fear and
superstition never reason" (Clericus). Samuel points out this
contradiction ([Sa1 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#016).md): "Why dost
thou ask me, since Jehovah hath departed from thee, and is become thine
enemy?" The meaning is: How canst thou expect an answer under these
circumstances from me, the prophet of Jehovah? ערך, from ער, signifies
an enemy here (from עיר, fervour); and this meaning is confirmed by [Psa
139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020.md) and [Dan
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016) (Chald..md). There is all the less
ground for any critical objection to the reading, as the Chaldee and
Vulgate give a periphrastic rendering of "enemy," whilst the lxx, Syr.,
and Arab. have merely paraphrased according to conjectures. Samuel then
announced his fate ([Sa1 28:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#017).md):
"Jehovah hath performed for himself, as He spake by me (לו, for himself,
which the lxx and Vulg. have arbitrarily altered into לך, σοί, tibi (to
thee), is correctly explained by Seb. Schmidt, 'according to His grace,
or to fulfil and prove His truth'); and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom
out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbour David." The perfects
express the purpose of God, which had already been formed, and was now
about to be fulfilled.

[Sa1 28:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#018.md)

The reason for Saul's rejection is then given, as in [Sa1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md) : "Because (כּאשׁר, according
as) thou ... hast not executed the fierceness of His anger upon Amalek,
therefore hath Jehovah done this thing to thee this day." "This thing"
is the distress of which Saul had complained, with its consequences.
ויתּן, that Jehovah may give (= for He will give) Israel also with thee
into the hand of the Philistines. "To-morrow wilt thou and thy sons be
with me (i.e. in Sheol, with the dead); also the camp of Israel will
Jehovah give into the hand of the Philistines," i.e., give up to them to
plunder. The overthrow of the people was to heighten Saul's misery, when
he saw the people plunged with him into ruin through his sin (O. v.
Gerlach). Thus was the last hope taken from Saul. His day of grace was
gone, and judgment was now to burst upon him without delay.

[Sa1 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#020.md)

These words so alarmed him, that he fell his whole length upon the
ground; for he had been kneeling hitherto ([Sa1
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#014).md). He "fell straightway (lit. he
hastened and fell) upon the ground. For he was greatly terrified at the
words of Samuel: there was also no strength in him, because he had eaten
no food the whole day and the whole night," sc., from mental
perturbation or inward excitement. Terror and bodily exhaustion caused
him to fall powerless to the ground.

[Sa1 28:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#021.md)

The woman then came to him and persuaded him to strengthen himself with
food for the journey which he had to take. It by no means follows from
the expression "came unto Saul," that the woman was in an adjoining room
during the presence of the apparition, and whilst Samuel was speaking,
but only that she was standing at some distance off, and came up to him
to speak to him when he had fallen fainting to the ground. As she had
fulfilled his wish at the risk of her own life, she entreated him now to
gratify her wish, and let her set a morsel of bread before him and eat.
"That strength may be in thee when thou goest thy way" (i.e., when thou
returnest).

This narrative, when read without prejudice, makes at once and
throughout the impression conveyed by the Septuagint at [Ch1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#013.md) : ἐπηρώτησε Σαοὺλ ἐν τῷ
ἐγγαστριμύθῳ τοῦ ζητῆσαι, καὶ ἀπεκρίνατο αὐτῷ Σαμουὴλ ὁ προφήτης; and
still more clearly at Ecclus. 46:20, where it is said of Samuel: "And
after his death he prophesied, and showed the king his end, and lifted
up his voice from the earth in prophecy, to blot out the wickedness of
the people." Nevertheless the fathers, reformers, and earlier Christian
theologians, with very few exceptions, assumed that there was not a real
appearance of Samuel, but only an imaginary one. According to the
explanation given by Ephraem Syrus, an apparent image of Samuel was
presented to the eye of Saul through demoniacal arts. Luther and Calvin
adopted the same view, and the earlier Protestant theologians followed
them in regarding the apparition as nothing but a diabolical spectre, a
phantasm, or diabolical spectre in the form of Samuel, and Samuel's
announcement as nothing but a diabolical revelation made by divine
permission, in which truth is mixed with falsehood.

(Note: Thus Luther says (in his work upon the abuses of the Mass, 1522):
"The raising of Samuel by a soothsayer or witch, in [Sa1
28:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#011.md), was certainly merely a
spectre of the devil; not only because the Scriptures state that it was
effected by a woman who was full of devils (for who could believe that
the souls of believers, who are in the hand of God, Ecclus. 3:1, and in
the bosom of Abraham, [Luk 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#031.md), were
under the power of the devil, and of simple men?), but also because it
was evidently in opposition to the command of God that Saul and the
woman inquired of the dead. The Holy Ghost cannot do anything against
this himself, nor can He help those who act in opposition to it." Calvin
also regards the apparition as only a spectre (Hom. 100 in 1 Samuel.):
"It is certain," he says, "that it was not really Samuel, for God would
never have allowed His prophets to be subjected to such diabolical
conjuring. For here is a sorceress calling up the dead from the grave.
Does any one imagine that God wished His prophet to be exposed to such
ignominy; as if the devil had power over the bodies and souls of the
saints which are in His keeping? The souls of the saints are said to
rest and live in God, waiting for their happy resurrection. Besides, are
we to believe that Samuel took his cloak with him into the grave? For
all these reasons, it appears evident that the apparition was nothing
more than a spectre, and that the senses of the woman herself were so
deceived, that she thought she saw Samuel, whereas it really was not
he." The earlier orthodox theologians also disputed the reality of the
appearance of the departed Samuel on just the same grounds; e.g., Seb.
Schmidt (Comm.); Aug. Pfeiffer; Sal. Deyling; and Buddeus, Hist. Eccl.
V. t. ii. p. 243, and many more.)

It was not till the seventeenth century that the opinion was expressed,
that the apparition of Samuel was merely a delusion produced by the
witch, without any real background at all. After Reginald Scotus and
Balth. Becker had given expression to this opinion, it was more fully
elaborated by Ant. van Dale, in his dissert. de divinationibus
idololatricis sub V. T.; and in the so-called age of enlightenment this
was the prevailing opinion, so that Thenius still regards it as an
established fact, not only that the woman was an impostor, but that the
historian himself regarded the whole thing as an imposture. There is no
necessity to refute this opinion at the present day. Even Fr. Boettcher
(de inferis, pp. 111ff.), who looks upon the thing as an imposture,
admits that the first recorder of the occurrence "believed that Samuel
appeared and prophesied, contrary to the expectation of the witch;" and
that the author of the books of Samuel was convinced that the prophet
was raised up and prophesied, so that after his death he was proved to
be the true prophet of Jehovah, although through the intervention of
ungodly arts (cf. [Eze 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#007.md), [Eze
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009).md). But the view held by the early
church does not do justice to the scriptural narrative; and hence the
more modern orthodox commentators are unanimous in the opinion that the
departed prophet did really appear and announce the destruction of Saul,
not, however, in consequence of the magical arts of the witch, but
through a miracle wrought by the omnipotence of God.

This is most decidedly favoured by the fact, that the prophetic
historian speaks throughout of the appearance, not of a ghost, but of
Samuel himself. He does this not only in [Sa1
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#012.md), "When the woman saw Samuel she
cried aloud," but also in [Sa1 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#014.md),
[Sa1 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md), [Sa1
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#016.md), and [Sa1
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#020.md). It is also sustained by the
circumstance, that not only do the words of Samuel to Saul, in [Sa1
28:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#016.md), create the impression that
it is Samuel himself who is speaking; but his announcement contains so
distinct a prophecy of the death of Saul and his sons, that it is
impossible to imagine that it can have proceeded from the mouth of an
impostor, or have been an inspiration of Satan. On the other hand, the
remark of Calvin, to the effect that "God sometimes give to devils the
power of revealing secrets to us, which they have learned from the
Lord," could only be regarded as a valid objection, provided that the
narrative gave us some intimation that the apparition and the speaking
were nothing but a diabolical delusion. But it does nothing of the kind.
It is true, the opinion that the witch conjured up the prophet Samuel
was very properly disputed by the early theologians, and rejected by
Theodoret as "unholy, and even impious;" and the text of Scripture
indicates clearly enough that the very opposite was the case, by the
remark that the witch herself was terrified at the appearance of Samuel
([Sa1 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#012).md). Shbel is therefore quite
correct in saying: "It was not at the call of the idolatrous king, nor
at the command of the witch, - neither of whom had the power to bring
him up, or even to make him hear their voice in his rest in the grave, -
that Samuel came; nor was it merely by divine 'permission,' which is
much too little to say. No, rather it was by the special command of God
that he left his grave (?), like a faithful servant whom his master
arouses at midnight, to let in an inmate of the house who has wilfully
stopped out late, and has been knocking at the door. 'Why do you disturb
me out of my sleep?' would always be the question put to the unwelcome
comer, although it was not by his noise, but really by his master's
command, that he had been aroused. Samuel asked the same question." The
prohibition of witchcraft and necromancy ([Deu
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#011.md); [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md), which the earlier writers quote
against this, does not preclude the possibility of God having, for His
own special reasons, caused Samuel to appear. On the contrary, the
appearance itself was of such a character, that it could not fail to
show to the witch and the king, that God does not allow His prohibitions
to be infringed with impunity. The very same thing occurred here, which
God threatened to idolaters through the medium of Ezekiel ([Eze
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004.md), [Eze
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#007.md),[Eze
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#008).md): "If they come to the prophet, I
will answer them in my own way." Still less is there any force in the
appeal to [Luk 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#027.md)., where Abraham
refuses the request of the rich man in Hades, that he would send Lazarus
to his father's house to preach repentance to his brethren who were
still living, saying, "They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear
them. If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be
persuaded though one rose from the dead." For this does not affirm that
the appearance of a dead man is a thing impossible in itself, but only
describes it as useless and ineffectual, so far as the conversion of the
ungodly is concerned.

The reality of the appearance of Samuel from the kingdom of the dead
cannot therefore be called in question, especially as it has an analogon
in the appearance of Moses and Elijah at the transfiguration of Christ
([Mat 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#003.md); [Luk
9:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#030).md); except that this difference
must not be overlooked, namely, that Moses and Elijah appeared "in
glory," i.e., in a glorified form, whereas Samuel appeared in earthly
corporeality with the prophet's mantle which he had worn on earth. Just
as the transfiguration of Christ was a phenomenal anticipation of His
future heavenly glory, into which He was to enter after His resurrection
and ascension, so may we think of the appearance of Moses and Elijah "in
glory" upon the mount of transfiguration as an anticipation of their
heavenly transfiguration in eternal life with God. It was different with
Samuel, whom God brought up from Hades through an act of His
omnipotence. This appearance is not to be regarded as the appearance of
one who had risen in a glorified body; but though somewhat spirit-like
in its external manifestation, so that it was only to the witch that it
was visible, and not to Saul, it was merely an appearance of the soul of
Samuel, that had been at rest in Hades, in the clothing of the earthly
corporeality and dress of the prophet, which were assumed for the
purpose of rendering it visible. In this respect the appearance of
Samuel rather resembled the appearances of incorporeal angels in human
form and dress, such as the three angels who came to Abraham in the
grove at Mamre (Gen 18), and the angel who appeared to Manoah (Judg 13);
with this exception, however, that these angels manifested themselves in
a human form, which was visible to the ordinary bodily eye, whereas
Samuel appeared in the spirit-like form of the inhabitants of Hades. In
all these cases the bodily form and clothing were only a dress assumed
for the soul or spirit, and intended to facilitate perception, so that
such appearances furnish no proof that the souls of departed men possess
an immaterial corporeality.

(Note: Delitzsch (bibl Psychol. pp. 427ff.) has very properly rejected,
not only the opinion that Samuel and Moses were raised up from the dead
for the purpose of a transient appearance, and then died again, but also
the idea that they appeared in their material bodies, a notion upon
which Calvin rests his argument against the reality of the appearance of
Samuel. But when he gives it as his opinion, that the angels who
appeared in human form assumed this form by virtue of their own power,
inasmuch as they can make themselves visible to whomsoever they please,
and infers till further from this, "that the outward form in which
Samuel and Moses appeared (which corresponded to their form when on this
side the grave) was the immaterial production of their spiritual and
psychical nature," he overlooks the fact, that not only Samuel, but the
angels also, in the cases referred to, appeared in men's clothing, which
cannot possibly be regarded as a production of their spiritual and
psychical nature. The earthly dress is not indispensable to a man's
existence. Adam and Eve had no clothing before the Fall, and there will
be no material clothing in the kingdom of glory; for the "fine linen,
pure and white," with which the bride adorns herself for the marriage
supper of the Lamb, is "the righteousness of saints" ([Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008).md).

[Sa1 28:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#023.md)

On Saul's refusing to take food, his servants (i.e., his two attendants)
also pressed him, so that he yielded, rose up from the ground, and sat
down upon the bed (Mittah: i.e., a bench by the wall of the room
provided with pillows); whereupon the woman quickly sacrificed (served
up) a stalled calf, baked unleavened cakes, and set the food she had
prepared before the king and his servants. The woman did all this from
natural sympathy for the unhappy king, and not, as Thenius supposes, to
remove all suspicion of deception from Saul's mind; for she had not
deceived the king at all.

[Sa1 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#025.md)

When Saul and his servants had eaten, they started upon their way, and
went back that night to Gilboa, which was about ten miles distant, where
the battle occurred the next day, and Saul and his sons fell. "Saul was
too hardened in his sin to express any grief or pain, either on his own
account or because of the fate of his sons and his people. In stolid
desperation he went to meet his fate. This was the terrible end of a man
whom the Spirit of God had once taken possession of and turned into
another man, and whom he had endowed with gifts to be the leader of the
people of God" (O. v. Gerlach).
