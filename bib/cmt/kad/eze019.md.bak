### [Ezekiel Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 19:0</span></span>

Lamentation for the Princes of Israel

Israel, the lioness, brought up young lions in the midst of lions. But
when they showed their leonine nature, they were taken captive by the
nations and led away, one to Egypt, the other to Babylon ([Eze
19:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001).md). The mother herself, once a
vine planted by the water with vigorous branches, is torn from the soil,
so that her strong tendrils wither, and is transplanted into a dry land.
Fire, emanating from a rod of the branches, has devoured the fruit of
the vine, so that not a cane is left to form a ruler's sceptre ([Eze
19:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010).md). - This lamentation, which
bewails the overthrow of the royal house and the banishment of Israel
into exile, forms a finale to the preceding prophecies of the overthrow
of Judah, and was well adapted to annihilate every hope that things
might not come to the worst after all.

[Ezekiel 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 19:1</span></span>

Capture and Exile of the Princes

[Eze 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md). And do thou raise a
lamentation for the princes of Israel, [Eze
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#002.md). And say, Why did thy mother, a
lioness, lie down among lionesses; bring up her whelps among young
lions? [Eze 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#003.md). And she brought up
one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and he learned to take prey;
he devoured man. [Eze 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#004.md). And
nations heard of him; he was caught in their pit, and they brought him
with nose-rings into the land of Egypt. [Eze
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005.md). And when she saw that her hope
was exhausted, overthrown, she took one of her whelps, made it a young
lion. [Eze 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#006.md). And he walked among
lionesses, he became a young lion, and learned to take prey. He devoured
man. [Eze 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#007.md). He knew its widows,
and laid waste their cities; and the land and its fulness became waste,
at the voice of his roaring. [Eze
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#008.md). Then nations round about from
the provinces set up against him, and spread over him their net: he was
caught in their pit. [Eze 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#009.md). And
they put him in the cage with nose-rings, and brought him to the king of
Babylon: brought him into a fortress, that his voice might not be heard
any more on the mountains of Israel.

The princes of Israel, to whom the lamentation applies, are the king
(נשׂיא, as in [Eze 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#010).md), two of whom
are so clearly pointed out in [Eze
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#004.md) and [Eze
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#009.md), that there is no mistaking
Jehoahaz and Jehoiachin. This fact alone is sufficient to protect the
plural נשׂיאי against the arbitrary alteration into the singular נשׂיא,
proposed by Houbigant and Hitzig, after the reading of the lxx. The
lamentation is not addressed to one particular prince, either Zedekiah
(Hitzig) or Jehoiachin (Ros., Maurer), but to Israel as a nation; and
the mother ([Eze 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#002).md) is the national
community, the theocracy, out of which the kings were born, as is
indisputably evident from [Eze 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010.md).
The words from מה to רבצה form one sentence. It yields no good sense to
separate מה אמּך from רבצה, whether we adopt the rendering, "what is thy
mother?" or take מה with לביּא and render it, "how is thy mother a
lioness?" unless, indeed, we supply the arbitrary clause "now, in
comparison with what she was before," or change the interrogative into a
preterite: "how has thy mother become a lioness?" The lionesses, among
which Israel lay down, are the other kingdoms, the Gentile nations. The
words have no connection with [Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md), where Judah is depicted as a
warlike lion. The figure is a different one here. It is not so much the
strength and courage of the lion as its wildness and ferocity that are
the points of resemblance in the passage before us. The mother brings up
her young ones among young lions, so that they learn to take prey and
devour men. גּוּר is the lion's whelp, catulus; כּפיר, the young lion,
which is old enough to go out in search of prey. ותּעל is a Hiphil, in
the tropical sense, to cause to spring up, or grow up, i.e., to bring
up. The thought is the following: Why has Israel entered into fellowship
with the heathen nations? Why, then, has it put itself upon a level with
the heathen nations, and adopted the rapacious and tyrannical nature of
the powers of the world? The question "why then?" when taken with what
follows, involves the reproof that Israel has struck out a course
opposed to its divine calling, and will now have to taste the bitter
fruits of this assumption of heathen ways. The heathen nations have
taken captive its king, and led him away into heathen lands. ישׁמעוּ
אליו, they heard of him (אליו for עליו). The fate of Jehoahaz, to which
[Eze 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#004.md) refers, is related in [Kg2
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md). - [Eze
19:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005.md) refer to Jehoiachin, the son of
Jehoiakim, and not to Zedekiah, as Hitzig imagines. For the fact that
Jehoiachin went out of his own accord to the king of Babylon ([Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012).md), is not at variance with the
figure contained in [Eze 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#008.md),
according to which he was taken (as a lion) in a net. He simply gave
himself up to the king of Babylon because he was unable to escape from
the besieged city. Moreover, Jehoahaz and Jehoiachin are simply
mentioned as examples, because they both fell into the hands of the
world-powers, and their fate showed clearly enough "what the end must
inevitably be, when Israelitish kings became ambitious of being lions,
like the kings of the nations of the world" (Kliefoth). Jehoiakim was
not so suitable an example as the others, because he died in Jerusalem.
נוחלה, which has been explained in different ways, we agree with Ewald
in regarding as the Niphal of יחל = חוּל, in the sense of feeling vexed,
being exhausted or deceived, like the Syriac ̀ewaḥel, viribus defecit,
desperavit. For even in [Gen 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#012.md),
נוחל simply means to wait; and this is inapplicable here, as waiting is
not equivalent to waiting in vain. The change from חוּל to יחל is
established by [Jdg 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#025.md), where חוּל
or חיל occurs in the sense of יחל. In [Jdg
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007.md), the figurative language passes
into a literal description of the ungodly course pursued by the king. He
knew, i.e., dishonoured, its (Israel's, the nation's) widows. The Targum
reads וירע here instead of וידע, and renders it accordingly, "he
destroyed its palaces;" and Ewald has adopted the same rendering. But
רעע, to break, or smash in pieces, e.g., a vessel ([Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009).md), is never used for the
destruction of buildings; and אלמנות does not mean palaces (ארמנות), but
windows. There is nothing in the use of the word in [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022.md) to support the meaning
"palaces," because the palaces are simply called ̀almânōth (widows)
there, with a sarcastic side glance at their desolate and widowed
condition. Other conjectures are still more inadmissible. The thought is
as follows: Jehoiachin went much further than Jehoahaz. He not only
devoured men, but laid hands on defenceless widows, and laid the cities
waste to such an extent that the land with its inhabitants became
perfectly desolate through his rapacity. The description is no doubt
equally applicable to his father Jehoiakim, in whose footsteps
Jehoiachin walked, since Jehoiakim is described in [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md). as a grievous despot and
tyrant. In [Eze 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#008.md) the object רשׁתּם
also belongs to יתּנוּ: they set up and spread out their net. The plural
מצדות is used in a general and indefinite manner: in lofty castles,
mountain-fortresses, i.e., in one of them (cf. [Jdg
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007).md).

[Ezekiel 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010.md)

Destruction of the Kingdom, and Banishment of the People

[Eze 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010.md). Thy mother was like a
vine, planted by the water in thy repose; it became a fruitful and rich
in tendrils from many waters. [Eze
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#011.md). And it had strong shoots for
rulers' sceptres; and its growth ascended among the clouds, and was
visible in its height in the multitude of its branches. [Eze
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012.md). Then it was torn up in fury,
cast to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit; its strong
shoots were broken off, and withered; fire devoured them. [Eze
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#013.md). And now it is planted in the
desert, in a dry and thirsty land. [Eze
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#014.md). There goeth out fire from the
shoot of its branches, devoureth its fruit, so that there is no more a
strong shoot upon it, a sceptre for ruling. - A lamentation it is, and
it will be for lamentation. - From the lamentable fate of the princes
transported to Egypt and Babylon, the ode passes to a description of the
fate, which the lion-like rapacity of the princes is preparing for the
kingdom and people. Israel resembled a vine planted by the water. The
difficult word בּדמך we agree with Hvernick and Kliefoth in tracing to
the verb דּמה, to rest ([Jer 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017).md),
and regard it as synonymous with בּדמי in [Isa
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010.md) : "in thy repose," i.e., in the
time of peaceful, undisturbed prosperity. For neither of the other
renderings, "in thy blood" and "in thy likeness," yields a suitable
meaning. The latter explanation, which originated with Raschi and
Kimchi, is precluded by the fact that Ezekiel always uses the word
דּמוּת to express the idea of resemblance. - For the figure of the vine,
compare [Psa 80:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md). This vine sent out
strong shoots for rulers' sceptres; that is to say, it brought forth
powerful kings, and grew up to a great height, even into the clouds.
עבתים signifies "cloud," lit., thicket of clouds, not only here, but in
[Eze 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md), [Eze
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md),[Eze
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014.md). The rendering "branches" or
"thicket of foliage" is not suitable in any of these passages. The form
of the word is not to be taken as that of a new plural of עבות, the
plural of עב, which occurs in [Sa2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004.md) and [Psa
77:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018.md); but is the plural of עבות, an
interlacing or thicket of foliage, and is simply transferred to the
interlacing or piling up of the clouds. The clause 'ויּרא וגו, and it
appeared, was seen, or became visible, simply serves to depict still
further the glorious and vigorous growth, and needs no such alteration
as Hitzig proposes. This picture is followed in [Eze
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012.md)., without any particle of
transition, by a description of the destruction of this vine. It was
torn up in fury by the wrath of God, cast down to the ground, so that
its fruit withered (compare the similar figures in [Eze
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010).md). מטּה עזּהּ is used
collectively, as equivalent to מטּות עז ([Eze
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#011).md); and the suffix in אכלתהוּ is
written in the singular on account of this collective use of מטּה. The
uprooting ends in the transplanting of the vine into a waste, dry,
unwatered land, - in other words, in the transplanting of the people,
Israel, into exile. The dry land is Babylon, so described as being a
barren soil in which the kingdom of God could not flourish. According to
[Eze 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#014.md), this catastrophe is
occasioned by the princes. The fire, which devours the fruit of the vine
so that it cannot send out any more branches, emanates ממּטּה בדּיה,
from the shoot of its branches, i.e., from its branches, which are so
prolific in shoots. מטּה is the shoot which grew into rulers' sceptres,
i.e., the royal family of the nation. The reference is to Zedekiah,
whose treacherous breach of covenant ([Eze
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015).md) led to the overthrow of the
kingdom and of the earthly monarchy. The picture from [Eze
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012.md) onwards is prophetic. The
tearing up of the vine, and its transplantation into a dry land, had
already commenced with the carrying away of Jeconiah; but it was not
completed till the destruction of Jerusalem and the carrying away of
Zedekiah, which were still in the future at the time when these words
were uttered. - The clause 'קינה היא does not contain a concluding
historical notice, as Hהvernick supposes, but simply the finale of the
lamentation, indicating the credibility of the prediction which it
contains. ותּהי is prophetic, like the perfects from ותּתּשׁ in [Eze
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012.md) onwards; and the meaning is
this: A lamentation forms the substance of the whole chapter; and it
will lead to lamentation, when it is fulfilled.
