List of Those Who Returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua -
Ezra 2

The title ([Ezr 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md) and [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002).md) announces that the list which
follows it (vv. 3-67) contains the number of the men of the people of
Israel who returned to Jerusalem and Judah from the captivity in
Babylon, under the conduct of Zerubbabel, Joshua, and other leaders. It
is composed of separate lists: of the families of the people, vv. 3-35;
of the priests and Levites,[Ezr
2:36-42](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036.md); of the Nethinims and servants
of Solomon, vv. 43-58; of families who could not prove their Israelite
descent, and of certain priests whose genealogy could not be found, [Ezr
2:59-63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#059.md); and it closes with the
sum-total of the persons, and of their beasts of burden, [Ezr
2:64-67](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#064.md). This is followed by an
enumeration of the gifts which they brought with them for the temple
([Ezr 2:68](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#068.md) and [Ezr
2:69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069).md), and by a final statement with
regard to the entire list ([Ezr 2:70](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#070).md).
Nehemiah also, when he desired to give a list of the members of the
community at Jerusalem, met with the same document, and incorporated it
in the book which bears his name (Neh 7:6-73). It is also contained in 1
Esdr. 5:7-45. The three texts, however, exhibit in the names, and still
more so in the numbers, such variations as involuntarily arise in
transcribing long lists of names and figures. The sum-total of 42,630
men and 7337 servants and maids is alike in all three texts; but the
addition of the separate numbers in the Hebrew text of Ezra gives only
29,818, those in Nehemiah 31,089, and those in the Greek Esdras 30,143
men. In our elucidation of the list, we shall chiefly have respect to
the differences between the texts of Ezra and Nehemiah, and only notice
the variations in 1 Esdras so far as they may appear to conduce to a
better understanding of the matter of our text.

[Ezra 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 2:1</span></span>

The title. - "These are the children of the province that went up out of
the captivity, of the carrying away (i.e., of those which had been
carried away), whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away unto
Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, every one to his
city." In [Neh 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#006.md) לבבל is omitted,
through an error of transcription caused by the preceding בּבל; and
וליהוּדה stands instead of ויהוּדה, which does not, however, affect the
sense. המּדינה is the province whose capital was Jerusalem ([Neh
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#003).md), i.e., the province of Judaea as
a district of the Persian empire; so [Ezr
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008.md); [Neh
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002.md). The Chethiv נבוכדנצור is similar
to the form Nebucadrezor, [Jer 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md),
and is nearer to the Babylonian form of this name than the usual
biblical forms Nebucadnezzar or Nebucadrezzar. For further remarks on
the various forms of this name, see on [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md). They returned "each to his city,"
i.e., to the city in which he or his ancestors had dwelt before the
captivity. Bertheau, on the contrary, thinks that, "though in the
allotment of dwelling-places some respect would certainly be had to the
former abode of tribes and families, yet the meaning cannot be that
every one returned to the locality where his forefathers had dwelt:
first, because it is certain (?) that all memorial of the connection of
tribes and families was frequently obliterated, comp. below, [Neh
7:61-64](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#061.md); and then, because a small
portion only of the former southern kingdom being assigned to the
returned community, the descendants of dwellers in those towns which lay
without the boundaries of the new state could not return to the cities
of their ancestors." True, however, as this may be, the city of each man
cannot mean that "which the authorities, in arranging the affairs of the
community, assigned to individuals as their domicile, and of which they
were reckoned inhabitants in the lists then drawn up for the sake of
levying taxes," etc. (Bertheau). This would by no means be expressed by
the words, "they returned each to his own city." We may, on the
contrary, correctly say that the words hold good potiori, i.e., they are
used without regard to exceptions induced by the above-named
circumstance. אשׁר־בּאוּ, [Ezr 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md),
corresponds with the העלים of [Ezr
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md); hence in [Neh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007.md) we find also the participle בּאים.
They came with Zerubbabel, etc., that is, under their conduct and
leadership. Zerubbabel (Ζοροβάβελ, זרבּבל or זרוּבבל, probably
abbreviated from בּבל זרוּע, in Babylonia satus seu genitus) the son of
Shealtiel was a descendant of the captive king Jehoiachin (see on [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017).md), and was probably on account of
this descent made leader of the expedition, and royal governor of the
new settlement, by Cyrus. Jeshua (ישׁוּע, the subsequently abbreviated
form of the name Jehoshua or Joshua, which is used [Neh
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017.md) also for Joshua the son of Nun,
the contemporary of Moses) the son of Josedech (Hagg. [Jos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001).md), and the grandson of Seraiah the
high priest, who was put to death by Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah, was the
first high priest of the restored community; see on [Ch1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015.md). Besides those of Zerubbabel and
Joshua, nine (or in Nehemiah more correctly ten) names, probably of
heads of families, but of whom nothing further is known, are placed
here. 1. Nehemiah, to be distinguished from the well-known Nehemiah the
son of Hachaliah, [Neh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md); 2.
Seraiah, instead of which we have in [Neh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007.md) Azariah; 3. Reeliah, in Nehemiah,
Raamiah; 4. Nahamani in Nehemiah, Εὐηνέος in 1 Esdras 5:8, omitted in
the text of Ezra; 5. Mordecai, not the Mordecai of the book of Esther
([Est 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005)..md); 6. Bilshan; 7. Mispar, in
Nehemiah Mispereth; 8. Bigvai; 9. Rehum, in 1 Esdras Ροΐ́μος; 10. Baanah.
These ten, or reckoning Zerubbabel and Joshua, twelve men, are evidently
intended, as leaders of the returning nation, to represent the new
community as the successor of the twelve tribes of Israel. This is also
unmistakeably shown by the designation, the people of Israel, in the
special title, and by the offering of twelve sin-offerings, according to
the number of the tribes of Israel, at the dedication of the new temple,
[Ezr 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#016.md). The genealogical relation,
however, of these twelve representatives to the twelve tribes cannot be
ascertained, inasmuch as we are told nothing of the descent of the last
ten. Of these ten names, one meets indeed with that of Seraiah, [Neh
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#003.md); of Bigvai, in the mention of the
sons of Bigvai, [Ezr 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#014.md); of Rehum,
[Neh 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#017.md); [Neh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#003.md); and of Baanah, [Neh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#028.md); but there is nothing to make
the identity of these persons probable. Even in case they were all of
them descended from members of the former kingdom of Judah, this is no
certain proof that they all belonged also to the tribes of Judah and
Benjamin, since even in the reign of Rehoboam pious Israelites of the
ten tribes emigrated thither, and both at and after the destruction of
the kingdom of the ten tribes, many Israelites might have taken refuge
and settled in Judah. The last words, [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md), "The number of the men of the
people of Israel," contain the special title of the first division of
the following list, with which the titles in [Ezr
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036.md), [Ezr
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040.md), [Ezr
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043.md), and [Ezr
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#055.md) correspond. They are called the
people of Israel, not the people of Judah, because those who returned
represented the entire covenant people.

The differences in the names are unimportant. In [Ezr
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#006.md) the ו copulative inserted between
the names ישׁוּע and יואב, both in Nehemiah and 1 Esdras, is wanting;
the name בּני ([Ezr 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#010).md) is written
בּנּוּי in Nehemiah ([Neh 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#015).md); for
יורה ([Ezr 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#018).md), [Neh
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#024.md) has חריף, evidently another name
for the same person, Jorah having a similarity of sound with יורה,
harvest-rain, and חריף with חרף, harvest; for נּבּר ([Ezr
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#020).md), [Neh
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#025.md) more correctly read גּבעון, the
name of the town; and for ערים קרית ([Ezr
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#025).md), [Neh
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#029.md) has the more correct form יערים
קרית: the sons of Azmaveth ([Ezr 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#024).md)
stands in Nehemiah as the men of Beth-azmaveth; while, on the other
hand, for the sons of Nebo ([Ezr
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#029).md), we have in Nehemiah ([Neh
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#033).md) the men of Nebo Acher, where אחר
seems to have been inserted inadvertently, Elam Acher so soon following.

(Note: This view is more probable than the notion of Dietrich, in A.
Merx, Archiv fr wissensch. Forschung des A. T., No. 3, p. 345, that by
the addition אחר in Nehemiah, the Nebo in Judah is distinguished from
the Nebo in Reuben.)

The names Bezai, Jorah, and Hashum ([Ezr
2:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#017).md) are transposed in Nehemiah
([Neh 7:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#022).md) thus, Hashum, Bezai,
and Harif; as are also Lod, etc., and Jericho, ([Ezr
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#033.md), [Ezr
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#034).md) into Jericho and Lod, etc.
(Nehemiah, vv. 36, 37). Lastly, the sons of Magbish ([Ezr
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#030).md) are omitted in Nehemiah; and the
sons of Bethlehem and the men of Netophah ([Ezr
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#021.md) and [Ezr
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#022).md) are in Nehemiah ([Neh
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#026).md) reckoned together, and stated to
be 188 instead of 123 + 56 = 179. A glance at the names undoubtedly
shows that those numbered 1-17 are names of races or houses: those from
18-27, and from 31-33, are as certainly names of towns; there,
therefore, inhabitants of towns are named. This series is, however,
interrupted by Nos. 28-30; Harim being undoubtedly, and Magbish very
probably, names not of places, but of persons; while the equality of the
number of the other, Elam 1254, with that of Elam (No. 6), seems
somewhat strange. To this must be added, that Magbish is wanting both in
Nehemiah and 2 Esdras, and the other Elam in 1 Esdras; while, in place
of the sons of Harim 320, we have in 1 Esdr. 5:16, in a more appropriate
position, υἱοὶ Ἀρομ 32. Hence Bertheau infers that Nos. 28 and 29, sons
of Magbish and sons of Elam Acher (vv. 30 and 31), are spurious, and
that Harim should be written Ἀρώμ, and inserted higher up. The reasons
for considering these three statements doubtful have certainly some
weight; but considering the great untrustworthiness of the statements in
the first book of Esdras, and the other differences in the three lists
arising, as they evidently do, merely from clerical errors, we could not
venture to call them decisive.

Of the names of houses or races (Nos. 1-17 and 30), we meet with many in
other lists of the time of Ezra and Nehemiah;

(Note: In the list of those who went up with Ezra (Ezra 8), the sons of
Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Adin, Elam, Shephatiah, Joab, Bebai, Azgad,
Adonikam, Bigvai, and, according to the original text ([Ezr
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#008.md), [Ezr
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#010).md), also the sons of Zattu and
Bani. In the lists of those who had taken strange wives (Ezra 10) we
meet with individuals of the sons of Parosh, Elam, Zattu, Bebai, Bani,
Pahath-Moab, Harim, Hashum, and of the sons of Nebo. Finally, in the
lists of the heads of the people in the time of Nehemiah ([Neh
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#015)..md) appear the names of Parosh,
Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, Azgad, Bebai, Bigvai, Adin, Ater,
Hashum, Bezai, Harif, Harim, Anathoth, together with others which do not
occur in the list we are not treating of.)

whence we perceive, (1) that of many houses only a portion returned with
Zerubbabel and Joshua, the remaining portion following with Ezra; (2)
that heads of houses are entered not by their personal names, but by
that of the house. The names, for the most part, descend undoubtedly
from the time anterior to the captivity, although we do not meet with
them in the historical books of that epoch, because those books give
only the genealogies of those more important personages who make a
figure in history. Besides this, the genealogies in Chronicles are very
incomplete, enumerating for the most part only the families of the more
ancient times. Most, if not all, of these races or houses must be
regarded as former inhabitants of Jerusalem. Nor can the circumstance
that the names given in the present list are not found in the lists of
the inhabitants of Jerusalem (1 Chron 9 and Neh 11) be held as any valid
objection; for in those lists only the heads of the great races of Judah
and Benjamin are named, and not the houses which those races comprised.
The names of cities, on the other hand (Nos. 18-33), are for the most
part found in the older books of the Old Testament: Gibeon in [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md); Bethlehem in [Rut
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#002.md); [Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md); Netophah, [Sa2
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#028.md) - see comm. on [Ch1
2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054.md); Anathoth in [Jos
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#018.md); [Jer
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md); Kirjath-jearim, Chephirah, and
Beeroth, as cities of the Gibeonites, in [Jos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017.md); Ramah and Geba, which often
occur in the histories of Samuel and Saul, also in [Jos
18:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024.md); Michmash in [Sa1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md), [Sa1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005.md); [Isa
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md); Bethel and Ai in [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md); and Jericho in [Jos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013.md), and elsewhere. All these places
were situate in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, and were probably taken
possession of by former inhabitants or their children immediately after
the return. Azmaveth or Beth-azmaveth ([Neh
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#028).md) does not occur in the earlier
history, nor is it mentioned out of this list, except in [Neh
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#029.md), according to which it must be
sought for in the neighbourhood of Geba. It has not, however, been as
yet discovered; for the conjecture of Ritter, Erdk. xvi. p. 519, that it
may be el-Hizme, near Anta, is unfounded. Nor can the position of Nebo
be certainly determined, the mountain of that name ([Num
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#003).md) being out of the question. Nob
or Nobe ([Sa1 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002).md) has been thought
to be this town. Its situation is suitable; and this view is supported
by the fact that in [Neh 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#031.md)., Nob,
and not Nebo, is mentioned, together with many of the places here named;
in [Ezr 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#043.md), however, the sons of
Nebo are again specified. As far as situation is concerned, Nuba, or
Beit-Nuba (Robinson's Biblical Researches, p. 189), may, as Bertheau
thinks, correspond with this town. Magbish was by many older expositors
regarded as the name of a place, but is certainly that of a person; and
no place of such a name is known. The localities Lod, Hadid, and Ono
([Ezr 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#033).md) first occur in the later
books of the Old Testament. On Lod and Ono, see comm. on [Ch1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md). חדיד is certainly Ἀδιδά (1 Macc.
12:28, 13:13), not far from Lydda, where there is still a place called
el-Hadithe, Arab. 'l-hdı̂th (Robinson's Biblical Researches, p. 186).
סנאה, [Ezr 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#035.md), is identified by
older expositors with Σεννά, ν͂ν Μαγδαλσεννά, which Jerome describes as
terminus Judae, in septimo lapide Jerichus contra septentrionalem plagam
(Onom. ed. Lars. et Parth. p. 332f.); in opposition to which, Robinson,
in his above-cited work, identifies Magdal-Senna with a place called
Mejdel, situate on the summit of a high hill about eighteen miles north
of Jericho. The situation, however, of this town does not agree with the
distance mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome, and the name Mejdel, i.e.,
tower, is not of itself sufficient to identify it with Magdal-Senna. The
situation of the Senaah in question is not as yet determined; it must be
sought for, however, at no great distance from Jericho. Of the towns
mentioned in the present list, we find that the men of Jericho, Senaah,
and Gibeon, as well as the inhabitants of Tekoa, Zanoah, Beth-haccerem,
Mizpah, Beth-zur, and Keilah, assisted at the building of the walls of
Jerusalem under Nehemiah ([Neh 3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#002.md),
[Neh 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#007).md). A larger number of towns of
Judah and Benjamin is specified in the list in [Neh
11:25-35](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025.md), whence we perceive that in
process of time a greater multitude of Jews returned from captivity and
settled in the land of their fathers.

[Ezra 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ezr 2:36</span></span>

The list of the priests is identical, both in names and numbers, with
that of [Neh 7:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#039.md). These are:

The sons of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua 973 The sons of Immer 1052
The sons of Pashur 1247 The sons of Harim 1017 Total 4289

Jedaiah is the head of the second order of priests in [Ch1
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#007.md). If, then, Jedaiah here
represents this order, the words "of the house of Jeshua" must not be
applied to Jeshua the high priest; the second order belonging in all
probability to the line of Ithamar, and the high-priestly race, on the
contrary, to that of Eleazar. We also meet the name Jeshua in other
priestly families, e.g., as the name of the ninth order of priests in
[Ch1 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#011.md), so that it may be the old
name of another priestly house. Since, however, it is unlikely that no
priest of the order from which the high priest descended should return,
the view that by Joshua the high priest is intended, and that the sons
of Jedaiah were a portion of the house to which Joshua the high priest
belonged, is the more probable one. In this case Jedaiah is not the name
of the second order of priests, but of the head of a family of the
high-priestly race. Immer is the name of the sixteenth order of priests,
[Ch1 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#014.md). Pashur does not occur
among the orders of priests in 1 Chron 24; but we find the name, [Ch1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012.md), and [Neh
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#012.md), among the ancestors of Adaiah,
a priest of the order of Malchijah; the Pashur of Jer 20 and [Jer
21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md) being, on the contrary, called
the son of Immer, i.e., a member of the order of Immer. Hence Bertheau
considers Pashur to have been the name of a priestly race, which first
became extensive, and took the place of an older and perhaps extinct
order, after the time of David. Gershom of the sons of Phinehas, and
Daniel of the sons of Ithamar, are said, [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md), to have gone up to Jerusalem with
Ezra, while the order to which they belonged is not specified. Among the
priests who had married strange wives ([Ezr
10:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#018).md) are named, sons of Jeshua,
Immer, Harim, Pashur; whence it has been inferred "that, till the time
of Ezra, only the four divisions of priests here enumerated had the
charge of divine worship in the new congregation" (Bertheau). On the
relation of the names in [Ezr 2:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036.md)
to those in [Neh 10:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#003.md) and 12:1-22,

Levites, Nethinim, and Solomon's servants. Comp. Neh. 7:43-60.

Ezra Neh. Levites: the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the sons of
Hodivah 74 74 Singers: sons of Asaph 128 148 Sons of the door-keepers;
sons of Shallum, Ater. Etc. 139 138 Nethinim and servants of Solomon, in
all 392 392 Total 733 752

The Levites are divided into three classes: Levites in the stricter
sense of the word, i.e., assistants of the priests in divine worship,
singers, and door-keepers; comp. [Ch1
24:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020.md), [Ch1
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#025.md), and 26:1-19. Of Levites in the
stricter sense are specified the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel of the sons
of Hodaviah (וקדמיאל, and הודויה of our text are evidently correct
readings; and לקדמיאל and הודיה, Keri להודיּה, [Neh
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#043), errors of transcription.md). The
addition, "of the sons of Hodaviah," belongs to Kadmiel, to distinguish
him from other Levites of similar name. Jeshua and Kadmiel were,
according to [Ezr 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#009.md), chiefs of two
orders of Levites in the times of Zerubbabel and Joshua. These names
recur as names of orders of Levites in [Neh
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#010.md). We do not find the sons of
Hodaviah in the lists of Levites in Chronicles.

[Ezr 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#041.md)

Of singers, only the sons of Asaph, i.e., members of the choir of Asaph,
returned. In [Neh 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017.md) three orders
are named, Bakbukiah evidently representing the order of Heman.

[Ezr 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#042.md)

Of door-keepers, six orders or divisions returned, among which those of
Shallum, Talmon, and Akkub dwelt, according to [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md), at Jerusalem before the
captivity. Of the sons of Ater, Hatita and Shobai, nothing further is
known.

Ezra 2:43-58

The Nethinim, i.e., temple-bondsmen, and the servants of Solomon, are
reckoned together, thirty-five families of Nethinim and ten of the
servants of Solomon being specified. The sum-total of these amounting
only to 392, each family could only have averaged from eight to nine
individuals. The sons of Akkub, Hagab and Asnah ([Ezr
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#045.md), [Ezr
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#046.md), and [Ezr
2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#050).md), are omitted in Nehemiah; the
name Shalmai ([Ezr 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#046).md) is in [Neh
7:48](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#048.md) written Salmai; and for נפיסים,
[Ezr 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#050.md), [Neh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#052.md) has נפושׁסים, a form combined
from נפוּסים and נפישׁים. All other variations relate only to
differences of form. Because Ziha (ציהא, [Ezr
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043).md) again occurs in [Neh
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#021.md) as one of the chiefs of the
Nethinim, and the names following seem to stand in the same series with
it, Bertheau insists on regarding these names as those of divisions.
This cannot, however, be correct; for Ziha is in [Neh
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#021.md) the name of an individual, and
in the present list also the proper names are those of individuals, and
only the sons of Ziha, Hasupha, etc., can be called families or
divisions. Plural words alone, Mehunim and Nephisim, are names of races
or nations; hence the sons of the Mehunim signify individuals belonging
to the Mehunim, who, perhaps, after the victory of King Uzziah over that
people, were as prisoners of war made vassals for the service of the
sanctuary. So likewise may the sons of the Nephisim have been prisoners
of war of the Ishmaelite race נפישׁ. Most of the families here named
may, however, have been descendants of the Gibeonites ([Jos
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021.md), [Jos
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027).md). The servants of Solomon must
not be identified with the Canaanite bond-servants mentioned [Kg1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020.md)., [Ch2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#007.md)., but were probably prisoners of
war of some other nation, whom Solomon sentenced to perform, as
bondsmen, similar services to those imposed upon the Gibeonites. The
sons of these servants are again mentioned in [Neh
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#003.md). In other passages they are
comprised under the general term Nethinim, with whom they are here
computed. Among the names, that of הצּבים פּכרת ([Ezr
2:57](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#057).md), i.e., catcher of gazelles, is a
singular one; the last name, אמי, is in [Neh
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#059.md) אמון.

[Ezra 2:59](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">ezr 2:59</span></span>

Those who went up with, but could not prove that they pertained to, the
nation of Israel. Comp. [Neh 7:61](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#061.md) and
[Neh 7:62](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#062.md). - Three such families are
named, consisting of 652, or according to Nehemiah of 642, persons.
These went up, with those who returned, from Tel-melah (Salthill) and
Tel-harsa (Thicket or Forest Hill), names of Babylonian districts or
regions, the situations of which cannot be ascertained. The words also
which follow, אמּר אדּן כּרוּב, are obscure, but are certainly not the
names of individuals, the persons who went up not being specified till
[Ezr 2:60](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#060.md). The words are names of
places, but it is uncertain whether the three are used to express one or
three places. In favour of the notion that they designate but one
locality, may be alleged that in [Ezr
2:60](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#060.md) only three races are named, which
would then correspond with the districts named in [Ezr
2:59](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#059.md) : Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, and
Cherub-Addan-Immer; a race from each district joining those who went up
to Jerusalem. The three last words, however, may also designate three
places in close proximity, in which one of the races of [Ezr
2:60](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#060.md) might be dwelling. These could
not show their father's house and their seed, i.e., genealogy, whether
they were of Israel. הם, as well as the suffixes of זרעם and בּית־אבותם,
refers to the persons named in [Ezr
2:60](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#060.md). They could not show that the
houses of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, after which they were called,
belonged to Israel, nor that they themselves were of Israelitish origin.
Cler. well remarks: Judaicam religionem dudum sequebantur, quam ob rem
se Judaeos censebant; quamvis non possent genealogicas ullas tabulas
ostendere, ex quibus constaret, ex Hebraeis oriundos esse. One of these
names, Nekoda, [Ezr 2:48](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#048.md), occurring
among those of the Nethinim, Bertheau conjectures that while the sons of
Nekoda here spoken of claimed to belong to Israel, the objection was
made that they might belong to the sons of Nekoda mentioned [Ezr
2:48](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#048.md), and ought therefore to be
reckoned among the Nethinim. Similar objections may have been made to
the two other houses. Although they could not prove their Israelite
origin, they were permitted to go up to Jerusalem with the rest, the
rights of citizenship alone being for the present withheld. Hence we
meet with none of these names either in the enumeration of the heads and
houses of the people, [Neh 10:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#015.md),
or in the list Ezra 10:25-43.

[Ezra 2:61](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">ezr 2:61</span></span>

Priests who could not prove themselves members of the priesthood. Comp.
[Neh 7:63-65](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#063.md). - Three such families
are named: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of
Barzillai. These could not discover their family registers, and were
excluded from the exercise of priestly functions. Of these three names,
that of Hakkoz occurs as the seventh order of priests; but the names
alone did not suffice to prove their priesthood, this being also borne
by other persons. Comp. [Neh 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#004.md). The
sons of Barzillai were the descendants of a priest who had married a
daughter, probably an heiress (Num), of Barzillai the Gileadite, so well
known in the history of David ([Sa2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027.md); [Sa2
19:32-39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#032.md); [Kg1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007).md), and had taken her name for the
sake of taking possession of her inheritance (the suffix שׁמם refers to
בּנות; see on [Num 27:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001).md). That by
contracting this marriage he had not renounced for himself and his
descendants his priestly privileges, is evident from the fact, that when
his posterity returned from captivity, they laid claim to these
privileges. The assumption, however, of the name of Barzillai might have
cast such a doubt upon their priestly origin as to make it necessary
that this should be proved from the genealogical registers, and a search
in these did not lead to the desired discovery. כּתבם is their ספר יחשׂ,
[Neh 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md), the book or record in which
their genealogy was registered. The title of this record was המּתיחשׁים,
the Enregistered: the word is in apposition to כּתבם, and the plural
נמצאוּ agrees with it, while in [Neh
7:64](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#064.md) the singular נמצא agrees with
כתבם. They were declared to be polluted from the priesthood, i.e., they
were excluded from the priesthood as polluted or unclean. The
construction of the Pual יגאלוּ with מן is significant.

[Ezra 2:63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">ezr 2:63</span></span>

The Tirshatha, the secular governor of the community, i.e., as is
obvious from a comparison of [Neh 7:65](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#065.md)
with [Neh 7:70](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070.md), Zerubbabel, called
[Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md) יהוּדה פּחת. תּרשׁתא, always
used with the article, is undoubtedly the Persian designation of the
governor or viceroy. Nehemiah is also so called in [Neh
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009.md) and [Neh
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002.md), and likewise הפּחה, [Neh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#026.md). The meaning of the word is
still matter of dispute. Some derive it from the Persian trsı̂dn, to
fear, and trs, fear = the feared or respected one (Meier, Wurzelb. p.
714); others from Persian trš, acer, auster, the strict ruler; others,
again (with Benfey, die Monatsnamen, p. 196), from the Zend. thvôrestar
(nom. thvôresta), i.e., praefectus, penes quem est imperium: comp.
Gesenius, thes. p. 1521. The Tirshatha decided that they were not to eat
of the most holy things till there should arise a priest with Urim and
Thummim, i.e., to give a final decision by means of Urim and Thummim.
עמד, according to the later usage of the language, is equivalent to
קוּם, comp. [Dan 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#003.md); [Dan
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002.md), and other places. The
prohibition to eat of the most holy things (comp. on [Lev
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003).md) involved the prohibition to
approach the most holy objects, e.g., the altar of burnt-offering ([Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md); [Exo
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010).md), and to enter the most holy
place, and thus excludes from specific priestly acts: without, however,
denying a general inclusion among the priestly order, or abolishing a
claim to the priestly revenues, so far as these were not directly
connected with priestly functions. On Urim and Thummim, see on [Exo
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030.md). From the words, "till a priest
shall arise," etc., it is evident that the then high priest was not in a
position to entreat, and to pronounce, the divine decision by Urim and
Thummim. The reason of this, however, need not be sought in the
personality of Joshua (Ewald, Gesch. iv. 95), nor supposed to exist in
such a fact as that he might not perhaps have been the eldest son of his
father, and therefore not have had full right to the priesthood. This
conjecture rests upon utterly erroneous notions of the Urim and Thummim,
upon a subjectivistic view, which utterly evaporates the objective
reality of the grace with which the high priest was in virtue of his
office endowed. The obtainment of the divine decision by Urim and
Thummim presupposes the gracious presence of Jahve in the midst of His
people Israel. And this had been connected by the Lord Himself with the
ark of the covenant, and with its cherubim-overshadowed mercy-seat, from
above which He communed with His people ([Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022).md). The high priest, bearing upon
his breast the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim, was to appear
before Jahve, and, bringing before Him the judgment of Israel, to
entreat the divine decision ([Exo
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030.md); [Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021).md). The ark of the covenant with
the mercy-seat was thus, in virtue of the divine promise, the place of
judgment, where the high priest was to inquire of the Lord by means of
the Urim and Thummim. This ark, however, was no longer in existence,
having been destroyed when Solomon's temple was burned by the Chaldeans.
Those who returned with Zerubbabel were without the ark, and at first
without a temple. In such a state of affairs the high priest could not
appear before Jahve with the breastplate and the Urim and Thummim to
entreat His decision. The books of Samuel, indeed, relate cases in which
the divine will was consulted by Urim and Thummim, when the ark of the
covenant was not present for the high priest to appear before (comp.
[Sa1 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#004.md), [Sa1
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006.md), [Sa1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md), etc., [Sa1
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#018).md); whence it appears that the
external or local presence of the ark was not absolutely requisite for
this purpose. Still these cases occurred at a time when the congregation
of Israel as yet possessed the ark with the Lord's cherubim-covered
mercy-seat, though this was temporarily separated from the holy of
holies of the tabernacle. Matters were in a different state at the
return from the captivity. Then, not only were they without either ark
or temple, but the Lord had not as yet re-manifested His gracious
presence in the congregation; and till this should take place, the high
priest could not inquire of the Lord by Urim and Thummim. In the hope
that with the restoration of the altar and temple the Lord would again
vouchsafe His presence to the returned congregation, Zerubbabel expected
that a high priest would arise with Urim and Thummim to pronounce a
final decision with regard to those priests who could not prove their
descent from Aaron's posterity. This expectation, however, was
unfulfilled. Zerubbabel's temple remained unconsecrated by any visible
token of Jahve's presence, as the place where His name should dwell. The
ark of the covenant with the cherubim, and the Shechinah in the cloud
over the cherubim, were wanting in the holy of holies of this temple.
Hence, too, we find no single notice of any declaration of the divine
will or the divine decision by Urim and Thummim in the period subsequent
to the captivity; but have, on the contrary, the unanimous testimony of
the Rabbis, that after the Babylonian exile God no longer manifested His
will by Urim and Thummim, this kind of divine revelation being reckoned
by them among the five things which were wanting in the second temple.

The whole number of those who returned, their servants, maids, and
beasts of burden. Comp. [Neh 7:66-69](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#066.md).
- The sum-total of the congregation (כּאחד, as one, i.e., reckoned
together; comp. [Ezr 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#009.md); [Ezr
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#020).md) is the same in both texts, as
also in 1 Esdras, viz., 42,360; the sums of the separate statements
being in all three different, and indeed amounting in each to less than
the given total. The separate statements are as follow: -

AccordingtoEzra AccordingtoNehemiah Accordingto1 Esdras Men of Israel
24,144 25,406 26,390 Priests 4,289 4,289 2,388 Levites 341 360 341
Nethinim and servants of Solomon 392 392 372 Those who could not prove
their Israelitish origin 652 642 652 Total 29,818 31,089 30,143

These differences are undoubtedly owing to mere clerical errors, and
attempts to reconcile them in other ways cannot be justified. Many older
expositors, both Jewish and Christian (Seder olam, Raschi, Ussher, J. H.
Mich., and others), were of opinion that only Jews and Benjamites are
enumerated in the separate statements, while the sum-total includes also
those Israelites of the ten tribes who returned with them. In opposing
this notion, it cannot, indeed, be alleged that no regard at all is had
to members of the other tribes (Bertheau); for the several families of
the men of Israel are not designated according to their tribes, but
merely as those whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken away to Babylon; and among
these would certainly be included, as Ussher expressly affirms, many
belonging to the other tribes who had settled in the kingdom of Judah.
But the very circumstances, that neither in the separate statements nor
in the sum-total is any allusion made to tribal relations, and that even
in the case of those families who could not prove their Israelitish
origin the only question was as to whether they were of the houses and
of the seed of Israel, exclude all distinction of tribes, and the
sum-total is evidently intended to be the joint sum of the separate
numbers. Nor can it be inferred, as J. D. Mich. conjectures, that
because the parallel verse to [Ezr
2:64](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#064.md) of our present chapter, viz., 1
Esdr. 5:41, reads thus, "and all of Israel from twelve years old and
upwards, besides the servants and maids, were 42,360," the separate
statements are therefore the numbers only of those of twenty years old
and upwards, while the sum-total includes those also from twelve to
twenty years of age. The addition "from twelve years and upwards" is
devoid of critical value; because, if it had been genuine, the
particular "from twenty years old and upwards" must have been added to
the separate statements. Hence it is not even probable that the author
of the 1st book of Esdras contemplated a reconciliation of the
difference by this addition. In transcribing such a multitude of names
and figures, errors could scarcely be avoided, whether through false
readings of numbers or the omission of single items. The sum-total being
alike in all three texts, we are obliged to assume its correctness.

[Ezr 2:65](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#065.md)

"Besides these, their servants and their maids, 7337." אלּה is, by the
accent, connected with the preceding words. The further statement, "And
there were to them (i.e., they had) 200 singing men and singing women,"
is striking. The remark of Bertheau, that by להם the property of the
community is intended to be expressed, is incorrect; להם denotes merely
computation among, and does not necessarily imply proprietorship. J. D.
Mich., adopting the latter meaning, thought that oxen and cows
originally stood in the text, and were changed by transcribers into
singing men and singing women, "for both words closely resemble each
other in appearance in the Hebrew." Berth., on the contrary, remarks
that שׁורים, oxen, might easily be exchanged for שׁררים or משׁררים, but
that שׁור has no feminine form for the plural, and that פּרות, cows, is
very different from משׁררות; that hence we are obliged to admit that in
the original text שׁורים stood alone, and that after this word had been
exchanged for משׁררים, משׁררות was added as its appropriate complement.
Such fanciful notions can need no serious refutation. Had animals been
spoken of as property, להם would not have been used, but a suffix, as in
the enumeration of the animals in [Ezr
2:66](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#066.md). Besides, oxen and cows are not
beasts of burden used in journeys, like the horses, mules, camels, and
asses enumerated in [Ezr 2:66](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#066.md), and
hence are here out of place. וּמשׁררות משׁררים are singing men and
singing women, in 1 Esdras ψάλται καὶ ψαλτῳδοί, who, as the Rabbis
already supposed, were found among the followers of the returning Jews,
ut laetior esset Israelitarum reditus. The Israelites had from of old
employed singing men and singing women not merely for the purpose of
enhancing the cheerfulness of festivities, but also for the singing of
lamentations on sorrowful occasions; comp. [Ecc
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md); [Ch2
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025.md) : these, because they sang and
played for hire, are named along with the servants and maids, and
distinguished from the Levitical singers and players. In stead of 200,
we find both in Nehemiah and 1 Esdras the number 245, which probably
crept into the text from the transcriber fixing his eye upon the 245 of
the following verse.

[Ezr 2:66-67](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#066.md)

The numbers of the beasts, whether for riding or baggage: horses, 736;
mules, 245; camels, 435; and asses, 6720. The numbers are identical in
[Neh 7:68](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#068.md). In 1 Esdr. 5:42 the camels
are the first named, and the numbers are partially different, viz.,
horses, 7036, and asses, 5525.

[Ezr 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#009) with הקים.md). After their
ability (כּכוחם; comp. [Ch1 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002).md) they
gave unto the treasure of the work, i.e., of restoring the temple and
its services, 61,000 darics of gold = 68,625, and 5000 mina of silver,
above 30,000, and 100 priests' garments. The account of these
contributions is more accurately given in [Neh
7:70-72](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070.md), according to which some of
the heads of houses gave unto the work (מקצת as [Dan
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002) and elsewhere.md); the Tirshatha gave
to the treasure 1000 darics of gold, 50 sacrificial vessels (see on [Exo
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003).md), 30 priests' garments, and 500
... This last statement is defective; for the two numbers 30 and 500
must not be combined into 530, as in this case the hundreds would have
stood first. The objects enumerated were named before 500, and are
omitted through a clerical error, מנים וכסף "and silver (500) mina." And
some of the heads of houses (others than the Tirshatha) gave of gold
20,000 darics, of silver, 2200 mina; and that which the rest of the
people gave was-gold, 20,000 darics, silver, 2000 mina, and 67 priests'
garments. According to this statement, the Tirshatha, the heads of
houses, and the rest of the people, gave together 41,000 darics in gold,
4200 mina in silver, 97 priests' garments, and 30 golden vessels. In
Ezra the vessels are omitted; and instead of the 30 + 67 = 97 priests'
garments, they are stated in round numbers to have been 100. The two
other differences have arisen from textual errors. Instead of 61,000
darics, it is evident that we must read with Nehemiah, 41,000 (1000 +
20,000 + 20,000); and in addition to the 2200 and 2000 mina, reckon,
according to [Neh 7:70](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070.md), 500 more, in
all 4700, for which in the text of Ezra we have the round sum of 5000.
The account of the return of the first band of exiles concludes at [Ezr
2:70](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#070.md), and the narrative proceeds to
the subsequent final statement: "So the priests, etc ... .dwelt in their
cities." העם וּמן, those of the people, are the men of the people of
Israel of [Ezr 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md), the laity as
distinguished from the priests, Levites, etc. In Nehemiah the words are
transposed, so that העם מן stand after the Levitical door-keepers and
singers. Bertheau thinks this position more appropriate; but we cannot
but judge otherwise. The placing of the people, i.e., the laity of
Israel, between the consecrated servants of the temple (the priests and
their Levitical assistants in the sacrificial service) and the singers
and door-keepers, seems to us quite consistent; while, on the other
hand, the naming of the שׁוערים before the משׁררים in Nehemiah seems
inappropriate, because the performance of the choral service of the
temple was a higher office than the guardianship of the doors. Neither
can we regard Bertheau's view, that בּעריהם, which in the present verse
follows והנּתינים, should be erased, as a correct one. The word forms a
perfectly appropriate close to the sentence beginning with ויּשׁבוּ; and
the sentence following, "And all Israel were in their cities," forms a
well-rounded close to the account; while, on the contrary, the summing
up of the different divisions by the words כל־ישׂראל in Nehemiah, after
the enumeration of those divisions, has a rather heavy effect.

(Note: In 1 Esdr. 5:46, this verse, freely carrying out the texts of
Ezra and Nehemiah, with regard also to [Neh
12:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027.md), runs thus: "And so dwelt the
priests, and the Levites, and the people, in Jerusalem and in the
country, the singers also and the porters, and all Israel in their
villages.")
