### [1 Chronicles Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001.md)

The same phenomena are met with in the detailed account of the
Ammonite-Syriac war, [Ch1 19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001.md); [Ch1
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#003.md), as compared with 2 Sam
10:1-11:1, and [Sa2 12:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026.md). In [Ch1
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001.md) the omission of the name הנוּן
after בּנו is merely an oversight, as the omission of the name נחשׁ in
[Sa2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md) also is. In [Ch1
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#003.md) there is no need to alter וגו
ולהפך לחקר into וגו וּלרגּלהּ את־העיר חקר, [Sa2
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003.md), although the expression in
Samuel is more precise. If the actual words of the original document are
given in Samuel, the author of the Chronicle has made the thought more
general: "to search and to overthrow, and to spy out the land." Perhaps,
however, the terms made use of in the original document were not so
exact and precise as those of the book of Samuel. In [Ch1
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md), [Ch1
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007.md), at least, the divergence from
[Sa2 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#016.md) cannot be explained
otherwise than by supposing that in neither of the narratives is the
text of the original document exactly and perfectly reproduced. For a
further discussion of the differences, see on [Sa2
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md). The special statement as to the
place where the mercenaries encamped, and the Ammonites gathered
themselves together from out their cities ([Ch1
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007).md), is wanting in 2nd Samuel. The
city Medeba, which, according to [Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016.md), was assigned to the tribe of
Reuben, lay about two hours southeast from Heshbon, and still exists as
ruins, which retain the ancient name Medaba (see on [Num
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030).md). In [Ch1
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#009.md), העיר פּתח, "outside the city"
(i.e., the capital Rabbah), more correct or exact than השּׁער פּתח ([Sa2
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#008).md). On אליהם ויּבא, as compared
with חלאמה ויּבא ([Sa2 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#017).md), cf. the
discussion on [Sa2 10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#016.md).
