### [Lamentations Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

Sorrow and Wailing over the Fall of Jerusalem and Judah

(Note: Keil has attempted, in his German translation of this and the
next three chapters, to reproduce something of the alphabetic
acrosticism of the original (see above, p. 466); but he has frequently
been compelled, in consequence, to give something else than a faithful
reproduction of the Hebrew. It will be observed that his example has not
been followed here; but his peculiar renderings have generally been
given, except where these peculiarities were evidently caused by the
self-imposed restraint now mentioned. He himself confesses, in two
passages omitted from the present translation (pp. 591 and 600 of the
German original), that for the sake of reproducing the alphabeticism, he
has been forced to deviate from a strict translation of the ideas
presented in the Hebrew. - Tr.)

1 Alas! how she sits alone, the city that was full of people!

She has become like a widow, that was great among the nations;

The princess among provinces has become a vassal.

2 She weeps bitterly through the night, and her tears are upon her
cheek;

She has no comforter out of all her lovers:

All her friends have deceived her; they have become enemies to her.

3 Judah is taken captive out of affliction, and out of much servitude;

She sitteth among the nations, she hath found no rest;

All those who pursued her overtook her in the midst of her distresses.

4 The ways of Zion mourn, for want of those who went up to the appointed
feast;

All her gates are waste; her priests sigh;

Her virgins are sad, and she herself is in bitterness.

5 Her enemies have become supreme; those who hate her are at ease;

For Jahveh hath afflicted her because of the multitude of her
transgressions:

Her young children have gone into captivity before the oppressor.

6 And from the daughter of Zion all her honour has departed;

Her princes have become like harts \[that\] have found no pasture,

And have gone without strength before the pursuer.

7 In the days of her affliction and her persecutions,

Jerusalem remembers all her pleasant things which have been from the
days of old:

When her people fell by the hand of the oppressor, and there was none to
help her,

Her oppressors saw her, - they laughed at her times of rest.

8 Jerusalem hath sinned grievously, therefore she hath become an
abomination:

All those who honoured her despise her, because they have seen her
nakedness;

And she herself sighs, and turns backward.

9 Her filth is on her flowing skirts; she remembered not her latter end;

And so she sank wonderfully: she has no comforter.

"O Jahveh, behold my misery!" for the enemy hath boasted.

10 The oppressor hath spread out his hand upon all her precious things;

For she hath seen \[how\] the heathen have come into her sanctuary,

\[Concerning\] whom Thou didst command that they should not enter into
Thy community.

11 All her people \[have been\] sighing, seeking bread;

They have given their precious things for bread, to revive their soul.

See, O Jahveh, and consider that I am become despised.

12 \[Is it\] nothing to you, all ye that pass along the way?

Consider, and see if there be sorrow like my sorrow which is done to me,

Whom Jahveh hath afflicted in the day of the burning of His anger.

13 From above He sent fire in my bones, so that it mastered them;

He hath spread a net for my feet, He hath turned me back;

He hath made me desolate and ever languishing.

14 The yoke of my transgressions hath been fastened to by His hand;

They have interwoven themselves, they have come up on my neck; it hath
made my strength fail:

The Lord hath put me into the hands of \[those against whom\] I cannot
rise up.

15 The Lord hath removed all my strong ones in my midst;

He hath proclaimed a festival against me, to break my young men in
pieces:

The Lord hath trodden the wine-press for the virgin daughter of Judah.

16 Because of these things I weep; my eye, my eye runneth down \[with\]
water,

Because a comforter is far from me, one to refresh my soul;

My children are destroyed, because the enemy hath prevailed.

17 Zion stretcheth forth her hands, \[yet\] there is none to comfort
her;

Jahveh hath commanded concerning Jacob; his oppressors are round about
him:

Jerusalem hath become an abomination among them.

18 Jahveh is righteous, for I have rebelled against His mouth.

Hear now, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow;

My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

19 I called for my lovers, \[but\] they have deceived me;

My priests and my elders expired in the city,

When they were seeking bread for themselves, that they might revive
their spirit.

20 Behold, O Jahveh, how distressed I am! my bowels are moved;

My heart is turned within me, for I was very rebellious:

Without, the sword bereaveth \[me\]; within, \[it is\] like death.

21 They have heard that I sigh, I have no comforter:

All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad because Thou
hast done it.

Thou bringest the day \[that\] Thou hast proclaimed, that they may be
like me.

22 Let all their wickedness come before Thee,

And do to them as Thou hast done to me because of all my transgressions;

For my sighs are many and my heart is faint.

Lamentations 1:1-22

The poem begins with a doleful meditation on the deeply degraded state
into which Jerusalem has fallen; and in the first half ([Lam
1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001).md), lament is made over the sad
condition of the unhappy city, which, forsaken by all her friends, and
persecuted by enemies, has lost all her glory, and, finding no comforter
in her misery, pines in want and disesteem. In the second half ([Lam
1:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012).md), the city herself is
introduced, weeping, and giving expression to her sorrow over the evil
determined against her because of her sins. Both portions are closely
connected. On the one hand, we find, even in [Lam
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009.md) and [Lam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011.md), tones of lamentation, like signs
from the city, coming into the description of her misery, and preparing
the way for the introduction of her lamentation in [Lam
1:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012.md); on the other hand, her sin is
mentioned even so early as in [Lam 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#005.md)
and [Lam 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008.md) as the cause of her
misfortune, and the transition thus indicated from complaint to the
confession of guilt found in the second part. This transition is made in
[Lam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017.md) by means of a kind of
meditation on the cheerless and helpless condition of the city. The
second half of the poem is thereby divided into two equal portions, and
in such a manner that, while in the former of these ([Lam
1:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012).md) it is complaint that
prevails, and the thought of guilt comes forward only in [Lam
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014.md), in the latter ([Lam
1:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#018).md) the confession of God's
justice and of sin in the speaker becomes most prominent; and the
repeated mention of misery and oppression rises into an entreaty for
deliverance from the misery, and the hope that the Lord will requite all
evil on the enemy.

[Lamentations 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 1:1</span></span>

Doleful consideration and description of the dishonour that has befallen
Jerusalem. In these verses the prophet, in the name of the godly, pours
out his heart before the Lord. The dreadful turn that things have taken
is briefly declared in [Lam 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md) in two
clauses, which set forth the fall of Jerusalem from its former glory
into the depths of disgrace and misery, in such a way that the verse
contains the subject unfolded in the description that follows. We have
deviated from the Masoretic pointing, and arranged the verse into three
members, as in the succeeding verses, which nearly throughout form
tristichs, and have been divided into two halves by means of the
Athnach; but we agree with the remark of Gerlach, "that, according to
the sense, היתה למס and not היתה כּאלמנה is the proper antithesis to
רבּתי בגּוים." איכה is here, as in [Lam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md); [Lam
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md), an expression of complaint
mingled with astonishment; so in [Jer
48:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#017.md); [Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md). "She sits solitary" (cf. [Jer
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017).md) is intensified by "she has
become like a widow." Her sitting alone is a token of deep sorrow (cf.
[Neh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004).md), and, as applied to a city,
is a figure of desolation; cf. [Isa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#010.md). Here, however, the former
reference is the main one; for Jerusalem is personified as a woman, and,
with regard to its numerous population, is viewed as the mother of a
great multitude of children. רבּתי is a form of the construct state,
lengthened by Yod compaginis, found thrice in this verse, and also in
[Isa 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md), elegiac composition; such
forms are used, in general, only in poetry that preserves and affects
the antique style, and reproduces its peculiar ring.

(Note: On the different views regarding the origin and meaning of this
Yod compaginis, cf. Fr. W. M. Philippi, Wesen u. Ursprung des Status
constr. im Hebr. S. 96ff. This writer (S. 152ff.) takes it to be the
remnant of a primitive Semitic noun-inflexion, which has been preserved
only in a number of composite proper names of ancient origin e.g.,
מלכּיחדק, etc.\]; in the words אב, אח, and חם, in which it has become
fused with the third radical into a long vowel; and elsewhere only
between two words standing in the construct relation see Ges. 90; Ewald,
211.)

According to the twofold meaning of רב (Much and Great), רבּתי in the
first clause designates the multiplicity, multitude of the population;
in the second, the greatness or dignity of the position that Jerusalem
assumed among the nations, corresponding to the שׂרתי במּדינות, "a
princess among the provinces." מדינה, from דּין (properly, the circuit
of judgment or jurisdiction), is the technical expression for the
provinces of the empires in Asia (cf. [Est
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001.md), [Est
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#022), etc..md), and hence, after the
exile, was sued of Judah, [Ezr 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md);
[Neh 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#006.md), and in [Kg1
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#017.md) of the districts in the kingdom
of Israel. Here, however, המּדינות are not the circuits or districts of
Judah (Thenius), but the provinces of the heathen nations rendered
subject to the kingdom of Israel under David and Solomon (corresponding
to הגּויים), as in [Ecc 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md). Jerusalem
was formerly a princess among the provinces, during the flourishing
period of the Jewish kingdom under David and Solomon. The writer keeps
this time before his mind, in order to depict the contrast between the
past and present. The city that once ruled over nations and provinces
has now become but dependent on others. מס (the derivation of which is
disputed) does not mean soccage or tribute, but the one who gives
soccage service, a soccager; see on [Exo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011.md) and [Kg1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006.md). The words, "The princess has
become a soccager," signify nothing more than, "She who once ruled over
peoples and countries has now fallen into abject servitude," and are not
(with Thenius) to be held as "referring to the fact that the remnant
that has been left behind, or those also of the former inhabitants of
the city who have returned home, have been set to harder labour by the
conquerors." When we find the same writer inferring from this, that
these words presuppose a state of matters in which the country round
Jerusalem has been for some time previously under the oppression of
Chaldean officers, and moreover holding the opinion that the words "how
she sits..." could only have been written by one who had for a
considerable period been looking on Jerusalem in its desolate condition,
we can only wonder at such an utter want of power to understand poetic
language.

[Lamentations 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 1:2</span></span>

In this sorrow of hers she has not a single comforter, since all her
friends from whom she could expect consolation have become faithless to
her, and turned enemies. בּכו תבכּה, "weeping she weeps," i.e., she
weeps very much, or bitterly, not continually (Meier); the inf. abs.
before the verb does not express the continuation, but the intensity of
the action Gesenius, 131, 3, a; Ewald, 312\]. בּלּילה, "in the night,"
not "on into the night" (Ewald). The weeping by night does not exclude,
but includes, weeping by day; cf. [Lam
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018.md). Night is mentioned as the time
when grief and sorrow are wont to give place to sleep. When tears do not
cease to flow even during the night, the sorrow must be overwhelming.
The following clause, "and her tears are upon her cheek," serves merely
to intensify, and must not be placed (with Thenius) in antithesis to
what precedes: "while her sorrow shows itself most violently during the
loneliness of the night, her cheeks are yet always wet with tears (even
during the day)." But the greatness of this sorrow of heart is due to
the fact that she has no comforter, - a thought which is repeated in
[Lam 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009.md), [Lam
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#016.md), [Lam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017.md), and [Lam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#021.md). For her friends are faithless,
and have become enemies. "Lovers" and "friends" are the nations with
which Jerusalem made alliances, especially Egypt (cf. [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036)..md); then the smaller nations round
about, - Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Phoenicians, with which
Zedekiah had conspired against the king of Babylon, [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md). Testimony is given in [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md) to the hostile dealing on the
part of the Edomites against Judah at the destruction of Jerusalem; and
Ezekiel ([Eze 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md), [Eze
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006).md) charges the Ammonite and Tyrians
with having shown malicious delight over the fall of Jerusalem; but the
hostility of the Moabites is evident from the inimical behaviour of
their King Baalis towards Judah, mentioned in [Jer
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014.md).

[Lamentations 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 1:3</span></span>

With [Lam 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#003.md) begins the specific
account of the misery over which Jerusalem sorrows so deeply. Judah has
gone into exile, but she does not find any rest there among the nations.
"Judah" is the population not merely of Jerusalem, but of the whole
kingdom, whose deportation is bewailed by Jerusalem as the mother of the
whole country. Although יהוּדה designates the people, and not the
country, it is construed as a feminine, because the inhabitants are
regarded as the daughter of the land; cf. Ewald, 174, b \[and Gesenius,
107, 4, a\]. 'מעני וגו has been explained, since J. D. Michaelis, by
most modern expositors (Rosenmller, Maurer, Ewald, Thenius, Ngelsbach),
and previously by Calvin, as referring to the cause of the emigration,
"from (because of) misery and much servitude;" and in harmony with this
view, גּלתה יהוּדה has been understood, not of the deportation of Judah
into exile, but of the voluntary emigration of the fugitives who sought
to escape from the power of the Chaldeans by fleeing into foreign
countries, partly before and partly after the destruction of Jerusalem.
But this interpretation neither agrees with the meaning of the words nor
the context. Those fugitives cannot be designated "Judah," because,
however numerous one may think they were, they formed but a fraction of
the inhabitants of Judah: the flower of the nation had been carried off
to Babylon into exile, for which the usual word is גּלה. The context
also requires us to refer the words to involuntary emigration into
exile. For, in comparison with this, the emigration of fugitives to
different countries was so unimportant a matter that the writer could
not possibly have been silent regarding the deportation of the people,
and placed this secondary consideration in the foreground as the cause
of the sorrow. מעני is not to be taken in a causal sense, for מן simply
denotes the coming out of a certain condition, "out of misery," into
which Judah had fallen through the occupation of the country, first by
Pharaoh-Necho, then by the Chaldeans; and רב עבדה does not mean "much
service," but "much labour." For עבדה does not mean "service" (=עבדוּת),
but "labour, work, business," e.g., עבדת המּלך, "the service of the
king," i.e., the service to be rendered to the king in the shape of work
([Ch1 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#030).md), and the labour connected
with public worship ([Ch1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#013.md); [Ch1
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#014), etc..md); here, in connection with
עני, it means severe labour and toil which the people had to render,
partly for the king, that he might get ready the tribute imposed on the
country, and partly to defend the country and the capital against those
who sought to conquer them. Although Judah had wandered out from a
condition of misery and toil into exile, yet even there she found no
rest among the nations, just as Moses had already predicted to the
faithless nation, [Deu 28:65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065.md). All her
pursuers find her בּין המּצרים, inter angustias (Vulgate). This word
denotes "straits," narrow places where escape is impossible ([Psa
116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md); [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005).md), or circumstances in life from
which no escape can be found.

[Lamentations 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 1:4</span></span>

Zion (i.e., Jerusalem, as the holy city) is laid waste; feasts and
rejoicing have disappeared from it. "The ways of Zion" are neither the
streets of Jerusalem (Rosenmller), which are called חוּצות, nor the
highways or main roads leading to Zion from different directions
(Thenius, who erroneously assumes that the temple, which was situated on
Moriah, together with its fore-courts, could only be reached through
Zion), but the roads or highways leading to Jerusalem. These are
"mourning," i.e., in plain language, desolate, deserted, because there
are no longer any going up to Jerusalem to observe the feasts. For this
same reason the gates of Zion (i.e., the city gates) are also in ruins,
because there is no longer any one going out and in through them, and
men no longer assemble there. The reason why the priests and the virgins
are here conjoined as representatives of the inhabitants of Jerusalem
is, that lamentation is made over the cessation of the religious feasts.
The virgins are here considered as those who enlivened the national
festivals by playing, singing, and dancing: [Jer
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#013.md); [Psa
68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026.md); [Jdg
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019.md), [Jdg
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021.md); [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020). נגות (Niphal of יגה.md) is used
here, as in [Zep 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013.md), of sorrow over
the cessation of the festivals. Following the arbitrary rendering,
ἀγόμενοι, of the lxx, Ewald would alter the word in the text into
נהוּגות, "carried captive." But there is no necessity for this: he does
not observe that this rendering does not harmonize with the parallelism
of the clauses, and that נהג means to drive away, but not to lead
captive.

(Note: See, however, [Sa1 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#002.md), with
Keil's own rendering, and [Isa 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004.md),
with Delitzsch's translation. - Tr.)

והיא, "and she (Zion) herself" is in bitterness (cf. [Rut
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#013.md), [Rut
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020).md), i.e., she feels bitter sorrow.
In [Lam 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#006.md), [Lam
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#007.md), are mentioned the causes of this
grief.

[Lamentations 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 1:5</span></span>

Her adversaries or oppressors, in relation to her, have become the head
(and Judah thus the tail), as was threatened, [Deu
28:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#044.md); whereas, according to [Deu
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#013.md) in that same address of Moses,
the reverse was intended. Her enemies, knowing that their power is
supreme, and that Judah has been completely vanquished, are quite at
ease, secure (שׁלוּ, cf. [Jer 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001).md).
This unhappy fate Zion has brought on herself through the multitude of
her own transgressions. Her children (עוללים, children of tender age)
are driven away by the enemy like a flock. The comparison to a flock of
lambs is indicated by לפני. But Zion has not merely lost what she loves
most (the tender children), but all her glory; so that even her princes,
enfeebled by hunger, cannot escape the pursuers, who overtake them and
make them prisoners. Like deer that find no pasture, they flee exhausted
before the pursuer. כּאיּלים has been rendered ὡς κριοὶ by the lxx, and
ut arietes by the Vulgate; hence Kalkschmidt, Bttcher (Aehrenl. S. 94),
and Thenius would read כּאילים, against which Rosenmller has remarked:
perperam, nam hirci non sunt fugacia animalia, sed cervi. Raschi had
already indicated the point of the comparison in the words, quibus
nullae vires sunt ad effugiendum, fame eorum robore debilitato. The
objections raised against כּאיּלים as the correct reading are founded on
the erroneous supposition that the subject treated of is the carrying
away of the princes into exile; and that for the princes, in contrast
with the young, no more suitable emblem could be chosen than the ram.
But רודף does not mean "the driver," him who leads or drives the
captives into exile, but "the pursuer," who runs after the fugitive and
seeks to catch him. The words treat of the capture of the princes: the
flight of the king and his princes at the taking of Jerusalem ([Kg2
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003)..md) hovered before the writer's
mind. For such a subject, the comparison of the fugitive princes to
starved or badly fed rams is inappropriate; but it is suitable enough to
compare them with harts which had lost all power to run, because they
had been unable to find any pasture, and בּלא־כח (without strength,
i.e., in weakness) are pursued and caught.

[Lamentations 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 1:7</span></span>

The loss of all her magnificence ([Lam
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#007).md) brings to the remembrance of the
sorrowing city, in her trouble, the former days of her now departed
glory. "Jerusalem" is not the totality of those who are carried away
(Thenius), but the city personified as the daughter of Zion (cf. [Lam
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#006).md). "The days of her affliction,"
etc., is not the direct object of "remembers," as Pareau and Kalkschmidt
assume, with the lxx; the object is "all her pleasant things." If "the
days of her affliction" were also intended to be the object, "all her
pleasant things" would be preceded by the copula w, which Pareau indeed
supplies, but arbitrarily. Moreover, the combination of the days of
misery with the glory of bygone days is inappropriate, because Jerusalem
feels her present misery directly, and does not need first to call them
to remembrance. "The days of her affliction," etc., is the accusative of
duration. Living through the times of her adversity, Jerusalem thinks of
former happy times, and this remembrance increases her sorrow. מרוּדים
occurs only here, in [Lam 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019.md) and in
[Isa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md) : in meaning it is connected
with רוּד, vagari, and signifies roaming, - not voluntary, but
compulsory, - rejection, persecution; while the adjective מרוּדים, found
in Isaiah, is, as regards its form, taken from מרד, which is cognate
with רוּד. מחמדּים or מחמוּדים ([Lam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011), Kethib.md) is perhaps used in a
more general sense than מחמדּים, [Lam
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004.md) and [Lam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011) (Qeri.md), an signifies what is
costly, splendid, viz., gracious gifts, both of a temporal and spiritual
kind, which Israel formerly possessed, while מחמדּים signifies costly
treasures. "The days of old" are the times of Moses and Joshua, of David
and Solomon. In the words, "when her people fell," etc., the days of
misery are more exactly specified. The suffix in ראוּה refers to
Jerusalem. צרים are the foes into whose power Jerusalem fell helplessly,
not specially the escorts of those who were carried away (Thenius). They
made a mockery of her משׁבּתּים. This word is ἅπ. λεγ. It is not
identical in meaning with ,שׁבּתותsabbata (Vulgate, Luther, etc.),
though connected with it; nor does it signify deletiones, destructions
(Gesenius), but cessationes. This last rendering, however, is not to be
taken according to the explanation of Rosenm׬ller: quod cessasset omnis
ille decor, qui nominatus este ante, principatus et prosper rerum
status; but rather as L. Cappellus in his nott. crit. expresses it: quod
nunc terra ejus deserta jacet nec colitur et quasi cessat et feriatur,
though he does not quite exhaust the meaning. As Gerlach rightly
remarks, the expression is "evidently used with reference to the
threatenings given in the law, [Lev
26:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md), that the land would observe
its Sabbaths, - that it will keep them during the whole period of the
desolation, when Israel is in the land of his enemies." We must not,
however, restrict the reference merely to the uncultivated state of the
fields, but extend it so that it shall be applied to cessation from all
kinds of employment, even those connected with the worship of God, which
were necessary for the hallowing of the Sabbath. The mockery of enemies
does not apply to the Jewish celebration of the Sabbath (to which
Grotius refers the words), but to the cessation of the public worship of
the Lord, inasmuch as the heathen, by destroying Jerusalem and the
temple, fancied they had not only put an end to the worship of God of
the Jews, but also conquered the God of Israel as a helpless national
deity, and made a mock of Israel's faith in Jahveh as the only true God.

[Lamentations 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 1:8</span></span>

But Jerusalem has brought this unutterable misery on herself through her
grievous sins. חטאה is intensified by the noun חטא, instead of the inf.
abs., as in [Jer 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005.md). Jerusalem has
sinned grievously, and therefore has become an object of aversion. נידה
does not mean εἰς σάλον (lxx), or instabilis (Vulgate); nor is it, with
the Chaldee, Raschi, and most of the ancient expositors, to be derived
fromנוּד: we must rather, with modern expositors, regard it as a
lengthened form of נדּה, which indeed is the reading given in twenty
codices of Kennicott. Regarding these forms, cf. Ewald, 84, a. נדּה
(prop. what one should flee from) signifies in particular the
uncleanness of the menstrual discharge in women, [Lev
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002.md), [Lev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005.md), etc.; then the uncleanness of a
woman in this condition, [Lev 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019.md),
etc.; here it is transferred to Jerusalem, personified as such an
unclean woman, and therefore shunned. הזּיל, the Hiphil of זלל (as to
the form, cf. Ewald, 114, c), occurs only in this passage, and signifies
to esteem lightly, the opposite of כּבּד, to esteem, value highly; hence
זולל, "despised," [Lam 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011.md), as in
[Jer 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019.md). Those who formerly
esteemed her - her friends, and those who honoured her, i.e., her allies
- now despise her, because they have seen her nakedness. The nakedness
of Jerusalem means her sins and vices that have now come to the light.
She herself also, through the judgment that has befallen her, has come
to see the infamy of her deeds, sighs over them, and turns away for
shame, i.e., withdraws from the people so that they may no longer look
on her in her shame.

[Lamentations 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 1:9</span></span>

In [Lam 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009.md) the figure if uncleanness
is further developed. Her uncleanness sticks to the hems or skirts of
her garment. טמאה is the defilement caused by touching a person or thing
Levitically unclean, [Lev 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#003.md); [Lev
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021.md); here, therefore, it means
defilement by sins and crimes. This has now been revealed by the
judgment, because she did not think of her end. These words point to the
warning given in the song of Moses, [Deu
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029.md) : "If they were wise, they would
understand this (that apostasy from the Lord brings heavy punishment
after it), they would think of their end," i.e., the evil issue of
continued resistance to God's commands. But the words are especially a
quotation from [Isa 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#007.md), where they
are used of Babylon, that thought she would always remain mistress, and
did not think of the end of her pride; therefore on her also came the
sentence, "Come down from thy glory, sit in the dust," [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md), cf. [Jer
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#018.md).

Jerusalem has now experienced this also; she has come down wonderfully,
or fallen from the height of her glory into the depths of misery and
disgrace, where she has none to comfort her, and is constrained to sigh,
"O Lord, behold my misery!" These words are to be taken as a sign from
the daughter of Zion, deeply humbled through shame and repentance for
her sins. This is required by the whole tenor of the words, and
confirmed by a comparison with [Lam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011.md) and [Lam
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020.md). פּלאים is used adverbially; cf.
Ewald, 204, b \[Gesenius, 100, 2, b.\] There is no need for supplying
anything after הגדּיל, cf. [Jer 48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026.md),
[Jer 48:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#042.md); [Dan
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004.md), [Dan
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008.md),[Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md), [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md), although לעשׂות originally stood
with it, e.g., [Joe 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020.md); cf. Ewald,
122, c \[and Gesenius' Lexicon, s.v. גּדל\]. The clause כּי הגדּיל,
which assigns the reason, refers not merely to the sighing of Jerusalem,
but also to the words, "and she came down wonderfully." The boasting of
the enemy shows itself in the regardless, arrogant treatment not merely
of the people and their property, but also of their holy things.

[Lamentations 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 1:10</span></span>

This is specially mentioned in [Lam
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#010.md). The enemy has spread out his
hand over all her jewels (מחמדּיה, the costly treasures of Jerusalem
which were plundered), and even forced into the sanctuary of the Lord to
spoil it of its treasures and vessels. C. B. Michaelis, Thenius,
Gerlach, Ngelsbach, etc., would restrict the meaning of מחמדּיה to the
precious things of the sanctuary; but not only are there no sufficient
reasons for this, but the structure of the clauses is against it.
Neither does the expression, "all our precious things," in Isa. 69:10,
signify merely the articles used in public worship on which the people
had placed their desire; nor are "all her pleasant vessels" merely the
sacred vessels of the temple. In the latter passage, the suffix in
מחמדּיה refers to Jerusalem; and inasmuch as the burning of all the
palaces of the city (ארמנתיה) has been mentioned immediately before, we
are so much the less at liberty to restrict "all her precious vessels"
to the vessels of the temple, and must rather, under that expression,
include all the precious vessels of the city, i.e., of the palaces and
the temple. And Delitzsch has already remarked, on [Isa
64:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010.md), that "under מחמדּיה may be
included favourite spots, beautiful buildings, pleasure gardens; and
only the parallelism induces us to think especially of articles used in
public worship." But when Thenius, in the passage now before us, brings
forward the succeeding words, "for she hath seen," as a proof that by
"all her pleasant things" we are to understand especially the vessels
and utensils of the temple, he shows that he has not duly considered the
contents of the clause introduced by כּי (for). The clause characterizes
the enemy's forcing his way into the sanctuary, i.e., the temple of
Jerusalem, as an unheard of act of sacrilege, because גּוים were not to
enter even into the קהל of Jahveh. The subject treated of is not by any
means the robbing of the temple - the plundering of its utensils and
vessels. The prohibition against the coming, i.e., the receiving of
foreigners into the "congregation," is given, [Deu
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004.md), with regard to the Ammonites and
Moabites: this neither refers to the jus connubii (Grotius, Rosenmller),
nor to the civil rights of Jewish citizens (Kalkschmidt), but to
reception into religious communion with Israel, the ecclesia of the Old
Covenant (קהל יהוה). In [Deu 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#008.md), the
restriction is relaxed in favour of the Edomites and Egyptians, but in
[Eze 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007.md), [Eze
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#009.md), in accordance with the ratio
legis, extended to all uncircumcised sons of strangers. Hence, in the
verse now before us, we must not, with Rosenmller and Thenius, restrict
the reference of גּוים to the Ammonites and Moabites as accomplices of
the Chaldeans in the capture of Jerusalem and the plundering of the
temple ([Kg2 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002).md); rather the גּוים
are identical with those mentioned in the first member of the verse as
צר, i.e., the Chaldeans, so called not "because their army was made up
of different nationalities, but because the word contains the notice of
their being heathens, - profane ones who had forced into the sanctuary"
(Gerlach). But if we look at the structure of the clauses, we find that
"for she saw," etc., is parallel to "for the enemy hath boasted" of [Lam
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009.md); and the clause, "for she saw
nations coming," etc., contains a further evidence of the deep
humiliation of Jerusalem; so that we may take כּי as showing the last
step in a climax, since the connection of the thought is this: For the
enemy hath boasted, spreading his hand over all her precious things, -
he hath even forced his way into the sanctuary of the Lord. If this is
mentioned as the greatest disgrace that could befall Jerusalem, then the
spreading out of the hands over the precious things of Jerusalem cannot
be understood of the plundering of the temple. The construction ראתּה
גּוים בּא is in sense exactly similar to the Latin vidit gentes venisse,
cf. Ewald, 284, b; and on the construction צוּיתה לא יבאוּ, cf. Ewald,
336, b. בּקהל לך does not stand for בּקהלך (lxx, Pareau, Rosenmller),
for הקהל is not the congregation of Judah, but that of Jahveh; and the
meaning is: They shall not come to thee, the people of God, into the
congregation of the Lord.

[Lamentations 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 1:11</span></span>

Besides this disgrace, famine also comes on her. All her people, i.e.,
the whole of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, sigh after bread, and part
with their jewels for food, merely to prolong their life. The
participles נאנחים, מכקשׁים, are not to be translated by preterites;
they express a permanent condition of things, and the words are not to
be restricted in their reference to the famine during the siege of the
city ([Jer 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021.md); [Jer
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#009.md); [Jer
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006).md). Even after it was reduced, the
want of provisions may have continued; so that the inhabitants of the
city, starved into a surrender, delivered up their most valuable things
to those who plundered them, for victuals to be obtained from these
enemies. Yet it is not correct to refer the words to the present sad
condition of those who were left behind, as distinguished from their
condition during the siege and immediately after the taking of the city
(Gerlach). This cannot be inferred from the participles. The use of
these is fully accounted for by the fact that the writer sets forth, as
present, the whole of the misery that came on Jerusalem during the
siege, and which did not immediately cease with the capture of the city;
he describes it as a state of matters that still continues. As to
מחמוּדיהם, see on [Lam 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#007.md). השׁיב
נפשׁ, "to bring back the soul," the life, i.e., by giving food to revive
one who is nearly fainting, to keep in his life (= השׁיב רוּח); cf. [Rut
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#015.md); [Sa1
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#012.md), and in a spiritual sense, [Psa
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#008.md); [Psa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003.md). In the third member of the
verse, the sigh which is uttered as a prayer ([Lam
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009).md) is repeated in an intensified
form; and the way is thus prepared for the transition to the lamentation
and suppliant request of Jerusalem, which forms the second half of the
poem.

[Lamentations 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 1:12</span></span>

The lamentation of the city. - [Lam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012.md). The first words, לוא אליכם, are
difficult to explain. The lxx have οἱ πρὸς ὑμᾶς; but the reading ought
certainly to be οἴ π. ὑ.. The Vulgate is, o vos omnes; the Chaldee,
adjuro vos omnes. They all seem to have taken לוא as an exclamation.
Hence Le Clerc and others would read לוּא; but in this case one would
require to supply a verb: thus, Le Clerc renders utinam adspiciatis, or,
"O that my cry might reach you!" But these insertions are very
suspicious. The same holds true of the explanation offered by J. D.
Michaelis in his edition of Lowth on Hebrew Poetry, Lect. xxii.: non
vobis, transeuntes in via, haec acclamo (viz., the closing words of [Lam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011).md): this is decidedly opposed by
the mere fact that passers-by certainly could not regard a call
addressed to Jahveh as applying to them. Without supplying something or
other, the words, as they stand, remain incomprehensible. Ngelsbach
would connect them with what follows: "\[Look\] not to yourselves...but
look and see...." But the antithesis, "Look not upon yourselves, but
look on me (or on my sorrow)," has no proper meaning. If we compare the
kindred thought presented in [Lam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#018.md), "Hear, all ye peoples, and
behold my sorrow," then לוא seems to express an idea corresponding to
שׁמעוּ נא. But we obtain this result only if we take the words as a
question, as if לוא = הלוא, though not in the sense of an asseveration
(which would be unsuitable here, for which reason also הלוא is not
used); the question is shown to be such merely by the tone, as in [Exo
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#022.md); [Sa2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005.md). Thus, we might render the sense
with Gerlach: Does not (my sighing - or, more generally, my misery -
come) to you? The Syriac, Lowth, Ewald, Thenius, and Vaihinger have
taken the words as a question; Ewald, following [Pro
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#004.md), would supply אקרא. But such an
insertion gives a rendering which is both harsh and unjustifiable,
although it lies at the foundation of Luther's "I say unto you." Hence
we prefer Gerlach's explanation, and accordingly give the free
rendering, "Do ye not observe, sc. what has befallen me, - or, my
misery?" The words are, in any case, intended to prepare the way for,
and thereby render more impressive, the summons addressed to all those
passing by to look on and consider her sorrow. עולל is passive (Poal):
"which is done to me." Since הוגה has no object, the second אשׁר does
not permit of being taken as parallel with the first, though the
Chaldee, Rosenmller, Kalkschmidt, and others have so regarded it, and
translate: "with which Jahveh hath afflicted me." With Ewald, Thenius,
Gerlach, etc., we must refer it to לי: "me whom Jahveh hath afflicted."
The expression, "on the day of the burning of His anger," is pretty
often found in Jeremiah; see [Jer 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008.md),
[Jer 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#026.md); [Jer
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#037.md), etc.

[Lam 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#013.md)

In [Lam 1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#013.md), the misfortunes that
have befallen Jerusalem are enumerated in a series of images. "Out from
the height (i.e., down from heaven) hath He sent fire into my bones;"
ויּרדּנּהּ is rendered by Luther, "and let it have the mastery" (Ger.
und dasselbige walten lassen). Thenius explains this as being correct,
and accordingly seeks to point the word ויּרדּנּהּ, while Ewald takes
רדה to be cognate with רתח, and translates it "made them red-hot;" and
Rosenmller, following N. G. Schrder, attributes to רדה, from the Arabic,
the meaning collisit, percussit lapide. All these explanations are not
only far-fetched and incapable of lexical vindication, but also
unnecessary. The change of vowels, so as to make it the Hiphil, is
opposed by the fact that רדה, in the Hiphil, does not mean to cause to
manage, rule, but to read down, subdue ([Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002).md). In Kal, it means to tread,
tread down, and rule, as in [Jer 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md),
where Gesenius and Deitrich erroneously assume the meaning of "striding,
going," and accordingly render this passage, "it stalks through them."
The lexically substantiated meaning, "subdue, rule, govern, (or, more
generally,) overpower," is quite sufficient for the present passage,
since רדה is construed not merely with בּ, but also with the accusative:
the subject is אשׁ, which is also construed as a masc. in [Jer
48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045.md); and the suffix ־נּה may either
be taken as a neuter, or referred to "my bones," without compelling us
to explain it as meaning unumquodque os (Rosenmller, etc.). The bones
are regarded as bodily organs in which the pain is most felt, and are
not to be explained away allegorically to mean urbes meas munitas
(Chaldee). While fire from above penetrated the bones, God from beneath
placed nets for the feet which thus were caught. On this figure, cf.
[Jer 50:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024.md); [Hos
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#012.md), etc. The consequence of this was
that "He turned me back," ita ut progredi pedemque extricare non possem,
sed capta detinerer (C. B. Michaelis), - not, "he threw me down
backwards," i.e., made me fall heavily (Thenius). "He hath made me
desolate" (שׁוממה), - not obstupescentem, perturbatam, desperatam
(Rosenmller); the same word is applied to Tamar, [Sa2
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#020.md), as one whose happiness in life
has been destroyed. "The whole day (i.e., constantly, uninterruptedly)
sick," or ill. The city is regarded as a person whose happiness in life
has been destroyed, and whose health has been broken. This miserable
condition is represented in [Lam 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014.md),
under another figure, as a yoke laid by God on this people for their
sins. נשׂקד, ἅπ. λεγ., is explained by Kimchi as נקשׁר או נתחבר,
compactum vel colligatum, according to which שׂקד would be allied to
עקד. This explanation suits the context; on the other hand, neither the
interpretation based on the Talmudic סקד, punxit, stimulavit, which is
given by Raschi and Aben Ezra, nor the interpretations of the lxx,
Syriac, and Vulgate, which are founded on the reading נשׁקד, harmonize
with על, which must be retained, as is shown by the words עלוּ
על־צוּארי. Ewald supposes that שׂקד was the technical expression for the
harnessing on of the yoke. "The yoke of my transgressions" (not "of my
chastisements," as Gesenius, Rosenmller, and Ewald think) means the yoke
formed of the sins. The notion of punishment is not contained in פּשׁעי,
but in the imposition of the yoke upon the neck, by which the misdeeds
of sinful Jerusalem are laid on her, as a heavy, depressing burden which
she must bear. These sins become interwoven or intertwine themselves
(ישׂתּרגוּ), after the manner of intertwined vine-tendrils (שׂריגים,
[Gen 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#010.md); cf. remarks on [Job
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#017).md), as the Chaldee paraphrase well
shows; and, through this interweaving, form the yoke that has come on
the neck of the sinful city. Veluti ex contortis funibus aut complicatis
lignis jugum quoddam construitur, ita h. l. praevaricationis tanquam
materia insupportabilis jugi considerantur (C. B. Michaelis). עלה is
used of the imposition of the yoke, as in [Num
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#002.md); [Sa1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#007.md). The effect of the imposition of
this yoke is: "it hath made my strength to stumble (fail)." Pareau,
Thenius, Vaihinger, and Ngelsbach assume God as the subject of the verb
הכשׁיל; but this neither accords with the current of the description,
nor with the emphatic mention of the subject אדני in the clause
succeeding this. Inasmuch as, in the first member of the verse, God is
not the subject, but the address takes a passive turn, it is only the
leading word על that can be the subject of הכשׁיל: the yoke of sins
which, twined together, have come on the neck, has made the strength
stumble, i.e., broken it. This effect of the yoke of sins is stated, in
the last member, in simple and unfigurative speech: "the Lord hath given
me into the hands of those whom I cannot withstand," i.e., before whom I
cannot maintain my ground. On the construction בּידי לא אוּכל, cf.
Ewald, 333, b; Gesenius, 116, 3. קוּם is here viewed in the sense of
standing fast, maintaining ground, as in [Psa
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md); and, construed with the
accusative, it signifies, to withstand any one; its meaning is not
surgere, which Thenius, following the Vulgate, would prefer: the
construction here requires the active meaning of the verb.

[Lam 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015.md)

In [Lam 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015.md) this thought is further
carried out. סלּה and סלה, "to lift up," is only used in poetry; in [Psa
119:118](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#118.md) it takes the Aramaic meaning
vilipendere, as if in reference to things that can be lifted easily;
here it means tollere, to lift up, take away (lxx ἐξῇρε, Vulgate
abstulit), tear away forcibly, just as both meanings are combined in
נשׂא: it does not mean to outweigh, or raise with a jerk, - the warriors
being regarded as weighty things, that speedily were raised when the
Chaldean power was thrown into the scale (Thenius, and Bttcher in his
Aehrenl. S. 94). This meaning is not confirmed for the Piel by [Job
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#016.md), [Job
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#019.md). קתא מועד does not mean to
summon an assembly, i.e., the multitude of foes (Raschi, Rosenmller,
Gesenius, Neumann), but to proclaim a festival (cf. [Lam
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022).md), because in [Lam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md) and [Lam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md) (cf. [Lev
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004).md) מועד denotes the feast-day, and
in [Lam 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#021.md) קתא יום means to proclaim
a day. עלי means "against me;" for those invited to the feast are the
nations that God has invited to destroy the youths, i.e., the young
troops of Jerusalem. These celebrate a feast like that of the vintage,
at which Jahveh treads the wine-press for the daughter of Judah, because
her young men are cut off like clusters of grapes ([Jer
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009).md), and thrown into the wine-press
([Joe 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013).md). The last judgment also is
set forth under this figure, [Isa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002.md).; [Rev
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#019.md)., [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015). לבּתוּלת יהוּדה, "to (for.md) the
virgin of Judah;" her young men are regarded as a mass of grapes, whose
life-sap (blood) is trodden out in the wine-press. As to the expression
'בּתוּלת בּת י, see on [Jer 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017.md).
"The addition of the word 'virgin' brings out the contrast between this
fate, brought on through the enemy, at God's command, and the peculiar
privilege of Judah as the people of God, in being free from the attacks
of enemies" (Gerlach).

[Lam 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#016.md)

[Lam 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#016.md) concludes this series of
thoughts, since the address returns to the idea presented in [Lam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012.md), and the unprecedented sorrow
([Lam 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012).md) gives vent to itself in
tears. "Because of these things" refers to the painful realities
mentioned in [Lam 1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#013.md), which
Jerusalem has experienced. The form בּוכיּה is like the feminine form
פּריּה in [Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003.md); [Isa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006.md); cf. Ges. 75, Rem. 5. The
repetition of "my eye" gives greater emphasis, and is quite in the style
of Jeremiah; cf. [Jer 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md); [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md) ([Jer
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011).md), [Jer
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#029.md); [Jer
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025.md); the second עיני is not to be
expunged (Pareau and Thenius), although it is not found in the lxx,
Vulgate, Arabic, and some codices. On ירדה , cf. [Jer
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md); [Jer
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017.md); [Jer
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017.md). In these passages stands דמעה,
but here מים, as the stronger expression: the eye flows like water, as
if it were running to the ground in water. Gesenius, in his Thesaurus,
appositely cites the German "sich die Augen aus dem Kopfe weinen" with
which the English corresponds: "to weep one's eyes out of his head".
Still stronger is the expression in [Lam
3:48](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#048.md). But the sorrow becomes thus
grievous, because the weeping one has none to comfort her; friends who
could comfort her have faithlessly forsaken her (cf. [Lam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#002.md), [Lam
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009).md), and her sons are שׁוממים, i.e.,
destroyed, not "astonished" ([Jer
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md); [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008).md), but, as in [Lam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#013.md), made desolate, i.e., made so
unhappy that they cannot bring their mother comfort in her misery. On
משׁיב , cf. [Lam 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011.md). "Because the
enemy hath become strong," i.e., prevailed (גּבר as in [Jer
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002).md).

[Lamentations 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 1:17</span></span>

The complaint regarding the want of comforters is corroborated by the
writer, who further developes this thought, and gives some proof of it.
By this contemplative digression he breaks in on the lamentation of the
city, as if the voice of the weeping one were choked with tears, thus he
introduces into the complaint a suitable pause, that both serves to
divide the lamentation into two, and also brings a turn in its contents.
It is in vain that Zion stretches out her hands (פּרשׁ בּ, to make a
spreading out with the hands) for comforters and helpers; there is none
she can embrace, for Jahveh has given orders against Jacob, that those
round about him should act as oppressors. סביביו are the neighbouring
nations round about Israel. These are all of hostile disposition, and
strive but to increase his misery; cf. [Lam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#002.md). Jerusalem has become their
abomination (cf. [Lam 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008).md), since God,
in punishment for sins, has exposed her before the heathen nations (cf.
[Lam 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008).md). בּיניהם, "between them,"
the neighbouring nations, who live round about Judah. The thought that
Jahveh has decreed the suffering which has come on Jerusalem, is laid to
heart by her who makes complaint, so that, in [Lam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#018.md), she owns God's justice, and lets
herself be roused to ask for pity, [Lam
1:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019.md).

Starting with the acknowledgment that Jahveh is righteous, because
Jerusalem has opposed His word, the sorrowing one anew ([Lam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#018.md), as in [Lam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012).md) calls on the nations to regard
her sorrow, which attains its climax when her children, in the bloom of
youth, are taken captives by the enemy. But she finds no commiseration
among men; for some, her former friends, prove faithless, and her
counsellors have perished ([Lam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019).md);
therefore she turns to God, making complaint to Him of her great misery
([Lam 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020).md), because the rest, her
enemies, even rejoice over her misery ([Lam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#021).md): she prays that God may punish
these. Gerlach has properly remarked, that this conclusion of the
chapter shows Jerusalem does not set forth her fate as an example for
the warning of the nations, nor desires thereby to obtain commiseration
from them in her present state (Michaelis, Rosenmller, Thenius,
Vaihinger); but that the apostrophe addressed to the nations, as well as
that to passers-by ([Lam 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012).md), is
nothing more than a poetic turn, used to express the boundless magnitude
of this her sorrow and her suffering. On the confession "Righteous is
Jahveh," cf. [Jer 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md); [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md); [Ch2
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006.md); [Psa
119:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#037.md), etc. "Because I have rebelled
against His mouth" (i.e., His words and commandments), therefore I am
suffering what I have merited. On מרה , cf. [Num
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#024.md); [Kg1
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#026.md). כּל־עמּים (without the article,
which the Qeri supplies) is a form of expression used in poetry, which
often drops the article; moreover, we must here bear in mind, that it is
not by any means the idea of the totality of the nations that
predominates, but nations are addressed merely in indefinite generality:
the expression in the text means nations of all places and countries. In
order to indicate the greatness of her grief, the sorrowing one mentions
the carrying into captivity of the young men and virgins, who are a
mother's joy and hope.

[Lamentations 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 1:19</span></span>

[Lam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019.md) is not a continuation of the
direct address to the nations, to whom she complains of her distress,
but merely a complaint to God regarding the sorrow she endures. The
perfects קראתי, רמּוּני, are not preterites, and thus are not to be
referred to the past, as if complaint were made that, in the time of
need, the lovers of Jerusalem forsook her; they rather indicate
accomplished facts, whose consequences reach down to the present time.
It was not merely in former times, during the siege, that Jerusalem
called to her friends for help; but even now she still calls, that she
may be comforted by them, yet all in vain. Her friends have deceived
her, i.e., shamefully disappointed her expectations. From those who are
connected with her, too, she can expect neither comfort nor counsel. The
priests and the elders, as the helpers and advisers of the city, - the
former as representing the community before God, and being the medium of
His grace, the latter as being leaders in civil matters, - pined away (
,גּועexspirare; here, to pine away through hunger, and expire). כּי is a
temporal particle: "when they were seeking for bread" to prolong their
life ('השׁיב נ as in [Lam 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011).md). The
lxx have added καὶ οὐχ ευ, which Thenius is inclined to regard as a
portion of the original text; but it is very evidently a mere conjecture
from the context, and becomes superfluous when כּי ne is taken as a
particle of time.

[Lamentations 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 1:20</span></span>

Since neither comfort nor advice is to be found with men, Jerusalem
makes her complaint of need to God the Lord. "See, Jahveh, that I am
distressed. My bowels glow." חמרמרוּ, the passive enhancing form, from
חמר, is found, besides, only in [Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md), where the clause before us is
repeated, and in [Job 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md), where it
is used of the countenance, and can only mean to be glowing red; it is
scarcely legitimate to derive it from חמר, Arab. h\[mr, to be made red,
and must rather be referred to Arab. chmr, to ferment, rise into froth;
for even in [Psa 55:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#009.md) חמר does not
mean to be red, but to rise into froth. מעים, "bowels," are the nobler
portions of the internal organs of the body, the seat of the affections;
cf. Delitzsch's Biblical Psychology (Clark's translation), p. 314ff. "My
heart has turned within me" is an expression used in [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md) to designate the feeling of
compassion; but here it indicates the most severe internal pain, which
becomes thus agonizing through the consciousness of its being deserved
on account of resistance to God. מרו for מרה, like בּכו ekil, [Jer
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010.md); [Jer
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#019.md), etc. Both forms occur together
in other verbs also; cf. Olshausen, Gram. 245, h \[Ewald, 238, e;
Gesen., 75, Rem. 2\]. But the judgment also is fearful; for "without
(מחוּץ, foris, i.e., in the streets and the open country) the sword
renders childless," through the slaughter of the troops; "within
(בּבּית, in the houses) כּמּות, like death." It is difficult to account
for the use of כּ; for neither the כ of comparison nor the so-called
כveritatis affords a suitable meaning; and the transposition of the
words into sicut mors intus (Rosenm׬ller, after Lצwe and Wolfsohn) is an
arbitrary change. Death, mentioned in connection with the sword, does
not mean death in general, but special forms of death through maladies
and plagues, as in [Jer 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002.md); [Jer
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md), not merely the fever of hunger,
[Jer 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018.md); on the other hand, cf.
[Eze 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#015.md), "the sword without,
pestilence and hunger within." But the difficulty connected with כּמּות
is not thereby removed. The verb שׁכּל belongs to both clauses; but "the
sword" cannot also be the subject of the second clause, of which the
nominative must be כּמּות, "all that is like death," i.e., everything
besides the sword that kills, all other causes of death, - pestilences,
famine, etc. כּ is used as in כּמראה, [Dan
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#018.md). That this is the meaning is
shown by a comparison of the present passage with [Deu
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#025.md), which must have been before the
writer's mind, so that he took the words of the first clause, viz.,
"without, the sword bereaves," almost as they stood, but changed
וּמחדרים into בּבּית כּמּות, - thus preferring "what is like death,"
instead of "terror," to describe the cause of destruction. Calvin long
ago hit the sense in his paraphrase multae mortes, and the accompanying
explanation: utitur nota similitudinis, quasi diceret: nihil domi
occurrere nisi mortale (more correctly mortiferum). Much light is thrown
on the expression by the parallel adduced by Kalkschmidt from Aeneid,
ii. 368, 369: crudelis ubique Luctus, ubique pavor, et plurima mortis
imago.

From speaking of friends, a transition is made in [Lam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#021.md) to enemies. Regarding the
explanation of Rosenmller, audiverunt quidem amici mei, a me implorati
[Lam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019.md), quod gemens ego...imo sunt
omnes hostes mei, Thenius observes that it introduces too much. This
remark is still more applicable to his own interpretation: "People
(certainly) hear how I sigh, (yet) I have no comforter." The antithesis
introduced by the insertion of "yet" destroys the simplicity of
arrangement among the clauses, although C. B. Michaelis and Gerlach also
explain the passage in the same manner. The subject of the words, "they
have heard," in the first clause, is not the friends who are said in
[Lam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019.md) to have been called upon for
help, nor those designated in the second clause of [Lam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#021.md) as "all mine enemies," but
persons unnamed, who are only characterized in the second clause as
enemies, because they rejoice over the calamity which they have heard of
as having befallen Jerusalem. The first clause forms the medium of
transition from the faithless friends ([Lam
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019).md) to the open enemies ([Lam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#021).md); hence the subject is left
undefined, so that one may think of friends and enemies. The foes
rejoice that God has brought the evil on her. The words 'הבאת וגו, which
follow, cannot also be dependent on כּי ("that Thou hast brought the day
which Thou hast announced"), inasmuch as the last clause, "and they
shall be like me," does not harmonize with them. Indeed, Ngelsbach and
Gerlach, who assume that this is the connection of the clause "Thou hast
brought," etc., take 'ויהיוּ כ adversatively: "but they shall be like
me." If, however, "they shall be," etc., were intended to form an
antithesis to "all mine enemies have heard," etc., the former clause
would be introduced by והם. The mere change of tense is insufficient to
prove the point. It must further be borne in mind, that in such a case
there would be introduced by the words "and they shall be," etc., a new
series of ideas, the second great division of the prayer; but this is
opposed by the arrangement of the clauses. The second portion of the
prayer cannot be attached to the end of the verse. The new series of
thoughts begins rather with "Thou hast brought," which the Syriac has
rendered by the imperative, venire fac. Similarly Luther translates:
"then (therefore) let the day come." C. B. Michaelis, Rosenmller,
Pareau, etc., also take the words optatively, referring to the Arabic
idiom, according to which a wish is expressed in a vivid manner by the
perfect. This optative use of the perfect certainly cannot be shown to
exist in the Hebrew; but perhaps it may be employed to mark what is
viewed as certain to follow, in which case the Germans use the present.
The use of the perfect shows that the occurrence expected is regarded as
so certain to happen, that it is represented as if it had already taken
place. The perfects in [Lam 3:56-61](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#056.md)
are taken in this sense by nearly all expositors. Similarly we take the
clause now before us to mean, "Thou bringest on the day which Thou hast
proclaimed (announced)," i.e., the day of judgment on the nations, Jer
25, "so that they become like me," i.e., so that the foes who rejoice
over my misfortune suffer the same fate as myself. "The day \[which\]
Thou hast proclaimed" has been to specifically rendered in the Vulgate,
adduxisti diem consolationis, probably with a reference of the
proclamation to [Isa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002.md). - After
this expression of certainty regarding the coming of a day of punishment
for her enemies, there follows, [Lam
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#022.md), the request that all the evil
they have done to Jerusalem may come before the face of God, in order
that He may punish it (cf. [Psa 109:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#015.md)
with [Lam 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014).md), - do to them as He
has done to Jerusalem, because of her transgressions. The clause which
assigns the reason ("for many are my sighs," etc.) does not refer to
that which immediately precedes; for neither the request that
retribution should be taken, nor the confession of guilt ("for all my
transgressions"), can be accounted fore by pointing to the deep misery
of Jerusalem, inasmuch as her sighing and sickness are not brought on
her by her enemies, but are the result of the sufferings ordained by God
regarding her. The words contain the ground of the request that God
would look on the misery ([Lam 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020).md),
and show to the wretched one the compassion which men refuse her. לבּי
is exactly the same expression as that in [Jer
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#018.md); cf. also [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005.md). The reason thus given for making
the entreaty forms an abrupt termination, and with these words the sound
of lamentation dies away.
