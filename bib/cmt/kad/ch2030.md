### [2 Chronicles Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 30:1</span></span>

The celebration of the passover. - [Ch2
30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md). The preparations for this
celebration. - [Ch2 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md). Hezekiah
invited all Israel and Judah to it; "and he also wrote letters to
Ephraim and Manasseh," the two chief tribes of the northern kingdom,
which here, as is manifest from [Ch2
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#005.md), [Ch2
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010.md), are named instar omnium. But
the whole sentence serves only to elucidate כּל־שׂראל על ישׁלה. To all
Israel (of the ten tribes) he sent the invitation, and this he did by
letters. The verse contains a general statement as to the matter, which
is further described in what follows.

[2 Chronicles 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 30:2</span></span>

The king consulted with his princes and the whole assembly in Jerusalem,
i.e., with the community of the capital assembled in their
representatives for this purpose, as to keeping the passover in the
second month. This was ([Num 9:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006).md)
allowed to those who, by uncleanness or by absence on a distant journey,
were prevented from holding the feast at the lawful time, the 14th of
the first month. Both these reasons existed in this case ([Ch2
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003).md): the priests had not
sufficiently sanctified themselves, and the people had not assembled in
Jerusalem, sc. at the legal time in the first month. למדּי, contracted
from מה־דּי, that which is sufficient, is usually interpreted, "not in
sufficient number" (Rashi, Vulg., Berth., etc.); but the reference of
the word to the number cannot be defended. למדּי denotes only ad
sufficientiam, and means not merely that the priests had not sanctified
themselves in such numbers as were required for the slaughtering and
offering of the paschal lambs, but that the priesthood in general was
not yet sufficiently consecrated, many priests not having at that time
wholly renounced idolatry and consecrated themselves anew. Nor does the
passage signify, as Bertheau says it does, "that although the
purification of the temple was completed only on the sixteenth day of
the first month ([Ch2 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017).md), the
passover would yet have been celebrated in the first month, though
perhaps not on the legal fourteenth day, had not a further postponement
become necessary for the reasons here given;" for there is nothing said
in the text of a "further postponement." That is just as arbitrarily
dragged into the narrative as the idea that Hezekiah ever intended to
hold the passover on another day than the legal fourteenth day of the
month, which is destitute of all support, and even of probability. The
postponement of the passover until the second month in special
circumstances was provided for by the law, but the transfer of the
celebration to another day of the month was not. Such a transfer would
have been an illegal and arbitrary innovation, which we cannot suppose
Hezekiah capable of. Rather it is clear from the consultation, that the
king and his princes and the congregations were persuaded that the
passover could be held only on the fourteenth day of the month; for they
did not consult as to the day, but only as to the month, upon the basis
of the law: if not in the first, then at any rate in the second month.
The day was, for those consulting, so definitely fixed that it was never
discussed, and is not mentioned at all in the record. If this were so,
then the consultation must have taken place in the first month before
the fourteenth day, at a time when the lawful day for the celebration
was not yet past. This is implied in the words, "for they could not hold
it at that time." ההיא בּעת is the first month, in contrast to "in the
second month;" not this or that day of the month. Now, since the reason
given for their not being able to hold it in the first month is that the
priests had not sufficiently purified themselves, and the people had not
assembled themselves in Jerusalem, we learn with certainty from these
reasons that it is not a celebration of the passover in the first year
of Hezekiah's reign which is here treated of, as almost all commentators
think.

(Note: Cf. the elaborate discussion of this question in Caspari, Beitr.
zur Einl. in das B. Jesaja, S. 109ff.)

In the whole narrative there is nothing to favour such a supposition,
except (1) the circumstance that the account of this celebration is
connected by ו consec. (in ויּשׁלח) with the preceding purification of
the temple and restoration of the Jahve-worship which took place in the
first year of Hezekiah's reign; and (2) the statement that the priests
had not sufficiently sanctified themselves, [Ch2
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md), which, when compared with that
in [Ch2 29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md), that the number of
priests who had sanctified themselves was not sufficient to flay the
beasts for sacrifice, makes it appear as if the passover had been
celebrated immediately after the consecration of the temple; and (3) the
mention of the second month in [Ch2
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002.md), which, taken in connection with
the mention of the first month in [Ch2
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md), [Ch2
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017.md), seems to imply that the second
month of the first year of Hezekiah's reign is meant. But of these three
apparent reasons none is convincing.

The use of ו consec. to connect the account of the celebration of the
passover with the preceding, without the slightest hint that the
celebration took place in another (later) year, is fully accounted for
by the fact that in no case is the year in which any event of Hezekiah's
twenty-nine years' reign occurred stated in the Chronicle. In [Ch2
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md), Sennacherib's invasion of Judah
is introduced only by the indefinite formula, "and after these events,"
though it happened in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah; while the
arrangements as to the public worship made by this king, and recorded in
2 Chron 31, belong to the first years of his reign. Only in the case of
the restoration of the Jahve-worship is it remarked, [Ch2
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md), that Hezekiah commenced it in
the very first year of his reign, because that was important in forming
an estimate of the spirit of his reign; but the statement of the year in
which his other acts were done had not much bearing upon the practical
aim of the chronicler. Nor does the reason given for the transfer of the
celebration of the passover to the second month, viz., that the priests
had not sufficiently sanctified themselves, prove that the celebration
took place in the first year of Hezekiah. During the sixteen years'
reign of the idolater Ahaz, the priesthood had beyond doubt fallen very
low, - become morally sunk, so that the majority of them would not
immediately make haste to sanctify themselves for the Jahve-worship.
Finally, the retrospective reference to [Ch2
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md), [Ch2
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017.md), would certainly incline us to
take השּׁני בּחרשׁ to mean the second month of the first year; but yet
it cannot be at once taken in that sense, unless the reasons given for
the transfer of the celebration of the passover to the second month
point to the first year. But these reasons, so far from doing so, are
rather irreconcilable with that view. The whole narrative, 2 Chron 29
and 30, gives us the impression that Hezekiah had not formed the
resolution to hold a passover to which the whole of Israel and Judah,
all the Israelites of the ten tribes as well as the citizens of his
kingdom, should be invited before or during the purification of the
temple; at least he did not consult with his princes and the heads of
Jerusalem at that time. According to [Ch2
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#020.md), the king assembled the princes
of the city only after the report had been made to him, on the
completion of the purification of the temple on the sixteenth day of the
first month, when he summoned them to the dedication of the purified
temple by solemn sacrifice. But this consecratory solemnity occupied
several days. The great number of burnt-offerings, - first seven
bullocks, seven rams, and seven lambs, besides the sin-offering for the
consecration of the temple ([Ch2
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#021).md); then, after the completion of
these, the voluntary burnt-offering of the congregation, consisting of
70 bullocks, 100 rams, and 200 lambs, together with and exclusive of the
thank-offerings ([Ch2 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#032).md), - could
not possibly be burnt on one day on one altar of burnt-offering, and
consequently the sacrificial meal could not well be held on the same
day. If, then, the king consulted with the princes and the assembly
about the passover after the conclusion of or during celebration, - say
in the time between the seventeenth and the twentieth day, - it could
not be said that the reason of the postponement of the passover was that
the priests had not yet sufficiently sanctified themselves, and the
people were not assembled in Jerusalem: it would only have been said
that the fourteenth day of the first month was already past. Caspari has
therefore rightly regarded this as decisive. But besides that, the
invitation to all Israel (of the ten tribes) to this passover is more
easily explained, if the celebration of it took place after the breaking
up of the kingdom of the ten tribes by the Assyrians, than if it was
before that catastrophe, in the time of Hosea, the last king of that
kingdom. Though King Hosea may not have been so evil as some of his
predecessors, yet it is said of him also, "he did that which was evil in
the sight of Jahve" ([Kg2 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#002).md). Would
Hezekiah have ventured, so long as Hosea reigned, to invite his subjects
to a passover at Jerusalem? and would Hosea have permitted the
invitation, and not rather have repelled it as an interference with his
kingdom? Further, in the invitation, the captivity of the greater part
of the ten tribes is far too strongly presupposed to allow us to imagine
that the captivity there referred to is the carrying away of several
tribes by Tiglath-pileser. The words, "the escaped who are left to you
from the hand of the king of Assyria" ([Ch2
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006).md), presuppose more than the
captivity of the two and a half trans-Jordanic tribes and the
Naphtalites; not merely because of the plural, the "kings of Assur," but
also because the remaining five and a half tribes were not at all
affected by Tiglath-pileser's deportation, while there is no mention
made of any being carried away by King Pul, nor is it a probable thing
in itself; see on [Ch1 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md). Finally,
according to [Ch2 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md), the Israelites
who had been assembled in Jerusalem for the passover immediately
afterwards destroyed the pillars, Astartes, high places, and altars, not
merely in all Judah and Benjamin, but also in Ephraim and Manasseh
(consequently even in the capital of the kingdom of the ten tribes),
"unto completion," i.e., completely, leaving nothing of them remaining.
Is it likely that King Hosea, and the other inhabitants of the kingdom
of the ten tribes who had not gone to the passover, but had laughed at
and mocked the messengers of Hezekiah ([Ch2
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010).md), would have quietly looked on
and permitted this? All these things are incomprehensible if the
passover was held in the first year of Hezekiah, and make it impossible
to accept that view.

Moreover, even the preparation for this passover demanded more time than
from the seventeenth day of the first month to the fourteenth day of the
second. The calling of the whole people together, "from Dan to
Beersheba" ([Ch2 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#005).md), could not be
accomplished in three weeks. Even if Hezekiah's messengers may have gone
throughout the land and returned home again in that time, we yet cannot
suppose that those invited, especially those of the ten tribes, could at
once commence their journey, so as to appear in Jerusalem at the time of
the feast. In consequence of all these things, we must still remain
stedfastly of the opinion already expressed in this volume in the
Commentary on the Books of Kings (p. 306ff.), that this passover was not
held in the first year of Hezekiah, only a week or two after the
restoration of the Jahve-worship according to the law had been
celebrated. But if it was not held in the first year, then it cannot
have been held before the ruin of the kingdom of the ten tribes, in the
sixth year of Hezekiah. In the third year of Hezekiah, Shalmaneser
marched upon Samaria, and besieged the capital of the kingdom of the ten
tribes. But during the occupation of that kingdom by the Assyrians,
Hezekiah could not think of inviting its inhabitants to a passover in
Jerusalem. He can have resolved upon that only after the Assyrians had
again left the country, Samaria having been conquered, and the
Israelites carried away. "But after an end had been thoroughly made of
the kingdom of the house of Israel, Hezekiah might regard himself as the
king of all Israel, and in this character might invite the remnant of
the ten tribes, as his subjects, to the passover (cf. [Jer
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001).md); and he might cherish the hope,
as the Israelitish people had been just smitten down by this last
frightful catastrophe, that its remaining members would humble
themselves under the mighty hand of God, which had been laid on them
solemnly, and turning to Him, would comply with the invitation; while
before the ruin of the Israelitish kingdom, in inviting the Israelites
of the ten tribes, he would have been addressing the subjects of a
foreign king" (Caspari, S. 125). And with this view, the statement, [Ch2
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010.md), that the messengers of Hezekiah
were laughed at by the majority of the Israelites, in the land of
Ephraim and Manasseh unto Zebulun, may be easily reconciled. "If we only
look," as Caspari pertinently says in answer to this objection, "at the
conduct of those who remained in Judea after the destruction of
Jerusalem, and who soon afterwards fled to Egypt to Jeremiah ([Jer
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004).md), we will understand how the
majority of the people of the kingdom of the ten tribes, who remained
behind after the deportation by Shalmaneser, could be hardened and
blinded enough to laugh at and mock the messengers of Hezekiah."

But if Hezekiah formed the resolution of holding such a passover
festival only after the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, it may
perhaps be asked why he did not take the matter into consideration early
enough to allow of the festival being held at the legal time, i.e., in
the first month? To this we certainly cannot give an assured answer,
because, from the reasons given for the delay of the passover to the
second month ([Ch2 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003).md), we can only
gather that, when the king consulted with the princes in the matter,
there was no longer sufficient time to carry out the celebration in the
manner proposed at the legal time. But it is quite possible that
Hezekiah resolved to invite the remnant of the ten tribes to the next
passover, only in the beginning of the year, when the Assyrians had
withdrawn from the land, and that in the consultation about the matter
the two circumstances mentioned in [Ch2
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md) were decisive for the
postponement of the feast to the second month. It became clear, on the
one hand, that the whole priesthood was not yet sufficiently prepared
for it; and on the other, that the summoning of the people could not be
accomplished before the 14th Nisan, so as to allow of the feast being
held in the way proposed at the legal time; and accordingly it was
decided, in order to avoid the postponement of the matter for a whole
year, to take advantage of the expedient suggested by the law, and to
hold the feast in the second month. From [Ch2
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#014.md) and [Ch2
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md) we gather that at that time there
were still standing in Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah and
Benjamin, Mazzeboth, Asherim, Bamoth, and altars; consequently, that the
Baal-worship had not yet been extirpated. The continuance of the
Baal-worship, and that on the high places in Jerusalem and Judah, until
the sixth or seventh year of Hezekiah's reign, will not much astonish
us, if we consider that even before Ahaz the most pious kings had not
succeeded in quite suppressing worship on the high places on the part of
the people. The reopening of the temple, and of the Jahve-worship in it,
Hezekiah might undertake and carry out in the beginning of his reign,
because he had all those of the people who were well inclined upon his
side. But it was otherwise with the altars on the high places, to which
the people from ancient times had been firmly attached. These could not
be immediately destroyed, and may have been again restored here and
there after they had been destroyed, even in the corners of the capital.
Many Levitic priests had, to a certainty, taken part in this worship on
high places, since, as a rule, it was not heathen idols, but Jahve, to
whom sacrifice was offered upon the high places, though it was done in
an illegal way. Such Levitic priests of the high places could not, even
if they had not practised idolatry, straightway take part in a passover
to be celebrated to Jahve according to the precepts of the law. They
must first sanctify themselves by abandoning the worship on the high
places, and earnestly turning to the Lord and to His law. Now, if the
passover was to be a general one, the time necessary for this
sanctification of themselves must be granted to these priests. For the
sanctification of these priests, and for the invitation of all Israel to
the festival, the time up to the fourteenth of the second month was
sufficient, and the king's proposal was consequently approved of by the
whole assembly.

[2 Chronicles 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 30:5</span></span>

They established the matter (דּבר יעמידוּ, Vulg. rightly, according to
the sense, decreverunt), to make proclamation throughout all Israel,
from Beersheba to Dan (cf. [Jdg 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001).md),
that they should come to keep the passover. לרב לא כּי, for not in
multitude had they celebrated it, as it is written. These words were
interpreted as early as by Rashi thus: they had not celebrated it for a
long time according to the precepts of the law, and were referred to the
time of the division of the kingdom. But to this Berth. has rightly
objected that the use of לרב of time is unusual, and has correctly
referred the words to the Israelites: they had not celebrated it in
multitude, i.e., in the assembly of the whole people, as the law
required. The words consequently tell us nothing as to the length of
time during which it had not been celebrated in multitude: as to that,
see [Ch2 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#026.md). Still less does it
follow from the words that under Hezekiah, after the restoration of the
temple worship, the passover had not been yearly held.

[2 Chronicles 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 30:6</span></span>

"The runners (whether soldiers of the royal body-guard, cf. [Ch2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#010.md), or other royal couriers, as
[Est 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013.md), [Est
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#015), cannot be determined.md) went with
letters from the hand of the king, ... and according to the commandment
of the king to say." Tot he written invitation of the king and his
princes they were to add words of exhortation: "Turn again to Jahve, ...
that He may return (turn Himself) to the remnant which remains to you
from the hand of the kings of Assyria," i.e., of Tiglath-pileser and
Shalmaneser.

[2 Chronicles 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 30:7</span></span>

Be not like your fathers, your brethren, i.e., those carried away by
Tiglath and Shalmaneser. On לשׁמּה יתּגם cf. [Ch2
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 30:8</span></span>

Be not stiff-necked; cf. [Kg2 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#014.md).
"Give the hand to the Lord," i.e., here, not submit yourselves, as [Ch1
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#024.md), construed with תּחת; it denotes
the giving of the hand as a pledge of fidelity, as in [Kg2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md); [Ezr
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#019.md); [Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 30:9</span></span>

If ye return to the Lord, your brethren and your sons (who are in exile)
shall be for mercy, i.e., shall find mercy of them who carried them
away, and for returning, i.e., and they shall return into this land. וגו
חנּוּן כּי, cf. [Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 30:10</span></span>

The couriers went about from city to city in the land of Ephraim and
Manasseh, even unto Zebulun; but the people laughed to scorn and mocked
at the summons to return, and the invitation to the passover festival.
The words "from city to city" are not inconsistent with the view that
the kingdom of Israel had already been ruined. The Assyrians had not
blotted out all the cities from the face of the land, nor carried away
every one of the inhabitants to the last man, but had been satisfied
with the capture of the fortresses and their partial or complete
demolition, and carried only the flower of the inhabitants away. No
doubt also many had saved themselves from deportation by flight to
inaccessible places, who then settled again and built in the cities and
villages which had not been completely destroyed, or perhaps had been
completely spared, after the enemy had withdrawn. From the statement,
moreover, that the couriers passed through the land of Ephraim and
Manasseh unto Zebulun, no proof can be derived that the messengers did
not touch upon the domain of the tribes led away captive by
Tiglath-pileser (Naphtali and the trans-Jordanic land), but only visited
those districts of the country which formed the kingdom of Israel as it
continued to exist after Tiglath-pileser. If that were so, it would
follow that the kingdom had not then been destroyed. But the enumeration
is not complete, as is manifest from the fact that, according to [Ch2
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#011.md) and [Ch2
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018.md), men of the tribes of Asher and
Issachar came to Jerusalem in compliance with the invitation; and the
domain of Asher extended to the northern frontier of Canaan. If we
further take it into consideration, that, according to the resolution of
the king and his princes, all Israel, from Beersheba on the southern
frontier to Dan on the northern, were to be invited, it is not to be
doubted that the couriers went through the whole land.

[2 Chronicles 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 30:12</span></span>

Also upon Judah came the hand of God, to give them one heart, to do...
The phrase בּ היתה יהוה יד has usually a punitive signification (cf.
[Exo 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#003.md); [Deu
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#015), etc..md), but here it is the
helping hand of God. God wrought powerfully upon Judah to make them of
one mind. יהוה בּדבר as in [Ch2 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#015.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 30:13</span></span>

The celebration of the passover. - [Ch2
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013.md). The assembly of the people at
Jerusalem to celebrate the feast became a great congregation.

[Ch2 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#014.md)

Before the slaying of the passover, in order to purify and sanctify the
city for the feast, they removed the (illegal) altars and places for
offering incense which had been erected under Ahaz ([Ch2
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#024).md), and threw them into the Kidron
([Ch2 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#016).md). מקטּרות is here a
substantive: places for incense-offerings (cf. Ew. 160, e), and denotes
altars intended for the offering of the קטרת.

[Ch2 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#015.md)

When they slaughtered the passover on the 14th, the Levites and priests
also were ashamed, i.e., had sanctified themselves under the influence
of a feeling of shame, and offered the sacrifice in the house of the
Lord; i.e., they performed the sacrificial functions incumbent upon them
at the passover in the temple, as is stated more in detail in [Ch2
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#016.md). The clause וגו והכּהנים is a
circumstantial clause, and the statement points back to [Ch2
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md). The mention of Levites along
with the priests here is worthy of remark, since in [Ch2
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md) it is said that at the
celebration of the dedication of the temple the Levites had sanctified
themselves more zealously than the priests. But these two statements do
not contradict each other. In [Ch2
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md) it is the Levites and priests
then present in or dwelling in Jerusalem who are spoken of; here, on the
contrary, it is the priests and the Levites of the whole kingdom of
Judah. Even though, at the former period, the Levites were more zealous
in sanctifying themselves for the dedication of the temple, yet there
must certainly have been many Levites in Judah, who, like many of the
priests, did not immediately purify themselves from their defilement by
the worship in the high places, and were only impelled and driven to
sanctify themselves for the service of the Lord by the Zeal of the
people who had come to Jerusalem to hold the passover.

[Ch2 30:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#016.md)

Standing in their place, according to their right, i.e., according to
the prescribed arrangement (see on [Ch1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#017).md), the priests sprinkled the blood
(of the paschal lambs) from the hand of the Levites, they handing it to
them. This was not the rule: in the case of the paschal lamb, the father
of the family who slew the lamb had to hand the blood to the priest,
that it might be sprinkled upon the altar; here the Levites did it for
the reasons given in [Ch2 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#017.md).
Because many in the assembly had not sanctified themselves, the Levites
presided over the slaying of the paschal lambs for every one who was
unclean, to sanctify (the lambs) to the Lord (see also on [Ch2
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#006.md), [Ch2
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#011).md). רבּת, stat. constr. before the
noun with a preposition, stands as neuter substantively: there was a
multitude in the assembly who...רבּת, in [Ch2
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018.md) is to be taken in a similar
manner, not as an adverb (Berth.). וגו מאפרים רבּת is in apposition to
העם מרבּית, a multitude of people, viz.: Many of Ephraim ... had not
purified themselves, but ate the passover in an illegal fashion, not
according to the precept (cf. [Num
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006).md). This clause explains how it
happened that the Levites presided at the slaying of the passover for
those who had not sanctified themselves, i.e., they caught the blood and
gave it to the priests. Had this been done by persons levitically
unclean, the expiatory sacrificial blood would have been defiled. The
eating of the paschal lamb or the participation in the passover meal was
indeed allowed only to the clean; but yet it was not so holy an act,
i.e., did not bring the people into such immediate contact with God, who
was present at His altar, that those who were not clean might not, under
some circumstances, be admitted to it. Here it was allowed, for Hezekiah
had prayed for them that God might forgive the transgression of the law.

[Ch2 30:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018.md)

[Ch2 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018.md) ends, according to the
Masoretic verse-division, with the preposition בּעד; but that division
seems merely to have arisen from ignorance of the construction heekiyn
כּל-l

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

baabow, of the fact that בּעד stands before a relative sentence without
אשׁר, like אל in [Ch1 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012.md), and is
certainly wrong. If we separate בּעד from what follows, we must, with
Aben Ezra, supply אלּה, and make הכין ([Ch2
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#019).md) refer to Hezekiah, both being
equally inadmissible. Rightly, therefore, the lxx, Vulg., and also
Kimchi, with the majority of commentators, have given up this division
of the verses as incorrect, and connected the words in this way: May the
good Jahve atone, i.e., forgive every one who has fixed his heart (cf.
[Ch2 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#014).md) to seek God, Jahve, the
God of his fathers, but not in accordance with the purity of the
sanctuary. This intercession of Hezekiah's is worthy of remark, not only
because it expresses the conviction that upright seeking of the Lord,
which proceeds from the heart, is to be more highly estimated than
strict observance of the letter of the law, but also because Hezekiah
presumes that those who had come out of Ephraim, etc., to the passover
had fixed their heart to seek Jahve, the God of their fathers, but had
not been in a position to comply with the precept of the law, i.e., to
purify themselves up to the day appointed for the passover.

[Ch2 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#020.md)

God heard this intercession, and healed the people. רפא, sanare, is not
to be explained by supposing, with Bertheau, that first sickness, and
then even death, were to be expected as the results of transgression of
the law, according to [Lev 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#031.md), and
that the people might be already regarded as sick, as being on the point
of becoming so. The use of the word is explained by the fact that sin
was regarded as a spiritual disease, so that רפא is to be understood of
healing the soul (as [Psa 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005).md), or
the transgression ([Hos 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005.md); [Jer
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022).md).

[Ch2 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#021.md)

And the Israelites that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of
unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and
priests praised the Lord day by day, singing to the Lord ליהוה עז בּכלי,
"with instruments of power to the Lord," i.e., with which they ascribed
power to the Lord; or, to express it more clearly, which they played to
the praise of the power of the Lord. The stringed instruments played by
the Levites, and the trumpets blown by the priests, to accompany the
psalm-singing, are meant. The singing of praise in connection with the
sacrificial service took place on the seventh day of the feast.

[Ch2 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022.md)

Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites, i.e., spoke encouraging
words of acknowledgment to all the Levites, "who showed good
understanding in regard to Jahve," i.e., not qui erant rerum divinarum
peritiores aliosque instruere poterant, but, as Clericus has already
said, those who had distinguished themselves by intelligent playing to
the honour of the Lord. "And they ate" - not merely the Levites and
priests, but all who took part in the festival - the festal sacrifices,
seven days. The expression את־המּועד אכל, to hold the festal sacrificial
meal, is formed after את־הפּסח אכל, to eat the passover = the passover
meal. This we gather from the following participial clause, "offering
peace-offerings," of which the sacrificial meals were prepared.
וּמתודּים, and acknowledged the Lord, the God of their fathers. הדותה
denotes here neither "to make confession of sin," nor "to approach with
thank-offerings" (Berth.), but simply to acknowledge the Lord with heart
and mouth, word and deed, or by prayer, praise, thanks, and offering of
sacrifice.

[2 Chronicles 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 30:23</span></span>

Prolongation of the festival for seven days more, and the conclusion of
it. - [Ch2 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#023.md). Since the king and
the princes had given a very large number of beasts for sacrifice as
thank-offerings, it was resolved to keep joy for other seven days, i.e.,
to keep them festally, with sacrificial meals. The expression ימים עשׂה,
to hold or celebrate days, is similar to פסח עשׂה, to hold the passover.
שׂמהה is an adverbial accusative: in joy. For this resolution two
reasons are given in [Ch2 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#024.md) : 1.
Hezekiah had given to the assembly 1000 bullocks and 7000 head of small
cattle, and the princes had given 1000 bullocks and 10,000 head of small
cattle besides; so that there was more than they could use during the
seven days of the Mazzoth feast. Bertheau incorrectly supposes that
these were "rich gifts for further sacrificial feasts." The gifts were
bestowed for the Mazzoth festival, but were so plentiful that they
sufficed for another festival of seven days. הרים, like תּרוּמה, denotes
to bestow, i.e., to present beasts, etc., with the design that they
should be used as sacrifices; cf. [Ch2
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#007.md). 2. The second reason: "priests
also had sanctified themselves in multitude," so as to be able to carry
on the service at the altar, even with such numerous sacrifices, refers
back to [Ch2 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#015.md) and [Ch2
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 30:25</span></span>

Concluding remarks on this festival. There took part in it (1) the whole
congregation of Judah, and the priests and Levites; (2) the whole
congregation of those who had come out of Israel (the ten tribes); (3)
the strangers, both those who came out of the land of Israel and those
dwelling in Judah.

[Ch2 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#026.md)

The joy was great, for there had not been the like in Jerusalem since
the days of Solomon. The meaning is, that this feast could be compared
only with the feast at the dedication of the temple in the time of
Solomon, [Ch2 7:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md), in respect to
its length, the richness of the sacrificial gifts, the multitude of
those who participated, and the joyous feeling it caused" (Berth.). The
feast at the dedication of the temple had been a festival of fourteen
days; for the feast of tabernacles, which lasted seven days, came
immediately after the proper dedicatory feast, and since the time of
Solomon all the tribes had never been united at a feast in Jerusalem.

[Ch2 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#027.md)

At the end of the Levitic priests dismissed the people with the blessing
(the ו before הלויּם in some MSS, and which the lxx, Vulg., and Syr.
also have, is a copyist's gloss brought from [Ch2
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#025.md); cf. against it, [Ch2
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#018).md), and the historian adds, "Their
voice was heard, and their prayer came to His holy dwelling-place, to
heaven." This conclusion he draws from the divine blessing having been
upon the festival; traceable partly in the zeal which the people
afterwards showed for the public worship in the temple (2 Chron 31),
partly in the deliverance of Judah and Jerusalem from the attack of the
Assyrian Sennacherib (2 Chron 32).
