### [Genesis Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 27:1</span></span>

When Isaac had grown old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could no
longer see (מראת from seeing, with the neg. מן as in [Gen
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#002), etc..md), he wished, in the
consciousness of approaching death, to give his blessing to his elder
son. Isaac was then in his 137th year, at which age his half-brother
Ishmael had died fourteen years before;

(Note: Cf. Lightfoot, opp. 1, p. 19. This correct estimate of Luther's
is based upon the following calculation: - When Joseph was introduced to
Pharaoh he was thirty years old ([Gen
41:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046).md), and when Jacob went into
Egypt, thirty-nine, as the seven years of abundance and two of famine
had then passed by ([Gen 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#006).md). But
Jacob was at that time 130 years old ([Gen
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009).md). Consequently Joseph was born
before Jacob was ninety-one; and as his birth took place in the
fourteenth year of Jacob's sojourn in Mesopotamia (cf. [Gen
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#025.md), and [Gen
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#018.md), [Gen
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#021.md), and [Gen
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#027).md), Jacob's flight to Laban
occurred in the seventy-seventh year of his own life, and the 137th of
Isaac's.)

and this, with the increasing infirmities of age, may have suggested the
thought of death, though he did not die till forty-three years
afterwards ([Gen 35:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#028).md). Without
regard to the words which were spoken by God with reference to the
children before their birth, and without taking any notice of Esau's
frivolous barter of his birthright and his ungodly connection with
Canaanites, Isaac maintained his preference for Esau, and directed him
therefore to take his things (כּלים, hunting gear), his quiver and bow,
to hunt game and prepare a savoury dish, that he might eat, and his soul
might bless him. As his preference for Esau was fostered and
strengthened by, if it did not spring from, his liking for game ([Gen
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#028).md), so now he wished to raise his
spirits for imparting the blessing by a dish of venison prepared to his
taste. In this the infirmity of his flesh is evident. At the same time,
it was not merely because of his partiality for Esau, but unquestionably
on account of the natural rights of the first-born, that he wished to
impart the blessing to him, just as the desire to do this before his
death arose from the consciousness of his patriarchal call.

[Genesis 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 27:5</span></span>

Rebekah, who heard what he said, sought to frustrate this intention, and
to secure the blessing for her (favourite) son Jacob. Whilst Esau was
away hunting, she told Jacob to take his father a dish, which she would
prepare from two kids according to his taste; and, having introduced
himself as Esau, to ask for the blessing "before Jehovah." Jacob's
objection, that the father would know him by his smooth skin, and so,
instead of blessing him, might pronounce a curse upon him as a mocker,
i.e., one who was trifling with his blind father, she silenced by
saying, that she would take the curse upon herself. She evidently relied
upon the word of promise, and thought that she ought to do her part to
secure its fulfilment by directing the father's blessing to Jacob; and
to this end she thought any means allowable. Consequently she was so
assured of the success of her stratagem as to have no fear of the
possibility of a curse. Jacob then acceded to her plan, and fetched the
goats. Rebekah prepared them according to her husband's taste; and
having told Jacob to put on Esau's best clothes which were with her in
the dwelling (the tent, not the house), she covered his hands and the
smooth (i.e., the smoother parts) of his neck with the skins of the kids
of the goats,

(Note: We must not think of our European goats, whose skins would be
quite unsuitable for any such deception. "It is the camel-goat of the
East, whose black, silk-like hair was used even by the Romans as a
substitute for human hair. Martial xii. 46." - Tuch on v. 16.)

and sent him with the savoury dish to his father.

[Genesis 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 27:18</span></span>

But Jacob had no easy task to perform before his father. As soon as he
had spoken on entering, his father asked him, "Who art thou, my son?" On
his replying, "I am Esau, thy first-born," the father expressed his
surprise at the rapid success of his hunting; and when he was satisfied
with the reply, "Jehovah thy God sent it (the thing desired) to meet
me," he became suspicious about the voice, and bade him come nearer,
that he might feel him. But as his hands appeared hairy like Esau's, he
did not recognise him; and "so he blessed him." In this remark ([Gen
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#023).md) the writer gives the result of
Jacob's attempt; so that the blessing is merely mentioned proleptically
here, and refers to the formal blessing described afterwards, and not to
the first greeting and salutation.

[Genesis 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 27:24</span></span>

After his father, in order to get rid of his suspicion about the voice,
had asked him once more, "Art thou really my son Esau?" and Jacob had
replied, "I am" (אני = yes), he told him to hand him the savoury dish
that he might eat. After eating, he kissed his son as a sing of his
paternal affection, and in doing so he smelt the odour of his clothes,
i.e., the clothes of Esau, which were thoroughly scented with the odour
of the fields, and then imparted his blessing ([Gen
27:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027).md). The blessing itself is
thrown, as the sign of an elevated state of mind, into the poetic style
of parallel clauses, and contains the peculiar forms of poetry, such as
ראה for הנּה, הוה for היה, etc. The smell of the clothes with the scent
of the field suggested to the patriarch's mind the image of his son's
future prosperity, so that he saw him in possession of the promised land
and the full enjoyment of its valuable blessings, having the smell of
the field which Jehovah blessed, i.e., the garden of paradise, and broke
out into the wish, "God (Ha-Elohim, the personal God, not Jehovah, the
covenant God) give thee from the dew of heaven, and the fat fields of
the earth, and plenty of corn and wine," i.e., a land blessed with the
dew of heaven and a fruitful soil.

In Eastern countries, where there is so little rain, the dew is the most
important prerequisite for the growth of the fruits of the earth, and is
often mentioned therefore as a source of blessing ([Deu
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013.md), [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md); [Hos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006.md); [Zac
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#012).md). In משׁמנּי, notwithstanding the
absence of the Dagesh from the שׁ, the מ is the prep. מן, as the
parallel מטּל proves; and שׁמנּים both here and in [Gen
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#039) are the fat (fertile.md) districts
of a country. The rest of the blessing had reference to the future
pre-eminence of his son. He was to be lord not only over his brethren
(i.e., over kindred tribes), but over (foreign) peoples and nations
also. The blessing rises here to the idea of universal dominion, which
was to be realized in the fact that, according to the attitude assumed
by the people towards him as their lord, it would secure to them either
a blessing or a curse. If we compare this blessing with the promises
which Abraham received, there are two elements of the latter which are
very apparent; viz., the possession of the land, in the promise of the
rich enjoyment of its produce, and the numerous increase of posterity,
in the promised dominion over the nations. The third element, however,
the blessing of the nations in and through the seed of Abraham, is so
generalized in the expression, which is moulded according to [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md), "Cursed be every one that
curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee," that the person
blessed is not thereby declared to be the medium of salvation to the
nations. Since the intention to give the blessing to Esau the first-born
did not spring from proper feelings towards Jehovah and His promises,
the blessing itself, as the use of the word Elohim instead of Jehovah or
El Shaddai (cf. [Gen 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#003).md) clearly
shows, could not rise to the full height of the divine blessings of
salvation, but referred chiefly to the relation in which the two
brothers and their descendants would stand to one another, the theme
with which Isaac's soul was entirely filled. It was only the painful
discovery that, in blessing against his will, he had been compelled to
follow the saving counsel of God, which awakened in him the
consciousness of his patriarchal vocation, and gave him the spiritual
power to impart the "blessing of Abraham" to the son whom he had kept
back, but whom Jehovah had chosen, when he was about to send him away to
Haran ([Gen 28:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#003).md).

[Genesis 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 27:30</span></span>

Jacob had hardly left his father, after receiving the blessing (יצא אך,
was only gone out), when Esau returned and came to Isaac, with the game
prepared, to receive the blessing. The shock was inconceivable which
Isaac received, when he found that he had blessed another, and not
Esau-that, in fact, he had blessed Jacob. At the same time he neither
could nor would, either curse him on account of the deception which he
had practised, or withdraw the blessing imparted. For he could not help
confessing to himself that he had sinned and brought the deception upon
himself by his carnal preference for Esau. Moreover, the blessing was
not a matter of subjective human affection, but a right entrusted by the
grace of God to paternal supremacy and authority, in the exercise of
which the person blessing, being impelled and guided by a higher
authority, imparted to the person to be blest spiritual possessions and
powers, which the will of man could not capriciously withdraw. Regarding
this as the meaning of the blessing, Isaac necessarily saw in what had
taken place the will of God, which had directed to Jacob the blessing
that he had intended for Esau. He therefore said, "I have blessed him;
yea, he will be (remain) blessed" (cf. [Heb
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017).md). Even the great and bitter
lamentation into which Esau broke out could not change his father's
mind. To his entreaty in [Gen 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#034.md),
"Bless me, even me also, O my father!" he replied, "Thy brother came
with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing." Esau answered, "Is it
that (הכי) they have named him Jacob (overreacher), and he has
overreached me twice?" i.e., has he received the name Jacob from the
fact that he has twice outwitted me? הכי is used "when the cause is not
rightly known" (cf. [Gen 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#015).md). To
his further entreaty, "Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?" (אצל,
lit., to lay aside), Isaac repeated the substance of the blessing given
to Jacob, and added, "and to thee (לכה for לך as in [Gen
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#009).md), now, what can I do, my son?"
When Esau again repeated, with tears, the entreaty that Isaac would
bless him also, the father gave him a blessing ([Gen
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#039.md), [Gen
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040).md), but one which, when compared
with the blessing of Jacob, was to be regarded rather as "a modified
curse," and which is not even described as a blessing, but "introduced a
disturbing element into Jacob's blessing, a retribution for the impure
means by which he had obtained it." "Behold," it states, "from the fat
fields of the earth will thy dwelling be, and from the dew of heaven
from above." By a play upon the words Isaac uses the same expression as
in [Gen 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#028.md), "from the fat fields of
the earth, and from the dew," but in the opposite sense, מן being
partitive there, and privative here, "from = away from." The context
requires that the words should be taken thus, and not in the sense of
"thy dwelling shall partake of the fat of the earth and the dew of
heaven" (Vulg., Luth., etc.).

(Note: I cannot discover, however, in [Mal
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003.md) an authentic proof of the
privative meaning, as Kurtz and Delitzsch do, since the prophet's words,
"I have hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste," are
not descriptive of the natural condition of Idumaea, but of the
desolation to which the land was given up.)

Since Isaac said ([Gen 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#037).md) he had
given Jacob the blessing of the super-abundance of corn and wine, he
could not possibly promise Esau also fat fields and the dew of heaven.
Nor would this agree with the words which follows, "By thy sword wilt
thou live." Moreover, the privative sense of מן is thoroughly poetical
(cf. [Sa2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022.md); [Job
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#015), etc..md). The idea expressed in
the words, therefore, was that the dwelling-place of Esau would be the
very opposite of the land of Canaan, viz., an unfruitful land. This is
generally the condition of the mountainous country of Edom, which,
although not without its fertile slopes and valleys, especially in the
eastern portion (cf. Robinson, Pal. ii. p. 552), is thoroughly waste and
barren in the western; so that Seetzen says it consists of "the most
desolate and barren mountains probably in the world."

The mode of life and occupation of the inhabitants were adapted to the
country. "By (lit., on) thy sword thou wilt live;" i.e., thy maintenance
will depend on the sword (על as in [Deu
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md) cf. [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).md), "live by war, rapine, and
freebooting" (Knobel). "And thy brother thou wilt serve; yet it will
come to pass, as (כּאשׁר, lit., in proportion as, cf. [Num
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014)) thou shakest (tossest.md), thou
wilt break his yoke from thy neck." רוּד, "to rove about" ([Jer
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031.md); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001)), Hiphil "to cause (the thoughts.md)
to rove about" ([Psa 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#003).md); but
Hengstenberg's rendering is the best here, viz., "to shake, sc., the
yoke." In the wild, sport-loving Esau there was aptly prefigured the
character of his posterity. Josephus describes the Idumaean people as "a
tumultuous and disorderly nation, always on the watch on every motion,
delighting in mutations" (Whiston's tr.: de bell Judg 4; 1:1-21:25; 1).
The mental eye of the patriarch discerned in the son his whole future
family in its attitude to its brother-nation, and he promised Edom, not
freedom from the dominion of Israel (for Esau was to serve his brother,
as Jehovah had predicted before their birth), but only a repeated and
not unsuccessful struggle for freedom. And so it was; the historical
relation of Edom to Israel assumed the form of a constant reiteration of
servitude, revolt, and reconquest. After a long period of independence
at the first, the Edomites were defeated by Saul ([Sa1
14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047).md) and subjugated by David ([Sa2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014).md); and, in spite of an attempt at
revolt under Solomon ([Kg1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014)..md),
they remained subject to the kingdom of Judah until the time of Joram,
when they rebelled. They were subdued again by Amaziah ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md); [Ch2
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#011)..md), and remained in subjection
under Uzziah and Jotham ([Kg2 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022.md);
[Ch2 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#002).md). It was not till the reign
of Ahaz that they shook the yoke of Judah entirely off ([Kg2
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006.md); [Ch2
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017).md), without Judah being ever able
to reduce them again. At length, however, they were completely conquered
by John Hyrcanus about b.c. 129, compelled to submit to circumcision,
and incorporated in the Jewish state (Josephus, Ant. xiii. 9, 1, xv. 7,
9). At a still later period, through Antipater and Herod, they
established an Idumaean dynasty over Judea, which lasted till the
complete dissolution of the Jewish state.

Thus the words of Isaac to his two sons were fulfilled-words which are
justly said to have been spoken "in faith concerning things to come"
([Heb 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#020).md). For the blessing was a
prophecy, and that not merely in the case of Esau, but in that of Jacob
also; although Isaac was deceived with regard to the person of the
latter. Jacob remained blessed, therefore, because, according to the
predetermination of God, the elder was to serve the younger; but the
deceit by which his mother prompted him to secure the blessing was never
approved. On the contrary, the sin was followed by immediate punishment.
Rebekah was obliged to send her pet son into a foreign land, away from
his father's house, and in an utterly destitute condition. She did not
see him for twenty years, even if she lived till his return, and
possibly never saw again. Jacob had to atone for his sin against both
brother and father by a long and painful exile, in the midst of
privation, anxiety, fraud, and want. Isaac was punished for retaining
his preference for Esau, in opposition to the revealed will of Jehovah,
by the success of Jacob's stratagem; and Esau for his contempt of the
birthright, by the loss of the blessing of the first-born. In this way a
higher hand prevailed above the acts of sinful men, bringing the counsel
and will of Jehovah to eventual triumph, in opposition to human thought
and will.

[Genesis 27:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">gen 27:41</span></span>

Esau's complaining and weeping were now changed into mortal hatred of
his brother. "The days of mourning," he said to himself, "for my father
are at hand, and I will kill my brother Jacob." אבי אבל: genit. obj. as
in [Amo 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010.md); [Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md). He would put off his intended
fratricide that he might not hurt his father's mind.

[Gen 27:42-46](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#042.md)

When Rebekah was informed by some one of Esau's intention, she advised
Jacob to protect himself from his revenge (התנחם to procure comfort by
retaliation, equivalent to "avenge himself," התנקּם, [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md),

(Note: This reference is incorrect; the Niphal is used in [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024), the Hithpael in Jer 5:9-29. Tr..md)

by fleeing to her brother Laban in Haran, and remaining there "some
days," as she mildly puts it, until his brother's wrath was subdued.
"For why should I lose you both in one day?" viz., Jacob through Esau's
vengeance, and Esau as a murderer by the avenger of blood ([Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md), cf. [Sa2
14:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#006).md). In order to obtain Isaac's
consent to this plan, without hurting his feelings by telling him of
Esau's murderous intentions, she spoke to him of her troubles on account
of the Hittite wives of Esau, and the weariness of life that she should
feel if Jacob also were to marry one of the daughters of the land, and
so introduced the idea of sending Jacob to her relations in Mesopotamia,
with a view to his marriage there.
