### [2 Chronicles Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 32:1</span></span>

Sennacherib's campaign against Judah and Jerusalem, and the annihilation
of his whole army by the angel of the Lord. In 2 Kings 18 and 19, and
Isa 36 and 37, we have two minute parallel accounts of this war, which
threatened the existence of the kingdom of Judah, in both of which the
course of this attack by the Assyrian world-power upon the kingdom of
God is circumstantially narrated. The author of the Chronicle gives only
a short narrative of the main events of the struggle; but,
notwithstanding its brevity, supplies us with several not unessential
additions to these detailed accounts. After stating that Sennacherib
invaded Judah with the design of conquering the kingdom for himself
([Ch2 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001).md), the author of the
Chronicle described the preparations which Hezekiah made for the defence
of the capital in case it should be besieged ([Ch2
32:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#002).md). Then we have an account of
Sennacherib's attempts to get Jerusalem into his power, by sending his
generals, who sought to induce the people to submit by boastful
speeches, and by writing threatening letters to Hezekiah ([Ch2
32:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009).md); and, finally, of Hezekiah's
prayer to God for help, and the answer to his prayer - the wonderful
annihilation of the Assyrian army ([Ch2
32:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#020).md). The purpose of the
chronicler in narrating these events was a didactic one: he wishes to
show how God the Lord helped the pious King Hezekiah in this danger to
his kingdom, and humbled the presumption of Sennacherib confiding in the
might of his powerful army. For this purpose, a brief rhetorical summary
of the main events of the struggle and its issues was sufficient. As to
the facts, see the commentary on 2 Kings 18f. and Isa. 36f.

[Ch2 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

The didactic and rhetorical character of the narrative is manifest in
the very form of the introductory statement. Instead of the
chronological statement of [Kg2 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md),
we find the loose formula of connection: after these events and this
fidelity (cf. [Ch2 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#020).md), Sennacherib
came (בּא) and entered into Judah (ביהוּדה ויּבא), and besieged the
fenced cities, and thought (ויּאמר) to break (conquer) them for himself.
He had already taken a number of them, and had advanced as far as
Lachish in the south-west of Judah, when he made the attempt to get
Jerusalem into his power; cf. [Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md).

[Ch2 32:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#002.md)

Preparations of Hezekiah for the strengthening and defending of
Jerusalem. - We find an account of this neither in 2 Kings 18 nor in Isa
36; but the fact is confirmed both by [Isa
22:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008.md), and by the remark [Kg2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#020.md) (cf. [Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030) of our chapter.md).

[Ch2 32:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#002.md)

When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib advanced, and his face was to war
against Jerusalem, i.e., that he purposed to capture Jerusalem, he
consulted with his princes and his valiant men to cover the waters of
the springs which were outside the city; and they helped him, brought
much people together, and covered all the springs, and the brook which
ran through the midst of the land. סתם does not denote to obstruct, but
only to hide by covering and conducting the water into subterranean
channels. The brook which flowed through the midst of the land is the
Gihon, which was formed by the waters flowing from the springs, and was
dried up by these springs being covered and the water diverted. For
further information, see on [Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md). The object of this measure is
stated in the words which follow: Why should the kings of Assyria come
and find much water? i.e., why should we provide them with much water,
when they advance against the city and besiege it? The plural, kings of
Assyria, is rhetorical, as in [Ch2
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016.md).

[Ch2 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005.md)

The fortification of Jerusalem. יתחזּק, he showed himself strong,
courageous, as in [Ch2 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008.md); [Ch2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001.md). And he built the whole wall
which was broken, i.e., he strengthened it by building up the breaches
and defective places; cf. [Isa 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009.md).
The words על־המּגדּלות ויּעל are obscure, since the translation "he
mounted on the towers" has no meaning. But if יעל be taken as a Hiph.,
"he caused to ascend upon the towers," the object is wanting; and if we
supply walls, it is arbitrary, for we might just as well suppose it to
be machines which he caused to be carried to the top of the towers for
defence against the enemy ([Ch2
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015).md). The lxx have wholly omitted
the words, and the translation of the Vulg., et exstruxit turres
desuper, appears to be only a guess, but is yet perhaps correct, and
presupposes the reading מגדּלות עליה ויּעל, "and brought up upon it
towers," in favour of which Ewald also decides. This conjecture is in
any case simpler than Bertheau's, that על ויעל is a false transcription
of ועליה: "he built the whole wall, and towers upon it, and outside was
the other wall," and is therefore to be preferred to it. The "other
wall" enclosed the lower city (Acra). This, too, was not first built by
Hezekiah; he only fortified it anew, for [Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011.md) already speaks of two walls,
between which a body of water had been introduced: see on [Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md). He fortified also the Millo of
the city of David (see on [Ch1 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#008).md),
and supplied the fortifications with weapons (שׁלח, a weapon of defence;
see on [Joe 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#008).md) in multitude, and
with shields; cf. [Ch2 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#014.md).

[Ch2 32:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#006.md)

And, moreover, he set captains of war over the people, i.e., the
populace of Jerusalem, assembled them in the open space at the city gate
(which gate is not stated; cf. [Neh
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001.md), [Neh
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#016).md), and addressed them in
encouraging words; cf. [Ch2 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022.md). On
[Ch2 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#007.md), cf. [Ch2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#015.md), [Deu
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006.md), etc. "For with us is more than
with him." רב, quite general, the closer definition following in [Ch2
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#008.md) : "With him is an arm of flesh;
but with us is Jahve, our God, to help us." An arm of flesh = frail
human power; cf. [Isa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003.md) : their
(the Egyptians') horses are flesh, not spirit; [Jer
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md); [Psa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005.md). "And the people leaned
themselves on (i.e., trusted in) the words of Hezekiah." These
statements are not inconsistent with the account in [Kg2
18:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md), that Hezekiah began to
negotiate with the Assyrian king Sennacherib when he had begun to take
the fenced cities of the land unto Lachish, promised to pay him tribute,
and actually paid the sum demanded, employing for that purpose even the
sheet gold on the temple doors. These negotiations are passed over, not
only in our narrative, but also in Isa 36, because they had no influence
upon the after course and the issue of the war. Sennacherib was not
induced to withdraw by the payment of the sum demanded, and soon after
the receipt of it he sent a detachment from Lachish against Jerusalem,
to summon the city to surrender. The fortification of Jerusalem which
the Chronicle records began before these negotiations, and was continued
while they were in progress.

[2 Chronicles 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 32:9</span></span>

The advance of an Assyrian army against Jerusalem, and the attempts of
Sennacherib's generals to induce the population of the capital to submit
by persuasive and threatening speeches, are very breifly narrated, in
comparison with 2 Kings 18:17-36. In [Ch2
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009.md), neither the names of the
Assyrian generals, nor the names of Hezekiah's ambassadors with whom
they treated, are given; nor is the place where the negotiation was
carried on mentioned. עבדיו, his servants, Sennacherib's generals.
על־לך, while he himself lay near (or against) Lachish, and all the army
of his kingdom with him. ממשׁלתּו, his dominion, i.e., army of his
kingdom; cf. [Jer 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md).

[Ch2 32:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#010.md)

Only the main ideas contained in the speech of these generals are
reported; in [Ch2 32:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#010.md) we have the
attempt to shake the trust of the people in Hezekiah and in God ([Kg2
18:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#019).md). וישׁבים is a continuation
of the question, In what do ye trust, and why sit ye in the distress, in
Jerusalem? מסּית as in [Kg2 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#032.md) :
Hezekiah seduces you, to give you over to death by hunger and thirst.
This thought is much more coarsely expressed in [Kg2
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#027.md). - On [Ch2
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#012.md), cf. [Kg2
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022.md) : אחד מזבּח is the one altar of
burnt-offering in the temple.

[Ch2 32:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#013.md)

The description of Sennacherib's all-conquering power: cf. [Kg2
18:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#035.md); [Isa
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#020.md), and [Isa
37:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#011.md). "Who is there among all the
gods of these peoples, whom my fathers utterly destroyed, who could have
delivered his people out of my hand, that your God should save you?" The
idea is, that since the gods of the other peoples, which were mightier
than your God, have not been able to save their peoples, how should your
God be in a position to rescue you from my power? This idea is again
repeated in [Ch2 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#015.md), as a
foundation for the exhortation not to let themselves be deceived and
misled by Hezekiah, and not to believe his words, and that in an
assertative form: "for not one god of any nation or kingdom was able to
deliver his people, ... much less then (כּי אף) your gods: they will not
save you;" and this is done in order to emphasize strongly the blasphemy
of the Assyrian generals against the Almighty God of Israel. To
communicate more of these blasphemous speeches would in the chronicler's
view be useless, and he therefore only remarks, in [Ch2
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#016.md), "And yet more spake his
(Sennacherib's) servants against God Jahve, and against His servant
Hezekiah;" and then, in [Ch2 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#017.md),
that Sennacherib also wrote a letter of similar purport, and ([Ch2
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#018).md) that his servants called with a
loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem upon the wall,
to throw them into fear and terrify them, that they might take the city.
What they called to the people is not stated, but by the infinit.
וּלבהלם ליראם it is hinted, and thence we may gather that it was to the
same effect as the blasphemous speeches above quoted (יראם, inf. Pi., as
in [Neh 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#019).md). - On comparing 2 Kings
18 and 19, it is clear that Sennacherib only sent the letter to Hezekiah
after his general Rabshakeh had informed him of the fruitlessness of his
efforts to induce the people of Jerusalem to submit by speeches, and the
news of the advance of the Cushite king Tirhakah had arrived; while the
calling aloud in the Jews' language to the people standing on the wall,
on the part of his generals, took place in the first negotiation with
the ambassadors of Hezekiah. The author of the Chronicle has arranged
his narrative rhetorically, so as to make the various events form a
climax: first, the speeches of the servants of Sennacherib; then the
king's letter to Hezekiah to induce him and his counsellors to submit;
and finally, the attempt to terrify the people in language intelligible
to them. The conclusion is the statement, [Ch2
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#019.md) : "They spake of the God of
Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of the
hands of man;" cf. [Kg2 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#018.md).

[2 Chronicles 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 32:20</span></span>

Prayer of King Hezekiah and of the prophet Isaiah for the help of the
Lord. - [Ch2 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#020.md). The main contents
of Hezekiah's prayer are communicated in [Kg2
19:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014.md) and [Isa
37:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#015.md). There it is not expressly
said that Isaiah also prayed, but it may be inferred from the statement
in [Kg2 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#002.md). and [Isa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#002.md). that Hezekiah sent a deputation
to the prophet with the request that he would pray for the people. In
answer Isaiah promised the ambassadors deliverance, as the word of the
Lord. זאת על, on account of this, i.e., on account of the contempt shown
for the God of Israel, which was emphatically dwelt upon both in the
prayer of Hezekiah ([Kg2 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#016).md) and in
the word of Isaiah, v. 22ff.

[Ch2 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021.md)

The deliverance: cf. [Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md).; [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md). The number of Assyrians smitten
by the angel of the Lord is not stated, as it was not of importance, the
main fact being that the whole Assyrian host was annihilated, so that
Sennacherib had to return with disgrace into his own land. This is what
is signified by the rhetorical phrase: The angel of Jahve destroyed all
the valiant warriors, and the leaders and princes of the king of
Assyria, and he returned with shame of face (cf. [Ezr
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007.md); [Psa
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016).md) to his land, where his sons
slew him in the temple. In regard to the facts, see on [Kg2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037.md) and [Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038.md). The Keth. מיציאו is an
orthographical error for מיציאי, a contraction of מן and יציאי from
יציא, a passive formation with intransitive signification: some of those
who went forth from his own bowels, i.e., some of his sons; cf. the
similar formation miyliydeey, [Ch1
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#004.md).

[Ch2 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#022.md)

Conclusion of this event. So the Lord helped, etc., מיּד־כּל, and out of
the hand of all, sc. his enemies; but we need not on that account, with
some manuscripts, bring איביו into the text. וינהלם, and protected them
round about. נהל, to lead, guide, with the additional idea of care and
protection ([Psa 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004.md); [Isa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010.md); [Isa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#018).md); and consequently here,
protect, defend. There is therefore no need of the conjecture להם ויּנח
להם erut, which Berth. holds to be the original reading, without
considering that, though מסּביב ויּנח is a current phrase with the
chronicler (cf. [Ch2 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#006.md); [Ch2
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#015.md); [Ch2
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#030.md); [Ch1
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#018).md), the supposition that these
words became וינהלם מס by an orthographical error is not at all
probable.

[Ch2 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023.md)

Many brought gifts to the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents to King
Hezekiah. רבּים is not to be restricted to Israelites, but probably
denotes chiefly neighbouring peoples, who by the destruction of the
Assyrian army were also freed from this dreaded enemy. They, too, might
feel impelled to show their reverence for the God of Israel, who had so
wonderfully delivered His people by their gifts.

[2 Chronicles 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 32:24</span></span>

Hezekiah's sickness and recovery; his pride and his humiliation. - [Ch2
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024.md). As to the sickness of Hezekiah,
and the miraculous sign by which the prophet Isaiah assured him of
recovery, see the account in [Kg2
20:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#001.md) and Isa 38. The Chronicle has
only given us hints on this matter. ויּאמר and נתן refer to the same
subject - God. Hezekiah prayed, and in consequence of his prayer God
spake to him, sc. by the mouth of the prophet, and gave him a miraculous
sign.

[Ch2 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md)

"But Hezekiah rendered not according to the benefit unto him, for his
heart was proud." In his sickness he had promised to walk in humility
all his days ([Isa 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015).md): yet he
became proud after his recovery; and his pride showed itself especially
in his showing all his treasures to the Babylonian embassy, in idle
trust in them and in the resources at his command (cf. [Kg2
20:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md); [Isa
39:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001).md). "And there was wrath upon
him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem," which participated in the king's
sentiments (cf. [Ch2 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#010.md); [Ch1
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#024).md). Isaiah proclaimed this wrath
to him in the prophecy that all the treasures of the king would be
carried away to Babylon, and that some of his sons should become
courtiers of the king of Babylon ([Kg2
20:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#016.md); [Isa
39:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#005).md), to which we should perhaps
also reckon the threatening prophecy in [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md).

[Ch2 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#026.md)

Then Hezekiah humbled himself in his pride, and the wrath came not upon
them in the days of Hezekiah (cf. [Isa
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#008).md). The threatened judgment was
postponed because of this humiliation, and broke over the royal house
and the whole kingdom only at a later time in the Chaldean invasion.

[2 Chronicles 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 32:27</span></span>

Hezekiah's riches; concluding estimate of his reign; his death and
burial. - [Ch2 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md). Like Jehoshaphat
([Ch2 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005.md); [Ch2
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#001).md), Solomon ([Ch2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012).md), and David ([Ch1
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#028).md), Hezekiah attained to riches
and glory, and made unto himself treasure-chambers for silver, gold,
precious stones, and spices, shields, and all manner of splendid
furniture. The מגנּים are named instead of weapons in general. The
collection of them brings to recollection the כּליו בּית ([Kg2
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013.md) and [Isa
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002).md).

[Ch2 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#028.md)

Storehouses also (magazines) for the agricultural produce, and stalls
for all manner of cattle, and stalls for the herds, like David ([Ch1
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025)..md) and Uzziah ([Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010).md). מסכּנות is a transposition of
מכנסות, storehouses, from כּנס, to heap up. "Cattle and cattle" = all
kinds of cattle. ארות, synonymous with אריות ([Ch2
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#005).md), stables or stalls for cattle.
The word אורות, which occurs only here, must have the same
signification, and be held to be a transposed form of that word.

[Ch2 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#029.md)

And cities (?) made (procured) he for himself. ערים cannot in this
connection denote the usual cities; it must mean either watch-towers
(from עוּר, to watch) or dwelling-places for herds and cattle, since
עיר, according to [Kg2 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009.md), is used
of any enclosed place, from a watch-tower to a fenced city. רכוּשׁ, as
in [Ch2 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#003.md), of possessions in herds.

[Ch2 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md)

The same Hezekiah covered the upper outlet of the water Gihon, and
brought it down westwards to the city of David, i.e., by a subterranean
channel into the city of David (see on [Ch2
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003).md). The form ויישׁרם is Piel
ויישּׁרם; the Keri is the same conjug., only contracted into ויּשּׁרם,
as ויּבּשׁ for וייבּשׁ, the ו of the third person having amalgamated
with the first radical, under the influence of the ו consec. With the
last clause in [Ch2 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md) cf. [Ch2
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#021.md); [Ch1
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#023.md).

[Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md)

"And so (i.e., accordingly) in the case of the ambassadors of the
princes of Babylon, ... God left him." וכן does not denote attamen; it
never has an adversative meaning. Bertheau rightly translates, "and
accordingly," with the further remark, that by וכן the account of
Hezekiah's treatment of the Babylonian ambassadors, which could not be
reckoned among his fortunate deeds, is brought into harmony with the
remark that he prospered in all his undertakings. It was permitted by
God that Hezekiah should on this occasion be lifted up, and should
commit an iniquity which could not but bring misfortune with it; not in
order that He might plunge him into misfortune, but to try him, and to
humble him (cf. [Ch2 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#026).md).

הסדים, pious deeds, as in [Ch2 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042.md).
ישׂ הזון is the book of Isaiah's prophecies; see the Introduction.

[Ch2 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#033.md)

Hezekiah was buried "on the height of the graves of the sons of David,"
perhaps because there was no longer room in the hereditary burying-place
of the kings; so that for Hezekiah and the succeeding kings special
graves had to be prepared in a higher place of the graves of the kings.
"They did him honour in his death," by the burning of many spices, as we
may conjecture (cf. [Ch2 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014.md); [Ch2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#019).md).
