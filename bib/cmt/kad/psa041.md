[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 41:0</span></span>

Complaint of a Sufferer of Being Surrounded by Hostile and Treacherous
Persons

After a Psalm with אשׁרי follows one beginning with אשׁרי; so that two
Psalms with אשׁרי close the First Book of the Psalms, which begins with
אשׁרי. [Psa 41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md) belongs to the
time of the persecution by Absalom. Just as the Jahve- [Psa
39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md) forms with the Elohim- [Psa
62:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md) a coherent pair belonging to
this time, so does also the Jahve- [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md) with the Elohim-Psalm 55.
These two Psalms have this feature in common, viz., that the complaint
concerning the Psalmist's foes dwells with especial sadness upon some
faithless bosom-friend. In [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md) David celebrates the blessing
which accompanies sincere sympathy, and depicts the hostility and
falseness which he himself experiences in his sickness, and more
especially from a very near friend. It is the very same person of whom
he complains in Ps 55, that he causes him the deepest sorrow - no ideal
character, as Hengstenberg asserts; for these Psalms have the most
distinctly impressed individual physiognomy of the writer's own times.
In Ps 55 the poet wishes for the wings of a dove, in order that, far
away from the city, he might seek for himself a safe spot in the
wilderness; for in the city deceit, violence, and mischief prevail, and
the storm of a wide-spread conspiracy is gathering, in which he himself
sees his most deeply attached friend involved. We need only supplement
what is narrated in the second Book of Samuel by a few features drawn
from these two Psalms, and these Psalms immediately find a satisfactory
explanation in our regarding the time of their composition as the period
of Absalom's rebellion. The faithless friend is that Ahithophel whose
counsels, according to [Sa2 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#023.md), had
with David almost the appearance of being divine oracles. Absalom was to
take advantage of a lingering sickness under which his father suffered,
in order to play the part of the careful and impartial judge and to
steal the heart of the men of Israel. Ahithophel supported him in this
project, and in four years after Absalom's reconciliation with his
father the end was gained. These four years were for David a time of
increasing care and anxiety; for that which was planned cannot have
remained altogether concealed from him, but he had neither the courage
nor the strength to smother the evil undertaking in the germ. His love
for Absalom held him back; the consciousness of his own deed of shame
and bloodshed, which was now notorious, deprived him of the alacrity
essential to energetic interference; and the consciousness of the divine
judgments, which ought to follow his sin, must have determined him to
leave the issue of the conspiracy that was maturing under his very eyes
entirely to the compassion of his God, without taking any action in the
matter himself. From the standpoint of such considerations, [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md) and 55 lose every look of
being alien to the history of David and his times. One confirmation of
their Davidic origin is the kindred contents of [Psa
28:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md).

Jesus explains ([Joh 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018).md) that in
the act of Judas Iscariot [Psa 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010.md)
is fulfilled, ὁ τρώγων μετ ̓ ἐμοῦ τὸν ἄρτον, ἐπῆρεν ἐπ ̓ ἐμε ̓ τὴν
πτέρναν αὐτοῦ (not following the lxx), and [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md); [Act
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016.md) assume in a general way that the
deed and fate of the traitor are foretold in the Old Testament
Scriptures, viz., in the Davidic Psalms of the time of Absalom - the
treachery and the end of Ahithophel belong to the most prominent typical
features of David's affliction in this second stage of persecution
(vid., Hofmann, Weissagung und Erf@fcllung, ii. 122).

[Psalms 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 41:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 41:2-4) The Psalm opens by celebrating the lot, so rich in
promises, of the sympathetic man. דּל is a general designation of the
poor (e.g., [Exo 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#015).md), of the sick
and weakly ([Gen 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#019).md), of the sick
in mind ([Sa2 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#004).md), and of that which
outwardly or inwardly is tottering and consequently weak, frail. To show
sympathising attention, thoughtful consideration towards such an one
(השׂכּיל אל as in [Neh 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#013.md), cf. על
[Pro 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020).md) has many promises. The
verb חיּה, which elsewhere even means to call to life again ([Psa
71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020).md), in this instance side by side
with preserving, viz., from destruction, has the signification of
preserving life or prolonging life (as in [Psa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004.md); [Psa
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030).md). The Pual אשּׁר signifies to be
made happy ([Pro 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018).md), but also
declaratively: to be pronounced happy ([Isa
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#015).md); here, on account of the בּארץ
that stands with it, it is the latter. The Chethb יעשּׁר sets forth as
an independent promise that which the Ker ואשּׁר joins on to what has
gone before as a consequence. אל, [Psa
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003.md) (cf. [Psa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006) and frequently.md), expresses a
negative with full sympathy in the utterance. נתן בּנפשׁ as in [Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md). The supporting in [Psa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md) is a keeping erect, which stops
or arrests the man who is sinking down into death and the grave. דּוי (=
davj, similar form to שׁמי, מעי, but wanting in the syllable before the
tone) means sickness. If [Psa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md) is
understood of the supporting of the head after the manner of one who
waits upon the sick (cf. [Sol 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006).md),
then [Psa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md) must, with Mendelssohn
and others, be understood of the making of the couch or bed. But what
then is neat by the word לך? משׁכּב is a sick-bed in [Exo
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#018.md) in the sense of being bedridden;
and הפכתּ (cf. [Psa 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#012).md) is a
changing of it into convalescence. By כל־משׁכבו is not meant the
constant lying down of such an one, but the affliction that casts him
down, in all its extent. This Jahve turns or changes, so often as such
an one is taken ill (בחליו, at his falling sick, parallel with דוי
על־ערשׂ דוי htiw). He gives a complete turn to the "sick-bed" towards
recovery, so that not a vestige of the sickness remains behind.

[Psalms 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 41:4</span></span>

(Heb.: 41:5-7) He, the poet, is treated in his distress of soul in a
manner totally different from the way just described which is so rich in
promises of blessing. He is himself just such a דּל, towards whom one
ought to manifest sympathising consideration and interest. But, whilst
he is addressing God in the language of penitential prayer for mercy and
help, his enemies speak evil to him, i.e., with respect to him, wishing
that he might die and that his name might perish. רפאה .hs is as an
exception Milra, inasmuch as א draws the tone to its own syllable; cf.
on the other hand רגזה, [Isa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011.md)
(Hitzig). מתי (prop. extension, length of time) has only become a
Semitic interrogative in the signification quando by the omission of the
interrogative אי (common Arabic in its full form Arab. 'ymtâ, êmata).
ואבד is a continuation of the future. In [Psa
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#007.md) one is singled out and made
prominent, and his hypocritically malicious conduct described. ראות of a
visit to a sick person as in [Sa2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#005.md)., [Kg2
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#029.md). אם is used both with the perf.
([Psa 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018.md); [Psa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#007.md); [Psa
78:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#034.md); [Psa
94:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#018.md); [Gen
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#009.md); [Amo
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#002.md); [Isa
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013.md); [Isa
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#025).md) and with the fut. ([Psa
68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014.md); [Job
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014).md), like quum, as a blending
together of si and quando, Germ. wenn (if) and wann (when). In ידבר לבו
two Rebias come together, the first of which has the greater value as a
distinctive, according to the rule laid down in Baer's Psalterium, p.
xiv. Consequently, following the accents, it must not be rendered:
"falsehood doth his heart speak." The lxx, Vulgate, and Targum have
discerned the correct combination of the words. Besides, the
accentuation, as is seen from the Targum and expositors, proceeds on the
assumption that לבּו is equivalent to בּלבּו. But why may it not be the
subject-notion: "His heart gathereth" is an expression of the activity
of his mind and feelings, concealed beneath a feigned and friendly
outward bearing. The asyndeton portrays the despatch with which he seeks
to make the material for slander, which has been gathered together,
public both in the city and in the country.

[Psalms 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 41:7</span></span>

(Heb.: 41:8-10) Continuation of the description of the conduct of the
enemies and of the false friend. התלחשׁ, as in [Sa2
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#019.md), to whisper to one another, or
to whisper among themselves; the Hithpa. sometimes (cf. [Gen
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001).md) has a reciprocal meaning like
the Niphal. The intelligence brought out by hypocritical visitors of the
invalid concerning his critical condition is spread from mouth to mouth
by all who wish him ill as satisfactory news; and in fact in whispers,
because at that time caution was still necessary. עלי stands twice in a
prominent position in the sense of contra me. רעה לּי belong together:
they maliciously invent what will be the very worst for him (going
beyond what is actually told them concerning him). In this connection
there is a feeling in favour of בּליּעל being intended of an evil fate,
according to [Psa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md), and not
according to [Psa 101:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#003.md) (cf. [Deu
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009).md) of pernicious or evil thought
and conduct. And this view is also supported by the predicate יצוּק בּו:
"a matter of destruction, an incurable evil (Hitzig) is poured out upon
him," i.e., firmly cast upon him after the manner of casting metal ([Job
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#015)..md), so that he cannot get free
from it, and he that has once had to lie down will not again rise up.
Thus do we understand אשׁר in [Psa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md); there is no occasion to take it
as an accusative by departing from the most natural sense, as Ewald
does, or as a conjunction, as Hitzig does. Even the man of his peace, or
literally of his harmonious relationship (אישׁ שׁלום as in [Oba
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#007.md), [Jer
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md); [Jer
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#022).md), on whom he has depended with
fullest confidence, who did eat his bread, i.e., was his messmate (cf.
[Psa 55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015).md), has made his heel great
against him, lxx ἐμεγάλυνεν ἐπ ̓ ἐμὲ πτερνισμόν. The combination הגדּיל
עקב is explained by the fact that עקב is taken in the sense of a thrust
with the heel, a kick: to give a great kick, i.e., with a good swing of
the foot.

[Psalms 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 41:10</span></span>

(Heb.: 41:11-13) Having now described their behaviour towards him, sick
in soul and body as he is, so devoid of affection, yea, so malignantly
hostile and so totally contrary to the will and promise of God, David
prays that God would raise him up, for he is now lying low, sick in soul
and in body. The prayer is followed, as in Ps 39:14 and many other
passages, by the future with ah: that I may be able to requite them, or:
then will I requite them. What is meant is the requiting which it was
David's duty as a duly constituted king to exercise, and which he did
really execute by the power of God, when he subdued the rebellion of
Absalom and maintained his ground in opposition to faithlessness and
meanness. Instead of בּזאת אדע ([Gen
42:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#033.md), cf. [Gen
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md), [Exo
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#017.md); [Num
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#028.md); [Jos
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010).md) the expression is בּזאת ידעתּי
in the sense of (ex hoc) cognoverim. On חפצתּ בּי cf. [Psa
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md); [Psa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009.md); [Psa
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027.md). By the second כּי, the בּזאת,
which points forwards, is explained. The adversatively accented subject
ואני stands first in [Psa 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013.md) as a
nom. absol., just as in [Psa 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013.md).
[Psa 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013.md) states, retrospectively
from the standpoint of fulfilment, what will then be made manifest and
assure him of the divine good pleasure, viz., Jahve upholds him (תּמך as
in [Psa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#009).md), and firmly sets him as
His chosen one before Him (cf. [Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006).md) in accordance with the Messianic
promise in [Sa2 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md), which speaks of
an unlimited future.

[Psalms 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 41:13</span></span>

(Heb.: 41:14) The closing doxology of the First Book, vid.,
Introduction. Concerning בּרוּך vid., [Psa
18:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#047.md). The expression "from aeon to
aeon" is, according to Berachoth ix. 5, directed against those who deny
the truth of the future world. אמן ואמן (a double aleethe's or
aleethoo's) seals it in a climactic form.
