Hymn in Honour of God the All-Compassionate One

To the "Thou wilt have compassion upon Zion" of [Psa
102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md) is appended Psalms 103, which
has this as its substance throughout; but in other respects the two
Psalms stand in contrast to one another. The inscription לדוד is also
found thus by itself without any further addition even before Psalms of
the First Book ([Psa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md), Ps 35, Ps
37). It undoubtedly does not rest merely on conjecture, but upon
tradition. For no internal grounds which might have given rise to the
annotation לדוד can be traced. The form of the language does not favour
it. This pensive song, so powerful in its tone, has an Aramaic colouring
like Ps 116; [Psa 124:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md); [Psa
129:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001.md). In the heaping up of
Aramaizing suffix-forms it has its equal only in the story of Elisha,
[Kg2 4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md), where, moreover, the Kerמ
throughout substitutes the usual forms, whilst here, where these
suffix-forms are intentional ornaments of the expression, the Chethמb
rightly remains unaltered. The forms are 2nd sing. fem. ēchi for ēch,
and 2nd sing. plur. ājchi for ajich. The i without the tone which is
added here is just the one with which originally the pronunciation was
אתּי instead of אתּ and לכי for לך. Out of the Psalter (here and [Psa
116:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007.md), [Psa
116:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#019).md) these suffix-forms echi and
ajchi occur only in [Jer 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015.md), and in
the North-Palestinian history of the prophet in the Book of Kings. The
groups or strophes into which the Psalm falls are [Psa
103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md), [Psa
103:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#006.md), [Psa
103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011.md), [Psa
103:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015.md), [Psa
103:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019.md). If we count their lines we
obtain the schema 10. 10. 8. 8. 10. The coptic version accordingly
reckons 46 CTYXOC, i.e., στίχοι.

[Psalms 103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 103:1</span></span>

In the strophe [Psa 103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md) the poet
calls upon his soul to arise to praiseful gratitude for God's
justifying, redeeming, and renewing grace. In such soliloquies it is the
Ego that speaks, gathering itself up with the spirit, the stronger, more
manly part of man (Psychology, S. 104f.; tr. p. 126), or even, because
the soul as the spiritual medium of the spirit and of the body
represents the whole person of man (Psychology, S. 203; tr. p. 240), the
Ego rendering objective in the soul the whole of its own personality. So
here in [Psa 103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003.md) the soul, which is
addressed, represents the whole man. The קובים which occurs here is a
more choice expression for מעים (מעים): the heart, which is called קרב
κατ ̓ ἐξοχήν, the reins, the liver, etc.; for according to the
scriptural conception (Psychology, S. 266; tr. p. 313) these organs of
the cavities of the breast and abdomen serve not merely for the bodily
life, but also the psycho-spiritual life. The summoning בּרכי is
repeated per anaphoram. There is nothing the soul of man is so prone to
forget as to render thanks that are due, and more especially thanks that
are due to God. It therefore needs to be expressly aroused in order that
it may not leave the blessing with which God blesses it unacknowledged,
and may not forget all His acts performed (גּמל = גּמר) on it (גּמוּל,
ῥῆμα μέσον, e.g., in [Psa 137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008).md),
which are purely deeds of loving-kindness), which is the primal
condition and the foundation of all the others, viz., sin-pardoning
mercy. The verbs סלח and רפא with a dative of the object denote the
bestowment of that which is expressed by the verbal notion. תּחלוּאים
(taken from [Deu 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#021.md), cf. [Ch1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#019.md), from חלא = חלה, root הל,
solutum, laxum esse) are not merely bodily diseases, but all kinds of
inward and outward sufferings. משּׁחת the lxx renders ἐκ φθορᾶς (from
שׁחת, as in [Job 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014).md); but in this
antithesis to life it is more natural to render the "pit" (from שׁוּח)
as a name of Hades, as in [Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md).
Just as the soul owes its deliverance from guilt and distress and death
to God, so also does it owe to God that with which it is endowed out of
the riches of divine love. The verb עטּר, without any such addition as
in Ps 5:13, is "to crown," cf. [Psa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006.md). As is usually the case, it is
construed with a double accusative; the crown is as it were woven out of
loving-kindness and compassion. The Beth of בּטּוב in [Psa
103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005.md) instead of the accusative ([Psa
104:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#028).md) denotes the means of
satisfaction, which is at the same time that which satisfies. עדיך the
Targum renders: dies senectutis tuae, whereas in [Psa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md) it is ornatus ejus; the Peshto
renders: corpus tuum, and in [Psa 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)
inversely, juventus eorum. These significations, "old age" or "youth,"
are pure inventions. And since the words are addressed to the soul, עדי
cannot also, like כבוד in other instances, be a name of the soul itself
(Aben-Ezra, Mendelssohn, Philippsohn, Hengstenberg, and others). We,
therefore, with Hitzig, fall back upon the sense of the word in [Psa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md), where the lxx renders τάς
σιαγόνας αὐτῶν, but here more freely, apparently starting from the
primary notion of עדי = Arabic chadd, the cheek: τὸν ἐμπιπλῶντα ἐν
ἀγαθοῖς τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν σου (whereas Saadia's victum tuum is based upon a
comparison of the Arabic gdâ, to nourish). The poet tells the soul
(i.e., his own person, himself) that God satisfies it with good, so that
it as it were gets its cheeks full of it (cf. [Psa
81:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011).md). The comparison כּנּשׁר is, as
in [Mic 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016.md) (cf. [Isa
40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031).md), to be referred to the annual
moulting of the eagle. Its renewing of its plumage is an emblem of the
renovation of his youth by grace. The predicate to נעוּריכי (plural of
extension in relation to time) stands first regularly in the sing. fem.

[Psalms 103:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 103:6</span></span>

His range of vision being widened from himself, the poet now in [Psa
103:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#006.md) describes God's gracious and
fatherly conduct towards sinful and perishing men, and that as it shines
forth from the history of Israel and is known and recognised in the
light of revelation. What [Psa 103:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#006.md)
says is a common-place drawn from the history of Israel. משׁפּטים is an
accusative governed by the עשׂה that is to be borrowed out of עשׂה (so
Baer after the Masora). And because [Psa
103:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#006.md) is the result of an historical
retrospect and survey, יודיע in [Psa
103:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#007.md) can affirm that which happened
in the past (cf. [Psa 96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006)..md); for the
supposition of Hengstenberg and Hitzig, that Moses here represents
Israel like Jacob, Isaac, and Joseph in other instances, is without
example in the whole Israelitish literature. It becomes clear from [Psa
103:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#008.md) in what sense the making of His
ways known is meant. The poet has in his mind Moses' prayer: "make known
to me now Thy way" ([Exo 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#013).md), which
Jahve fulfilled by passing by him as he stood in the cleft of the rock
and making Himself visible to him as he looked after Him, amidst the
proclamation of His attributes. The ways of Jahve are therefore in this
passage not those in which men are to walk in accordance with His
precepts ([Psa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004).md), but those which
He Himself follows in the course of His redemptive history ([Psa
67:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#003).md). The confession drawn from [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md). is become a formula of the
Israelitish faith ([Psa 86:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#015.md); [Psa
145:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008.md); [Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md); [Neh
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017), and frequently.md). In [Psa
103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009). the fourth attribute (ורב־חסד.md)
is made the object of further praise. He is not only long (ארך from ארך,
like כּבד from כּבד) in anger, i.e., waiting a long time before He lets
His anger loose, but when He contends, i.e., interposes judicially, this
too is not carried to the full extent ([Psa
78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038).md), He is not angry for ever (נטר,
to keep, viz., anger, [Amo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md); cf.
the parallels, both as to matter and words, [Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005.md); [Isa
57:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#016).md). The procedure of His
righteousness is regulated not according to our sins, but according to
His purpose of mercy. The prefects in [Psa
103:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#010.md) state that which God has
constantly not done, and the futures in [Psa
103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009.md) what He continually will not do.

[Psalms 103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 103:11</span></span>

The ingenious figures in [Psa 103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011.md).
(cf. [Psa 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006.md); [Psa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011).md) illustrate the infinite power
and complete unreservedness of mercy (loving-kindness). הרחיק has Gaja
(as have also השׁחיתו and התעיבו, [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md); [Psa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002), in exact texts.md), in order to
render possible the distinct pronunciation of the guttural in the
combination רח. [Psa 103:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013.md) sounds
just as much like the spirit of the New Testament as [Psa
103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011.md), [Psa
103:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#012.md). The relationship to Jahve in
which those stand who fear Him is a filial relationship based upon free
reciprocity ([Mal 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#011).md). His Fatherly
compassion is ([Psa 103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014).md) based upon
the frailty and perishableness of man, which are known to God, much the
same as God's promise after the Flood not to decree a like judgment
again ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021).md). According to this
passage and [Deu 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021.md), יצרנוּ appears
to be intended of the moral nature; but according to [Psa
103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md), one is obliged to think rather
of the natural form which man possesses from God the Creator (ויּיצר,
[Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md) than of the form of heart
which he has by his own choice and, so far as its groundwork is
concerned, by inheritance ([Psa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007).md).
In זכוּר, mindful, the passive, according to Bצttcher's correct
apprehension of it, expresses a passive state after an action that is
completed by the person himself, as in בּטוּה, ידוּע, and the like. In
its form [Psa 103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md) reminds one of
the Book of Job [Job 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#011.md); [Job
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#023.md), and [Psa
103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md) as to subject-matter recalls
[Job 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007.md), and other passages (cf. [Psa
78:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#039.md); [Psa
89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048).md); but the following figurative
representation of human frailty, with which the poet contrasts the
eternal nature of the divine mercy as the sure stay of all God-fearing
ones in the midst of the rise and decay of things here below, still more
strongly recalls that book.

[Psalms 103:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 103:15</span></span>

The figure of the grass recalls [Psa
90:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005.md)., cf. [Isa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md); [Isa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md); that of the flower, [Job
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002.md). אנושׁ is man as a mortal being;
his life's duration is likened to that of a blade of grass, and his
beauty and glory to a flower of the field, whose fullest bloom is also
the beginning of its fading. In [Psa
103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016.md) בּו (the same as in [Isa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007)..md) refers to man, who is compared
to grass and flowers. כּי is ἐάν with a hypothetical perfect; and the
wind that scorches up the plants, referred to man, is an emblem of every
form of peril that threatens life: often enough it is really a breath of
wind which snaps off a man's life. The bold designation of vanishing
away without leaving any trace, "and his place knoweth him no more," is
taken from [Job 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#010.md), cf. ibid. [Job
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#018.md); [Job
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#009.md). In the midst of this plant-like,
frail destiny, there is, however, one strong ground of comfort. There is
an everlasting power, which raises all those who link themselves with it
above the transitoriness involved in nature's laws, and makes them
eternal like itself. This power is the mercy of God, which spans itself
above (על) all those who fear Him like an eternal heaven. This is God's
righteousness, which rewards faithful adherence to His covenant and
conscientious fulfilment of His precepts in accordance with the order of
redemption, and shows itself even to (ל) children's children, according
to [Exo 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006.md); [Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md); [Deu
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009.md) : on into a thousand generations,
i.e., into infinity.

[Psalms 103:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 103:19</span></span>

He is able to show Himself thus gracious to His own, for He is the
supra-mundane, all-ruling King. With this thought the poet draws on to
the close of his song of praise. The heavens in opposition to the earth,
as in [Psa 115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003.md); [Ecc
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012.md), is the unchangeable realm above
the rise and fall of things here below. On [Psa
103:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019.md) cf. [Ch1
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#012.md). בּכּל refers to everything
created without exception, the universe of created things. In connection
with the heavens of glory the poet cannot but call to mind the angels.
His call to these to join in the praise of Jahve has its parallel only
in [Psa 29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md) and [Psa
148:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md). It arises from the
consciousness of the church on earth that it stands in living
like-minded fellowship with the angels of God, and that it possesses a
dignity which rises above all created things, even the angels which are
appointed to serve it ([Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011).md).
They are called גּבּרים as in [Joe
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#011.md), and in fact גּבּרי כּח, as the
strong to whom belongs strength unequalled. Their life endowed with
heroic strength is spent entirely - an example for mortals - in an
obedient execution of the word of God. לשׁמע is a definition not of the
purpose, but of the manner: obediendo (as in [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003) perficiendo.md). Hearing the call of
His word, they also forthwith put it into execution. the hosts (צבאיו),
as משׁרתיו shows, are the celestial spirits gathered around the angels
of a higher rank (cf. [Luk 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013).md), the
innumerable λειτουργικὰ πνεῦματα ([Psa
104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004.md), [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md); [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014).md), for there is a hierarchia
caelestis. From the archangels the poet comes to the myriads of the
heavenly hosts, and from these to all creatures, that they, wheresoever
they may be throughout Jahve's wide domain, may join in the song of
praise that is to be struck up; and from this point he comes back to his
own soul, which he modestly includes among the creatures mentioned in
the third passage. A threefold בּרכי נפשׁי now corresponds to the
threefold בּרכוּ; and inasmuch as the poet thus comes back to his own
soul, his Psalm also turns back into itself and assumes the form of a
converging circle.
