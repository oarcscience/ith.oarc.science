### [Joshua Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 12:0</span></span>

List of the Kings Slaughtered by the Israelites - Joshua 12

In the historical account of the wars of Joshua in the south and north
of Canaan, the only kings mentioned by name as having been conquered and
slain by the Israelites, were those who had formed a league to make war
upon them; whereas it is stated at the close, that Joshua had smitten
all the kings in the south and north, and taken possession of their
towns ([Jos 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040.md); [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017).md). To complete the account of
these conquests, therefore, a detailed list is given in the present
chapter of all the kings that were slain, and not merely of those who
were defeated by Joshua in the country on this side of the Jordan, but
the two kings of the Amorites who had been conquered by Moses are also
included, so as to give a complete picture of all the victories which
Israel had gained under the omnipotent help of its God.

[Joshua 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 12:1</span></span>

List of the kings whom the Israelites smote, and whose land they took,
on the other side of the Jordan, - namely, the land by the brook Arnon
(Mojeb; see [Num 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013).md) to Hermon
(Jebel es Sheikh, [Deu 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008).md), and the
whole of the eastern Arabah (the valley of the Jordan on the eastern
side of the river).

[Jos 12:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002.md)

On Sihon and his kingdom, see [Num
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024.md); [Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md); [Deu
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016.md). "Aror on the Arnon:" the
present ruins of Araayr, on the northern bank of the Mojeb (see [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034)). הנּחל ותוך, "and (from.md) the
middle of the valley onwards:" i.e., according to the parallel passages
in [Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md), [Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016.md), and [Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md), from the town in the Arnon
valley, the city of Moab mentioned in [Num
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#036.md), viz., Ar or Areopolis (see at
[Num 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015).md) in the neighbourhood of
Aror, which is mentioned as the exclusive terminus a quo of the land
taken by the Israelites along with the inclusive terminus Aror.
"Half-Gilead," i.e., the mountainous district on the south side of the
Jabbok (see at [Deu 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010).md), "to the
river Jabbok," i.e., the upper Jabbok, the present Nahr Ammn (see at
[Num 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024).md).

[Jos 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003.md)

"And (over) the Arabah, etc., Sihon reigned," i.e., over the eastern
side of the Ghor, between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea (see at
[Deu 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017).md). "By the way to
Bethjeshimoth, and towards the south below the slopes of Pisgah" (see at
[Num 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015.md) and [Num
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012).md), i.e., to the north-eastern
border of the desert by the Dead Sea (see at [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001).md).

[Jos 12:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004.md)

"And the territory of Og," sc., they took possession of ([Jos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001).md). On Og, vid., [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md); and on his residences, Ashtaroth
(probably to be seen in Tell Ashtereh) and Edrei (now Draa or Dra), see
at [Gen 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md) and [Num
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#033.md). On his territory, see [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md), [Deu
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013.md).

[Jos 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#006.md)

These two kings were smitten by Moses, etc.: vid., [Num
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md)., and [Num
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033.md).

[Joshua 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 12:7</span></span>

List of the thirty-one kings of Canaan whom Joshua smote on the western
side of the Jordan, "from Baal-gad, in the valley of Lebanon, to the
bald mountain that goeth up towards Seir" (see [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017).md). This land Joshua gave to the
other tribes of Israel. (On the different parts of the land, see at [Jos
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md); [Jos
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040.md), and [Jos
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002)..md)

[Joshua 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 12:9</span></span>

The different kings are given in the order in which they were defeated:
Jericho ([Jos 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001).md); Ai ([Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002).md); Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth,
Lachish, and Eglon ([Jos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003).md); Gezer
([Jos 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033).md); and Debir ([Jos
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#038).md). Those given in [Jos
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#013.md) and [Jos
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#014.md) are not mentioned by name in
Josh 10. Geder, possibly the same as Gedor upon the mountains of Judah
([Jos 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058).md), which has been preserved
under the old name of Jedur (Rob. Pal. ii. p. 186, and Bibl. Res. p.
282). Hormah (i.e., banning) was in the south of Judah ([Jos
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#030).md), and was allotted to the
Simeonites ([Jos 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#004).md). It was called
Zephath by the Canaanites ([Jdg 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017.md);
see at [Num 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#003).md), was on the southern
slope of the mountains of the Amalekites or Amorites, the present ruins
of Septa, on the western slope of the table-land of Rakhma, two hours
and a half to the south-west of Khalasa (Elusa: see Ritter, Erdk. xiv.
p. 1085). Arad, also in the Negeb, has been preserved in Tell Arad (see
at [Num 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001).md). Libnah (see at [Jos
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029).md). Adullam, which is mentioned in
[Jos 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md) among the towns of the
plain between Jarmuth and Socoh, was in the neighbourhood of a large
cave in which David took refuge when flying from Saul ([Sa1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md); [Sa2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#013).md). It was fortified by Rehoboam
([Ch2 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#007).md), and is mentioned in 2
Macc. 12:38 as the city of Odollam. The Onomast. describes it as being
ten Roman miles to the east of Eleutheropolis; but this is a mistake,
though it has not yet been discovered. So far as the situation is
concerned, Deir Dubbn would suit very well, a place about two hours to
the north of Beit Jibrin, near to a large number of caves in the white
limestone, which form a kind of labyrinth, as well as some vaulted
grottos (see Rob. Pal. ii. p. 353, and Van de Velde, Reise, pp. 162-3).
Makkedah: possibly Summeil (see at [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010).md). Bethel, i.e., Beitin (see [Jos
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#017).md). The situation of the towns
which follow in [Jos 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#017.md) and [Jos
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018.md) cannot be determined with
certainty, as the names Tappuach, Aphek, and Hefer are met with again in
different parts of Canaan, and Lassaron does not occur again. But if we
observe, that just as from [Jos 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#010.md)
onwards those kings'-towns are first of all enumerated, the capture of
which has already been described in Josh 10, and then in [Jos
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#015.md) and [Jos
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#016.md) certain other towns are added
which had been taken in the war with the Canaanites of the south, so
likewise in [Jos 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#019.md) and [Jos
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#020.md) the capitals of the allied kings
of northern Canaan are given first, and after that the other towns that
were taken in the northern war, but had not been mentioned by name in
Josh 11: there can be no doubt whatever that the four towns in [Jos
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#017.md) and [Jos
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018.md) are to be classed among the
kings'-towns taken in the war with the king of Jerusalem and his allies,
and therefore are to be sought for in the south of Canaan and not in the
north. Consequently we cannot agree with Van de Velde and Knobel in
identifying Tappuach with En-Tappuach ([Jos
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007).md), and looking for it in Atf, a
place to the north-east of Nablus and near the valley of the Jordan; we
connect it rather with Tappuach in the lowlands of Judah ([Jos
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034).md), though the place itself has
not yet been discovered. Hefer again is neither to be identified with
Gath-hepher in the tribe of Zebulun ([Jos
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013).md), nor with Chafaraim in the
tribe of Issachar ([Jos 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#019).md), but is
most probably the capital of the land of Hefer ([Kg1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#010).md), and to be sought for in the
neighbourhood of Socoh in the plain of Judah. Aphek is probably the town
of that name not far from Ebenezer ([Sa1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001).md), where the ark was taken by the
Philistines, and is most likely to be sought for in the plain of Judah,
though not in the village of Ahbek (Rob. Pal. ii. p. 343); but it has
not yet been traced. Knobel imagines that it was Aphek near to Jezreel
([Sa1 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001).md), which was situated,
according to the Onom., in the neighbourhood of Endor ([Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md); [Kg1
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#025.md), [Kg1
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#030).md); but this Aphek is too far
north. Lassaron only occurs here, and hitherto it has been impossible to
trace it. Knobel supposes it to be the place called Saruneh, to the west
of the lake of Tiberias, and conjectures that the name has been
contracted from Lassaron by aphaeresis of the liquid. This is quite
possible, if only we could look for Lassaron so far to the north.
Bachienne and Rosenmller imagine it to be the village of Sharon in the
celebrated plain of that name, between Lydda and Arsuf.

[Joshua 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 12:19</span></span>

Madon, Hezor, Shimron-meron, and Achshaph (see at [Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001).md).

[Joshua 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 12:21</span></span>

Taanach, which was allotted to the Manassites in the territory of
Issachar, and given up to the Levites ([Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md); [Jos
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025).md), but was not entirely wrested
from the Canaanites ([Jdg 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027).md), is
the present Tell Tanak, an hour and a quarter to the south-east of
Lejun, a flat hill sown with corn; whilst the old name has been
preserved in the small village of Tanak, at the south-eastern foot of
the Tell (see Van de Velde, i. p. 269, and Rob. Pal. iii. p. 156). -
Megiddo, which was also allotted to the Manassites in the territory of
Issachar, though without the Canaanites having been entirely expelled
([Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md); [Jdg
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027).md), was fortified by Solomon ([Kg1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015).md), and is also well known as the
place were Ahaziah died ([Kg2 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027).md),
and where Josiah was beaten and slain by Pharaoh Necho ([Kg2
23:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md); [Ch2
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020)..md). Robinson has shown that it
was preserved in the Legio of a later time, the present Lejun (Pal. iii.
pp. 177ff.; see also Bibl. Res. p. 116).

[Joshua 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 12:22</span></span>

Kedesh, a Levitical city and city of refuge upon the mountains of
Naphtali ([Jos 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#037.md); [Jos
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007.md); [Jos
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032).md), the home of Barak ([Jdg
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006).md), was conquered and depopulated by
Tiglath-Pileser ([Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md), and was
also a well-known place after the captivity (1 Macc. 11:61ff.) It is now
an insignificant village, still bearing the ancient name, to the
north-west of the lake of Huleh, or, according to Van de Velde (Reise.
ii. p. 355), nothing but a miserable farmstead upon a Tell at the
south-west extremity of a well-cultivated table-land, with a large
quantity of antiquities about, viz., hewn stones, relics of columns,
sarcophagi, and two ruins of large buildings, with an open and extensive
prospect on every side (see also Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 367ff.). Jokneam,
near Carmel, as a Levitical town in the territory of Zebulun ([Jos
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011.md); [Jos
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034).md). Van de Velde and Robinson
(Bibl. Res. p. 114) suppose that they have found it in Tell Kaimn, on
the eastern side of the Wady el Milh, at the north-west end of a chain
of hills running towards the south-east; this Tell being 200 feet high,
and occupying a very commanding situation, so that it governed the main
pass on the western side of Esdraelon towards the southern plain. Kaimn
is the Arabic form of the ancient Καμμωνά, Cimana, which Eusebius and
Jerome describe in the Onom. as being six Roman miles to the north of
Legio, on the road to Ptolemais.

[Joshua 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 12:23</span></span>

Dor: see [Jos 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002.md). Gilgal: the seat
of the king of the Goyim (a proper name, as in [Gen
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001).md), in all probability the same
place as the villa nomine Galgulis mentioned in the Onom. (s. v. Gelgel)
as being six Roman miles to the north of Antipatris, which still exists
in the Moslem village of Jiljule (now almost a ruin; see Rob. Bibl. Res.
p. 136), although this village is only two miles E.S.E. of Kefr Sba, the
ancient Antipatris (see Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 568-9). Thirza, the
capital of the kings of Israel down to the time of Omri ([Kg1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017.md); [Kg1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021.md), [Kg1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033.md); [Kg1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#006)..md), is probably the present
Talluza, an elevated and beautifully situated place, of a considerable
size, surrounded by large olive groves, two hours to the north of
Shechem (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 302, and Van de Velde, ii. p. 294).
