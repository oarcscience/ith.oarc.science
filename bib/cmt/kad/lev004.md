### [Leviticus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 4:1</span></span>

The Expiatory Sacrifices. - The sacrifices treated of in ch. 1-3 are
introduced by their names, as though already known, for the purpose of
giving them a legal sanction. But in ch. 4 and 5 sacrifices are
appointed for different offences, which receive their names for the
first time from the objects to which they apply, i.e., from the sin, or
the trespass, or debt to be expiated by them: viz., חטּאת sin, i.e.,
sin-offering ([Lev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md), [Lev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#008.md), [Lev
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014.md), [Lev
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#019), etc..md), and אשׁם debt, i.e.,
debt-offering ([Lev 5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015.md), [Lev
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#019).md); - a clear proof that the sin
and debt-offerings were introduced at the same time as the Mosaic law.
The laws which follow are distinguished from the preceding ones by the
new introductory formula in [Lev
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001.md), which is repeated in [Lev
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014.md). This repetition proves that Lev
4:2-5:13 treats of the sin-offerings, and [Lev
5:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014.md) of the trespass-offerings; and
this is confirmed by the substance of the two series of laws.

[Leviticus 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 4:2</span></span>

The Sin-Offerings. - The ritual prescribed for these differed, with
regard to the animals sacrificed, the sprinkling of the blood, and the
course adopted with the flesh, according to the position which the
person presenting them happened to occupy in the kingdom of God. The
classification of persons was as follows: (1) the anointed priest ([Lev
4:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002)); (2.md) the whole congregation of
Israel ([Lev 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#013) -21); (3.md) the prince
(vv. 22-26); (4) the common people (v. 27- [Lev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#013).md). In the case of the last, regard
was also paid to their circumstances; so that the sin-offerings could be
regulated according to the ability of the offerer, especially for the
lighter forms of sin ([Lev 5:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001).md).

[Lev 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md)

"If a soul sin in wandering from any (מכּל in a partitive sense) of the
commandments of Jehovah, which ought not to be done, and do any one of
them" (מאחת with מן partitive, cf. [Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), [Lev
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md), [Lev
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027), lit., anything of one.md). This
sentence, which stands at the head of the laws for the sin-offerings,
shows that the sin-offerings did not relate to sin or sinfulness in
general, but to particular manifestations of sin, to certain distinct
actions performed by individuals, or by the whole congregation. The
distinguishing characteristic of the sin is expressed by the term
בּשׁגגה (in error). No sins but those committed בּשׁגגה could be
expiated by sin-offerings; whilst those committed with a high hand were
to be punished by the extermination of the sinner ([Num
15:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#027).md). שׁגגה, from שׁגג = שׁגה to
wander or go wrong, signifies mistake, error, oversight. But sinning "in
error" is not merely sinning through ignorance ([Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), [Lev
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md), [Lev
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027.md), [Lev
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#018).md), hurry, want of consideration,
or carelessness ([Lev 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md), [Lev
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004.md), [Lev
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015).md), but also sinning
unintentionally ([Num 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#011.md), [Num
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#015.md), [Num
35:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#022).md); hence all such sins as
spring from the weakness of flesh and blood, as distinguished from sins
committed with a high (elevated) hand, or in haughty, defiant rebellion
against God and His commandments.

[Leviticus 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 4:3</span></span>

The sin of the high priest. - The high priest is here called the
"anointed priest" ([Lev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md), [Lev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005.md), [Lev
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#016.md), [Lev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#015).md) on account of the completeness
of the anointing with which he was consecrated to his office ([Lev
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#012).md); in other places he is called
the great (or high) priest ([Lev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010.md); [Num
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#025), etc..md), and by later writers
הראשׁ כּהן, the priest the head, or head priest ([Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md); [Ch2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#011).md). If he sinned העם לאשׁמת, "to
the sinning of the nation," i.e., in his official position as
representative of the nation before the Lord, and not merely in his own
personal relation to God, he was to offer for a sin-offering because of
his sin an ox without blemish, the largest of all the sacrificial
animals, because he filled the highest post in Israel.

[Lev 4:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#004.md)

The presentation, laying on of hands, and slaughtering, were the same as
in the case of the other sacrifices ([Lev
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003).md). The first peculiarity occurs
in connection with the blood ([Lev
4:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005).md). The anointed priest was to
take (a part) of the blood and carry it into the tabernacle, and having
dipped his finger in it, to sprinkle some of it seven times before
Jehovah "in the face of the vail of the Holy" ([Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031).md), i.e., in the direction towards
the curtain; after that, he was to put (נתן) some of the blood upon the
horns of the altar of incense, and then to pour out the great mass of
the blood, of which only a small portion had been used for sprinkling
and smearing upon the horns of the altar, at the bottom of the altar of
burnt-offering. A sevenfold sprinkling "in the face of the vail" also
took place in connection with the sin-offering for the whole
congregation, as well as with the ox and he-goat which the high priest
offered as sin-offerings on the day of atonement for himself, the
priesthood, and the congregation, when the blood was sprinkled seven
times before (לפני) the capporeth ([Lev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#014).md), and seven times upon the horns
of the altar ([Lev 16:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018).md). So too
the blood of the red cow, that was slaughtered as a sin-offering outside
the camp, was sprinkled seven times in the direction towards the
tabernacle ([Num 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#004).md). The sevenfold
sprinkling at the feast of atonement had respect to the purification of
the sanctuary from the blemishes caused by the sins of the people, with
which they had been defiled in the course of the year (see at ch. 16),
and did not take place till after the blood had been sprinkled once
"against (? upon) the capporeth in front" for the expiation of the sin
of the priesthood and people, and the horns of the altar had been
smeared with the blood ([Lev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#014.md),
[Lev 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018).md); whereas in the
sin-offerings mentioned in this chapter, the sevenfold sprinkling
preceded the application of the blood to the horns of the altar. This
difference in the order of succession of the two manipulations with the
blood leads to the conclusion, that in the case before us the sevenfold
sprinkling had a different signification from that which it had on the
day atonement, and served as a preliminary and introduction to the
expiation. The blood also was not sprinkled upon the altar of the holy
place, but only before Jehovah, against the curtain behind which Jehovah
was enthroned, that is to say, only into the neighbourhood of the
gracious presence of God; and this act was repeated seven times, that in
the number seven, as the stamp of the covenant, the covenant relation,
which sin had loosened, might be restored. It was not till after this
had been done, that the expiatory blood of the sacrifice was put upon
the horns of the altar, - not merely sprinkled or swung against the wall
of the altar, but smeared upon the horns of the altar; not, however,
that the blood might thereby be brought more prominently before the eyes
of God, or lifted up into His more immediate presence, as Hoffmann and
Knobel suppose, but because the significance of the altar, as the scene
of the manifestation of the divine grace and salvation, culminated in
the horns, as the symbols of power and might. In the case of the
sin-offerings for the high priest and the congregation, the altar upon
which this took place was not the altar of burnt-offering in the court,
but the altar of incense in the holy place; because both the anointed
priest, by virtue of his calling and consecration as the mediator
between the nation and the Lord, and the whole congregation, by virtue
of its election as a kingdom of priests ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006).md), were to maintain communion with
the covenant God in the holy place, the front division of the
dwelling-place of Jehovah, and were thus received into a closer relation
of fellowship with Jehovah than the individual members of the nation,
for whom the court with its altar was the divinely appointed place of
communion with the covenant God. The remainder of the blood, which had
not been used in the act of expiation, was poured out at the bottom of
the altar of burnt-offering, as the holy place to which all the
sacrificial blood was to be brought, that it might be received into the
earth.

[Lev 4:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#008.md)

The priest was to lift off "all the fat" from the sacrificial animal,
i.e., the same fat portions as in the peace-offering ([Lev
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md), כּל־חלב is the subject to יוּרם
in [Lev 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#010).md), and burn it upon the
altar of burnt-offering.

[Lev 4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#011.md)

The skin of the bullock, and all the flesh, together with the head and
the shank and the entrails ([Lev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009).md)
and the foeces, in fact the whole bullock, was to be carried out by him
(the sacrificing priest) to a clean place before the camp, to which the
ashes of the sacrifices were carried from the ash-heap ([Lev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#016).md), and there burnt on the wood
with fire. (On the construction of [Lev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#011.md) and [Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012) see Ges. 145, 2.md).

The different course, adopted with the blood and flesh of the
sin-offerings, from that prescribed in the ritual of the other
sacrifices, was founded upon the special signification of these
offerings. As they were presented to effect the expiation of sins, the
offerer transferred the consciousness of sin and the desire for
forgiveness to the head of the animal that had been brought in his
stead, by the laying on of his hand; and after this the animal was
slaughtered, and suffered death for him as the wages of sin. But as sin
is not wiped out by the death of the sinner, unless it be forgiven by
the grace of God, so devoting to death an animal laden with sin rendered
neither a real nor symbolical satisfaction or payment for sin, by which
the guilt of it could be wiped away; but the death which it endured in
the sinner's stead represented merely the fruit and effect of sin. To
cover the sinner from the holiness of God because of his sin, some of
the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled seven times before Jehovah in
the holy place; and the covenant fellowship, which had been endangered,
was thereby restored. After this, however, the soul, which was covered
in the sacrificial blood, was given up to the grace of God that
prevailed in the altar, by means of the sprinkling of the blood upon the
horns of the altar of incense, that it might receive the forgiveness of
sins and reconciliation with God, and the full enjoyment of the
blessings of the covenant be ensured to it once more. But the sin, that
had been laid upon the animal of the sin-offering, lay upon it still.
The next thing done, therefore, was to burn the fat portions of its
inside upon the altar of burnt-offering. Now, if the flesh of the victim
represented the body of the offerer as the organ of his soul, the fat
portions inside the body, together with the kidneys, which were regarded
as the seat of the tenderest and deepest emotions, can only have set
forth the better part or inmost kernel of the man, the ἔσω ἄνθρωπος
([Rom 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#022.md); [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016).md). By burning the fat portions
upon the altar, the better part of human nature was given up in symbol
to the purifying fire of the Holy Spirit of God, that it might be
purified from the dross of sin, and ascend in its glorified essence to
heaven, for a sweet savour unto the Lord ([Lev
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#031).md). The flesh of the sin-offering,
however, or "the whole bullock," was then burned in a clean place
outside the camp, though not merely that it might be thereby destroyed
in a clean way, like the flesh provided for the sacrificial meals, which
had not been consumed at the time fixed by the law ([Lev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#017.md); [Lev
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#032.md); [Lev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#006.md); [Exo
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#010.md); [Exo
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#034).md), or the flesh of the
sacrifices, which had been defiled by contact with unclean objects ([Lev
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019).md); for if the disposal of the
flesh formed an integral part of the sacrificial ceremony in the case of
all the other sacrifices, and if, in the case of the sin-offerings, the
blood of which was not brought into the interior of the sanctuary, the
priests were to eat the flesh in a holy place, and that not "as a
portion assigned to them by God as an honourable payment," but,
according to the express declaration of Moses, "to bear and take away
(לשׂאת) the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them"
([Lev 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017).md), the burning of the flesh
of the sin-offerings, i.e., of the animal itself, the blood of which was
not brought into the holy place, cannot have been without significance,
or simply the means adopted to dispose of it in a fitting manner, but
must also have formed one factor in the ceremony of expiation. The
burning outside the camp was rendered necessary, because the sacrifice
had respect to the expiation of the priesthood, and the flesh or body of
the bullock, which had been made חטּאת by the laying on of the hand,
could not be eaten by the priests as the body of sin, that by the
holiness of their official character they might bear and expiate the sin
imputed to the sacrifice (see at [Lev
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017).md). In this case it was necessary
that it should be given up to the effect of sin, viz., to death or
destruction by fire, and that outside the camp; in other words, outside
the kingdom of God, from which everything dead was removed. But,
inasmuch as it was sacrificial flesh, and therefore most holy by virtue
of its destination; in order that it might not be made an abomination,
it was not to be burned in an unclean place, where carrion and other
abominations were thrown ([Lev 14:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#040.md),
[Lev 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#045).md), but in the clean place,
outside the camp, to which the ashes of the altar of burnt-offering were
removed, as being the earthly sediment and remains of the sacrifices
that had ascended to God in the purifying flames of the altar-fire.

(Note: The most holy character of the flesh of the sin-offering ([Lev
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#018)..md) furnishes no valid argument
against the correctness of this explanation of the burning; for, in the
first place, there is an essential difference between real or inherent
sin, and sin imputed or merely transferred; and secondly, the flesh of
the sin-offering was called most holy, not in a moral, but only in a
liturgical or ritual sense, as subservient to the most holy purpose of
wiping away sin; on which account it was to be entirely removed from all
appropriation to earthly objects. Moreover, the idea that sin was
imputed to the sin-offering, that it was made sin by the laying on of
the hand, has a firm basis in the sacrifice of the red cow (Num 19), and
also occurs among the Greeks (see Oehler in Herzog's Cycl.).)

[Leviticus 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 4:13</span></span>

Sin of the whole congregation. - This is still further defined, as
consisting in the fact that the thing was hid (נעלּם)

(Note: In the correct editions נעלּם has dagesh both here and in [Lev
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#002.md), [Lev
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004.md), as Delitzsch informs me,
according to an old rule in pointing, which required that every
consonant which followed a syllable terminating with a guttural should
be pointed with dagesh, if the guttural was to be read with a quiescent
sheva and not with chateph. This is the case in ויּאסּר in [Gen
46:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#029.md); [Exo
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#006.md), תּעלּים in [Psa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md), and other words in the critical
edition of the Psalter which has been carefully revised by Bהr according
to the Masora, and published with an introduction by Delitzsch. In other
passages, such as בּכל־לּבּי [Psa 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#002.md),
על־לּשׁנו [Psa 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#003.md), etc., the dagesh
is introduced to prevent the second letter from being lost in the
preceding one through the rapidity of reading. - Ewald's conjectures and
remarks about this "dagesh, which is found in certain MSS," is a proof
that he was not acquainted with this rule which the Masora recognises.)

from the eyes of the congregation, i.e., that it was a sin which was not
known to be such, an act which really violated a commandment of God,
though it was not looked upon as sin. Every transgression of a divine
command, whether it took place consciously or unconsciously, brought
guilt, and demanded a sin-offering for its expiation; and this was to be
presented as soon as the sin was known. The sin-offering, which the
elders had to offer in the name of the congregation, was to consist of a
young ox, and was to be treated like that of the high priest ([Lev
4:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014.md) compared with [Lev
4:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003).md), inasmuch as "the whole
congregation" included the priesthood, or at any rate was on an equality
with the priesthood by virtue of its calling in relation to the Lord.
חטא with על signifies to incur guilt upon (on the foundation of) sin
([Lev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005), etc..md); it is usually
construed with an accusative ([Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md), [Lev
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#028.md); [Lev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006.md), [Lev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#010), etc..md), or with בּ, to sin with a
sin ([Lev 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023.md); [Gen
42:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#022).md). The subject of ושׁחט ([Lev
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#015).md) is one of the elders. "The
bullock for a sin-offering:" sc., the one which the anointed priest
offered for his sin, or as it is briefly and clearly designated in [Lev
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#021.md), "the former bullock" ([Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012).md).

[Leviticus 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 4:20</span></span>

"And let the priest make an atonement for them, that it may be forgiven
them," or, "so will they be forgiven." This formula recurs with all the
sin-offerings (with the exception of the one for the high priest), viz.,
[Lev 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026.md), [Lev
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#031.md), [Lev
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035.md), [Lev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#010.md), [Lev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#013.md); [Num
15:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#025.md), [Num
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#028.md); also with the
trespass-offerings, [Lev 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016.md), [Lev
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#018.md); [Lev
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#022.md), - the only difference being,
that in the sin-offerings presented for defilements cleansing is
mentioned, instead of forgiveness, as the effect of the atoning
sacrifice ([Lev 12:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#007.md); [Lev
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#020.md), [Lev
13:53](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#053.md); [Num
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#021).md).

[Leviticus 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 4:22</span></span>

The sin of a ruler. - [Lev 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md). אשׁר:
ὅτε, when. נשׂיא is the head of a tribe, or of a division of a tribe
([Num 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#024.md), [Num
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#030.md), [Num
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#035).md).

[Lev 4:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023.md)

"If (או, see Ges. 155, 2) his sin is made known to him," i.e., if any
one called his attention to the fact that he had transgressed a
commandment of God, he was to bring a he-goat without blemish, and,
having laid his hand upon it, to slay it at the place of burnt-offering;
after which the priest was to put some of the blood upon the horns of
the altar of burnt-offering, and pour out the rest of the blood at the
foot of the altar, and then to burn the whole of the fat upon the altar,
as in the case of the peaceoffering (see [Lev
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003).md), and thus to make atonement for
the prince on account of his sin. עזים שׂעיר, or שׂעיר alone (lit.,
hairy, shaggy, [Gen 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#011).md), is the
buck-goat, which is frequently mentioned as the animal sacrificed as a
sin-offering: e.g., that of the tribe-princes ([Num
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#016.md)., [Lev
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#024).md), and that of the nation at the
yearly festivals ([Lev 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#009.md), [Lev

23:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#019.md); [Num
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#015.md), [Num
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#022.md), [Num

29:5](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#005.md), [Num

tabernacle ([Lev 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003.md), [Lev
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#015.md); [Lev
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#016).md). It is distinguished in [Num
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#016.md). from the attudim, which were
offered as peace-offerings, and frequently occur in connection with
oxen, rams, and lambs as burnt-offerings and thank-offerings ([Psa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009.md), [Psa
50:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#013.md); [Psa
66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015.md); [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md); [Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md); [Eze
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018).md). According to Knobel, עזים
שׂעיר, or שׂעיר, was an old he-goat, the hair of which grew longer with
age, particularly about the neck and back, and עזים שׂעירת ([Lev
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#028.md); [Lev
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016).md) an old she-goat; whilst עתּוּד
was the younger he-goat, which leaped upon the does ([Gen
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#010.md), [Gen
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#012).md), and served for slaughtering
like lambs, sheep, and goats ([Deu
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014.md); [Jer
51:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#040).md). But as the עזים שׂעיר was also
slaughtered for food ([Gen 37:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#031).md), and
the skins of quite young he-goats are called שׂעירת ([Gen
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#023).md), the difference between שׂעיר
and עתּוּד is hardly to be sought in the age, but more probably, as
Bochart supposes, in some variety of species, in which case seir and
seirak might denote the rough-haired, shaggy kind of goat, and attud the
buck-goat of stately appearance.

In the case of the sin of a common Israelite ("of the people of the
land," i.e., of the rural population, [Gen
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#007).md), that is to say, of an Israelite
belonging to the people, as distinguished from the chiefs who ruled over
the people ([Kg2 11:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md); [Kg2
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015).md), the sin-offering was to
consist of a shaggy she-goat without blemish, or a ewe-sheep ([Lev
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#032).md). The ceremonial in both cases
was the same as with the he-goat ([Lev
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023)..md). - "According to the offerings
made by fire unto the Lord" ([Lev
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035).md): see at [Lev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#005.md).
