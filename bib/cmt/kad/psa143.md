Longing after Mercy in the Midst of Dark Imprisonment

In some codices of the lxx this Psalm (as Euthymius also bears witness)
has no inscription at all; in others, however, it has the inscription:
Ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυεὶδ ὅτε αὐτὸν ἐδίωκεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ (Cod. Sinait.
οτε αυτον ο υς καταδιωκει). Perhaps by the same poet as [Psa
142:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001.md), with which it accords in [Psa
143:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#004.md), [Psa
143:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#008.md), [Psa
143:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#011.md) (cf. [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004), 8.md), it is like this a modern
offshoot of the Davidic Psalm-poetry, and is certainly composed as
coming out of the situation of him who was persecuted by Absalom. The
Psalms of this time of persecution are distinguished from those of the
time of the persecution by Saul by the deep melancholy into which the
mourning of the dethroned king was turned by blending with the
penitential sorrowfulness of one conscious of his own guilt. On account
of this fundamental feature the church has chosen [Psa
143:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001.md) for the last of its seven
Psalmi poenitentiales. The Sela at the close of [Psa
143:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#006.md) divides the Psalm into two
halves.

[Psalms 143:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 143:1</span></span>

The poet pleads two motives for the answering of his prayer which are to
be found in God Himself, viz., God's אמוּנה, truthfulness, with which He
verifies the truth of His promises, that is to say, His faithfulness to
His promises; and His צדקה, righteousness, not in a recompensative legal
sense, but in an evangelical sense, in accordance with His counsel,
i.e., the strictness and earnestness with which He maintains the order
of salvation established by His holy love, both against the ungratefully
disobedient and against those who insolently despise Him. Having entered
into this order of salvation, and within the sphere of it serving Jahve
as his God and Lord, the poet is the servant of Jahve. And because the
conduct of the God of salvation, ruled by this order of salvation, or
His "righteousness" according to its fundamental manifestation, consists
in His justifying the sinful man who has no righteousness that he can
show corresponding to the divine holiness, but penitently confesses this
disorganized relationship, and, eager for salvation, longs for it to be
set right again - because of all this, the poet prays that He would not
also enter into judgment (בּוא בּמשׁפּט as in [Job
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032.md); [Job
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#004.md); [Job
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#003).md) with him, that He therefore
would let mercy instead of justice have its course with him. For, apart
from the fact that even the holiness of the good spirits does not
coincide with God's absolute holiness, and that this defect must still
be very far greater in the case of spirit-corporeal man, who has
earthiness as the basis of his origin-yea, according to [Psa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007.md), man is conceived in sin, so that
he is sinful from the point at which he begins to live onward - his life
is indissolubly interwoven with sin, no living man possesses a
righteousness that avails before God ([Job
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017.md); [Job
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002.md); [Job
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#003.md)., [Job
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014), and frequently.md).

(Note: Gerson observes on this point (vid., Thomasius, Dogmatik, iv.
251): I desire the righteousness of pity, which Thou bestowest in the
present life, not the judgment of that righteousness which Thou wilt put
into operation in the future life - the righteousness which justifies
the repentant one.)

With כּי ([Psa 143:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#003).md) the poet
introduces the ground of his petition for an answer, and more
particularly for the forgiveness of his guilt. He is persecuted by
deadly foes and is already nigh unto death, and that not without
transgression of his own, so that consequently his deliverance depends
upon the forgiveness of his sins, and will coincide with this. "The
enemy persecuteth my soul" is a variation of language taken from [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md) (חיּה for חיּים, as in [Psa
78:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#050.md), and frequently in the Book of
Job, more particularly in the speeches of Elihu). [Psa
143:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#003.md) also recalls [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md), but as to the words it sounds
like [Lam 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#006.md) (cf. [Psa
88:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#007)). מתי עולם (lxx νεκροὺς αἰῶνος.md)
are either those for ever dead (the Syriac), after שׁנת עולם in [Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md), cf. בּית עולמו in [Ecc
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005.md), or those dead time out of mind
(Jerome), after עם עולם in [Eze 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020.md).
The genitive construction admits both senses; the former, however, is
rendered more natural by the consideration that הושׁיבני glances back to
the beginning that seems to have no end: the poet seems to himself like
one who is buried alive for ever. In consequence of this hostility which
aims at his destruction, the poet feels his spirit within him, and
consequently his inmost life, veil itself (the expression is the same as
[Psa 142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004.md); [Psa
77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004).md); and in his inward part his
heart falls into a state of disturbance (ישׁתּומם, a Hithpo. peculiar to
the later language), so that it almost ceases to beat. He calls to mind
the former days, in which Jahve was manifestly with him; he reflects
upon the great redemptive work of God, with all the deeds of might and
mercy in which it has hitherto been unfolded; he meditates upon the
doing (בּמעשׂה, Ben-Naphtali בּמעשׂה) of His hands, i.e., the hitherto
so wondrously moulded history of himself and of his people. They are
echoes out of [Psa 77:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004.md), [Psa
77:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#012.md). The contrast which presents
itself to the Psalmist in connection with this comparison of his present
circumsntaces with the past opens his wounds still deeper, and makes his
prayer for help all the more urgent. He stretches forth his hands to God
that He may protect and assist him (vid., Hlemann, Bibelstudien, i.
150f.). Like parched land is his soul turned towards Him, - language in
which we recognise a bending round of the primary passage [Psa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md). Instead of לך it would be לך, if
סלה (Targum לעלמין) were not, as it always is, taken up and included in
the sequence of the accents.

[Psalms 143:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 143:7</span></span>

In this second half the Psalm seems still more like a reproduction of
the thoughts of earlier Psalms. The prayer, "answer me speedily, hide
not Thy face from me," sounds like [Psa
69:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#018.md); [Psa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md), cf. [Psa
102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md). The expression of languishing
longing, כּלתה רוּחי, is like [Psa
84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md). And the apodosis, "else I should
become like those who go down into the pit," agrees word for word with
[Psa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md), cf. [Psa
88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md). In connection with the words,
"cause me to hear Thy loving-kindness in the early morning," one is
reminded of the similar prayer of Moses in [Psa
90:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#014.md), and with the confirmatory "for
in Thee do I trust" of [Psa 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md), and
frequently. With the prayer that the night of affliction may have an end
with the next morning's dawn, and that God's helping loving-kindness may
make itself felt by him, is joined the prayer that God would be pleased
to grant him to know the way that he has to go in order to escape the
destruction into which they are anxious to ensnare him. This last prayer
has its type in [Exo 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#013.md), and in the
Psalter in [Psa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004.md) (cf. [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004).md); and its confirmation: for to
Thee have I lifted up my soul, viz., in a craving after salvation and in
the confidence of faith, has its type in [Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md); [Psa
86:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004.md). But the words אליך כסּיתי, which
are added to the petition "deliver me from mine enemies" ([Psa
59:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#002.md); [Psa
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016).md), are peculiar, and in their
expression without example. The Syriac version leaves them untranslated.
The lxx renders: ὅτι πρὸς σὲ κατέφυγον, by which the defective mode of
writing כסתי is indirectly attested, instead of which the translators
read נסתי (cf. נוּס על in [Isa 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003).md);
for elsewhere not חסה but נוּס is reproduced with καταφυγεῖν. The Targum
renders it מימרך מנּתי לפריק, Thy Logos do I account as (my) Redeemer
(i.e., regard it as such), as if the Hebrew words were to be rendered:
upon Thee do I reckon or count, כסּיתי = כּסתּי, [Exo
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#004.md). Luther closely follows the lxx:
"to Thee have I fled for refuge." Jerome, however, inasmuch as he
renders: ad te protectus sum, has pointed כסּיתי (כסּיתי). Hitzig (on
the passage before us and [Pro 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#020).md)
reads כסתי from כּסא = סכא, to look ("towards Thee do I look"). But the
Hebrew contains no trace of that verb; the full moon is called כסא
(כסה), not as being "a sight or vision, species," but from its covered
orb.

The כסּתי before us only admits of two interpretations: (1) Ad (apud) te
texi = to Thee have I secretly confided it (Rashi, Aben-Ezra, Kimchi,
Coccejus, J. H. Michaelis, J. D. Michalis, Rosenmller, Gesenius, and De
Wette). But such a constructio praegnans, in connection with which כּסּה
would veer round from the signification to veil (cf. כסה מן, [Gen
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017).md) into its opposite, and the
clause have the meaning of כּי אליך גּלּיתי, [Jer
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020.md); [Jer
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#012), is hardly conceivable. (2.md) Ad
(apud) te abscondidi, scil. me (Saadia, Calvin, Maurer, Ewald, and
Hengstenberg), in favour of which we decide; for it is evident from [Gen
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014.md); [Deu
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#012.md), cf. [Jon
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006.md), that כּסּה can express the act of
covering as an act that is referred to the person himself who covers,
and so can obtain a reflexive meaning. Therefore: towards Thee, with
Thee have I made a hiding = hidden myself, which according to the sense
is equivalent to חסיתּי, as Hupfeld (with a few MSS) wishes to read; but
Abulwald has already remarked that the same goal is reached with כסּתי.
Jahve, with whom he hides himself, is alone able to make known to him
what is right and beneficial in the position in which he finds himself,
in which he is exposed to temporal and spiritual dangers, and is able to
teach him to carry out the recognised will of God ("the will of God,
good and well-pleasing and perfect," [Rom
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002).md); and this it is for which he
prays to Him in [Psa 143:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#010.md) (רצונך;
another reading, רצונך). For Jahve is indeed his God, who cannot leave
him, who is assailed and tempted without and within, in error; may His
good Spirit then (רוּחך טובה for הטּובה, [Neh
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#020).md)

(Note: Properly, "Thy Spirit, רוּח הטּובה, a spirit, the good one,
although such irregularities may also be a negligent usage of the
language, like the Arabic msjd 'l-jâm‛, the chief mosque, which many
grammarians regard as a construct relationship, others as an ellipsis
(inasmuch as they supply Arab. 'l-mkân between the words); the former is
confirmed from the Hebrew, vid., Ewald, 287, a.))

lead him in a level country, for, as it is said in Isaiah, [Isa
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007.md), in looking up to Jahve, "the
path which the righteous man takes is smoothness; Thou makest the course
of the righteous smooth." The geographical term ארץ מישׁור, [Deu
4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043.md); [Jer
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#021.md), is here applied spiritually.
Here, too, reminiscences of Psalms already read meet us everywhere: cf.
on "to do Thy will," [Psa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md); on
"for Thou art my God," [Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), and
frequently; on "Thy good Spirit," [Psa
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014.md); on "a level country," and the
whole petition, [Psa 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md) (where the
expression is "a level path"), together with [Psa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md); [Psa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004.md)., [Psa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004.md). And the Psalm also further
unrolls itself in such now well-known thoughts of the Psalms: For Thy
Name's sake, Jahve ([Psa 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011).md),
quicken me again ([Psa 71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020.md), and
frequently); by virtue of Thy righteousness be pleased to bring my soul
out of distress (Ps 142:8; [Psa 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017.md),
and frequently); and by virtue of Thy loving-kindness cut off mine
enemies ([Psa 54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007).md). As in [Psa
143:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001.md) faithfulness and righteousness,
here loving-kindness (mercy) and righteousness, are coupled together;
and that so that mercy is not named beside towtsiy', nor righteousness
beside תּצמית, but the reverse (vid., on [Psa
143:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001).md). It is impossible that God
should suffer him who has hidden himself in Him to die and perish, and
should suffer his enemies on the other hand to triumph. Therefore the
poet confirms the prayer for the cutting off (הצמית as in [Psa
94:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#023).md) of his enemies and the
destruction (האביד, elsewhere אבּד) of the oppressors of his soul
(elsewhere צררי) with the words: for I am Thy servant.
