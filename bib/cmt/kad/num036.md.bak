### [Numbers Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 36:1</span></span>

The occasion for this law was a representation made to Moses and the
princes of the congregation by the heads of the fathers' houses (האבות
for בּית־האבות, as in [Exo 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#025), etc..md)
of the family of Gilead the Manassite, to which Zelophehad ([Num
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033).md) belonged, to the effect that,
by allotting an hereditary possession to the daughters of Zelophehad,
the tribe-territory assigned to the Manassites would be diminished if
they should marry into another tribe. They founded their appeal upon the
command of Jehovah, that the land was to be distributed by lot among the
Israelites for an inheritance ([Num
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#002.md) compared with [Num
26:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055.md), and [Num
33:54](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#054).md); and although it is not
expressly stated, yet on the ground of the promise of the everlasting
possession of Canaan ([Gen 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008).md), and
the provision made by the law, that an inheritance was not to be
alienated ([Lev 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010.md), [Lev
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013.md), [Lev
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023)..md), they understood it as
signifying that the portion assigned to each tribe was to continue
unchanged to all generations. (The singular pronoun, my Lord, in [Num
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#002.md), refers to the speaker, as in
[Num 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#027)..md) Now, as the inheritance
of their brother, i.e., their tribe-mate Zelophehad, had been given to
his daughters ([Num 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001).md), if they
should be chosen as wives by any of the children of the (other) tribes
of Israel, i.e., should marry into another tribe, their inheritance
would be taken away from the tribe-territory of Manasseh, and would be
added to that of the tribe into which they were received. The suffix להם
([Num 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#003).md) refers ad sensum to מטּה,
the tribe regarded according to its members.

[Numbers 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 36:4</span></span>

And when the year of jubilee came round (see [Lev
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010).md), their inheritance would be
entirely withdrawn from the tribe of Manasseh. Strictly speaking, the
hereditary property would pass at once, when the marriage took place, to
the tribe into which an heiress married, and not merely at the year of
jubilee. But up to the year of jubilee it was always possible that the
hereditary property might revert to the tribe of Manasseh, either
through the marriage being childless, or through the purchase of the
inheritance. But in the year of jubilee all landed property that had
been alienated was to return to its original proprietor or his heir
([Lev 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#033)..md). In this way the
transfer of an inheritance from one tribe to another, which took place
in consequence of a marriage, would be established in perpetuity. And it
was in this sense that the elders of the tribe of Manasseh meant that a
portion of the inheritance which had fallen to them by lot would be
taken away from their tribe at the year of jubilee.

[Numbers 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 36:5</span></span>

Moses declared that what they had affirmed was right (כּן), and then, by
command of Jehovah, he told the daughters of Zelophehad that they might
marry whoever pleased them (the suffix ־הם, attached to בּעיני, for ־הן,
as in [Exo 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#021.md); [Gen
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#009), etc..md), but that he must belong
to the family of their father's tribe, that is to say, must be a
Manassite. For ([Num 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#007).md) the
inheritance was not to turn away the Israelites from one tribe to
another (not to be transferred from one to another), but every Israelite
was to keep to the inheritance of his father's tribe, and no one was to
enter upon the possession of another tribe by marrying an heiress
belonging to that tribe. This is afterwards extended, in [Num
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#008.md) and [Num
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#009.md), into a general law for every
heiress in Israel.

[Numbers 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 36:10</span></span>

In [Num 36:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#010.md) it is related that,
in accordance with these instructions, the five daughters of Zelophehad,
whose names are repeated from [Num
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033.md) and [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md) (see also [Jos
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#003).md), married husbands from the
families of the Manassites, namely, sons of their cousins (? uncles),
and thus their inheritance remained in their father's tribe (על היה, to
be and remain upon anything).

[Numbers 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 36:13</span></span>

The conclusion refers not merely to the laws and rights contained in Num
33:50-36:13, but includes the rest of the laws given in the steppes of
Moab (ch. 25-30), and forms the conclusion tot he whole book, which
places the lawgiving in the steppes of Moab by the side of the lawgiving
at Mount Sinai ([Lev 26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046.md); [Lev
27:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#034).md) and bring sit to a close,
though without in any way implying that the explanation (בּאר, [Deu
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005).md), further development, and
hortatory enforcement of the law and its testimonies, statutes, and
judgments ([Deu 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005.md); [Deu
4:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#044.md)., [Num
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001)..md), which follow in Deuteronomy,
are not of Mosaic origin.
