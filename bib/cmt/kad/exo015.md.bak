### [Exodus Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 15:1</span></span>

In the song of praise which Moses and the children of Israel sang at the
Red Sea, in celebration of the wonderful works of Jehovah, the
congregation of Israel commemorated the fact of its deliverance and its
exaltation into the nation of God. By their glorious deliverance from
the slave-house of Egypt, Jehovah had practically exalted the seed of
Abraham into His own nation; and in the destruction of Pharaoh and his
host, He had glorified Himself as God of the gods and King of the
heathen, whom no power on earth could defy with impunity. As the fact of
Israel's deliverance from the power of its oppressors is of everlasting
importance to the Church of the Lord in its conflict with the ungodly
powers of the world, in which the Lord continually overthrows the
enemies of His kingdom, as He overthrew Pharaoh and his horsemen in the
depths of the sea: so Moses' song at the Red Sea furnishes the Church of
the Lord with the materials for its songs of praise in all the great
conflicts which it has to sustain, during its onward course, with the
powers of the world. Hence not only does the key-note of this song
resound through all Israel's songs, in praise of the glorious works of
Jehovah for the good of His people (see especially [Isa
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md), but the song of Moses the
servant of God will also be sung, along with the song of the Lamb, by
the conquerors who stand upon the "sea of glass," and have gained the
victory over the beast and his image ([Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003).md).

The substance of this song, which is entirely devoted to the praise and
adoration of Jehovah, is the judgment inflicted upon the heathen power
of the world in the fall of Pharaoh, and the salvation which flowed from
this judgment to Israel. Although Moses is not expressly mentioned as
the author of the song, its authenticity, or Mosaic authorship, is
placed beyond all doubt by both the contents and the form. The song is
composed of three gradually increasing strophes, each of which commences
with the praise of Jehovah, and ends with a description of the overthrow
of the Egyptian host ([Exo 15:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md),
[Exo 15:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#006.md), [Exo
15:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011).md). The theme announced in the
introduction in [Exo 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md) is thus
treated in three different ways; and whilst the omnipotence of God,
displayed in the destruction of the enemy, is the prominent topic in the
first two strophes, the third depicts with prophetic confidence the
fruit of this glorious event in the establishment of Israel, as a
kingdom of Jehovah, in the promised inheritance. Modern criticism, it is
true, has taken offence at this prophetic insight into the future, and
rejected the song of Moses, just because the wonders of God are carried
forward in [Exo 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016.md), [Exo
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017.md), beyond the Mosaic times. But it
was so natural a thing that, after the miraculous deliverance of the
Israelites from Egypt, they should turn their eyes to Canaan, and,
looking forward with certainty to the possession of the promised land,
should anticipate with believing confidence the foundation of a
sanctuary there, in which their God would dwell with them, that none but
those who altogether reject the divine mission of Moses, and set down
the mighty works of God in Egypt as myths, could ever deny to Moses this
anticipation and prospect. Even Ewald admits that this grand song of
praise "was probably the immediate effect of first enthusiasm in the
Mosaic age," though he also ignores the prophetic character of the song,
and denies the reality of any of the supernatural wonders of the Old
Testament. There is nothing to prevent our understanding words, "then
sang Moses," as meaning that Moses not only sang this song with the
Israelites, but composed it for the congregation to the praise of
Jehovah.

[Exo 15:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md)

Introduction and first strophe. - The introduction, which contains the
theme of the song, "Sing will I to the Lord, for highly exalted is He,
horse and his rider He hath thrown into the sea," was repeated, when
sung, as an anti-strophe by a chorus of women, with Miriam at their head
(cf. [Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md), [Exo
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#021).md); whether after every verse, or
only at the close of the longer strophes, cannot be determined. גּאה to
arise, to grow up, trop. to show oneself exalted; connected with an inf.
abs. to give still further emphasis. Jehovah had displayed His
superiority to all earthly power by casting horses and riders, the proud
army of the haughty Pharaoh, into the sea. This had filled His people
with rejoicing: ([Exo 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002).md), "My
strength and song is Jah, He became my salvation; He is my God, whom I
extol, my father's God, whom I exalt." עז strength, might, not praise or
glory, even in [Psa 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md). זמרת, an old
poetic form for זמרה, from זמר, primarily to hum; thence זמּר רב́ככוים,
to play music, or sing with a musical accompaniment. Jah, the
concentration of Jehovah, the God of salvation ruling the course of
history with absolute freedom, has passed from this song into the
Psalms, but is restricted to the higher style of poetry. "For He became
salvation to me, granted me deliverance and salvation:" on the use of
vav consec. in explanatory clauses, see [Gen
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012.md). This clause is taken from our
song, and introduced in [Isa 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002.md);
[Psa 118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md). אלי זה: this Jah, such an
one is my God. אנוהוּ: Hiphil of נוה, related to נאה, נאוה, to be
lovely, delightful, Hiph. to extol, to praise, δοξάσω, glorificabo (lxx,
Vulg.). "The God of my father:" i.e., of Abraham as the ancestor of
Israel, or, as in [Exo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md), of the
three patriarchs combined. What He promised them ([Gen
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014.md); [Gen
46:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003).md) He had now fulfilled.

[Exo 15:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003.md)

"Jehovah is a man of war:" one who knows how to make war, and possesses
the power to destroy His foes. "Jehovah is His name:" i.e., He has just
proved Himself to be the God who rules with unlimited might. For ([Exo
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004).md) "Pharaoh's chariots and his
might (his military force) He cast into the sea, and the choice (the
chosen ones) of his knights (shelishim, see [Exo
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007).md) were drowned in the Red Sea."

[Exo 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#005.md)

"Floods cover them (יכסימוּ, defectively written for יכסיוּ = יכסּוּ,
and the suffix מוּ for מו, only used here); they go down into the deep
like stone," which never appears again.

[Exo 15:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#006.md)

Jehovah had not only proved Himself to be a true man of war in
destroying the Egyptians, but also as the glorious and strong one, who
overthrows His enemies at the very moment when they think they are able
to destroy His people.

[Exo 15:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#006.md)

"Thy right hand, Jehovah, glorified in power (gloriously equipped with
power: on the Yod in נאדּרי, see [Gen
31:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#039.md); the form is masc., and ימין,
which is of common gender, is first of all construed as a masculine, as
in [Pro 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#016.md), and then as a
feminine), "Thy right hand dashes in pieces the enemy." רעץ = רצץ: only
used here, and in [Jdg 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008.md). The
thought it quite a general one: the right hand of Jehovah smites every
foe. This thought is deduced from the proof just seen of the power of
God, and is still further expanded in [Exo
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#007.md), "In the fulness of Thy majesty
Thou pullest down Thine opponents." הרס generally applied to the pulling
down of buildings; then used figuratively for the destruction of foes,
who seek to destroy the building (the work) of God; in this sense here
and [Psa 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005.md). קמים: those that rise
up in hostility against a man ([Deu
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#011.md); [Psa
18:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040), etc..md). "Thou lettest out Thy
burning heat, it devours them like stubble." חרן, the burning breath of
the wrath of God, which Jehovah causes to stream out like fire ([Eze
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#003).md), was probably a play upon the
fiery look cast upon the Egyptians from the pillar of cloud (cf. [Isa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018.md); [Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017.md); and on the last words, [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md); [Nah
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010).md).

[Exo 15:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#008.md)

Thus had Jehovah annihilated the Egyptians. "And by the breath of Thy
nostrils (i.e., the strong east wind sent by God, which is described as
the blast of the breath of His nostrils; cf. [Psa
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016).md) the waters heaped themselves up
(piled themselves up, so that it was possible to go between them like
walls); the flowing ones stood like a heap" (נד cumulus; it occurs in
[Jos 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#013.md), [Jos
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016.md), and [Psa
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007.md); [Psa
78:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#013.md), where it is borrowed from this
passage. מזלים: the running, flowing ones; a poetic epithet applied to
waves, rivers, or brooks, [Psa 78:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#016.md),
[Psa 78:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#044.md); [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003).md). "The waves congealed in the
heart of the sea:" a poetical description of the piling up of the waves
like solid masses.

[Exo 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#009.md)

"The enemy said: I pursue, overtake, divide spoil, my soul becomes full
of them; I draw my sword, my hand will root them out." By these short
clauses following one another without any copula, the confidence of the
Egyptian as he pursued them breathing vengeance is very strikingly
depicted. נפשׁ: the soul as the seat of desire, i.e., of fury, which
sought to take vengeance on the enemy, "to cool itself on them." הורישׁ:
to drive from their possession, to exterminate (cf. [Num
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012).md).

[Exo 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#010.md)

"Thou didst blow with Thy breath: the sea covered them, they sank as
lead in the mighty waters." One breath of God was sufficient to sink the
proud foe in the waves of the sea. The waters are called אדּרים, because
of the mighty proof of the Creator's glory which is furnished by the
waves as they rush majestically along.

[Exo 15:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md)

Third strophe. On the ground of this glorious act of God, the song rises
in the third strophe into firm assurance, that in His incomparable
exaltation above all gods Jehovah will finish the word of salvation,
already begun, fill all the enemies of Israel with terror at the
greatness of His arm, bring His people to His holy dwelling-place, and
plant them on the mountain of His inheritance. What the Lord had done
thus far, the singer regarded as a pledge of the future.

[Exo 15:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md)

"Who is like unto Thee among the gods, O Jehovah (אלים: not strong ones,
but gods, Elohim, [Psa 86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008.md), because
none of the many so-called gods could perform such deeds), who is like
unto Thee, glorified in holiness?" God had glorified Himself in holiness
through the redemption of His people and the destruction of His foes; so
that Asaph could sing, "Thy way, O God, is in holiness" ([Psa
78:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#013).md). קדשׁ, holiness, is the sublime
and incomparable majesty of God, exalted above all the imperfections and
blemishes of the finite creature (vid., [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006).md). "Fearful for praises, doing
wonders." The bold expression תהלּת נורא conveys more than summe
venerandus, s. colendus laudibus, and signifies terrible to praise,
terribilis laudibus. As His rule among men is fearful ([Psa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005).md), because He performs fearful
miracles, so it is only with fear and trembling that man can sing songs
of praise worthy of His wondrous works. Omnium enim laudantium vires,
linguas et mentes superant ideoque magno cum timore et tremore eum
laudant omnes angeli et sancti (C. a Lap.). "Thou stretchest out Thy
hand, the earth swallows them." With these words the singer passes in
survey all the mighty acts of the Lord, which were wrapt up in this
miraculous overthrow of the Egyptians. The words no longer refer to the
destruction of Pharaoh and his host. What Egypt had experienced would
come upon all the enemies of the Lord and His people. Neither the idea
of the earth swallowing them, nor the use of the imperfect, is
applicable to the destruction of the Egyptians (see [Exo
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md), [Exo
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004.md), [Exo
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#005.md), [Exo
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#010.md), [Exo
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#019.md), where the perfect is applied to
it as already accomplished).

[Exo 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#013.md)

"Thou leadest through Thy mercy the people whom Thou redeemest; Thou
guidest them through Thy might to Thy holy habitation." The deliverance
from Egypt and guidance through the Red Sea were a pledge to the
redeemed people of their entrance into the promised land. The holy
habitation of God was Canaan ([Psa
78:54](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#054).md), which had been consecrated as
a sacred abode for Jehovah in the midst of His people by the revelations
made to the patriarchs there, and especially by the appearance of God at
Bethel ([Gen 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016.md)., [Exo
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013.md); [Exo
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#007).md).

[Exo 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014.md)

"People hear, they are afraid; trembling seizes the inhabitants of
Philistia."

[Exo 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015.md)

"Then are the princes (alluphim, see [Gen
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015).md) of Edom confounded; the mighty
men of Moab, trembling seizes them; all the inhabitants of Canaan
despair." אלים, like אוּלים in [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015.md), scriptio plena for אלים,
strong, powerful ones. As soon as these nations should hear of the
miraculous guidance of Israel through the Red Sea, and Pharaoh's
destruction, they would be thrown into despair from anxiety and alarm,
and would not oppose the march of Israel through their land.

[Exo 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016.md)

"Fear and dread fall upon them; for the greatness of Thine arm (the
adjective גּדול placed as a substantive before the noun) they are dumb
(ידּמוּ from דּמם) as stones, till Thy people pass through, Jehovah,
till the people which Thou hast purchased pass through." Israel was
still on its march to Canaan, an evident proof that [Exo
15:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#013.md) do not describe what was
past, but that future events were foreseen in spirit, and are
represented by the use of perfects as being quite as certain as if they
had already happened. The singer mentions not only Edom and Moab, but
Philistia also, and the inhabitants of Canaan, as enemies who are so
paralyzed with terror, as to offer no resistance to the passage of
Israel through their territory; whereas the history shows that Edom did
oppose their passing through its land, and they were obliged to go round
in consequence ([Num 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#018.md).; [Deu
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#003.md), [Deu
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#008).md), whilst Moab attempted to destroy
them through the power of Balaam's curse ([Num
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#002)..md); and what the inhabitants of
Philistia and Canaan had to fear, was not their passing through, but
their conquest of the land.

(Note: The fact that the inhabitants of Philistia and Canaan are
described in the same terms as Edom and Moab, is an unquestionable proof
that this song was composed at a time when the command to exterminate
the Canaanites had not yet been given, and the boundary of the territory
to be captured by the Israelites was not yet fixed; in other words, that
it was sung by Moses and the Israelites after the passage through the
Red Sea. In the words יעבר עד in [Exo
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016.md), there is by no means the
allusion to, or play upon, the passage through the Jordan, which Knobel
introduces.)

We learn, however, from [Jos 2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md)
and [Jos 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#009.md), that the report of
Israel's miraculous passage through the Red Sea had reached to Canaan,
and filled its inhabitants with terror.

[Exo 15:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017.md)

"Thou wilt bring and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance,
the place which Thou hast made for Thy dwelling-place, Jehovah, for the
sanctuary, Lord, which Thy hands prepared." On the dagesh dirim. in
מקּדשׁ, see [Exo 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003.md). The futures are
not to be taken as expressive of wishes, but as simple predictions, and
are not to be twisted into preterites, as they have been by Knobel. The
"mountain of Jehovah's inheritance" was not the hill country of Canaan
([Deu 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025).md), but the mountain which
Jehovah had prepared for a sanctuary ([Psa
78:54](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#054).md), and chosen as a dwelling-place
through the sacrifice of Isaac. The planting of Israel upon this
mountain does not signify the introduction of the Israelites into the
promised land, but the planting of the people of God in the house of the
Lord ([Psa 92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014).md), in the future
sanctuary, where Jehovah would perfect His fellowship with His people,
and where the people would show themselves by their sacrifices to be the
"people of possession," and would serve Him for ever as their King. This
was the goal, to which the redemption from Egypt pointed, and to which
the prophetic foresight of Moses raised both himself and his people in
this song, as he beholds in spirit and ardently desires the kingdom of
Jehovah in its ultimate completion.

(Note: Auberlen's remarks in the Jahrb.f. d. Theol. iii. p. 793, are
quite to the point: "In spirit Moses already saw the people brought to
Canaan, which Jehovah had described, in the promise given to the fathers
and repeated to him, as His own dwelling-place where He would abide in
the midst of His people in holy separation from the nations of the
world. When the first stage had been so gloriously finished, he could
already see the termination of the journey."..."The nation was so
entirely devoted to Jehovah, that its own dwelling-place fell into the
shade beside that of its God, and assumed the appearance of a sojourning
around the sanctuary of Jehovah, for God went up before the people in
the pillar of cloud and fire. The fact that a mountain is mentioned in
[Exo 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017.md) as the dwelling-place of
Jehovah is no proof of a vaticinium post eventum, but is a true
prophecy, having its natural side, however, in the fact that mountains
were generally the sites chosen for divine worship and for temples; a
fact with which Moses was already acquainted ([Gen
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md); [Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md), [Exo
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012.md); compare such passages as [Num
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041.md); [Num
33:52](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052.md); [Mic
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001).md). In the actual fulfilment its
was Mount Zion upon which Jehovah was enthroned as King in the midst of
his People.)

The song closes in [Exo 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#018.md) with an
inspiring prospect of the time, when "Jehovah will be King (of His
people) for ever and ever;" and in [Exo
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#019.md), it is dovetailed into the
historical narrative by the repetition of the fact to which it owed its
origin, and by the explanatory "for," which points back to the opening
verse.

[Exo 15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#019.md)

In the words "Pharaoh's horse, with his chariots and horsemen," Pharaoh,
riding upon his horse as the leader of the army, is placed at the head
of the enemies destroyed by Jehovah. In [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md), Miriam is called "the
prophetess," not ob poeticam et musicam facultatem (Ros.), but because
of her prophetic gift, which may serve to explain her subsequent
opposition to Moses ([Num 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001.md), [Num
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#006).md); and "the sister of Aaron,"
though she was Moses' sister as well, and had been his deliverer in his
infancy, not "because Aaron had his own independent spiritual standing
by the side of Moses" (Baumg.), but to point out the position which she
was afterwards to occupy in the congregation of Israel, namely, as
ranking, not with Moses, but with Aaron, and like him subordinate to
Moses, who had been placed at the head of Israel as the mediator of the
Old Covenant, and as such was Aaron's god ([Exo
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#016), Kurtz.md). As prophetess and sister
of Aaron she led the chorus of women, who replied to the male chorus
with timbrels and dancing, and by taking up the first strophe of the
song, and in this way took part in the festival; a custom that was kept
up in after times in the celebration of victories ([Jdg
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md); [Sa1
18:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006.md); [Sa1
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#012.md); [Sa1
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#005).md), possibly in imitation of an
Egyptian model (see my Archologie, 137, note 8).

[Exodus 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 15:22</span></span>

[Exo 15:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022.md)

Leaving the Red Sea, they went into the desert of Shur. This name is
given to the tract of desert which separates Egypt from Palestine, and
also from the more elevated parts of the desert of Arabia, and stretches
from the Mediterranean to the head of the Arabian Gulf or Red Sea, and
thence along the eastern shore of the sea to the neighbourhood of the
Wady Gharandel. In [Num 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#008.md) it is
called the desert of Etham, from the town of Etham, which stood upon the
border (see [Exo 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#020).md). The spot
where the Israelites encamped after crossing the sea, and sang praises
to the Lord for their gracious deliverance, is supposed to have been the
present Ayun Musa (the springs of Moses), the only green spot in the
northern part of this desolate tract of desert, where water could be
obtained. At the present time there are several springs there, which
yield a dark, brackish, though drinkable water, and a few stunted palms;
and even till a very recent date country houses have been built and
gardens laid out there by the richer inhabitants of Suez. From this
point the Israelites went three days without finding water, till they
came to Marah, where there was water, but so bitter that they could not
drink it. The first spot on the road from Ayun Musa to Sinai where water
can be found, is in the well of Howra, 33 English miles from the former.
It is now a basin of 6 or 8 feet in diameter, with two feet of water in
it, but so disagreeably bitter and salt, that the Bedouins consider it
the worst water in the whole neighbourhood (Robinson, i. 96). The
distance from Ayun Musa and the quality of the water both favour the
identity of Howra and Marah. A whole people, travelling with children,
cattle, and baggage, could not accomplish the distance in less than
three days, and there is no other water on the road from Ayum Musa to
Howra. Hence, from the time of Burckhardt, who was the first to
rediscover the well, Howra has been regarded as the Marah of the
Israelites. In the Wady Amara, a barren valley two hours to the north of
Howra, where Ewald looked for it, there is not water to be found; and in
the Wady Gharandel, two hours to the south, to which Lepsius assigned
it, the quality of the water does not agree with our account.

(Note: The small quantity of water at Howra, "which is hardly sufficient
for a few hundred men, to say nothing of so large an army as the
Israelites formed" (Seetzen), is no proof that Howra and Marah are not
identical. For the spring, which is now sanded up, may have flowed more
copiously at one time, when it was kept in better order. Its present
neglected state is the cause of the scarcity.)

It is true that no trace of the name has been preserved; but it seems to
have been given to the place by the Israelites simply on account of the
bitterness of the water. This furnished the people with an inducement to
murmur against Moses ([Exo 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#024).md).
They had probably taken a supply of water from Ayum Musa for the three
days' march into the desert. But this store was now exhausted; and, as
Luther says, "when the supply fails, our faith is soon gone." Thus even
Israel forgot the many proofs of the grace of God, which it had received
already.

[Exo 15:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#025.md)

When Moses cried to the Lord in consequence, He showed him some wood
which, when thrown into the water, took away its bitterness. The
Bedouins, who know the neighbourhood, are not acquainted with such a
tree, or with any other means of making bitter water sweet; and this
power was hardly inherent in the tree itself, though it is ascribed to
it in Ecclus. 38:5, but was imparted to it through the word and power of
God. We cannot assign any reason for the choice of this particular
earthly means, as the Scripture says nothing about any "evident and
intentional contrast to the change in the Nile by which the sweet and
pleasant water was rendered unfit for use" (Kurtz). The word עץ "wood"
(see only [Num 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#006).md), alone, without
anything in the context to explain it, does not point to a "living tree"
in contrast to the "dead stick." And if any contrast had been intended
to be shown between the punishment of the Egyptians and the training of
the Israelites, this intention would certainly have been more visibly
and surely accomplished by using the staff with which Moses not only
brought the plagues upon Egypt, but afterwards brought water out of the
rock. If by עץ we understand a tree, with which ויּשׁלך, however, hardly
agrees, it would be much more natural to suppose that there was an
allusion to the tree of life, especially if we compare [Gen
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009.md) and [Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022.md) with [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md), "the leaves of the tree of life
were for the healing of the nations," though we cannot regard this
reference as established. All that is clear and undoubted is, that by
employing these means, Jehovah made Himself known to the people of
Israel as their Physician, and for this purpose appointed the wood for
the healing of the bitter water, which threatened Israel with disease
and death ([Kg2 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#040).md).

By this event Jehovah accomplished two things: (a) "there He put (made)
for it (the nation) an ordinance and a right," and (b) "there He proved
it." The ordinance and right which Jehovah made for Israel did not
consist in the words of God quoted in [Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026.md), for they merely give an
explanation of the law and right, but in the divine act itself. The
leading of Israel to bitter water, which their nature could not drink,
and then the sweetening or curing of this water, were to be a חק for
Israel, i.e., an institution or law by which God would always guide and
govern His people, and a משׁפּט or right, inasmuch as Israel could
always reckon upon the help of God, and deliverance from every trouble.
But as Israel had not yet true confidence in the Lord, this was also a
trial, serving to manifest its natural heart, and, through the relief of
its distress on the part of God, to refine and strengthen its faith. The
practical proof which was given of Jehovah's presence was intended to
impress this truth upon the Israelites, that Jehovah as their Physician
would save them from all the diseases which He had sent upon Egypt, if
they would hear His voice, do what was right in His eyes, and keep all
His commandments.

[Exo 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#027.md)

Elim, the next place of encampment, has been sought from olden time in
the Wady Gharandel, about six miles south of Howra; inasmuch as this
spot, with its plentiful supply of comparatively good water, and its
luxuriance of palms, tamarisks, acacias, and tall grass, which cause it
to be selected even now as one of the principal halting-places between
Suez and Sinai, quite answers to Elim, with its twelve wells of water
and seventy palm-trees (cf. Rob. i. pp. 100, 101, 105). It is true the
distance from Howra is short, but the encampments of such a procession
as that of the Israelites are always regulated by the supply of water.
Both Baumgarten and Kurtz have found in Elim a place expressly prepared
for Israel, from its bearing the stamp of the nation in the number of
its wells and palms: a well for every tribe, and the shade of a
palm-tree for the tent of each of the elders. But although the number of
the wells corresponded to the twelve tribes of Israel, the number of the
elders was much larger than that of the palms ([Exo
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#009).md). One fact alone is beyond all
doubt, namely, that at Elim, this lovely oasis in the barren desert,
Israel was to learn how the Lord could make His people lie down in the
green pastures, and lead them beside still waters, even in the barren
desert of this life ([Psa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002).md).
