[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 8:1</span></span>

If Solomon now complies with her request, yields to her invitation, then
she will again see her parental home, where, in the days of her first
love, she laid up for him that which was most precious, that she might
thereby give him joy. Since she thus places herself with her whole soul
back again in her home and amid its associations, the wish expressed in
these words that follow rises up within her in the childlike purity of
her love:

1 O that thou wert like a brother to me,

Who sucked my mother's breasts!

If I found thee without, I would kiss thee;

They also could not despise me.

2 I would lead thee, bring thee into my mother's house;

Thou wouldest instruct me -

I would give thee to drink spiced wine,

The must of my pomegranates.

Solomon is not her brother, who, with her, hung upon the same mother's
breast; but she wishes, carried away in her dream into the reality of
that she wished for, that she had him as her brother, or rather, since
she says, not אח, but כּאח (with כּ, which here has not, as at [Psa
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014.md), the meaning of tanquam, but of
instar, as at [Job 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#014).md), that she
had in him what a brother is to a sister. In that case, if she found him
without, she would kiss him (hypoth. fut. in the protasis, and fut.
without Vav in the apodosis, as at [Job
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md); [Hos
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012.md); [Psa
139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018).md) - she could do this without
putting any restraint on herself for the sake of propriety (cf. the kiss
of the wanton harlot, [Pro 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#013).md), and
also (גּם) without needing to fear that they who saw it would treat it
scornfully (ל בּוּז, as in the reminiscence, [Pro
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030).md). The close union which lies in
the sisterly relationship thus appeared to her to be higher than the
near connection established by the marriage relationship, and her
childlike feeling deceived her not: the sisterly relationship is
certainly purer, firmer, more enduring than that of marriage, so far as
this does not deepen itself into an equality with the sisterly, and
attain to friendship, yea, brotherhood ([Pro
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017).md), within. That Shulamith thus
feels herself happy in the thought that Solomon was to her as a brother,
shows, in a characteristic manner, that "the lust of the flesh, the lust
of the eye, and the pride of life," were foreign to her. If he were her
brother, she would take him by the hand,

(Note: Ben-Asher punctuates אנהגך. Thus also P. rightly. Ben-Naphtali,
on the contrary, punctuates אנהגך. Cf. Genesis (1869), p. 85, note 3.)

and bring him into her mother's house, and he would then, under the eye
of their common mother, become her teacher, and she would become his
scholar. The lxx adds, after the words "into my mother's house," the
phrase, καὶ εἰς ταμεῖον τῆς συλλαβούσης με, cf. [Sol
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004.md). In the same manner also the Syr.,
which has not read the words διδάξεις με following, which are found in
some Codd. of the lxx. Regarding the word telammedēne (thou wouldest
instruct me) as incongruous, Hitzig asks: What should he then teach her?
He refers it to her mother: "who would teach me," namely, from her own
earlier experience, how I might do everything rightly for him. "Were the
meaning," he adds, "he should do it, then also it is she who ought to be
represented as led home by him into his house, the bride by the
bridegroom." But, correctly, Jerome, the Venet., and Luther: "Thou
wouldest (shouldest) instruct me;" also the Targ.: "I would conduct
thee, O King Messiah, and bring Thee into the house of my sanctuary; and
Thou wouldest teach me (וּתאלּף יתי) to fear God and to walk in His
ways." Not her mother, but Solomon, is in possession of the wisdom which
she covets; and if he were her brother, as she wishes, then she would
constrain him to devote himself to her as her teacher. The view,
favoured by Leo Hebraeus (Dialog. de amore, c. III), John Pordage
(Metaphysik, III 617 ff.), and Rosenmller, and which commends itself,
after the analogy of the Gtagovinda, Boethius, and Dante, and appears
also to show itself in the Syr. title of the book, "Wisdom of the Wise,"
that Shulamith is wisdom personified (cf. also [Sol
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002.md) with [Pro
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md), and [Pro
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#003.md); [Pro
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006.md) with [Pro
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#008).md), shatters itself against this
תלמדני; the fact is rather the reverse: Solomon is wisdom in person, and
Shulamith is the wisdom-loving soul,

(Note: Cf. my Das Hohelied unter. u. ausg. (1851), pp. 65-73.)

\- for Shulamith wishes to participate in Solomon's wisdom. What a deep
view the "Thou wouldest teach me" affords into Shulamith's heart! She
knew how much she yet came short of being to him all that a wife should
be. But in Jerusalem the bustle of court life and the burden of his
regal duties did not permit him to devote himself to her; but in her
mother's house, if he were once there, he would instruct her, and she
would requite him with her spiced wine and with the juice of the
pomegranates.

הרקח יין, vinum conditura, is appos. = genitiv. יין הרקח, vinum
conditurae (ἀρωματίτης in Dioscorides and Pliny), like יין תּר, [Psa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md), לחץ מים [Kg1
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027.md), etc., vid., Philippi's Stat.
Const. p. 86. אשׁקך carries forward אשּׁקך in a beautiful play upon
words. עסיס designates the juice as pressed out: the Chald. עסּי
corresponds to the Heb. דּרך, used of treading the grapes. It is
unnecessary to render רמּני as apoc. plur., like מנּי, [Psa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009) (Ewald, 177a.md); rimmoni is the
name she gives to the pomegranate trees belonging to her, - for it is
true that this word, rimmon, can be used in a collective sense ([Deu
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008).md); but the connection with the
possessive suff. excludes this; or by 'asis rimmoni she means the
pomegranate must (cf. ῥοΐ́της = vinum e punicis, in Dioscorides and
Pliny) belonging to her. Pomegranates are not to be thought of as an
erotic symbol;

(Note: Vid., Porphyrius, de Abstin. iv. 16, and Inman in his smutty
book, Ancient Faiths, vol. I 1868, according to which the pomegranate is
an emblem of "a full womb.")

they are named as something beautiful and precious. "O Ali," says a
proverb of Sunna, "eat eagerly only pomegranates (Pers. anâr), for their
grains are from Paradise."

(Note: Vid., Fleischer's Catal. Codd. Lips. p. 428.)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 8:3</span></span>

Resigning herself now dreamily to the idea that Solomon is her brother,
whom she may freely and openly kiss, and her teacher besides, with whom
she may sit in confidential intercourse under her mother's eye, she
feels herself as if closely embraced by him, and calls from a distance
to the daughters of Jerusalem not to disturb this her happy enjoyment:

3 His left hand is under my head,

And his right doth embrace me:

4 I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem,

That ye awake not and disturb not love

Till she please!

Instead of תּהת ל, "underneath," there is here, as usual, תּהת (cf. [Sol
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005).md). Instead of אם ... ואם in the
adjuration, there is here the equivalent מה ... ומה; the interrogative
מה, which in the Arab. ma becomes negat., appears here, as at [Job
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#001.md), on the way toward this change of
meaning. The per capreas vel per cervas agri is wanting, perhaps because
the natural side of love is here broken, and the ἔρως strives up into
ἀγάπη. The daughters of Jerusalem must not break in upon this holy
love-festival, but leave it to its own course.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 8:5</span></span>

5a Who is this coming up out of the wilderness,

Leaning on her beloved?

The third Acts; [Sol 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006.md), began with a
similar question to that with which the sixth here commences. The former
closed the description of the growth of the love-relation, the latter
closes that of the consummated love-relation. Instead of "out of the
wilderness," the lxx has "clothed in white" (λελευκανθισμένη); the
translator has gathered mit

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

chauweret from the illegible consonants of his MS before him. On the
contrary, he translates מתחוּרת correctly by ἐπιστηριζομένη (Symm.
ἐπερειδομένη, Venet. κεκμηκυῖα ἐπί, wearily supporting herself on ...),
while Jerome renders it unsuitably by deliciis affluens, interchanging
the word with מתפּנּקת. But התרפּק, common to the Heb. with the Arab.
and Aethiop., signifies to support oneself, from רפק, sublevare (French,
soulager), Arab. rafaḳa, rafuḳa, to be helpful, serviceable, compliant,
irtafaḳa, to support oneself on the elbow, or (with the elbow) on a
pillow (cf. rafîk, fellow-traveller, rufḳa, a company of
fellow-travellers, from the primary idea of mutually supporting or being
helpful to each other); Aethiop. rafaḳa, to encamp for the purpose of
taking food, ἀνακλίνεσθαι (cf. [Joh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023).md). That Shulamith leant on her
beloved, arose not merely from her weariness, with the view of
supplementing her own weakness from his fulness of strength, but also
from the ardour of the love which gives to the happy and proud Solomon,
raised above all fears, the feeling of his having her in absolute
possession. The road brings the loving couple near to the apple tree
over against Shulamith's parental home, which had been the witness of
the beginning of their love.

5b Under the apple tree I waked thy love:

There thy mother travailed with thee;

There travailed she that bare thee.

The words, "under the apple tree I waked thee," עוררתּיך, might be
regarded as those of Shulamith to Solomon: here, under this apple tree,
where Solomon met with her, she won his first love; for the words cannot
mean that she wakened him from sleep under the apple tree, since עורר
has nowhere the meaning of הקיץ and העיר here given to it by Hitzig, but
only that of "to stir, to stir up, to arouse;" and only when sleep or a
sleepy condition is the subject, does it mean "to shake out of sleep, to
rouse up" (vid., under [Sol 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007).md). But
it is impossible that "there" can be used by Shulamith even in the sense
of the shepherd hypothesis; for the pair of lovers do not wander to the
parental home of the lover, but of his beloved. We must then here
altogether change the punctuation of the text, and throughout restore
the fem. suffix forms as those originally used: עוררתּיך, חבּלתך אמּך,

(Note: חבּלתך, penult. accented, and Lamed with Pathach in P. This is
certainly right. Michlol 33a adduces merely ילדתך of the verse as having
Kametz, on account of the pause, and had thus in view חבּ, with the
Pathach under Lamed. But P. has also יל, with Pathach under Daleth, and
so also has H, with the remark בּ פתחין (viz., here and [Jer
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#026).md). The Biblia Rabbinica 1526 and
1615 have also the same pointing, Pathach under Daleth. In the printed
list of words having Pathach in pause, this word is certainly not found.
But it is found in the MS list of the Ochla veochla, at Halle.)

and ילדתך (cf. שׁו, [Isa 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#010).md), in
which we follow the example of the Syr. The allegorizing interpreters
also meet only with trouble in regarding the words as those of Shulamith
to Solomon. If התפיח were an emblem of the Mount of Olives, which, being
wonderfully divided, gives back Israel's dead (Targ.), or an emblem of
Sinai (Rashi), in both cases the words are more appropriately regarded
as spoken to Shulamith than by her. Aben-Ezra correctly reads them as
the words of Shulamith to Solomon, for he thinks on prayers, which are
like golden apples in silver bowls; Hahn, for he understands by the
apple tree, Canaan, where with sorrow his people brought him forth as
their king; Hengstenberg, rising up to a remote-lying comparison, says,
"the mother of the heavenly Solomon is at the same time the mother of
Shulamith." Hoelemann thinks on Sur. 19:32 f., according to which 'Isa,
Miriam's son, was born under a palm tree; but he is not able to answer
the question, What now is the meaning here of the apple tree as
Solomon's birthplace? If it were indeed to be interpreted allegorically,
then by the apple tree we would rather understand the "tree of
knowledge" of Paradise, of which Aquila, followed by Jerome, with his
ἐκεῖ διεφθάρη, appears to think, - a view which recently Godet approves
of;

(Note: Others, e.g., Bruno von Asti († 1123) and the Waldensian
Exposition, edited by Herzog in the Zeit. fr hist. Theol. 1861: malum =
crux dominica. Th. Harms (1870) quotes [Sol
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md), and remarks: The church brings
forth her children under the apple tree, Christ. Into such absurdities,
in violation of the meaning of the words, do the allegorizing
interpreters wander.)

there Shulamith, i.e., poor humanity, awakened the compassionate love of
the heavenly Solomon, who then gave her, as a pledge of this love, the
Protevangelium, and in the neighbourhood of this apple tree, i.e., on
the ground and soil of humanity fallen, but yet destined to be saved,
Shulamith's mother, i.e., the pre-Christian O.T. church, brought forth
the Saviour from itself, who in love raised Shulamith from the depths to
regal honour. But the Song of Songs does not anywhere set before us the
task of extracting from it by an allegorizing process such far-fetched
thoughts. If the masc. suff. is changed into the fem., we have a
conversation perfectly corresponding to the situation. Solomon reminds
Shulamith by that memorable apple tree of the time when he kindled
within her the fire of first love; עורר elsewhere signifies energy ([Psa
80:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#003).md), or passion ([Pro
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012).md), put into a state of violent
commotion; connected with the accus. of the person, it signifies, [Zac
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013.md), excited in a warlike manner;
here, placed in a state of pleasant excitement of love that has not yet
attained its object. Of how many references to contrasted affections the
reflex. התע is capable, is seen from [Job
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#008.md); [Job
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#029.md); why not thus also עורר?

With שׁמּה Solomon's words are continued, but not in such a way as that
what follows also took place under the apple tree. For Shulamith is not
the child of Beduins, who in that case might even have been born under
an apple tree. Among the Beduins, a maiden accidentally born at the
watering-place (menhîl), on the way (rahîl), in the dew (ṭall) or snow
(thelg), is called from that circumstance Munêhil, Ruhêla, Talla, or
Thelga.

(Note: Vid., Wetstein's Inschriften (1864), p. 336.)

The birthplace of her love is not also the birthplace of her life. As
התפוח points to the apple tree to which their way led them, so שׁמה
points to the end of their way, the parental home lying near by
(Hitzig).

The lxx translates well: ἐκεῖ ὠδίνησέ σε ἡ μήτηρ σου, for while the
Arab. ḥaḅida means concipere, and its Pi., ḥabbada, is the usual word
for gravidam facere, חבּל in the passage before us certainly appears to
be

(Note: The Arab. ḥabilat, she has conceived, and is in consequence
pregnant, accords in the latter sense with ḥamilat, she bears, i.e., is
pregnant, without, however, being, as Hitzig thinks, of a cognate root
with it. For ḥamal signifies to carry; הבל, on the contrary, to
comprehend and to receive (whence also the cord, figuratively, the tie
of love, liaison, as enclosing, embracing, is called ḥabl, הבל), and
like the Lat. concipere and suscipere, is used not only in a sexual, but
also in an ethical sense, to conceive anger, to take up and cherish
sorrow. The Assyr. , corresponding to the Heb. בן, is explained from
this Arab. ḥabl, concipere. On the supposition that the Heb. had a word,
חבל, of the same meaning as the Arab. ḥabl, then חבּל might mean
concipiendo generare; but the Heb. sentence lying before us leads to the
interpretation eniti.)

a denom. Pi. in the sense of "to bring forth with sorrow" (חבלי היּלדה).
The lxx further translates: ἐκεῖ ὠδίνησέ σε ἡ τεκοῦσά σε, in which the
σε is inserted, and is thus, as also by the Syr., Jerome, and Venet.,
translated, with the obliteration of the finite ילדתך, as if the reading
were ילדתּך. But not merely is the name of the mother intentionally
changed, it is also carried forward from the labour, eniti, to the
completed act of birth.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 8:6</span></span>

After Solomon has thus called to remembrance the commencement of their
love-relation, which receives again a special consecration by the
reference to Shulamith's parental home, and to her mother, Shulamith
answers with a request to preserve for her this love.

6 Place me as a signet-ring on thy heart,

As a signet-ring on thine arm!

For strong as death is love;

Inexorable as hell is jealousy:

Its flames are flames of fire,

A flame of Jah.

7 Mighty waters are unable to quench such love,

And rivers cannot overflow it.

If a man would give

All the wealth of his house for love, -

He would only be contemned.

The signet-ring, which is called חותם (חתם, to impress), was carried
either by a string on the breast, [Gen
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#018.md), or also, as that which is
called טבּעת denotes (from טבע, to sink into), on the hand, [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024.md), cf. [Gen
41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042.md); [Est
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012.md), but not on the arm, like a
bracelet, [Sa2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#010.md); and since it is
certainly permissible to say "hand" for "finger," but not "arm" for
"hand," so we may not refer "on thine arm" to the figure if the
signet-ring, as if Shulamith had said, as the poet might also introduce
her as saying: Make me like a signet-ring (כּחותם) on thy breast; make
me like a signet-ring "on thy hand," or "on thy right hand." The words,
"set me on thy heart," and "(set me) on thine arm," must thus also,
without regard to "as a signet-ring," express independent thoughts,
although שׂימני is chosen (vid., [Hag
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023).md) instead of קחני, in view of the
comparison.

(Note: Of the copy of the Tra, which was to be the king's vade-mecum, it
is said, Sanhedrin 21b: עושה אותה כמין קמיע ותולה בזרוע, but also there
the amulet is thought of not as fastened to the finger, but as wound
round the arm.)

Thus, with right, Hitzig finds the thought therein expressed: "Press me
close to thy breast, enclose me in thine arms." But it is the first
request, and not the second, which is in the form עכל־זרועך, and not
על־זרועתיך (שׁימני), which refers to embracing, since the subject is not
the relation of person and thing, but of person and person. The
signet-ring comes into view as a jewel, which one does not separate from
himself; and the first request is to this effect, that he would bear her
thus inalienably (the art. is that of the specific idea) on his heart
([Exo 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#029).md); the meaning of the
second, that he would take her thus inseparably as a signet-ring on his
arm (cf. [Hos 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md) : "I have taught
Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms"), so that she might lie
always on his heart, and have him always at her side (cf. [Psa
110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005).md): she wishes to be united and
bound to him indissolubly in the affection of love and in the community
of life's experience.

The reason for the double request following כּי, abstracted from the
individual case, rises to the universality of the fact realized by
experience, which specializes itself herein, and celebrates the praise
of love; for, assigning a reason for her "set me," she does not say, "my
love," nor "thy love," but אהבה, "love" (as also in the address at [Sol
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#007).md). She means love undivided,
unfeigned, entire, and not transient, but enduring; thus true and
genuine love, such as is real, what the word denotes, which exhausts the
conception corresponding to the idea of love.

קנאה, which is here parallel to "love," is the jealousy of love
asserting its possession and right of property; the reaction of love
against any diminution of its possession, against any reserve in its
response, the "self-vindication of angry love."

(Note: Vid., my Prolegomena to Weber's Vom Zorne Gottes (1862), p. 35
ss.)

Love is a passion, i.e., a human affection, powerful and lasting, as it
comes to light in "jealousy." Zelus, as defined by Dav. Chytrus, est
affectus mixtus ex amore et ira, cum videlicet amans aliquid irascitur
illi, a quo laeditur res amata, wherefore here the adjectives עזּה
(strong) and קשׁה (hard, inexorable, firm, severe) are respectively
assigned to "love" and "jealousy," as at [Gen
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007.md) to "anger" and "wrath." It is
much more remarkable that the energy of love, which, so to say, is the
life of life, is compared to the energy of death and Hades; with at
least equal right ממּות and משּׁאול (might be used, for love scorns
both, outlasts both, triumphs over both ([Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md).; [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054)..md). But the text does not speak
of surpassing, but of equality; not of love and jealousy that they
surpass death and Hades, but that they are equal to it. The point of
comparison in both cases is to be obtained from the predicates. עז,
powerful, designates the person who, being assailed, cannot be overcome
([Num 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028).md), and, assailing, cannot
be withstood ([Jdg 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018).md). Death is
obviously thought of as the assailer ([Jer
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#020).md), against which nothing can hold
its ground, from which nothing can escape, to whose sceptre all must
finally yield (vid., Ps 49). Love is like it in this, that it also
seizes upon men with irresistible force (Bttcher: "He whom Death assails
must die, whom Love assails must love"); and when she has once assailed
him, she rests not till she has him wholly under her power; she kills
him, as it were, in regard to everything else that is not the object of
his love. קשׁה, hard (opposed to רך, [Sa2
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#039).md), σκληρός, designates one on whom
no impression is made, who will not yield ([Psa
48:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#004.md); [Psa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004).md), or one whom stern fate has made
inwardly stubborn and obtuse ([Sa1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015).md). Here the point of comparison is
inflexibility; for Sheol, thought of with שׁאל, to ask (vid., under [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014).md), is the God-ordained messenger
of wrath, who inexorably gathers in all that are on the earth, and holds
them fast when once they are swallowed up by him. So the jealousy of
love wholly takes possession of the beloved object not only in arrest,
but also in safe keeping; she holds her possession firmly, that it
cannot be taken from her (Wisd. 2:1), and burns relentlessly and
inexorably against any one who does injury to her possession ([Pro
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#034) f..md). But when Shulamith wishes,
in the words, "set me," etc., to be bound to the heart and to the arm of
Solomon, has she in the clause assigning a reason the love in view with
which she loves, or that with which she is loved? Certainly not the one
to the exclusion of the other; but as certainly, first of all, the love
with which she wishes to fill, and believes that she does fill, her
beloved. If this is so, then with "for strong as death is love," she
gives herself up to this love on the condition that it confesses itself
willing to live only for her, and to be as if dead for all others; and
with "inexorable as hell is jealousy," in such a manner that she takes
shelter in the jealousy of this love against the occurrence of any fit
of infidelity, since she consents therein to be wholly and completely
absorbed by it.

To קנאה, which proceeds from the primary idea of a red glow, there is
connected the further description of this love to the sheltering and
protecting power of which she gives herself up: "its flames, רשׁפיה, are
flames of fire;" its sparkling is the sparkling of fire. The verb רשף
signifies, in Syr. and Arab., to creep along, to make short steps; in
Heb. and Chald., to sparkle, to flame, which in Samar. is referred to
impetuosity. Symmachus translates, after the Samar. (which Hitzig
approves of): ἁι ὁρμαὶ αὐτοῦ ὁρμαὶ πύρινοι; the Venet., after Kimchi,
ἄνθρακες, for he exchanges רשׁף with the probably non.-cogn. רצפה;
others render it all with words which denote the bright glancings of
fire. רשׁפּי (so here, according to the Masora; on the contrary, at [Psa
76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004), רשׁפּי.md) are effulgurations; the
pred. says that these are not only of a bright shining, but of a fiery
nature, which, as they proceed from fire, so also produce fire, for they
set on fire and kindle.

(Note: The Phoen. Inscriptions, Citens. xxxvii., xxxviii., show a name
for God, רשפי חץ, or merely רשף, which appears to correspond to Ζεὺς
Κεραύνιος on the Inscriptions of Larnax (vid., Vogu's Mlanges
Archologiques, p. 19). רשפי are thus not the arrows themselves (Grtz),
but these are, as it were, lightnings from His bow ([Psa
76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004))..md)

Love, in its flashings up, is like fiery flashes of lightning; in short,
it is שׁלהבתיה,

(Note: Thus in the Biblia Rabbinica and P. H. with the note מלהחדא ולא
מפיק. Thus by Ben-Asher, who follows the Masora. Cf. Liber Psalmorum
Hebr. atque Lat. p. 155, under [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md); and Kimchi, Wrterb., under אפל
and שלהב. Ben-Naphtali, on the other hand, reads as two words, שׁלהבת
יהּ. \[Except in this word, the recensions of Ben-Asher and Ben-Naphtali
differ only "de punctis vocalibus et accentibus." Strack's Prolegomena,
p. 28.\])

which is thus to be written as one word with ה raphatum, according to
the Masora; but in this form of the word יה is also the name of God, and
more than a meaningless superlative strengthening of the idea. As להבה
is formed from the Kal להב to flame (R. לב, to lick, like להט, R. לט, to
twist), so is שׁלהבת, from the Shafel שׁלהב, to cause to flame; this
active stem is frequently found, especially in the Aram., and has in the
Assyr. almost wholly supplanted the Afel (vid., Schrader in Deut. Morg.
Zeit. xxvi. 275). שׁלהבת is thus related primarily to להבה, as
inflammatio to (Ger.) Flamme; יה thus presents itself the more naturally
to be interpreted as gen. subjecti. Love of a right kind is a flame not
kindled and inflamed by man ([Job
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026).md), but by God - the
divinely-influenced free inclination of two souls to each other, and at
the same time, as is now further said, [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md), [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md), a situation supporting all
adversities and assaults, and a pure personal relation conditioned by
nothing material. It is a fire-flame which mighty waters (רבּים, great
and many, as at [Hab 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#015.md); cf. עזּים,
wild, [Isa 43:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#016).md) cannot extinguish,
and streams cannot overflow it (cf. [Psa
69:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003.md); [Psa
124:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004).md) or sweep it away (cf. [Job
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019.md); [Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017).md). Hitzig adopts the latter
signification, but the figure of the fire makes the former more natural;
no heaping up of adverse circumstances can extinguish true love, as many
waters extinguish elemental fire; no earthly power can suppress it by
the strength of its assault, as streams drench all they sweep over in
their flow - the flame of Jah is inextinguishable.

Nor can this love be bought; any attempt to buy it would be scorned and
counted madness. The expressions is like [Pro
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030.md) f., cf. [Num
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#018.md); [Co1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#003.md). Regarding הון (from הוּן,
(Arab.) han, levem esse), convenience, and that by which life is made
comfortable, vid., at [Pro 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#013.md).
According to the shepherd-hypothesis, here occurs the expression of the
peculiar point of the story of the intercourse between Solomon and
Shulamith; she scorns the offers of Solomon; her love is not to be
bought, and it already belongs to another. But of offers we read nothing
beyond Song [Sol 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#011.md), where, as in
the following [Sol 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012.md), it is
manifest that Shulamith is in reality excited in love. Hitzig also
remarks under [Sol 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012.md) : "When the
speaker says the fragrance of her nard is connected with the presence of
the king, she means that only then does she smell the fragrance of nard,
i.e., only his presence awakens in her heart pleasant sensations or
sweet feelings." Shulamith manifestly thus speaks, also emphasizing [Sol
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012.md), the spontaneousness of her
relation to Solomon; but Hitzig adds: "These words, [Sol
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012.md), are certainly spoken by a court
lady." But the Song knows only a chorus of the "Daughters of Jerusalem"
- that court lady is only a phantom, by means of which Hitzig's
ingenuity seeks to prop up the shepherd-hypothesis, the weakness of
which his penetration has discerned. As we understand the Song, [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md) refers to the love with which
Shulamith loves, as decidedly as [Sol
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md) to the love with which she is
loved. Nothing in all the world is able to separate her from loving the
king; it is love to his person, not love called forth by a desire for
riches which he disposes of, not even by the splendour of the position
which awaited her, but free, responsive love with which she answered
free love making its approach to her. The poet here represents Shulamith
herself as expressing the idea of love embodied in her. That apple tree,
where he awaked first love in her, is a witness of the renewal of their
mutual covenant of love; and it is significant that only here, just
directly here, where the idea of the whole is expressed more fully, and
in a richer manner than at [Sol 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#007.md),
is God denoted by His name, and that by His name as revealed in the
history of redemption. Hitzig, Ewald, Olshausen, Bttcher, expand this
concluding word, for the sake of rhythmic symmetry, to שׁלהבתיה שׁלהבת
יהּ its flames are flames of Jah; but a similar conclusion is found at
[Psa 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md); [Psa
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007.md), and elsewhere.

"I would almost close the book," says Herder in his Lied der Lieder
(Song of Songs), 1778, "with this divine seal. It is even as good as
closed, for what follows appears only as an appended echo." Daniel
Sanders (1845) closes it with [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md), places [Sol
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012.md) after [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md), and cuts off [Sol
1:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md), [Sol
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md), [Sol
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md), as not original. Anthologists,
like Dpke and Magnus, who treat the Song as the Fragmentists do the
Pentateuch, find here their confused medley sanctioned. Umbreit also,
1820, although as for the rest recognising the Song as a compact whole,
explains [Sol 8:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) as a fragment,
not belonging to the work itself. Hoelemann, however, in his Krone des
Hohenliedes Crown of the Song, 1856 (thus he names the "concluding Act,"
[Sol 8:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005).md), believes that there is
here represented, not only in [Sol
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md), [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md), but further also in [Sol
8:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md), the essence of true love -
what it is, and how it is won; and then in [Sol
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#013.md) f. he hears the Song come to an
end in pure idyllic tones.

We see in [Sol 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) ff. the
continuation of the love story practically idealized and set forth in
dramatic figures. There is no inner necessity for this continuance. It
shapes itself after that which has happened; and although in all history
divine reason and moral ideas realize themselves, yet the material by
means of which this is done consists of accidental circumstances and
free actions passing thereby into reciprocal action. But [Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) ff. is the actual continuance of
the story on to the completed conclusion, not a mere appendix, which
might be wanting without anything being thereby missed. For after the
poet has set before us the loving pair as they wander arm in arm through
the green pasture-land between Jezreel and Sunem till they reach the
environs of the parental home, which reminds them of the commencement of
their love relations, he cannot represent them as there turning back,
but must present to us still a glimpse of what transpired on the
occasion of their visit there. After that first Act of the concluding
scene, there is yet wanting a second, to which the first points.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 8:8</span></span>

The locality of this scene is Shulamith's parental home. It is she
herself who speaks in these words:

8 We have a sister, a little one,

And she has no breasts:

What shall we do with our sister

In the day when she will be sued for?

Between [Sol 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) and [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md) is a blank. The figure of the
wanderers is followed by the figure of the visitors. But who speaks
here? The interchange of the scene permits that Shulamith conclude the
one scene and begin the other, as in the first Act; or also that at the
same time with the change of scene there is an interchange of persons,
as e.g., in the third Act. But if Shulamith speaks, all her words are
not by any means included in what is said from [Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) to [Sol
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#010.md). Since, without doubt, she also
speaks in [Sol 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011.md) f., this whole
second figure consists of Shulamith's words, as does also the second of
the second Acts; [Sol 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001.md). But there
Shulamith's address presents itself as the narrative of an experience,
and the narrative dramatically framed in itself is thoroughly penetrated
by the I of the speaker; but here, as e.g., Ewald, Heiligst., and Bttch.
explain, she would begin with a dialogue with her brothers referable to
herself, one that had formerly taken place-that little sister, Ewald
remarks under [Sol 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#010.md), stands here
now grown up she took notice of that severe word formerly spoken by her
brothers, and can now joyfully before all exclaim, taking up the same
flowery language, that she is a wall, etc. But that a monologue should
begin with a dialogue without any introduction, is an impossibility; in
this case the poet ought to have left the expression, "of old my
mother's sons said," to be supplemented by the reader or hearer. It is
true, at [Sol 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#002.md); [Sol
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#003.md), we have a former address
introduced without any formal indication of the fact; but it is the
address of the narrator herself. With [Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) there will thus begin a colloquy
arising out of present circumstances. That in this conversation [Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) appertains to the brothers, is
evident. This harsh entweder oder (aut ... aut) is not appropriate as
coming from Shulamith's mouth; it is her brothers alone, as Hoelemann
rightly remarks, who utter these words, as might have been expected from
them in view of [Sol 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md). But does
[Sol 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) belong also to them? There
may be two of them, says Hitzig, and the one may in [Sol
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#009.md) reply to the question of the other
in [Sol 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md); Shulamith, who has heard
their conversation, suddenly interposes with [Sol
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#010.md). But the transition from the
first to the second scene is more easily explained if Shulamith proposes
the question of [Sol 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) for
consideration. This is not set aside by Hitzig's questions: "Has she to
determine in regard to her sister? and has she now for the first time
come to do nothing in haste?" For (1) the dramatic figures of the Song
follow each other chronologically, but not without blanks; and the poet
does not at all require us to regard [Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) as Shulamith's first words after
her entrance into her parental home; (2) but it is altogether seeming
for Shulamith, who has now become independent, and who has been raised
so high, to throw out this question of loving care for her sister.
Besides, from the fact that with [Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md) there commences the representation
of a present occurrence, it is proved that the sister here spoken of is
not Shulamith herself. If it were Shulamith herself, the words of [Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md), [Sol
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#009.md) would look back to what had
previously taken place, which, as we have shown, is impossible. Or does
[Sol 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md) require that we should think
of Shulamith as having no sister? Certainly not, for so understood,
these words would be purposeless. The "only one," then, does not mean
the only one numerically, but, as at [Pro
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003), it is emphatic (Hitzig.md); she is
called by Solomon the "only one" of her mother in this sense, that she
had not one her equal.

Thus it is Shulamith who here speaks, and she is not the "sister"
referred to. The words, "we have a sister ... ," spoken in the family
circle, whether regarded as uttered by Shulamith or not, have something
strange in them, for one member of a family does not need thus to speak
to another. We expect: With regard to our sister, who is as yet little
and not of full age, the question arises, What will be done when she has
grown to maturity to guard her innocence? Thus the expression would have
stood, but the poet separates it into little symmetrical sentences; for
poetry present facts in a different style from prose. Hoelem. has on
this remarked that the words are not to be translated: we have a little
sister, which the order of the words וגו אחות ק would presuppose, [Gen
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#020.md); cf. [Sa2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004.md); [Sa2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#002.md) f.; [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md); [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md). "Little" is not immediately
connected with "sister," but follows it as an apposition; and this
appositional description lays the ground for the question: We may be now
without concern; but when she is grown up and will be courted, what
then? "Little" refers to age, as at [Kg2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#002.md); cf. [Gen
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#020.md). The description of the child in
the words, "she has no breasts," has neither in itself nor particularly
for Oriental feeling anything indecent in it (cf. mammae sororiarunt,
[Eze 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007).md). The ל following מה־נּעשׂה
is here not thus purely the dat. commodi, as e.g., [Isa
64:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003) (to act for some one.md), but
indiff. dat. (what shall we do for her?); but מה is, according to the
connection, as at [Gen 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#037.md); [Sa1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002.md); [Isa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md), equivalent to: What conducing to
her advantage? Instead of בּיּום, the form בּיום lay syntactically
nearer (cf. [Exo 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#028).md); the art. in
בּיּום is, as at [Ecc 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#003.md), understood
demonst.: that day when she will be spoken for, i.e., will attract the
attention of a suitor. בּ after דּבּר may have manifold significations
(vid., under [Psa 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003).md); thus the
general signification of "concerning," [Sa1
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#003.md), is modified in the sense of
courting a wife, [Sa1 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#039.md). The
brothers now take speech in hand, and answer Shulamith's question as to
what will have to be done for the future safety of their little sister
when the time comes that she shall be sought for:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 8:9</span></span>

9 If she be a wall,

We will build upon her a pinnacle of silver;

And if she be a door,

We will block her up with a board of cedar-wood.

The brothers are the nearest guardians and counsellors of the sister,
and, particularly in the matter of marriage, have the precedence even of
the father and mother, [Gen 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#050.md),
[Gen 24:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#055.md); [Gen
34:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#006.md).. They suppose two cases which
stand in contrast to each other, and announce their purpose with
reference to each case. Hoelem. here affects a synonymous instead of the
antithetic parallelism; for he maintains that אם (ואם) ... אם nowhere
denotes a contrast, but, like sive ... sive, essential indifference. But
examples such as [Deu 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003.md) (sive
bovem, sive ovem) are not applicable here; for this correl. אם ... אם,
denoting essential equality, never begins the antecedents of two
principal sentences, but always stands in the component parts of one
principal sentence. Wherever ואם ... אם commences two parallel
conditional clauses, the parallelism is always, according to the
contents of these clauses, either synonymous, [Gen
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050.md); [Amo
9:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md); [Ecc
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md) (where the first ואם signifies ac
si, and the second sive), or antithetic, [Num
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#029.md) f.; [Job
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#011.md) f.; [Isa
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019.md) f. The contrast between חומה
(from חמה, Arab. ḥaman, Modern Syr. chamo, to preserve, protect) and
דּלת (from דּלל, to hang loose, of doors, [Pro
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#014.md), which move hither and thither
on their hinges) is obvious. A wall stands firm and withstands every
assault if it serves its purpose (which is here presupposed, where it is
used as a figure of firmness of character). A door, on the contrary, is
moveable; and though it be for the present closed (דלת is intentionally
used, and not פּתח, vid., [Gen 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#006).md),
yet it is so formed that it can be opened again. A maiden inaccessible
to seduction is like a wall, and one accessible to it is like a door. In
the apodosis, [Sol 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#009.md), the lxx
correctly renders טירת by ἐπάλξεις; Jerome, by propugnacula. But it is
not necessary to read טירת. The verb טור, cogn. דור, signifies to
surround, whence tirah (= Arab. duâr), a round encampment, [Gen
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016.md), and, generally, a habitation,
[Psa 69:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025.md); and then also, to range
together, whence תּוּר, a rank, row (cf. Arab. thur and daur, which, in
the manifoldness of their meanings, are parallel with the French tour),
or also tirah, which, [Eze 46:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#023.md)
(vid., Keil), denotes the row or layer of masonry, - in the passage
before us, a row of battlements (Ew.), or a crown of the wall (Hitz.),
i.e., battlements as a wreath on the summit of a wall. Is she a wall, -
i.e., does she firmly and successfully withstand all immoral approaches?
- then they will adorn this wall with silver pinnacles (cf. [Isa
54:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#012).md), i.e., will bestow upon her the
high honour which is due to her maidenly purity and firmness; silver is
the symbol of holiness, as gold is the symbol of nobility. In the
apodosis 9b, על צוּר is not otherwise meant than when used in a military
sense of enclosing by means of besieging, but, like [Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md), with the obj.-accus., of that
which is pressed against that which is to be excluded; צור here means,
forcibly to press against, as סגר, [Gen
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021.md), to unite by closing up.

ארז לוּח is a board or plank (cf. [Eze
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#005.md), of the double planks of a ship's
side) of cedar wood (cf. [Zep 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014.md),
ארזה, cedar wainscot). Cedar wood comes here into view not on account of
the beautiful polish which it takes on, but merely because of its
hardness and durability. Is she a door, i.e., accessible to seduction?
They will enclose this door around with a cedar plank, i.e., watch her
in such a manner that no seducer or lover will be able to approach her.
By this morally stern but faithful answer, Shulamith is carried back to
the period of her own maidenhood, when her brothers, with good
intention, dealt severely with her. Looking back to this time, she could
joyfully confess:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 8:10</span></span>

10 I was a wall,

And my breasts like towers;

Then I became in his eyes

Like one who findeth peace.

In the language of prose, the statement would be: Your conduct is good
and wise, as my own example shows; of me also ye thus faithfully took
care; and that I met this your solicitude with strenuous
self-preservation, has become, to my joy and yours, the happiness of my
life. That in this connection not אני חומה, but חומה אני has to be used,
is clear: she compares herself with her sister, and the praise she takes
to herself she takes to the honour of her brothers. The comparison of
her breasts to towers is suggested by the comparison of her person to a
wall; Kleuker rightly remarks that here the comparison is not of thing
with thing, but of relation with relation: the breasts were those of her
person, as the towers were of the wall, which, by virtue of the power of
defence which they conceal within themselves, never permit the enemy,
whose attention they attract, to approach them. The two substantival
clauses, murus et ubera mea instar turrium, have not naturally a
retrospective signification, as they would in a historical connection
(vid., under [Gen 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010).md); but they
become retrospective by the following "then I became," like [Deu
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005.md), by the historical tense
following, where, however, it is to be remarked that the expression,
having in itself no relation to time, which is incapable of being
expressed in German, mentions the past not in a way that excludes the
present, but as including it. She was a wall, and her breasts like the
towers, i.e., all seductions rebounded from her, and ventured not near
her awe-inspiring attractions; then (אז, temporal, but at the same time
consequent; thereupon, and for this reason, as at [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md); [Jer
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015), etc..md) she became in his
(Solomon's) eyes as one who findeth peace. According to the
shepherd-hypothesis, she says here: he deemed it good to forbear any
further attempts, and to let me remain in peace (Ewald, Hitz., and
others). But how is that possible? מצא שׁלום בעיני is a variation of the
frequently occurring מצא חן בעיני, which is used especially of a woman
gaining the affections of a man, [Est
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#017.md); [Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md); [Jer
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#002.md) f.; and the expression here used,
"thus I was in his eyes as one who findeth peace" is only the more
circumstantial expression for, "then I found (אז מצאתי) in his eyes
peace," which doubtless means more than: I brought it to this, that he
left me further unmolested; שׁלום in this case, as syn. of חן, means
inward agreement, confidence, friendship, as at [Psa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010.md); there it means, as in the
salutation of peace and in a hundred other cases, a positive good. And
why should she use שׁלום instead of חן, but that she might form a play
upon the name which she immediately, [Sol
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011.md), thereafter utters, שׁלמה, which
signifies, [Ch1 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009.md), "The man of
peace." That Shulamith had found shalom (peace) with Shelomoh (Solomon),
cannot be intended to mean that uninjured she escaped from him, but that
she had entered into a relation to him which seemed to her a state of
blessed peace. The delicate description, "in his eyes," is designed to
indicate that she appeared to him in the time of her youthful discipline
as one finding peace. The כ is כ veritatis, i.e., the comparison of the
fact with its idea, [Isa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002.md), or of
the individual with the general and common, [Isa
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006.md); [Eze
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#010.md); [Zac
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md). Here the meaning is, that
Shulamith appeared to him corresponding to the idea of one finding
peace, and thus as worthy to find peace with him. One "finding peace" is
one who gains the heart of a man, so that he enters into a relation of
esteem and affection for her. This generalization of the idea also
opposes the notion of a history of seduction. מוחאת is from the
ground-form matsiat, the parallel form to מוצאת, [Sa2
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#022.md). Solomon has won her, not by
persuasion or violence; but because she could be no other man's, he
entered with her into the marriage covenant of peace (cf. [Pro
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md) with [Isa
54:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 8:11</span></span>

It now lies near, at least rather so than remote, that Shulamith,
thinking of her brothers, presents her request before her royal husband:

11 Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon;

He committed the vineyard to the keepers,

That each should bring for its fruit

A thousand in silv.

12 I myself disposed of my own vineyard:

The thousand is thine, Solomon,

And two hundred for the keepers of its fruit!

The words לשׁ היה כּרם are to be translated after כרמוגו, [Kg1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md), and לידידי ... , [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md), "Solomon had a vineyard" (cf.
[Sa1 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002.md); [Sa2
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023.md); [Sa2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#002.md); [Kg2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017.md); [Ch1
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#017.md); [Ch1
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#010).md), not "Solomon has a vineyard,"
which would have required the words לשׁ כרם, with the omission of היה. I
formerly explained, as also Bttcher: a vineyard became his, thus at
present is his possession; and thus explaining, one could suppose that
it fell to him, on his taking possession of his government, as a
component part of his domain; but although in itself לו היה can mean,
"this or that has become one's own" (e.g., [Lev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#003).md), as well as "it became his own,"
yet here the historical sense is necessarily connected by היה with the
נתן foll.: Solomon has had ... , he has given; and since Solomon, after
possession the vineyard, would probably also preserve it, Hitzig draws
from this the conclusion, that the poet thereby betrays the fact that he
lived after the time of Solomon. But these are certainly words which he
puts into Shulamith's mouth, and he cannot at least have forgotten that
the heroine of his drama is a contemporary of Solomon; and supposing
that he had forgotten this for a moment, he must have at least once read
over what he had written, and could not have been so blind as to have
allowed this היה which had escaped him to stand. We must thus assume
that he did not in reality retain the vineyard, which, as Hitzig
supposes, if he possessed it, he also "probably" retained, whether he
gave it away or exchanged it, or sold it, we know not; but the poet
might suppose that Shulamith knew it, since it refers to a piece of land
lying not far from her home. For המון בּעל, lxx Βεελαμών, is certainly
the same as that mentioned in Judith 8:3, according to which Judith's
husband died from sunstroke in Bethulia, and was buried beside his
fathers "between Dothaim and Balamoon"

(Note: This is certainly not the Baal-meon (now Man) lying half an hour
to the south of Heshbon; there is also, however, a Meon (now Man) on
this the west side of Jordan, Nabal's Maon, near to Carmel. Vid., art.
"Maon," by Kleuker in Schenkel's Bibl. Lex.)

(probably, as the sound of the word denotes, Belmen, or, more
accurately, Belman, as it is also called in Judith 4:4, with which
Kleuker in Schenkel's Bibl. Lex., de Bruyn in his Karte, and others,
interchange it; and חמּון, [Jos 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md),
lying in the tribe of Asher). This Balamoon lay not far from Dothan, and
thus not far from Esdrelon; for Dothan lay (cf. Judith 3:10) south of
the plain of Jezreel, where it has been discovered, under the name of
Tell Dotan, in the midst of a smaller plain which lies embosomed in the
hills of the south.

(Note: Vid., Robinson's Physical Geogr. of the Holy Land, p. 113;
Morrison's Recovery of Jerusalem (1871), p. 463, etc.)

The ancients, since Aquila, Symm., Targ., Syr., and Jerome, make the
name of the place Baal-hamon subservient to their allegorizing
interpretation, but only by the aid of soap-bubble-like fancies; e.g.,
Hengst. makes Baal-hamon designate the world; nothrim \[keepers\], the
nations; the 1000 pieces in silver, the duties comprehended in the ten
commandments. Hamon is there understood of a large, noisy crowd. The
place may, indeed, have its name from the multitude of its inhabitants,
or from an annual market held there, or otherwise from revelry and riot;
for, according to Hitzig,

(Note: Cf. also Schwarz' Das heilige Land, p. 37.)

there is no ground for co-ordinating it with names such as Baal-gad and
Baal-zephon, in which Baal is the general, and what follows the special
name of God. Amon, the Sun-God, specially worshipped in Egyptian Thebes,
has the bibl. name אמון, with which, after the sound of the word,
accords the name of a place lying, according to Jer. Dema ii. 1, in the
region of Tyrus, but no אמון. The reference to the Egypt. Amon Ra, which
would direct rather to Baalbec, the Coele-Syrian Heliupolis, is
improbable; because the poet would certainly not have introduced into
his poem the name of the place where the vineyard lay, if this name did
not call forth an idea corresponding to the connection. The Shulamitess,
now become Solomon's, in order to support the request she makes to the
king, relates an incident of no historical value in itself of the
near-lying Sunem (Sulem), situated not far from Baal-hamon to the north,
on the farther side of the plain of Jezreel. She belongs to a family
whose inheritance consisted in vineyards, and she herself had acted in
the capacity of the keeper of a vineyard, [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md), - so much the less therefore is
it to be wondered at that she takes an interest in the vineyard of
Baal-hamon, which Solomon had let out to keepers on the condition that
they should pay to him for its fruit-harvest the sum of 1000 shekels of
silver (shekel is, according to Ges. 120. 4, Anm. 2, to be supplied).

יבא, since we have interpreted היה retrospectively, might also indeed be
rendered imperfect. as equivalent to afferebat, or, according to Ewald,
136c, afferre solebat; but since נתן = ἐξέδοτο, [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md), denotes a gift laying the
recipients under an obligation, יבא is used in the sense of יבא (אשׁר)
למען; however, למען is not to be supplied (Symm. ἐνέγκη), but יבא in
itself signifies afferre debebat (he ought to bring), like יע, [Dan
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#005), they should stand (wait upon.md),
Ewald, 136g. Certainly נארים does not mean tenants, but watchers, - the
post-bibl. language has חכר, to lease, קבּל, to take on lease, chikuwr,
rent, e.g., Meza ix. 2, - but the subject here is a locatio conductio;
for the vine-plants of that region are entrusted to the "keepers" for a
rent, which they have to pay, not in fruits but in money, as the
equivalent of a share of the produce (the ב in בּפר is the ב pretii).
[Isa 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023.md) is usually compared; but
there the money value of a particularly valuable portion of a vineyard,
consisting of 1000 vines, is given at "1000 silverlings" (1 shekel);
while, on the other hand, the 1000 shekels here are the rent for a
portion of a vineyard, the extent of which is not mentioned. But that
passage in Isaiah contains something explanatory of the one before us,
inasmuch as we see from it that a vineyard was divided into portions of
a definite number of vines in each. Such a division into mekomoth is
also here supposed. For if each "keeper" to whom the vineyard was
entrusted had to count 1000 shekels for its produce, then the vineyard
was at the same time committed to several keepers, and thus was divided
into small sections (Hitzig). It is self-evident that the gain of the
produce that remained over after paying the rent fell to the "keepers;"
but since the produce varied, and also the price of wine, this gain was
not the same every year, and only in general are we to suppose from [Sol
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012.md), that it yielded on an average
about 20 per cent. For the vineyard which Shulamith means in [Sol
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012.md) is altogether different from that
of Baal-hamon. It is of herself she says, [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md), that as the keeper of a vineyard,
exposed to the heat of the day, she was not in a position to take care
of her own vineyard. This her own vineyard is not her beloved (Hoelem.),
which not only does not harmonize with [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md) (for she there looks back to the
time prior to her elevation), but her own person, as comprehending
everything pleasant and lovely which constitutes her personality
(4:12-5:1), as is the sum-total of the vines which together form a
vineyard.

Of this figurative vineyard she says: לפני שׁלּי כּרמי. This must mean,
according to Hitzig, Hoelem., and others, that it was under her
protection; but although the idea of affectionate care may, in certain
circumstances, be connected with לפני, [Gen
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#018.md); [Pro
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003.md), yet the phrase: this or that is
לפני, wherever it has not merely a local or temporal, but an ethical
signification, can mean nothing else than: it stands under my direction,
[Gen 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#009.md); [Gen
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#015.md); [Gen
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#006.md); [Ch2
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#006.md); [Gen
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#051.md); [Sa1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#016.md). Rightly Heiligst., after Ewald:
in potestate mea est. Shulamith also has a vineyard, which she is as
free to dispose of as Solomon of his at Baal-hamon. It is the totality
of her personal and mental endowments. This vineyard has been given over
with free and joyful cordiality into Solomon's possession. This vineyard
also has keepers (one here sees with what intention the poet has chosen
in [Sol 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011) just that word נארים.md) -
to whom Shulamith herself and to whom Solomon also owes it that as a
chaste and virtuous maiden she became his possession. These are her
brothers, the true keepers and protectors of her innocence. Must these
be unrewarded? The full thousands, she says, turning to the king, which
like the annual produce of the vineyard of Baal-hamon will thus also be
the fruit of my own personal worth, shall belong to none else, O
Solomon, than to thee, and two hundred to the keepers of its fruit! If
the keepers in Baal-hamon do not unrewarded watch the vineyard, so the
king owes thanks to those who so faithfully guarded his Shulamith. The
poetry would be reduced to prose if there were found in Shulamith's
words a hint that the king should reward her brothers with a
gratification of 200 shekels. She makes the case of the vineyard in
Baal-hamon a parable of her relation to Solomon on the one hand, and of
her relation to her brothers on the other. From מאתים, one may conclude
that there were two brothers, thus that the rendering of thanks is
thought of as מעשׂר (a tenth part); but so that the 200 are meant not as
a tax on the thousand, but as a reward for the faithful rendering up of
the thousand.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 8:13</span></span>

The king who seems to this point to have silently looked on in inmost
sympathy, now, on being addressed by Shulamith, takes speech in hand; he
does not expressly refer to her request, but one perceives from his
words that he heard it with pleasure. He expresses to her the wish that
she would gratify the companions of her youth who were assembled around
her, as well as himself, with a song, such as in former times she was
wont to sing in these mountains and valleys.

13 O thou (who art) at home in the gardens,

Companions are listening for thy voice;

Let me hear!

We observe that in the rural paradise with which she is surrounded, she
finds herself in her element. It is a primary feature of her character
which herein comes to view: her longing after quietness and peace, her
love for collectedness of mind and for contemplation; her delight in
thoughts of the Creator suggested by the vegetable world, and
particularly by the manifold soft beauty of flowers; she is again once
more in the gardens of her home, but the address, "O thou at home in the
gardens!" denotes that wherever she is, these gardens are her home as a
fundamental feature of her nature. The חברים are not Solomon's
companions, for she has come hither with Solomon alone, leaning on his
arm. Also it is indicated in the expression: "are listening for thy
voice," that they are such as have not for a long time heard the dear
voice which was wont to cheer their hearts. The חבר are the companions
of the former shepherdess and keeper of a vineyard, [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md) f., the playmates of her youth,
the friends of her home. With a fine tact the poet does not represent
Solomon as saying חבריך nor חברינוּ: the former would be contrary to the
closeness of his relation to Shulamith, the latter contrary to the
dignity of the king. By חברים there is neither expressed a one-sided
reference, nor is a double-sided excluded. That "for thy voice" refers
not to her voice as speaking, but as the old good friends wish, as
singing, is evident from השׁמיעני in connection with [Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md), where also קולך is to be
supplied, and the voice of song is meant. She complies with the request,
and thus begins:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 8:14</span></span>

14 Flee, my beloved,

And be thou like a gazelle,

Or a young one of the harts,

Upon spicy mountains.

Hitzig supposes that with these words of refusal she bids him away from
her, without, however, as "my beloved" shows, meaning them in a bad
sense. They would thus, as Renan says, be bantering coquetry. If it is
Solomon who makes the request, and thus also he who is addressed here,
not the imaginary shepherd violently introduced into this closing scene
in spite of the words "(the thousand) is thine, Solomon" ([Sol
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012).md), then Shulamith's ignoring of
his request is scornful, for it would be as unseemly if she sang of her
own accord to please her friends, as it would be wilful if she kept
silent when requested by her royal husband. So far the Spanish author,
Soto Major, is right (1599): jussa et rogata id non debuit nec potuit
recusare. Thus with "flee" she begins a song which she sings, as at [Sol
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015.md) she commences one, in response to
a similar request, with "catch us." Hoelem. finds in her present
happiness, which fills her more than ever, the thought here expressed
that her beloved, if he again went from her for a moment, would yet very
speedily return to his longing, waiting bride.

(Note: Similarly Godet: The earth during the present time belongs to the
earthly power; only at the end shall the bridegroom fetch the bride, and
appear as the heavenly Solomon to thrust out the false and fleshly, and
to celebrate the heavenly marriage festival.)

But apart from the circumstance that Shulamith is no longer a bride, but
is married, and that the wedding festival is long past, there is not a
syllable of that thought in the text; the words must at least have been
אלי בּרח, if ברח signified generally to hasten hither, and not to hasten
forth. Thus, at least as little as סב, [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md), without אלי, signifies "turn
thyself hither," can this בּרח mean "flee hither." The words of the song
thus invite Solomon to disport himself, i.e., give way to frolicsome and
aimless mirth on these spicy mountains. As sov lecha is enlarged to sov
demeh-lecha, [Sol 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md), for the sake
of the added figures (vid., under [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009).md), so here berahh-lecha ([Gen
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#043).md) is enlarged to berahh udemeh
(udǎmeh) lecha. That "mountains of spices" occurs here instead of "cleft
mountains," [Sol 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md), has its reason,
as has already been there remarked, and as Hitzig, Hoelem., and others
have discovered, in the aim of the poet to conclude the pleasant song of
love that has reached perfection and refinement with an absolutely
pleasant word.

But with what intention does he call on Shulamith to sing to her beloved
this בּרח, which obviously has here not the meaning of escaping away
(according to the fundamental meaning, transversum currere), but only,
as where it is used of fleeting time, [Job
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#025.md); [Job
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002.md), the sense of hastening? One
might suppose that she whom he has addressed as at home in gardens
replied to his request with the invitation to hasten forth among the
mountains, - an exercise which gives pleasure to a man. But (1) Solomon,
according to [Sol 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md); [Sol
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002.md) f., is also fond of gardens and
flowers; and (2) if he took pleasure in ascending mountains, it doubled
his joy, according to [Sol 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008.md), to
share this joy with Shulamith; and (3) we ask, would this closing scene,
and along with it the entire series of dramatic pictures, find a
satisfactory conclusion, if either Solomon remained and gave no response
to Shulamith's call, or if he, as directed, disappeared alone, and left
Shulamith by herself among the men who surrounded her? Neither of these
two things can have been intended by the poet, who shows himself
elsewhere a master in the art of composition. In [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md) the matter lies otherwise. There
the love-relation is as yet in progress, and the abandonment of love to
uninterrupted fellowship places a limit to itself. Now, however,
Shulamith is married, and the summons is unlimited. It reconciles itself
neither with the strength of her love nor with the tenderness of the
relation, that she should with so cheerful a spirit give occasion to her
husband to leave her alone for an indefinite time. We will thus have to
suppose that, when Shulamith sings the song, "Flee, my beloved," she
goes forth leaning on Solomon's arm out into the country, or that she
presumes that he will not make this flight into the mountains of her
native home without her. With this song breaking forth in the joy of
love and of life, the poet represents the loving couple as disappearing
over the flowery hills, and at the same time the sweet charm of the Song
of Songs, leaping gazelle-like from one fragrant scene to another,
vanishes away.
