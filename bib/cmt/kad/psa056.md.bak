### [Psalms Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 56:0</span></span>

Cheerful Courage of a Fugitive

To Ps 55, which is [Psa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md) gives
utterance to the wish: "Oh that I had wings like a dove," etc., no Psalm
could be more appropriately appended, according to the mode of
arrangement adopted by the collector, than [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md), the musical inscription of
which runs: To the Precentor, after "The silent dove among the far off,"
by David, a Michtam. רחקים is a second genitive, cf. [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md), and either signifies distant men
or longiqua, distant places, as in [Psa
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006.md), cf. נעימים, [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md). Just as in [Psa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002.md), it is questionable whether the
punctuation אלם has lighted upon the correct rendering. Hitzig is
anxious to read אלם, "Dove of the people in the distance;" but אלם,
people, in spite of Egli's commendation, is a word unheard of in Hebrew,
and only conjectural in Phoenician. Olshausen's אלם more readily
commends itself, "Dove of the distant terebinths." As in other like
inscriptions, על does not signify de (as Joh. Campensis renders it in
his paraphrase of the Psalms \[1532\] and frequently): Praefecto
musices, de columba muta quae procul avolaverat), but secundum; and the
coincidence of the defining of the melody with the situation of the
writer of the Psalm is explained by the consideration that the melody is
chosen with reference to that situation. The lxx (cf. the Targum),
interpreting the figure, renders: ὑπὲρ τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων (from
the sanctuary) μεμακρυμμένου, for which Symmachus has: φύλου ἀπωσμένου.
The rendering of Aquila is correct: ὑπὲρ περιστερᾶς ἀλάλου μακρυσμῶν.
From Ps 55 ([Psa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md), cf. [Psa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#014).md) we may form an idea of the
standard song designated by the words יונת אלם רחקים; for Ps 55 is not
this song itself, and for this reason, that it belongs to the time of
Absalom, and is therefore of later date than [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md), the historical inscription of
which, "when the Philistines assaulted him in Gath" (cf. בּידם, [Sa1
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#014).md), carries us back into the time
of Saul, to the same time of the sojourn in Philistia to which Ps 34 is
assigned. [Psa 56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md) exhibits many
points of the closest intermingling with the Psalms of this period, and
thus justifies its inscription. It is a characteristic possessed in
common by these Psalms, that the prospect of the judgment that will come
upon the whole of the hostile world is combined with David's prospect of
the judgment that will come upon his enemies: [Psa
56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008.md); [Psa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md); [Psa
59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006) (12.md). The figure of the bottle in
which God preserves the tears of the suffering ones corresponds to the
sojourn in the wilderness. As regards technical form, [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md) begins the series of Davidic
Elohimic Michtammı̂m, [Psa 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md). Three
of these belong to the time of Saul. These three contain refrains, a
fact that we have already recognised on [Psa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md) as a peculiarity of these
"favourite-word-poems." the favourite words of this [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001) are (באלהים אהלל דבר.md)ו and לי
(אדם) מה־יּעשׂה בשׂר.

[Psalms 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 56:1</span></span>

אלהים and אנושׁ, [Psa 56:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#002.md) ([Psa
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020.md); [Psa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018).md), are antitheses: over against
God, the majestic One, men are feeble beings. Their rebellion against
the counsel of God is ineffective madness. If the poet has God's favour
on his side, then he will face these pigmies that behave as though they
were giants, who fight against him מרום, moving on high, i.e., proudly
(cf. ממּרום, [Psa 73:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#008).md), in the
invincible might of God. שׁאף, inhiare, as in [Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md); לחם, as in [Psa
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md), with ל like אל, e.g., in [Jer
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#019.md). Thus, then, he does not fear; in
the day when (Ges. ֗123, 3, b) he might well be afraid (conjunctive
future, as e.g., in [Jos 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027).md), he
clings trustfully to (אל as in [Psa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md), and frequently, [Pro
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#005).md) his God, so that fear cannot come
near him. He has the word of His promise on his side (דּברו as e.g.,
[Psa 130:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#005).md); בּאלהים, through God will
he praise this His word, inasmuch as it is gloriously verified in him.
Hupfeld thus correctly interprets it; whereas others in part render it
"in Elohim do I praise His word," in part (and the form of this
favourite expression in [Psa 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#011.md) is
opposed to it): "Elohim do I celebrate, His word." Hitzig, however,
renders it: "Of God do I boast in matter," i.e., in the present affair;
which is most chillingly prosaic in connection with an awkward brevity
of language. The exposition is here confused by [Psa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003.md) and [Psa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009.md). הלּל does not by any means
signify gloriari in this passage, but celebrare; and באלהים is not
intended in any other sense than that in Ps 60:14. בּטח בּ is equivalent
to the New Testament phrase πιστεύειν ἐν. לא אירא is a circumstantial
clause with a finite verb, as is customary in connection with לא, [Psa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008.md), [Job
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#024.md), and עב, [Pro
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#023.md).

[Psalms 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 56:5</span></span>

This second strophe describes the adversaries, and ends in imprecation,
the fire of anger being kindled against them. Hitzig's rendering is:
"All the time they are injuring my concerns," i.e., injuring my
interests. This also sounds unpoetical. Just as we say חמס תורה, to do
violence to the Tפra ([Zep 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md); [Eze
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026).md), so we can also say: to torture
any one's words, i.e., his utterances concerning himself, viz., by
misconstruing and twisting them. It is no good to David that he
asseverates his innocence, that he asserts his filial faithfulness to
Saul, God's anointed; they stretch his testimony concerning himself upon
the rack, forcing upon it a false meaning and wrong inferences. They
band themselves together, they place men in ambush. The verb גּוּר
signifies sometimes to turn aside, turn in, dwell (= Arab. jâr);
sometimes, to be afraid (= יגר, Arab. wjr); sometimes, to stir up,
excite, [Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003) (= גּרה.md); and
sometimes, as here, and in [Psa 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#004.md),
[Isa 54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015.md) : to gather together (=
אגר). The Ker reads יצפּונוּ (as in [Psa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md); [Pro
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011).md), but the scriptio plena points
to Hiph. (cf. [Job 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#006.md), and also [Psa
126:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005).md), and the following המּה leads
one to the conclusion that it is the causative יצפּינוּ that is
intended: they cause one to keep watch in concealment, they lay an
ambush (synon. האריב, [Sa1 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#005).md); so
that המה refers to the liers-in-wait told off by them: as to these -
they observe my heels or (like the feminine plural in [Psa
77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020.md); [Psa
89:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052)) footprints (Rashi: mes traces.md),
i.e., all my footsteps or movements, because (properly, "in accordance
with this, that," as in [Mic 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004).md) they
now as formerly (which is implied in the perfect, cf. [Psa
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#004).md) attempt my life, i.e., strive
after, lie in wait for it (קוּה like שׁמר, [Psa
71:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#010.md), with the accusative = קוּה ל in
[Psa 119:95](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#095).md). To this circumstantial
representation of their hostile proceedings is appended the clause
על־עון פּלּט־למו, which is not to be understood otherwise than as a
question, and is marked as such by the order of the words ([Kg2
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026.md); [Isa
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028).md): In spite of iniquity \[is
there\] escape for them? i.e., shall they, the liers-in-wait,
notwithstanding such evil good-for-nothing mode of action, escape? At
any rate פּלּט is, as in [Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md), a
substantivized finitive, and the "by no means" which belongs as answer
to this question passes over forthwith into the prayer for the overthrow
of the evil ones. This is the customary interpretation since Kimchi's
day. Mendelssohn explains it differently: "In vain be their escape,"
following Aben-Jachja, who, however, like Saadia, takes פלט to be
imperative. Certainly adverbial notions are expressed by means of על, -
e.g., על־יתר ,., abundantly, [Psa
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#024.md); על־שׁקר, falsely, Lev. 5:22
(vid., Gesenius, Thesaurus, p. 1028), - but one does not say על־הבל, and
consequently also would hardly have said על־און (by no means, for
nothing, in vain); moreover the connection here demands the prevailing
ethical notion for און. Hupfeld alters פלט to פּלּס, and renders it:
"recompense to them for wickedness," which is not only critically
improbable, but even contrary to the usage of the language, since פלס
signifies to weigh out, but not to requite, and requires the accusative
of the object. The widening of the circle of vision to the whole of the
hostile world is rightly explained by Hengstenberg by the fact that the
special execution of judgment on the part of God is only an outflow of
His more general and comprehensive execution of judgment, and the belief
in the former has its root in a belief in the latter. The meaning of
הורד becomes manifest from the preceding Psalm (Ps 55:24), to which the
Psalm before us is appended by reason of manifold and closely allied
relation.

[Psalms 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 56:8</span></span>

What the poet prays for in [Psa 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008.md),
he now expresses as his confident expectation with which he solaces
himself. נד ([Psa 56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009).md) is not to be
rendered "flight," which certainly is not a thing that can be numbered
(Olshausen); but "a being fugitive," the unsettled life of a fugitive
([Pro 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#008).md), can really be numbered
both by its duration and its many temporary stays here and there. And
upon the fact that God, that He whose all-seeing eye follows him into
every secret hiding-place of the desert and of the rocks, counteth
(telleth) it, the poet lays great stress; for he has long ago learnt to
despair of man. The accentuation gives special prominence to נדי as an
emphatically placed object, by means of Zarka; and this is then followed
by ספרתּה with the conjunctive Galgal and the pausal אתּה with
Olewejored (the \_ of which is placed over the final letter of the
preceding word, as is always the case when the word marked with this
double accent is monosyllabic, or dissyllabic and accented on the first
syllable). He who counts ([Job 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#004).md)
all the steps of men, knows how long David has already been driven
hither and thither without any settled home, although free from guilt.
He comforts himself with this fact, but not without tears, which this
wretched condition forces from him, and which he prays God to collect
and preserve. Thus it is according to the accentuation, which takes
שׂימה as imperative, as e.g., in [Sa1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#005.md); but since שׂים, שׂימה ,שׂים, is
also the form of the passive participle ([Sa1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024.md), and frequently, [Sa2
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#032).md), it is more natural, in
accordance with the surrounding thoughts, to render it so even in this
instance (posita est lacrima mea), and consequently to pronounce it as
Milra (Ewald, Hupfeld, Bttcher, and Hitzig). דמעתי ([Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001).md) corresponds chiastically
(crosswise) to נדי, with which בנאדך forms a play in sound; and the
closing clause הלא בּספרתך unites with ספרתּה in the first member of the
verse. Both [Psa 56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009.md) and [Psa
56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009.md) are wanting in any particle of
comparison. The fact thus figuratively set forth, viz., that God
collects the tears of His saints as it were in a bottle, and notes them
together with the things which call them forth as in a memorial ([Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016).md), the writer assumes; and only
appropriatingly applies it to himself. The אז which follows may be taken
either as a logical "in consequence of so and so" (as e.g., [Psa
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014.md); [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008).md), or as a "then" fixing a
turning-point in the present tearful wandering life (viz., when there
have been enough of the "wandering" and of the "tears"), or "at a future
time" (more abruptly, like שׁם in [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md); 36:13, vid., on [Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005).md). בּיום אקרא is not an expansion
of this אז, which would trail awkwardly after it. The poet says that one
day his enemies will be obliged to retreat, inasmuch as a day will come
when his prayer, which is even now heard, will be also outwardly
fulfilled, and the full realization of the succour will coincide with
the cry for help. By זה־ידעתּי in [Psa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#010.md) he justifies this hope from his
believing consciousness. It is not to be rendered, after [Job
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#019.md) : "I who know," which is a
trailing apposition without any proper connection with what precedes;
but, after [Kg1 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#024.md) : this I know
(of this I am certain), that Elohim is for me. זה as a neuter, just as
in connection with ידע in [Pro 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012.md),
and also frequently elsewhere ([Gen
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#015.md); [Exo
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#008.md); [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md); [Lev
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004.md); [Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md), cf. [Job
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#017).md); and לי as e.g., in [Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md). Through Elohim, [Psa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#011.md) continues, will I praise דּבר:
thus absolutely is the word named; it is therefore the divine word, just
like בּר in [Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md), the Son
absolutely, therefore the divine Son. Because the thought is repeated,
Elohim stands in the first case and then Jahve, in accordance with the
Elohimic Psalm style, as in [Psa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007.md).
The refrain in [Psa 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012.md) (cf. [Psa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005).md) indicates the conclusion of the
strophe. The fact that we read אדם instead of בּשׂר in this instance,
just as in [Psa 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#011.md) דּבר instead of
דּברו ([Psa 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005).md), is in accordance
with the custom in the Psalms of not allowing the refrain to recur in
exactly the same form.

[Psalms 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 56:12</span></span>

In prospect of his deliverance the poet promises beforehand to fulfil
the duty of thankfulness. עלי, incumbent upon me, as in [Pro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md); [Sa2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#011.md). נדריך, with an objective
subject, are the vows made to God; and תּודות are distinguished from
them, as e.g., in [Ch2 29:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#031.md). He will
suffer neither the pledged שׁלמי נדר nor the שׁלמי תּודה to be wanting;
for - so will he be then able to sing and to declare - Thou hast
rescued, etc. The perfect after כּי denotes that which is then past, as
in [Psa 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017.md), cf. the dependent
passage [Psa 116:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#008.md). There the
expression is ארצות החיּים instead of אור החיּים (here and in Elihu's
speech, [Job 33:30](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#030).md). Light of life
([Joh 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012).md) or of the living (lxx τῶν
ζώντων) is not exclusively the sun-light of this present life. Life is
the opposite of death in the deepest and most comprehensive sense; light
of life is therefore the opposite of the night of Hades, of this
seclusion from God and from His revelation in human history.
