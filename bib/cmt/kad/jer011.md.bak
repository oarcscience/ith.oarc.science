Judah's Faithlessness to Covenant Obligations, and the Consequences
Thereof - Jeremiah 11-13

In the first part of this compilation of discourses (Jer 11:1-17) Judah
is upbraided for disloyalty to the covenant, on account of which people
and kingdom are threatened with sore disaster. In the second part
(11:18-12:17), the murderous attempt of the people of Anathoth against
the prophet's life ([Jer 11:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018).md)
gives occasion for a description of Judah's irreclaimable perverseness;
while Jeremiah's expostulation with God as to the prosperity of godless
men, and the reproof therefor received by him from God ([Jer
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001).md), call forth an announcement
that, in spite of God's long-suffering, judgment on Judah and all
nations will not be for ever deferred ([Jer
12:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007).md). Finally, in the third part,
Jer 13, we have first a further account, by means of a symbolical action
to be performed by the prophet, of the abasement of Judah's pride in
banishment to Euphrates ([Jer
11:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001).md); and next, an account of the
judgment about to fall on Judah in the destruction of Jerusalem, and
this both in figurative and in direct language ([Jer
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#012) -27.md).

From the contents of the discourses it appears unquestionable that we
have here, gathered into the unity of a written record, various oral
addresses of Jeremiah, together with some of the experiences that befell
him in the exercise of his calling. There is no foundation for the
assertion, that [Jer 12:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007.md) is a
self-complete prophetic discourse (Hitz.), or a supplement to the rest,
written in the last years of Jehoiakim (Graf); nor for the assumption of
several commentators, that the composition of c. 13 falls into the time
of Jehoiachin - as will be shown when we come to expound the passages
referred to. The discourse throughout contains nothing that might not
have been spoken or have happened in the time of Josiah; nor have we
here any data for determining precisely the dates of the several
portions of the whole discourse.

Judah's Disloyalty to the Covenant, with the Consequences Thereof

In [Jer 11:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002.md) is a short summary of
the covenant made with the fathers; in [Jer
11:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#009.md) is an account of the breaking
of this covenant by Judah, and of the calamity which results therefrom;
and in [Jer 11:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md) further
description of this calamity.

[Jer 11:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md)

"The word which came to Jeremiah from Jahveh, saying: [Jer
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002.md). Hear ye the words of this
covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, [Jer 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#003.md). And say thou to
them: Thus hath Jahve, the God of Israel, said: Cursed is the man that
heareth not the words of this covenant, [Jer
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#004.md). Which I commanded your fathers
in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of
the iron furnace, saying: Hearken to my voice, and do them according to
all which I command you; so shall ye be my people, and I will be your
God; [Jer 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005.md). That I may perform the
oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing
with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said: So be
it, Jahveh. [Jer 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#006.md). Then said
Jahveh to me: Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the
streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear ye the words of this covenant and do
them. [Jer 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007.md). For I have testified
to your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt
unto this day, testifying from early morning on: Hearken to my voice!
[Jer 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008.md). But they hearkened not, nor
inclined their ear, but walked each in the stubbornness of their evil
heart; and so I brought on them all the words of this covenant which I
have commanded them to do, and they have not done them."

The form of address, [Jer 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002.md) : hear
ye (שׁמעוּ), and speak ye (דּבּרתּם), is noteworthy since we are not
told who are to hear and speak; while at [Jer
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#003.md), in ואמרתּ Jeremiah receives the
commission to declare the words of the covenant to the people, and to
make known in the cities of Judah, etc. ([Jer
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#006).md). The difficulty is not removed
by the plan adopted by Hitz. and Graf from the lxx, of changing ודבּרתּם
into ודבּרתּם, "and speak them;" for the שׁמעוּ remains to be dealt
with. To whom then, is it addressed? Schleussner proposed to change it
into שׁמעה - a purely arbitrary change. In [Jer
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#004.md) "hearing" is used in the sense of
giving ear to, obeying. And in no other sense can it be taken in [Jer
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md). "The words of this covenant"
are, as is clear from the succeeding context, the words of the covenant
recorded in the Pentateuch, known from the reading of the Torah. The
call to hear the words thereof can only have the meaning of: to give ear
to them, take them to heart. Hence Chr. B. Mich. and Schnur. have
referred the words to the Jews: Listen, ye Jews and ye citizens of
Jerusalem, to the words of the covenant, and make them know to one
another, and exhort one another to observe them. But this paraphrase is
hardly consistent with the wording of the verse. Others fancied that the
priests and elders were addressed; but if so, these must necessarily
have been named. Clearly it is to the prophets in general that the words
are spoken, as Kimchi observed; and we must not take "hear ye" as if the
covenant was unknown to the prophets, but as intended to remind the
prophets of them, that they might enforce them upon the people. Taken
thus, this introductory verse serves to exalt the importance of the
truths mentioned, to mark them out as truths which God had commanded all
the prophets to proclaim. If it be the prophets in general who are
addressed in [Jer 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002.md), the transition
to "and say thou" is easily explained. Jeremiah, too, must himself do
that which was the bounden duty of all the prophets, must make the men
of Judah and Jerusalem call to mind the curse overhanging transgressors
of the covenant. The words: Cursed is the man, etc., are taken from [Deu
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md), from the directions for the
engagement to keep the covenant, which the people were to solemnise upon
their entry into Canaan, and which, acc. to [Jos
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md)., they did solemnise. The
quotation is made freely from memory. Instead of "that heareth not the
words of this covenant," we find in Deut. l.c.: "the confirmeth not
(יקים) the words of this law to do them." The choice there of the word
יקים is suggested by its connection with the act of solemnisation
enjoined. The recitation and promulgation of the law upon Mount Gerizim
and Ebal (Deut 27) had no other aim than that of solemnly binding the
people to keep or follow the law; and this is what Jeremiah means by
"hearing." The law to be established is the law of the covenant, i.e.,
the covenant made by Jahveh with Israel, and spoken of in [Deu
28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068.md) and [Deu
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#008.md) as the "words of this covenant."
This covenant, which Moses had made with the sons of Israel in the land
of Moab ([Deu 28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068).md), was but a
renewal of that solemnly concluded at Sinai (Ex 24). And so Jeremiah
speaks of this covenant as the one which Jahveh commanded the fathers in
the day, i.e., at the time, of their leaving Egypt. "In the day that,"
etc., as in [Jer 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md). "Out of the
iron furnace:" this metaphor for the affliction endured by Israel in
Egypt is taken from [Deu 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md). The
words: hearken unto my voice and do them (the words of the covenant),
suggest [Deu 27:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#001.md); and the words: so
shall ye be my people, suggest [Deu
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#012.md), a passage which itself points
back to ex. [Jer 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007.md) ([Jer
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005)..md), [Lev
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#012.md); [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md), etc. That I may establish, i.e.,
perform, the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, i.e., the
patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ([Deu
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008), etc..md), promising to give them a
land flowing, etc. The frequently repeated description of the promised
land; cf. [Exo 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md), [Exo
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#017.md); [Deu
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#003.md), etc. כּיּום , as in [Deu
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030.md); [Deu
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md), etc., is not: at this time, now
(Graf), but: as this day, meaning: as is even now the case, sc. that ye
still possess this precious land. The assenting reply of the prophet:
אמן יהוה, yea, or so be it (γένοιτο, lxx), Lord, corresponds to the אמן
with which the people, acc. to [Deu
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015.md)., were to take on themselves the
curses attached to the breaking of the law, curses which they did take
on themselves when the law was promulgated in Canaan. As the whole
congregation did on that occasion, so here the prophet, by his "yea,"
expresses his adherence to the covenant, and admits that the engagement
is yet in full force for the congregation of God; and at the same time
indicates that he, on his part, is ready to labour for the fulfilment of
the covenant, so that the people may not become liable to the curse of
the law.

[Jer 11:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#006.md)

Having set forth the curse to which transgressors of the law are
exposed, God commands the prophet to proclaim the words of the covenant
to the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem, and to call upon them to do
these. "All these words" are those subsequently specified, i.e., the
commandments of the law (cf. [Jer
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002).md). Jeremiah is to proclaim these,
because, in spite of unremitting exhortation to hear and give heed to
the voice of the Lord, the fathers had paid no regard thereto. קתא, not:
read aloud (Hitz., Graf), but: proclaim, make known, as in [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md); [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md), etc. העיד with בּ, to testify
against any one, equivalent to: solemnly to enforce on one with
importunate counsel and warning; cf. [Deu
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019.md); [Psa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007.md), etc. On השׁכּם והעד, see at [Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013.md). - But they have not hearkened,
[Jer 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008.md), running almost literally in
the words of [Jer 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#024.md). "And I brought
upon them," etc., i.e., inflicted upon them the punishments with which
transgressors of the law were threatened, which curses had been, in the
case of the greater part of the people, the ten tribes, carried to the
extreme length, i.e., to the length of their banishment from their own
land into the midst of the heathen; cf. [Kg2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013.md).

[Jer 11:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#009.md)

The people's breach of the covenant, and the consequences of this. -
[Jer 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#009.md). "And Jahveh said unto me:
Conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem. [Jer 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#010.md). They are turned
back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to give ear
to my words, and they are gone after other gods to serve them; the house
of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made
with their fathers. [Jer 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011.md).
Behold, I bring evil upon them, from which they cannot escape; and
though they cry to me, I will not hear them. [Jer
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#012.md). And the cities of Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go and cry unto the gods unto whom they
offer incense, but they shall not help them in the time of their
trouble. [Jer 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013.md). For as many as
are thy cities, so many are thy gods become, O Judah; and as many as are
the streets of Jerusalem, so many altars have ye set up to Shame, altars
to offer odours to Baal."

Jeremiah is once more to enforce the words of the covenant upon the
people, because they have broken the covenant, returned to the idolatry
of the fathers. Conspiracy is found, is to be seen. The people's
defection from Jahveh, their breach of faith towards the covenant God,
is called conspiracy, because it had become as universal as if it had
been initiated by a formal preconcertment. "The former fathers,"
forefathers of the people, are the Israelites under Moses, who broke the
covenant by idolatry while still at Sinai, and those of the time of the
Judges. With והמּה the subject is changed; "they" are not the
forefathers, but the prophet's contemporaries. In the last clause of
[Jer 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#010.md) is comprehended the
apostasy of the whole people: Like Israel, Judah too has broken the
covenant. Israel has been punished for this by being cast out among the
heathen, the like doom awaits Judah.

[Jer 11:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011.md)

Because of the covenant broken, the Lord will bring on Judah and
Jerusalem evil out of which they shall not come forth, i.e., not merely,
from which they shall not escape safely, but: in which they shall find
no way of rescue; for it in this calamity they cry to the Lord, He will
not hear them. Nor will the gods whom they serve, i.e., the false gods,
help them then. As to "as many as are," etc., see on [Jer
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#028). "(The.md) Shame," i.e., Baal, as at
[Jer 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024.md).

[Jer 11:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md)

Neither entreaty on their behalf nor their hypocritical worship will
avert judgment. - [Jer 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md). "But
thou, pray not for this people, neither lift up for them cry or prayer;
for I hear them not in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.
[Jer 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015.md). What would my beloved in
my house? they who practise guile? Shall vows and holy flesh remove they
calamity from thee? then mayest thou exult. [Jer
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016.md). A green olive, fair for its
goodly fruit, Jahveh called thy name; with the noise of great tumult He
set fire to it, and its branches brake. [Jer
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#017.md). And Jahveh of hosts, that
planted thee, hath decreed evil against thee, for the evil of the house
of Israel and of the house of Judah which they themselves have done, to
provoke me, in that they have offered odours to Baal."

We have already, in [Jer 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md), met
with the declaration that the Lord will not accept any intercession for
the covenant-breaking people ([Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014).md); the termination of this verse
differs slightly in the turn to takes. - בּעד רעתם the ancient
commentators have almost unanimously rendered: tempore mali eorum, as if
they had read בּעת (this is, in fact, the reading of some codd.); but
hardly on sufficient grounds. בּעד gives a suitable sense, with the
force of the Greek ἀμφί, which, like the German um, passes into the
sense of wegen, as the English about passes into that of concerning. -
In [Jer 11:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015.md) we have the reason
why the Lord will hear neither the prophet's supplication nor the
people's cry in their time of need. [Jer
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015.md) is very obscure; and from the
Masoretic text it is hardly possible to obtain a suitable sense. "The
beloved" of Jahveh is Judah, the covenant people; cf. [Deu
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012.md), where Benjamin is so called,
and [Jer 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007.md), where the Lord calls
His people ידידוּת נפשׁי. "What is to my beloved in my house?" i.e.,
what has my people to do in my house - what does it want there? "My
house" is the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, as appears from the
mention of holy flesh in the second clause. The main difficulty lies in
the words עשׂותהּ המזמּתה הרבּים. Hitz. takes עשׂותהּ to be the subject
of the clause, and makes the suffix point back to ידידי, which, as
collective, is to be construed generis faem.: what should the
accomplishment of his plans be to my beloved in my house? But as adverse
to this we must note, a. the improbability of ידיד as used of the people
being feminine; b. the fact that even if we adopt Hitz.'s change of
המזמּתה into המזמּות, yet the latter word does not mean plans or designs
to bring offerings. The phrase is clearly to be taken by itself as a
continuation of the question; and the suffix to be regarded, with Ew.,
Umbr., etc., as pointing, in the Aramaic fashion, to the object
following: they who practise guile. מזמּה, a thinking out, devising,
usually of hurtful schemes, here guile, as in [Psa
139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020.md); [Job
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#027.md). What is meant is the hypocrisy
of cloaking their apostasy from God by offering sacrifices in the
temple, of concealing their idolatry and passing themselves off as
worshippers of Jahve. On the form מזמּתה, see Ew. 173, g, Gesen. 80,
Rem. 2,f. הרבּים makes no sense. It belongs manifestly to the words
which follow; for it can neither be subject to עשׂותהּ, nor can it be
joined to המזמּתה as its genitive. The lxx render: μὴ εὐχαὶ καὶ κρέα
ἅγια ἀφελοῦσιν ἀπὸ σοῦ τὰς κακίας σου; and following this, Dathe, Dahl.,
Ew., Hitz. hold הנדרים to be the original reading. On the other hand,
Maur., Graf, and Ng. think we should read הרנּים (after [Psa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007).md) or הרנּים myinirah, crying, loud
supplication; on the ground of Buxtorf's hint, Anticrit. p. 661, that
probably the Alexandrians had הרבּים in their text, but, changing the ב
for נ, read הרנים. We must make our choice between these two
conjectures; for even if הרבּים did not stand in the codex used by the
Alexandrians, it cannot have been the original word. The form רנּים is,
indeed, sufficiently attested by רנּי פלט, [Psa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md); but the meaning of exultation
which it has there is here wholly out of place. And we find no case of a
plural to רנּה, which means both exultation and piteous, beseeching cry
(e.g., [Jer 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016).md). So that, although
רנּה is in the lxx occasionally rendered by δέησις ([Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md); [Jer
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012), etc..md) or προσευχή ([Kg1
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#028).md), we prefer the conjecture
הנדרים; for "vow" is in better keeping with "holy flesh," i.e., flesh of
sacrifice, [Hag 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012.md), since the vow
was generally carried out by offering sacrifice. - Nor do the following
words, 'יעברוּ מעליך וגו, convey any meaning, without some alteration.
As quoted above, they may be translated: shall pass away from thee. But
this can mean neither: they shall be torn from thee, nor: they shall
disappoint thee. And even if this force did lie in the words, no
statement can begin with the following כּי רעתכי gniwollo. If this be a
protasis, the verb is wanting. We shall have to change it, after the
manner of the lxx, to יעברוּ מעליכי רעתכי: shall vows and holy flesh
(sacrifice) avert thine evil from thee? For the form יעברוּ as Hiph. cf.
ידרכוּ, [Jer 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002.md). "Thine evil" with
the double force: thy sin and shame, and the disaster impending, i.e.,
sin and (judicial) suffering. There is no occasion for any further
changes. אז, rendered ἤ by the lxx, and so read או by them, may be
completely vindicated: then, i.e., if this were the case, if thou
couldst avert calamity by sacrifice, then mightest thou exult. Thus we
obtain the following as the sense of the whole verse: What mean my
people in my temple with their hypocritical sacrifices? Can vows and
offerings, presented by you there, avert calamity from you? If it could
be so, well might you shout for joy.

[Jer 11:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016.md)

This idea is carried on in [Jer 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016.md),
[Jer 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#017). Judah (Israel.md) was truly a
noble planting of God's, but by defection from the Lord, its God and
Creator, it has drawn down on itself this ruin. Jahveh called Judah a
green olive with splendid fruit. For a comparison of Israel to an olive,
cf. [Hos 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007.md), Ps. 52:10; [Psa
128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003.md). The fruit of the tree is the
nation in its individual members. The naming of the name is the
representation of the state of the case, and so here: the growth and
prosperity of the people. The contrasted state is introduced by לקול ה'
without adversative particle, and is thus made to seem the more abrupt
and violent (Hitz.). Noise of tumult (המלּה, occurring besides here only
in [Eze 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024) as equivalent to המון.md),
i.e., of the tumult of war, cf. [Isa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004.md); not: roar of the thunderstorm or
crash of thunder (Ng., Graf). עליה for בּהּ (OT:871a), cf. [Jer
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#027.md); [Jer
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014.md), etc. The suffix is regulated by
the thing represented by the olive, i.e., Judah as a kingdom. Its
branches brake; רעע, elsewhere only transitive, here intransitive,
analogously to רצץ in [Isa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md). Hitz.
renders less suitably: its branches look bad, as being charred, robbed
of their gay adornment. On this head cf. [Eze
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md). The setting of fire to the
olive tree Israel came about through its enemies, who broke up one part
of the kingdom after the other, who had already destroyed the kingdom of
the ten tribes, and were now about to destroy Judah next. That the words
apply not to Judah only, but to Israel as well, appears from [Jer
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#017.md), where the Lord, who has planted
Israel, is said to have spoken, i.e., decreed evil for the sin of the
two houses, Israel and Judah. דּבּר is not directly = decree, but
intimates also the utterance of the decree by the prophet. להם after
עשׂוּ is dat. incomm.: the evil which they have done to their hurt; cf.
[Jer 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#003.md), where the dative is
wanting. Hitz. finds in להם an intimation of voluntary action, as
throwing back the deed upon the subject as an act of free choice; cf.
Ew. 315, a.

[Jeremiah 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 11:18</span></span>

Evidence that Judah is Unreclaimable, and that the Sore Judgments
Threatened cannot be Averted. - As a practical proof of the people's
determination not to reform, we have in [Jer
11:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md) an account of the designs of
the inhabitants of Anathoth against the prophet's life, inasmuch as it
was their ill-will towards his prophecies that led them to this crime.
They are determined not to hear the word of God, chiding and punishing
them for their sins, and so to put the preacher of this word out of the
way. - [Jer 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md). "And Jahveh gave me
knowledge of it, and I knew it; then showedst Thou me their doings. [Jer
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019.md). And I was as a tame lamb that
is led to the slaughter, and knew not that they plotted designs against
me: Let us destroy the three with the fruit thereof, and cut him off out
of the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered. [Jer
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020.md). But Jahveh of hosts, that
judgeth justly, trieth reins and heart-I shall see Thy vengeance on
them, for to Thee have I confided my case. [Jer
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021.md). Therefore thus hath Jahveh
spoken against the men of Anathoth, that seek after thy life, saying,
Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jahveh, that thou die not by our
hand. [Jer 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#022.md). Therefore thus hath
Jahveh of hosts spoken: Behold, I will punish them; the young men shall
die by the sword, their sons and daughters shall die by famine. [Jer
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#023.md). And a remnant shall not remain
to them; for I bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their
visitation."

Jeremiah had not himself observed the designs of the people of Anathoth
against his life, because the thing was carried on in secret; but the
Lord made it known to him. אז, then, sc. when I knew nought of their
murderous intent; cf. [Jer 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019.md).
"Their doings," i.e., those done in secret. [Jer
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019.md). כּבשׂ , agnus mansuetus, a tame
pet-lamb, such as the Arabs used to keep, such as the Hebrews too, [Sa2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#003.md), kept; familiar with the
household, reared by them in the house, that does not suspect when it is
being taken to be killed. In like manner Jeremiah had no suspicion that
his countrymen were harbouring evil designs against him. These designs
are quoted directly without לאמר. The saying is a figurative or
proverbial one: we will destroy the tree בּלחמו. This word is variously
taken. The ordinary meaning, food for men and beasts, usually bread,
seems not to be suitable. And so Hitz. wishes to read בּלחו, in its sap
(cf. [Deu 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#007.md); [Eze
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003).md), because לחם may mean grain, but
it does not mean fruit. Ng. justly remarks against this view: What is
here essential is simply the produce of the tree, furnished for the use
of man. The word of the prophet was a food which they abhorred (cf. [Jer
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021).md). As לחם originally meant food,
we here understand by it the edible product of the tree, that is, its
fruit, in opposition to sap, wood, leaves. This interpretation is
confirmed by the Arabic; the Arabs use both lahûmun and ukulu of the
fruit of a tree, see ill. in Rosenm. Schol. ad h. l. The proverbial
saying is given in plain words in the next clause. We will cut him
(i.e., the prophet) off, etc.

[Jer 11:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020.md)

Therefore Jeremiah calls upon the Lord, as the righteous judge and
omniscient searcher of hearts, to punish his enemies. This verse is
repeated almost verbally in [Jer
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#012.md), and in substance in [Jer
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md). Who trieth reins and heart, and
therefore knows that Jeremiah has done no evil. אראה is future as
expressing certainty that God will interfere to punish; for to Him he
has wholly committed his cause. גּלּיתי, Pi. of גּלה, is taken by Hitz.,
Ew., etc. in the sense of גּלל: on Thee have I rolled over my cause; in
support of this they adduce [Psa 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009.md);
[Psa 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005.md); [Pro
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#003.md), as parallel passages. It is true
that this interpretation can be vindicated grammatically, for גלל might
have assumed the form of גלה (Ew. 121, a). But the passages quoted are
not at all decisive, since Jeremiah very frequently gives a new sense to
quotations by making slight alterations on them; and in the passage
cited we read גּלל את ריב. We therefore adhere, with Grot. and Ros., to
the usual meaning of גּלה; understanding that in making known there is
included the idea of entrusting, a force suggested by the construction
with אל instead of ל. ריב, controversy, cause. - The prophet declares
God's vengeance to the instigators of the plots against his life, [Jer
11:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021.md). The introductory formula in
[Jer 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021.md) is repeated in [Jer
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#022.md), on account of the long
intervening parenthesis. "That thou diest not" is introduced by the ו of
consecution. The punishment is to fall upon the entire population of
Anathoth; on the young men of military age (בּחוּרים), a violent death
in war; on the children, death by famine consequent on the siege. Even
though all had not had a share in the complot, yet were they at heart
just as much alienated from God and ill-disposed towards His word. "Year
of their visitation" is still dependent on "bring." This construction is
simpler than taking שׁנת for accus. adverb., both here and in [Jer
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012.md).
