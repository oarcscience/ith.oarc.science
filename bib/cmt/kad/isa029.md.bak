### [Isaiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 29:1</span></span>

The prophecy here passes from the fall of Samaria, the crown of flowers
([Isa 28:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001).md), to its formal parallel.
Jerusalem takes its place by the side of Samaria, the crown of flowers,
and under the emblem of a hearth of God. 'Arı̄'ēl might, indeed, mean a
lion of God. It occurs in this sense as the name of certain Moabitish
heroes ([Sa2 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020.md); [Ch1
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#022).md), and Isaiah himself used the
shorter form אראל for the heroes of Judah ([Isa
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007).md). But as אריאל (God's heart,
interchanged with הראל htiw degna, God's height) is the name given in
[Eze 43:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#015.md), to the altar of
burnt-offering in the new temple, and as Isaiah could not say anything
more characteristic of Jerusalem, than that Jehovah had a fire and
hearth there ([Isa 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009).md); and,
moreover, as Jerusalem the city and community within the city would have
been compared to a lioness rather than a lion, we take אריאל in the
sense of ara Dei (from ארה, to burn). The prophet commences in his own
peculiar way with a grand summary introduction, which passes in a few
gigantic strides over the whole course from threatening to promise. [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md) "Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the
castle where David pitched his tent! Add year to year, let the feasts
revolve: then I distress Ariel, and there is groaning and moaning; and
so she proves herself to me as Ariel." By the fact that David fixed his
headquarters in Jerusalem, and then brought the sacred ark thither,
Jerusalem became a hearth of God. Within a single year, after only one
more round of feasts (to be interpreted according to [Isa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010.md), and probably spoken at the
passover), Jehovah would make Jerusalem a besieged city, full of sighs
(vahătsı̄qōthı̄, perf. cons., with the tone upon the ultimate); but "she
becomes to me like an Arı̄el," i.e., being qualified through me, she will
prove herself a hearth of God, by consuming the foes like a furnace, or
by their meeting with their destruction at Jerusalem, like wood piled up
on the altar and then consumed in flame. The prophecy has thus passed
over the whole ground in a few majestic words. It now starts from the
very beginning again, and first of all expands the hoi. [Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md), [Isa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004.md) "And I encamp in a circle round
about thee, and surround thee with watch-posts, and erect tortoises
against thee. And when brought down thou wilt speak from out of the
ground, and thy speaking will sound low out of the dust; and thy voice
cometh up like that of a demon from the ground, and thy speaking will
whisper out of the dust." It would have to go so far with Ariel first of
all, that it would be besieged by a hostile force, and would lie upon
the ground in the greatest extremity, and then would whisper with a
ghostlike softness, like a dying man, or like a spirit without flesh and
bones. Kaddūr signifies sphaera, orbis, as in [Isa
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018.md) and in the Talmud (from kâdar =
kâthar; cf., kudur in the name Nabu-kudur-ussur, Nebo protect the crown,
κίδαριν), and is used here poetically for סביב. Jerome renders it quasi
sphaeram (from dūr, orbis). מצּב (from נצב, יצב) might signify "firmly
planted" (Luzzatto, immobilmente; compare shūth, [Isa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007).md); but according to the parallel it
signifies a military post, like מצּב, נציב. Metsurōth (from mâtsōr, [Deu
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#020).md) are instruments of siege, the
nature of which can only be determined conjecturally. On 'ōbh, see [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md);

(Note: The 'akkuubh mentioned there is equivalent to anbûb, Arab. a knot
on a reed stalk, then that part of such a reed which comes between two
knots, then the reed stalk itself; root נב, to rise up, swell, or become
convex without and concave within (Fl.). It is possible that it would be
better to trace 'ōbh back to this radical and primary meaning of what is
hollow (and therefore has a dull sound), whether used in the sense of a
leather-bag, or applied to a spirit of incantation, and the possessor of
such a spirit.)

there is no necessity to take it as standing for ba‛al 'ōbh.

[Isaiah 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 29:5</span></span>

Thus far does the unfolding of the hoi reach. Now follows an unfolding
of the words of promise, which stand at the end of [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md) : "And it proves itself to me as
Ariel." [Isa 29:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md) : "And the
multitude of thy foes will become like finely powdered dust, and the
multitude of the tyrants like chaff flying away; and it will take place
suddenly, very suddenly. From Jehovah of hosts there comes a visitation
with crash of thunder and earthquake and great noise, whirlwind and
tempest, and the blazing up of devouring fire. And the multitude of all
the nations that gather together against Ariel, and all those who storm
and distress Ariel and her stronghold, will be like a vision of the
night in a dream. And it is just as a hungry man dreams, and behold he
eats; and when he wakes up his soul is empty: and just as a thirsty man
dreams, and behold he drinks; and when he wakes up, behold, he is faint,
and his soul is parched with thirst: so will it be to the multitude of
the nations which gather together against the mountain of Zion." The
hostile army, described four times as hâmōn, a groaning multitude, is
utterly annihilated through the terrible co-operation of the forces of
nature which are let loose upon them ([Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md), cf., [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013).md). "There comes a visitation:"
tippâqēd might refer to Jerusalem in the sense of "it will be visited"
in mercy, viz., by Jehovah acting thus upon its enemies. But it is
better to take it in a neuter sense: "punishment is inflicted." The
simile of the dream is applied in two different ways: (1.) They will
dissolve into nothing, as if they had only the same apparent existence
as a vision in a dream. (2.) Their plan for taking Jerusalem will be put
to shame, and as utterly brought to nought as the eating or drinking of
a dreamer, which turns out to be a delusion as soon as he awakes. Just
as the prophet emphatically combines two substantives from the same
verbal root in [Isa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md), and two
adverbs from the same verb in [Isa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md); so does he place צבא and צבה
together in [Isa 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md), the former with
על relating to the crowding of an army for the purpose of a siege, the
latter with an objective suffix (compare [Psa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006).md) to the attack made by a crowded
army. The metsōdâh of Ariel (i.e., the watch-tower, specula, from tsūd,
to spy)

(Note: In Arabic, also, masâd signifies a lofty hill or mountain-top,
from a secondary form of tsud; and massara, to lay the foundations of a
fortified city (‛ı̄r mâtsōr, [Psa
31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022)), from tsūr.).md)

is the mountain of Zion mentioned afterwards in [Isa
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#008.md). כּאשׁר, as if; comp. [Zac
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006.md); [Job
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#019.md). אוכל והנּה without הוּא; the
personal pronoun is frequently omitted, not only in the leading
participial clause, as in this instance (compare [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md); [Isa
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019.md); [Psa
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029.md); [Job
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002.md); and Khler on [Zac
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#012).md), but also with a minor
participial clause, as in [Psa 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010.md);
[Psa 55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020.md), and [Hab
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010.md). The hungering and thirsting of
the waking man are attributed to his nephesh (soul: cf., [Isa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#006.md); [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md); [Pro
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030).md), just because the soul is the
cause of the physical life, and without it the action of the senses
would be followed by no sensation or experience whatever. The hungry
stomach is simply the object of feeling, and everything sensitive in the
bodily organism is merely the medium of sensation or feeling; that which
really feels is the soul. The soul no sooner passes out of the dreaming
state into a waking condition, than it feels that its desires are as
unsatisfied as ever. Just like such a dream will the army of the enemy,
and that victory of which it is so certain before the battle is fought,
fade away into nothing.

[Isaiah 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 29:9</span></span>

This enigma of the future the prophet holds out before the eyes of his
contemporaries. The prophet received it by revelation of Jehovah; and
without the illumination of Jehovah it could not possibly be understood.
The deep degradation of Ariel, the wonderful deliverance, the sudden
elevation from the abyss to this lofty height - all this was a matter of
faith. But this faith was just what the nation wanted, and therefore the
understanding depending upon it was wanting also. The shemu‛âh was
there, but the bı̄nâh was absent; and all שׁמועה הבין was wrecked on the
obtuseness of the mass. The prophet, therefore, who had received the
unhappy calling to harden his people, could not help exclaiming ([Isa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009).md), "Stop, and stare; blind
yourselves, and grow blind!" התמהמהּ, to show one's self delaying (from
מההּ, according to Luzzatto the reflective of תּמהמהּ, an emphatic form
which is never met with), is connected with the synonymous verb תּמהּ,
to be stiff with astonishment; but to שׁעע, to be plastered up, i.e.,
incapable of seeing (cf., [Isa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010).md),
there is attached the hithpalpel of the same verb, signifying "to place
one's self in such circumstances," se oblinere (differently, however, in
[Psa 119:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#016.md), [Psa
119:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#047.md), compare [Isa
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008), se permulcere.md). They could not
understand the word of God, but they were confused, and their eyes were,
so to speak, festered up: therefore this self-induced condition would
become to them a God-appointed punishment. The imperatives are judicial
words of command.

This growth of the self-hardening into a judicial sentence of obduracy,
is proclaimed still more fully by the prophet. "They are drunken, and
not with wine; they reel, and not with meth. For Jehovah hath poured
upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and bound up your eyes; the prophets
and your heads, the seers, He has veiled. And the revelation of all this
will be to you like words of a sealed writing, which they give to him
who understands writing, saying, Pray, read this; but he says, I cannot,
it is sealed. And they give the writing to one who does not understand
writing, saying, Pray, read this; but he says, I do not understand
writing." They were drunken and stupid; not, however, merely because
they gave themselves up to sensual intoxication (יין, dependent upon
שׁכרוּ, ebrii vino), but because Jehovah had given them up to spiritual
confusion and self-destruction. All the punishments of God are inflicted
through the medium of His no less world-destroying than world-sustaining
Spirit, which, although not willing what is evil, does make the evil
called into existence by the creature the means of punishing evil.
Tardēmâh is used here to signify the powerless, passive state of utter
spiritual insensibility. This judgment had fallen upon the nation in all
its members, even upon the eyes and heads of the nation, i.e., the
prophets. Even they whose duty is was to see to the good of the nation,
and lead it, were blind leaders of the blind; their eyes were fast shut
(עצּם, the intensive form of the kal, [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md); Aram. עצּם; Talmud also עמּץ:
to shut the eyes, or press them close), and over their heads a cover was
drawn, as over sleepers in the night. Since the time of Koppe and
Eichhorn it has become a usual thing to regard את־הנּביאים and החזים as
a gloss, and indeed as a false one (compare [Isa
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013).md); but the reason assigned -
namely, that Isaiah's polemics are directed not against the prophets,
but against the stupid staring people - is utterly groundless (compare
[Isa 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md), and the polemics of his
contemporary Micah, e.g., [Isa 3:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005).md).
Moreover, the author of a gloss would have been more likely to interpret
ראשׁיכם by השּׂרים or הכּהנים (compare [Job
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024).md). And [Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md), [Isa
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#012.md) are also opposed to this
assumption of a gloss. For by those who understood what was written
(sēpher), it is evident that the prophets and rulers of the nation are
intended; and by those who did not understand it, the great mass of the
people. To both of them, "the vision of all," i.e., of all and
everything that God had shown to His true prophets, was by the judgment
of God completely sealed. Some of them might have an outward knowledge;
but the inward understanding of the revelation was sealed to them. Some
had not even this, but stared at the word of the prophet, just as a man
who cannot read stares at what is written. The chethib has הסּפר; the
keri ספר, though without any ground, since the article is merely
generic. Instead of נא־זה קרא, we should write זה קרא־נא in both cases,
as certain codices and old editions do.

[Isaiah 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 29:13</span></span>

This stupefaction was the self-inflicted punishment of the dead works
with which the people mocked God and deceived themselves. "The Lord hath
spoken: Because this people approaches me with its mouth, and honours me
with its lips, and keeps its heart far from me, and its reverence of me
has become a commandment learned from men: therefore, behold, I will
proceed wondrously with this people, wondrously and marvellously
strange; and the wisdom of its wise men is lost, and the understanding
of its intelligent men becomes invisible." Ever since the time of Asaph
(Ps 50, cf., [Psa 78:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#036).md), the
lamentation and condemnation of hypocritical ceremonial worship, without
living faith or any striving after holiness, had been a leading theme of
prophecy. Even in Isaiah's introductory address (chapter 1) this
complain was uttered quite in the tone of that of Asaph. In the time of
Hezekiah it was peculiarly called for, just as it was afterwards in that
of Josiah (as the book of Jeremiah shows). The people had been obliged
to consent to the abolition of the public worship of idols, but their
worship of Jehovah was hypocrisy. Sometimes it was conscious hypocrisy,
arising from the fear of man and favour of man; sometimes unconscious,
inasmuch as without any inward conversion, but simply with
work-righteousness, the people contented themselves with, and even
prided themselves upon, an outward fulfilment of the law ([Mic
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md); [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).md). Instead of נגּשׁ (lxx, Vulg.,
Syr., [Mat 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008.md); [Mar
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#006).md), we also meet with the reading
נגּשׂ, "because this people harasses itself as with tributary service;"
but the antithesis to richaq (lxx πόῤῥω ἀπέχει ) favours the former
reading niggash, accedit; and bephı̄v (with its moth) must be connected
with this, though in opposition to the accents. This self-alienation and
self-blinding, Jehovah would punish with a wondrously paradoxical
judgment, namely, the judgment of a hardening, which would so completely
empty and confuse, that even the appearance of wisdom and unity, which
the leaders of Israel still had, would completely disappear. יוסיף (as
in [Isa 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005).md) is not the third person
fut. hiphil here (so that it could be rendered, according to [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), "Behold, I am he who;" or more
strictly still, "Behold me, who;" which, however, would give a
prominence to the subject that would be out of place here), but the
part. kal for יוסף. That the language really allowed of such a
lengthening of the primary form qatĭl into qatı̄l, and especially in the
case of יוסיף, is evident from [Ecc
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#018.md) (see at [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005).md). In ופלא הפלא, פלא (cf., [Lam
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009).md) alternates with the gerundive
(see at [Isa 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#017).md): the fifth example
in this one address of the emphatic juxtaposition of words having a
similar sound and the same derivation (vid., [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md), [Isa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md), [Isa
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md), [Isa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 29:15</span></span>

Their hypocrisy, which was about to be so wonderfully punished according
to the universal law ([Psa 18:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026).md),
manifested itself in their self-willed and secret behaviour, which would
not inquire for Jehovah, nor suffer itself to be chastened by His word.
"Woe unto them that hide plans deep from Jehovah, and their doing occurs
in a dark place, and they say, Who saw us then, and who knew about us?
Oh for your perversity! It is to be regarded as potters' clay; that a
work could say to its maker, He has not made me; and an image to its
sculptor, He does not understand it!" Just as Ahaz had carefully kept
his appeal to Asshur for help secret from the prophet; so did they try,
as far as possible, to hide from the prophet the plan for an alliance
with Egypt. לסתּיר is a syncopated hiphil for להסתּיר, as in [Isa
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012.md); [Isa
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#008.md); [Isa
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#011.md). העמיק adds the adverbial
notion, according to our mode of expression (comp. [Joe
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020.md), and the opposite thought in [Joe
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#026); Ges. 142.md). To hide from Jehovah
is equivalent to hiding from the prophet of Jehovah, that they might not
have to listen to reproof from the word of Jehovah. We may see from [Isa
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md) how suspiciously they watched the
prophet in such circumstances as these. But Jehovah saw them in their
secrecy, and the prophet saw through the whole in the light of Jehovah.
הפכּכם is an exclamation, like תּפלצתּך in [Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016). They are perverse, or ('im.md) "is
it not so?" They think they can dispense with Jehovah, and yet they are
His creatures; they attribute cleverness to themselves, and practically
disown Jehovah, as if the pot should say to the potter who has turned
it, He does not understand it.

[Isaiah 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 29:17</span></span>

But the prophet's God, whose omniscience, creative glory, and perfect
wisdom they so basely mistook and ignored, would very shortly turn the
present state of the world upside down, and make Himself a congregation
out of the poor and wretched, whilst He would entirely destroy this
proud ungodly nation. "Is it not yet a very little, and Lebanon is
turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field esteemed as a
forest? And in that day the deaf hear scripture words, and the eyes of
the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness. And the joy of
the humble increases in Jehovah, and the poor among men will rejoice in
the Holy One of Israel. For tyrants are gone, and it is over with
scoffers; and all who think evil are rooted out, who condemn a man for a
word, and lay snares for him that is free-spoken in the gate, and
overthrow the righteous through shameful lies." The circumstances
themselves, as well as the sentence passed, will experience a change, in
complete contrast with the present state of things. This is what is
affirmed in [Isa 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md); probably a
proverb transposed into a more literary style. What is now forest
becomes ennobled into garden ground; and what is garden ground becomes
in general estimation a forest (לכרמל, ליער, although we should rather
expect ל, just as in [Isa 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015).md).
These emblems are explained in [Isa
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md). The people that are now blind
and deaf, so far as the word of Jehovah is concerned, are changed into a
people with open ears and seeing eyes. Scripture words, like those which
the prophet now holds before the people so unsuccessfully, are heard by
those who have been deaf. The unfettered sight of those who have been
blind pierces through the hitherto surrounding darkness. The heirs of
the new future thus transformed are the anâvı̄m ("meek") and the
'ebhyōnı̄m ("poor"). אדם (the antithesis of אנשׁהים, e.g., [Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013).md) heightens the representation of
lowliness; the combination is a superlative one, as in הצאן צעירי, [Jer
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md), and הצאן עניי in [Zac
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007.md) (cf., חיות פריץ in [Isa
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#009).md): needy men who present a glaring
contrast to, and stand out from, the general body of men. Such men will
obtain ever increasing joy in Jehovah (yâsaph as in [Isa
37:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#031).md). Such a people of God would
take the place of the oppressors (cf., [Isa
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012).md) and scoffers (cf., [Isa
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md), [Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022).md), and those who thought evil
(shâqad, invigilare, sedulo agere), i.e., the wretched planners, who
made a חטא of every one who did not enter into their plans (i.e., who
called him a chōtē'; cf., [Deu 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004.md);
[Ecc 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#005).md), and went to law with the
man who openly opposed them in the gate ([Amo
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md); yeqōshūn, possibly the perf.
kal, cf., [Jer 50:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024.md); according to the
syntax, however, it is the fut. kal of qūsh = yâqōsh: see at [Isa
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016); Ges. 44, Anm. 4.md), and thrust
away the righteous, i.e., forced him away from his just rights ([Isa
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#002).md), by tōhū, i.e., accusations and
pretences of the utmost worthlessness; for these would all have been
swept away. This is the true explanation of the last clause, as given in
the Targum, and not "into the desert and desolation," as Knobel and
Luzzatto suppose; for with Isaiah tōhū is the synonym for all such words
as signify nothingness, groundlessness, and fraud. The prophet no doubt
had in his mind, at the time that he uttered these words, the conduct of
the people towards himself and his fellow-prophets, and such as were
like-minded with them. The charge brought against him of being a
conspirator, or a traitor to his country, was a tōhū of this kind. All
these conspirators and persecutors Jehovah would clear entirely away.

[Isaiah 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 29:22</span></span>

Everything that was incorrigible would be given up to destruction; and
therefore the people of God, when it came out of the judgment, would
have nothing of the same kind to look for again. "Therefore thus saith
Jehovah of the house of Jacob, He who redeemed Abraham: Jacob shall not
henceforth be ashamed, nor shall his face turn pale any more. For when
he, when his children see the work of my hands in the midst of him, they
will sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shudder
before the God of Israel. And those who were of an erring spirit discern
understanding, and murmurers accept instruction." With אל (for which
Luzzatto, following Lowth, reads אל sda, "the God of the house of
Jacob") the theme is introduced to which the following utterance refers.
The end of Israel will correspond to the holy root of its origin. Just
as Abraham was separated from the human race that was sunk in
heathenism, to become the ancestor of a nation of Jehovah, so would a
remnant be separated from the great mass of Israel that was sunk in
apostasy from Jehovah; and this remnant would be the foundation of a
holy community well pleasing to God. And this would never be confounded
or become pale with shame again (on bōsh, see at [Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029); châvar is a poetical Aramaism.md);
for both sins and sinners that called forth the punishments of God,
which had put them to shame, would have been swept away (cf., [Zep
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011).md). In the presence of this
decisive work of punishment (ma‛ăseh as in [Isa
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021.md); [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md); [Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md), [Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019).md), which Jehovah would perform in
the heart of Israel, Israel itself would undergo a thorough change.
ילדיו is in apposition to the subject in בּראתו, "when he, namely his
children" (comp. [Job 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#003).md); and the
expression "his children" is intentionally chosen instead of "his sons"
(bânı̄m), to indicate that there would be a new generation, which would
become, in the face of the judicial self-manifestation of Jehovah, a
holy church, sanctifying Him, the Holy One of Israel. Yaqdı̄shū is
continued in vehiqdı̄shū: the prophet intentionally repeats this most
significant word, and he‛ĕrı̄ts is the parallel word to it, as in [Isa
8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md). The new church would indeed
not be a sinless one, or thoroughly perfect; but, according to [Isa
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#024.md), the previous self-hardening in
error would have been exchanged for a willing and living appropriation
of right understanding, and the former murmuring resistance to the
admonitions of Jehovah would have given place to a joyful and receptive
thirst for instruction. There is the same interchange of Jacob and
Israel here which we so frequently met with in chapters 40ff. And, in
fact, throughout this undisputedly genuine prophecy of Isaiah, we can
detect the language of chapters 40-66. Through the whole of the first
part, indeed, we may trace the gradual development of the thoughts and
forms which predominate there.
