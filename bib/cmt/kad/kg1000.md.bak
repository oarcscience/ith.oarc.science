The Books of Kings

Introduction

Contents- and Character- Origin and Sources- of the Books of the Kings.

The books of the Kings, which were but one book originally like the
books of Samuel, and which like the latter, were divided into two books
by the Alexandrian translators (see the Introduction to the books of
Samuel), contain, in accordance with their name (מלכים), the history of
the Israelitish theocracy under the kings, from the accession of Solomon
to the extinction of the monarchy on the overthrow of the kingdom of
Judah, when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Chaldaeans and the people
were carried away into exile in Babylon. they embrace a period of 455
years, from 1015 to 560 b.c., that is to say, to the reign of the
Babylonian king Evil-merodach. And as every kingdom culminates in its
king, and the government of the kings determines the fate of the
kingdom, the contents of the books before us, which are named after the
kings of Israel, consist for the most part of a history of those kings;
inasmuch as, whilst on the one hand the reigns of the several kings form
the historical and chronological framework for the description of the
historical development of the people and kingdom, on the other hand the
leading phases which the monarchy assumed furnish the basis of the three
periods, into which the history of this epoch and the contents of our
books are divided.

The first period (1015-975 b.c.) embraces the forty years of Solomon's
reign over the undivided kingdom of the twelve tribes of Israel, when
the Israelitish kingdom of God stood at the summit of its earthly power
and glory; though towards the end of this period it began to decline
inasmuch as the rebellion of Solomon against the Lord in the closing
years of his reign prepared the way for the rebellion of the ten tribes
against the house of David. - The second period commences with the
division of the one kingdom into the two kingdoms, Israel (or the ten
tribes) and Judah, and stretches over the whole period during which
these two kingdoms existed side by side, terminating with the
destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes by the Assyrians, i.e.,
from 975 to 722 b.c. - The third period embraces the still remaining
years of the continuance of the kingdom of Judah, until its eventual
dissolution by the Chaldaeans and the carrying away of the people into
exile in Babylon, viz., from 722 to 560 b.c.

The first part of our books (1 Kings 1-11) therefore contains a
description of the reign of Solomon, (a) in its commencement, viz., his
ascent of the throne and the consolidation of his power (1 Kings 1 and
2); (b) in the gradual development of the strength and glory of his
government, by his marriage, his sacrifice and prayer at Gibeon, his
judicial wisdom, and his court (1 Kings 3:1-5:14)-also by the building
of the temple and royal palace and the dedication of the temple (1 Kings
5:15-9:9), by the erection of his other edifices and the introduction of
navigation and commerce (1 Kings 9:10-28), by the spreading abroad of
the fame of his wisdom, and by the increase of his wealth (1 Kings 10);
and (c) in its eventual decline in consequence of the sin into which the
aged monarch fell through his polygamy and idolatry (1 Kings 11). The
second part opens with an account of the falling away of the ten tribes
from the royal family of David, and relates in a synchronistic narrative
the history of the two kingdoms in the three stages of their
development: viz., (a) the early enmity between the two, from Jeroboam
to Omri of Israel (1 Kings 12:1-16:28); (b) the establishment of
friendship and intermarriage between the two royal houses under Ahab and
his sons, down to the destruction of the two kings Joram of Israel and
Ahaziah of Judah by Jehu (1 Kings 16:29-2 Kings 10); (c) the renewal of
hostilities between the two kingdoms, from Jehu's ascent of the throne
in Israel and Athaliah's usurpation of the throne in Judah to the
overthrow of the kingdom of Israel in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign
in Judah (2 Kings 11-17). And, lastly, the third part contains the
history of the kingdom of Judah from Hezekiah to the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans, and carries it down to the thirty-seventh
year of the imprisonment of king Jehoiachin in exile (2 Kings 18-25).

Now, although the history of the kings, or the account of both the
duration and character of their reigns, and also of their various
enterprises, so far as they promoted or hindered the progress of the
kingdom of God, forms the principal substance of these books, they do
not consist of a mere chronicle of the deeds and fortunes of the several
kings, but describe at the same time the ministry of the prophets in the
two kingdoms, and that to some extent in so elaborate a manner, that
whilst some have discovered in this a peculiarly "prophetico-didactic
purpose" (Hvernick, De Wette, etc.), others regard it as an endeavour
"to set forth the history of the Israelitish and Jewish kings in its
relation to the demands, the doings, the proclamations, and the
predictions of the prophets, from Solomon to the Babylonian exile"
(Kern). But however unmistakable the prophetico-didactic character may
be, which the books of Kings have in common with the whole of the
historical writings of the Old Testament, a closer investigation of
their character will show that there is no ground for the assertion that
there is any prophetico-didactic purpose in the mode in which the
history is written. For the account of the ministry of the prophets is
introduced into the history of the kings as the spiritual leaven which
pervaded the Israelitish monarchy from the beginning to the end, and
stamped upon its development the character of the theocracy or divine
rule in Israel. Jehovah, as the invisible but yet real King of the
covenant nation, had created the peculiar instruments of His Spirit in
the prophets who maintained His law and right before the kings, standing
by their side to advise and direct, or to warn and punish, and, wherever
it was necessary, proving their utterances to be words of God by signs
and wonders which they did before the people. Thus the Lord directed the
prophet Samuel to anoint Saul and David princes over His people, and the
prophet Nathan to communicate to David the promise of the everlasting
endurance of his throne (2 Sam 7). But when at a later period David
sinned (2 Sam 11 and 24), it was the prophets Nathan and Gad who
threatened him with punishment from God, and on his confession of sin
and repentance announced the forgiveness and favour of God ([Sa2
12:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001.md); [Sa2
24:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#011).md). Through the medium of the
prophet Nathan, Solomon was also appointed the successor of David upon
the throne ([Sa2 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#025).md), and not only
anointed king, but installed in defiance of the machinations of Adonijah
(1 Kings 1). But since the monarchy was transmitted from Solomon in a
direct line through his descendants by virtue of the divine promise in 2
Sam 7, it is only in connection with important enterprises, or when the
kingdom is involved in difficulties, that we find the prophets coming
forward in after times to help or advise those kings who walked in the
ways of the Lord; whereas under the idolatrous and godless rulers they
offer, in the power of God, such energetic resistance to idolatry and to
everything evil and ungodly, that princes and people are compelled to
bow before them and succumb to their divine words. In this way the
prophets accompanied the monarchy in all its course from Solomon to the
Captivity as guardians of the rights of the God-King, and as
interpreters of His counsel and will. Under Solomon, indeed, there was
apparently a long period, during which prophecy fell into the
background; since the Lord Himself not only appeared to this king in a
dream at Gibeon shortly after he ascended the throne, but also appeared
to him a second time after the dedication of the temple, and promised
him the fulfilment of his prayers, and the glorification and eternal
continuance of his kingdom, on condition of his faithful observance of
the divine commands ([Kg1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md)., [Kg1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001)..md). But towards the end of his
reign it rose up again in all the more threatening attitude, against the
king who was then disposed to fall away from Jehovah. It was no doubt a
prophet who announced to him the separation of ten parts of his kingdom
([Kg1 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#011)..md)-possibly the same Ahijah
who promised Jeroboam the government over ten tribes ([Kg1
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#029)..md). But after the division of the
kingdom, when Jeroboam proceeded, in order to fortify his throne, to
make the political division into a religious one, and to this end
exalted the image-worship into the state religion, the prophets
continued to denounce this apostasy and proclaim to the sinful kings the
destruction of their dynasties. And when at a still later period Ahab
the son of Omri, and his wife Jezebel, endeavoured to make the
Phoenician worship of Baal and Asherah into the national religion in
Israel, Elijah the Tishbite, "the prophet as fire, whose words burned as
a torch" (Ecclus. 48:1), came forward with the irresistible power of God
and maintained a victorious conflict against the prophets and servants
of Baal, warding off the utter apostasy of the nation by uniting the
prophets into societies, in which the worship of God was maintained, and
the godly in Israel were supplied with a substitute for that legal
worship in the temple which was enjoyed by the godly in Judah. And in
the kingdom of Judah also where were never wanting prophets to announce
the judgments of the Lord to idolatrous kings, and to afford a vigorous
support to the pious and God-fearing rulers in their endeavours to
promote the religious life of the nation, and to exalt the public
worship of God in the temple. But since the kingdom of Judah possessed
the true sanctuary, with the legal worship and an influential body of
priests and Levites; and since, moreover, the monarchy of the house of
David was firmly established by divine promises resting upon that house,
and among the kings who sat upon the throne, from Rehoboam onwards,
there were many godly rulers who were distinguished for their lofty
virtues as governors; the labours of the prophets did not assume the
same prominent importance here as they did in the kingdom of the ten
bribes, where they had to fight against idolatry from the beginning to
the end.

This explains the fact that the ministry of the prophets assumes so
prominent a position in the books of the Kings, whereas the history of
the kings appears sometimes to fall into the background in comparison.
Nevertheless the historical development of the monarchy, or, to express
it more correctly, of the kingdom of God under the kings, forms the true
subject-matter of our books. It was not a prophetico-didactic purpose,
but the prophetico-historical point of view, which prevailed throughout
the whole work, and determined the reception as well as the treatment of
the historical materials. The progressive development of the kingdom was
predicted and described by the Lord Himself in the promise communicated
to David by the prophet Nathan: "And when thy days shall be fulfilled,
and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after
thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his
kingdom. He shall build a house for my name; and I will stablish the
throne of his kingdom for ever. I will be his Father, and he shall be my
son, that if he go astray, I may chasten him with man's rod, and with
stripes of the children of men; but my mercy will not depart from him,
as I caused it to depart from Saul, whom I put away before thee. And thy
house and thy kingdom shall be for ever before thee, thy throne will be
established for ever" ([Sa2 7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012).md).
This thoroughly glorious promise forms the red thread which runs through
the history of the kings from Solomon to the Babylonian captivity, and
constitutes the leading idea in the record of this history in our books.
The author's intention is to show in the history of the kings how the
Lord fulfilled this gracious word, how He first of all chastised the
seed of David for its transgressions, and then cast it off, though not
for ever. To this end he shows in the history of Solomon, how,
notwithstanding the usurpation of the throne attempted by Adonijah,
Solomon received the whole of his father's kingdom, as the seed of David
promised by the Lord, and established his power; how the Lord at the
very beginning of his reign renewed to him at Gibeon the promise made to
his father on the condition of his faithful observance of His law, and
in answer to his prayer gave him not only a wise and understanding
heart, but also riches and honour, so that his equal was not to be found
among all the kings of the earth (1 Kings 1:1-5:14); how Solomon then
carried out the work of building the temple, entrusted to him by his
father according to the will of the Lord; and how, after it was
finished, the Lord again assured him of the fulfilment of that promise
(1 Kings 5:15-9:9); and, lastly, how Solomon, having attained to the
highest earthly glory, through the completion of the rest of his
buildings, through the great renown of his wisdom, which had reached to
nations afar off, and through his great riches, acquired partly by
marine commerce and trade, and partly from tributes and presents, forgot
his God, who had bestowed this glory upon him, and in his old age was
led astray into unfaithfulness towards the Lord through his numerous
foreign wives, and had at last to listen to this sentence from God:
"Because thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have
commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and give it to
thy servant: notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy
father's said; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. Howbeit I
will not rend away all thy kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son
for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have
chosen" (1 Kings 9:10-11:13). Thus, because God had promised to the seed
of David the eternal possession of the throne ([Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)..md), one portion of the kingdom was
to be left to the son of Solomon, with the chosen city of Jerusalem, and
his servant (Jeroboam, [Kg1 11:26-40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026).md)
was only to obtain dominion over ten tribes. The historical realization
of this prophecy is shown in the history of the two divided kingdoms.

In the synchronistic account of these kingdoms, according to the
principle already adopted in the book of Genesis, of disposing of the
subordinate lines of the patriarchs before proceeding with the main
line, the reigns of the kings of Israel are described before those of
the contemporaneous kings of Judah, and to some extent in a more
elaborate manner. The reason of this, however, is, that the history of
the kingdom of Israel, in which one dynasty overthrew another, whilst
all the rulers walked in the sin of Jeroboam, and Ahab even added the
worship of Baal to that sin, supplied the author with more materials for
the execution of his plan than that of the kingdom of Judah, which had a
much quieter development under the rule of the house of David, and of
which, therefore, there was less to relate. Apart from this, all the
events of the kingdom of Judah which are of any importance in relation
to the progress of the kingdom of God, are just as elaborately described
as those connected with the kingdom of Israel; and the author does equal
justice to both kingdoms, showing how the Lord manifested Himself
equally to both, and bore with them with divine long-suffering and
grace. But the proof of this necessarily assumed different forms,
according to the different attitudes which they assumed towards the
Lord. Jeroboam, the founder of the kingdom of Israel, when told that he
would be king over the ten tribes, had received the promise that Jehovah
would be with him, and build him a lasting house as He built for David,
and give Israel to him, on condition that he would walk in the ways of
God ([Kg1 11:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#037).md). This implied that
his descendants would rule over Israel (of the ten tribes) so long as
this kingdom should stand; for it was not to last for ever, but the
separation would come to an end, and therefore he is not promised the
everlasting continuance of his kingdom (see at [Kg1
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038).md). But Jeroboam did not fulfil
this condition, nor did any of the rulers of Israel who succeeded him.
Nevertheless the Lord had patience with the kings and tribes who were
unfaithful to His law, and not only warned them continually by His
prophets, and chastised them by threats of punishment and by the
fulfilment of those threats upon the kings and all the people, but
repeatedly manifested His favour towards them for the sake of His
covenant with Abraham ([Kg2 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#023).md), to
lead them to repentance-until the time of grace had expired, when the
sinful kingdom fell and the ten tribes were carried away to Media and
Assyria. - In the kingdom of David, on the contrary, the succession to
the throne was promised to the house of David for all time: therefore,
although the Lord caused those who were rebellious to be chastised by
hostile nations, yet, for His servant David's sake, He left a light
shining to the royal house, since He did not punish the kings who were
addicted to idolatry with the extermination of their family ([Kg1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004.md); [Kg2
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#019).md); and even when the wicked
Athaliah destroyed all the royal seed, He caused Joash, the infant son
of Ahaziah, to be saved and raised to the throne of his fathers (2 Kings
11). Consequently this kingdom was able to survive that of the ten
tribes for an entire period, just because it possessed a firm political
basis in the uninterrupted succession of the Davidic house, as it also
possessed a spiritual basis of no less firmness in the temple which the
Lord had sanctified as the place where His name was revealed. After it
had been brought to the verge of destruction by the godless Ahaz, it
received in Hezekiah a king who did what was right in the eyes of
Jehovah, as his father David had done, and in the severe oppression
which he suffered at the hands of the powerful army of the proud
Sennacherib, took refuge in the Lord, who protected and saved Jerusalem,
"for His own and His servant David's sake," at the prayer of the pious
king of Jerusalem ([Kg2 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#034.md); [Kg2
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#006).md). But when at length, throughout
the long reign of Manasseh the idolater, apostasy and moral corruption
prevailed to such an extent in Judah also, that even the pious Josiah,
with the reformation of religion which he carried out with the greatest
zeal, could only put down the outward worship of idols, and was unable
to effect any thorough conversion of the people to the Lord their God,
and the Lord as the Holy One of Israel was obliged to declare His
purpose of rejecting Judah from before His face on account of the sins
of Manasseh, and to cause that purpose to be executed by Nebuchadnezzar
([Kg2 23:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026.md); [Kg2
24:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#003).md); Jehoiachin was led away
captive to Babylon, and under Zedekiah the kingdom was destroyed with
the burning of Jerusalem and the temple. Yet the Lord did not suffer the
light to be altogether extinguished to His servant David; but when
Jehoiachin had pined in captivity at Babylon for thirty-seven years,
expiating his own and his fathers' sins, he was liberated from his
captivity by Nebuchadnezzar's son, and raised to honour once more ([Kg2
25:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027).md). - The account of this
joyful change in the condition of Jehoiachin, with which the books of
the Kings close, forms so essential a part of their author's plan, that
without this information the true conclusion to his work would be
altogether wanting. For this event shed upon the dark night of the
captivity the first ray of a better future, which was to dawn upon the
seed of David, and with it upon the whole nation in its eventual
redemption from Babylon, and was also a pledge of the certain fulfilment
of the promise that the Lord would not for ever withdraw His favour from
the seed of David.

(Note: Sthelin makes the following remark in his Einleitung (p.122):
"The books of the Kings form an antithesis to the history of David. As
the latter shows how obedience to God and to the utterances of His
prophets is rewarded, and how, even when Jehovah is obliged to punish,
He makes known His grace again in answer to repentance; so do the books
of the Kings, which relate the overthrow of both the Hebrew states,
teach, through the history of these two kingdoms, how glorious promises
are thrown back and dynasties fall in consequence of the conduct of
individual men (compare [Kg1 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038.md)
with [Kg1 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010.md), and still more with
[Kg2 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010.md). and [Kg2
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#027).md). The sins of one man like
Manasseh are sufficient to neutralize all the promises that have been
given to the house of David." There is no need to refute this erroneous
statement, since it only rests upon a misinterpretation of [Kg2
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010.md)., and completely misses the idea
which runs through both books of the Kings; and, moreover, there is no
contradiction between the manifestation of divine mercy towards penitent
sinners and the punishment of men according to their deeds.)

Thus the books of the Kings bring down the history of the Old Testament
kingdom of God, according to the divine plan of the kingdom indicated in
2 Sam 7, from the close of David's reign to the captivity; and the fact
that in [Kg1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md) they are formally
attached to the books of Samuel is an indication that they are a
continuation of those books. Nevertheless there is no doubt that they
formed from the very first a separate work, the independence and
internal unity of which are apparent from the uniformity of the
treatment of the history as well as from the unity of the language. From
beginning to end the author quotes from his original sources, for the
most part with certain standing formulas; in all important events he
gives the chronology carefully ([Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md), [Kg1
6:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#037.md); [Kg1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md); [Kg1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010.md); [Kg1
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#042.md); [Kg1
14:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#020.md), [Kg1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025.md); [Kg1
15:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001.md), [Kg1
15:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009), etc..md); he judges the conduct
of the kings throughout according to the standard of the law of Moses
([Kg1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003.md); [Kg1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014.md); [Kg2
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#031.md); [Kg2
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012.md); [Kg2
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#006.md); [Kg2
17:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#037.md); [Kg2
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#006.md); [Kg2
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#008.md); [Kg2
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008.md)., [Kg2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003.md), [Kg2
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#021), etc..md); and he nearly always
employs the same expressions when describing the commencement, the
character, and the close of each reign, as well as the death and burial
of the kings (compare [Kg1 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#043.md); [Kg1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#020.md), [Kg1

8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#024.md); [Kg2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#009.md); [Kg2
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#029.md); and for the characteristics of
the several kings of Judah, [Kg1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003.md),
[Kg1 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#011.md); [Kg1
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#043.md); [Kg2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#003.md); [Kg2
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#003.md); [Kg2
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#003.md), etc.; and for those of the kings
of Israel, [Kg1 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#008.md); [Kg1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#026.md), [Kg1
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#034.md); [Kg1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#019.md), [Kg1
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#026.md), [Kg1
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#030.md); [Kg1

13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#002.md), [Kg2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#011), etc..md). And so, again, the
language of the books remains uniform in every part of the work, if we
except certain variations occasioned by the differences in the sources
employed; since we find throughout isolated expressions and forms of a
later date, and words traceable to the Assyrian and Chaldaean epoch,
such as כּר for חמר in [Kg1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011.md);

occur in the earlier historical books. - The books of the Kings are
essentially distinguished from the books of Samuel through these
characteristic peculiarities; but not so much through the quotations
which are so prominent in the historical narrative, for these are common
to all the historical books of the Old Testament, and are only more
conspicuous in these books, especially in the history of the kings of
the two kingdoms, because in the case of all the kings, even of those in
relation to whom there was nothing to record of any importance to the
kingdom of God except the length and general characteristics of their
reign, there are notices of the writings which contain further
information concerning their reigns. - The unity of authorship is
therefore generally admitted, since, as De Wette himself acknowledges,
"you cannot anywhere clearly detect the interpolation or combination of
different accounts." The direct and indirect contradictions, however,
which Thenius imagines that he has discovered, prove to be utterly
fallacious on a closer inspection of the passages cited as proofs, and
could only have been obtained through misinterpretations occasioned by
erroneous assumptions. (See, on the other hand, my Lehrbuch der
Einleitung in das A. T. p. 184ff.)

All that can be determined with certainty in relation to the origin of
the books of Kings is, that they were composed in the second half of the
Babylonian captivity, and before its close, since they bring the history
down to that time, and yet contain no allusion to the deliverance of the
people out of Babylon. The author was a prophet living in the Babylonian
exile, though not the prophet Jeremiah, as the earlier theologians down
to Hvernick have assumed from the notice in the Talmud (Baba bathra, f.
15, 1): Jeremias scripsit librum suum et librum Regum et Threnos. For
even apart from the fact that Jeremiah ended his days in Egypt, he could
hardly have survived the last event recorded in our books, namely, the
liberation of Jehoiachin from prison, and his exaltation to royal
honours by Evil-merodach. For inasmuch as this event occurred sixty-six
years after his call to be a prophet, in the thirteenth year of Josiah,
he would have been eighty-six years old in the thirty-seventh year after
Jehoiachin had been carried away into exile, even if he had commenced
his prophetic career when only a young man of twenty years of age. Now,
even if he had reached this great age, he would surely not have composed
our books at a later period still. Moreover, all that has been adduced
in support of this is seen to be inconclusive on closer inspection. The
similarity in the linguistic character of our books and that of the
writings of Jeremiah, the sombre view of history which is common to the
two, the preference apparent in both for phrases taken from the
Pentateuch, and the allusions to earlier prophecies-all these
peculiarities may be explained, so far as they really exist, partly from
the fact that they were written in the same age, since all the writers
of the time of the captivity and afterwards cling very closely to the
Pentateuch and frequently refer to the law of Moses, and partly also
from the circumstance that, whilst Jeremiah was well acquainted with the
original sources of our books, viz., the annals of the kingdom of Judah,
the author of our books was also well acquainted with the prophecies of
Jeremiah. But the relation between [Kg2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md). and Jer is not of such a
nature, that these two accounts of the destruction of Jerusalem and the
carrying away of the remnant of the people could have emanated from the
hand of Jeremiah; on the contrary, a closer inspection clearly shows
that they are extracts from a more elaborate description of this
catastrophe (see at [Kg2 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018)..md).

As sources from which the author has obtained his accounts, there are
mentioned, for the history of Solomon, a שּׁלמה דּברי ספר, or book of
the acts (affairs) of Solomon ([Kg1
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041).md); for the history of the kings
of Judah, יהוּדה למלכי הימים דּברי ספר, book of the daily occurrences of
the kings of Judah ([Kg1 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#029.md); [Kg1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#007.md), [Kg1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023.md); [Kg1
22:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#046.md); [Kg2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#023.md); [Kg2
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#020), etc..md); and for that of the
kings of Israel, ישׂראל למלכי הימים דּברי ספר, book of the daily
occurrences of the kings of Israel ([Kg1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019.md); [Kg1
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#031.md); [Kg1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#005.md), [Kg1
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#014.md), [Kg1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#020.md), [Kg1
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#027.md); [Kg1
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#039.md); [Kg2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#018).md). These are quoted as writings in
which more is written concerning the life, the deeds, and the particular
undertakings, buildings and so forth, of the several kings. The two
last-named works were evidently general annals of the kingdoms: not,
indeed, the national archives of the two kingdoms, or official records
made by the מזכּירים of the reigns and acts of the kings, as Jahn,
Movers, Sthelin, and others suppose; but annals composed by prophets,
and compiled partly from the public year-books of the kingdom or the
national archives, and partly from prophetic monographs and collections
of prophecies, which reached in the kingdom of Israel down to the time
of Pekah ([Kg2 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#031).md), and in that of
Judah to the time of Jehoiakim ([Kg2
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#005).md). Moreover, they were not written
successively by different prophets, who followed one another, and so
carried on the work in uninterrupted succession from the rise of the two
kingdoms to the death of the two kings mentioned; but they had been
worked out into a "Book of the history of the times of the Kings" for
each of the two kingdoms, a short time before the overthrow of the
kingdom of Judah, by collecting together the most important things that
had been written both concerning the reigns of the several kings by
annalists and other historians who were contemporaneous with the events,
and also concerning the labours of the prophets, which were deeply
interwoven with the course of public affairs, whether composed by
themselves or by their contemporaries. And in this finished form they
lay before the author of our work. This view of the annals of the
kingdoms of Judah and Israel follows unquestionably from the agreement
which exists between our books of the Kings and the second book of the
Chronicles, in the accounts common to both, and which can only be
explained from the fact that they were drawn from one and the same
source. But in the Chronicles there are different writings of individual
prophets quoted, beside the day-books of the kings of Judah and Israel;
and it is expressly stated in relation to some of them that they were
received into the annals of the kings (compare [Ch2
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034.md) and [Ch2
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032.md), and the Introduction to the
books of the Chronicles). Moreover, there are no historical traces of
public annalists to be found in the kingdom of the ten tribes, and their
existence is by no means probable, on account of the constant change of
dynasties. The fact, however, that the frequently recurring formula "to
this day" ([Kg1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#013.md); [Kg1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012.md); [Kg2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#022.md); [Kg2
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#027.md); [Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md); [Kg2
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006.md); [Kg2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023.md), [Kg2
17:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#034.md), [Kg2
17:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#041.md); [Kg2
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#017.md); [Kg2
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#015).md) never refers to the time of the
captivity, except in the passages enclosed in brackets, but always to
the time of the existing kingdom of Judah, and that it cannot therefore
have emanated from the author of our books of the Kings, but can only
have been taken from the sources employed, is a proof that these annals
of the kingdom were composed towards the close of the kingdom of Judah;
and this is placed beyond all doubt, by the fact that this formula is
also found in many passages of the books of the Chronicles (compare [Kg1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008.md) with [Ch2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#009.md); [Kg1
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#021.md) with [Ch2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#008.md); [Kg1
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#019.md) with [Ch2
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#019.md); and [Kg2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022.md) with [Ch2
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#010).md). - In a similar manner to this
must we explain the origin of the שּׁלמה דּברי ספר, since three
prophetic writings are quoted in [Ch1
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029.md) in connection with Solomon's
reign, and their account agrees in all essential points with the account
in the books of the Kings. Nevertheless this "history of Solomon" never
formed a component part of the annals of the two kingdoms, and was
certainly written much earlier. - The assumption that there were other
sources still, is not only sustained by no historical evidence, but has
no certain support in the character or contents of the writings before
us. If the annals quoted were works composed by prophets, the elaborate
accounts of the working of the prophets Elijah and Elisha might also
have been included in them. - Again, in the constant allusion to these
annals we have a sure pledge of the historical fidelity of the accounts
that have been taken from them. If in his work the author followed
writings which were composed by prophets, and also referred his readers
to these writings, which were known and accessible to his
contemporaries, for further information, he must have been conscious of
the faithful and conscientious employment of them. And this natural
conclusion is in harmony with the contents of our books. The life and
actions of the kings are judged with unfettered candour and
impartiality, according to the standard of the law of God; and there is
no more concealment of the idolatry to which the highly renowned Solomon
was led astray by his foreign wives, than of that which was right in the
eyes of God, when performed by the kings of the ten tribes, which had
fallen away from the house of David. Even in the case of the greatest
prophet of all, namely Elijah, the weakness of his faith in being afraid
of the vain threats of the wicked Jezebel is related just as openly as
his courageous resistance, in the strength of the Lord, to Ahab and the
prophets of Baal. - Compare my Einleitung in das Alte Test. 56-60, where
adverse views are examined and the commentaries are also noticed.

The Book of 1 Kings

I. History Of Solomon's Reign - 1 Kings 1-11.

David had not only established the monarchy upon a firm basis, but had
also exalted the Old Testament kingdom of God to such a height of power,
that all the kingdoms round about wee obliged to bow before it. This
kingdom was transmitted by divine appointment to his son Solomon, in
whose reign Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the
sea-shore, and dwelt in security, every man under his vine and under his
fig-tree ([Kg1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020.md); [Kg1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005).md). The history of this reign
commences with the account of the manner in which Solomon had received
the kingdom from his father, and had established his own rule by the
fulfilment of his last will and by strict righteousness (1 Kings 1 and
2). Then follows in 1 Kings 3-10 the description of the glory of his
kingdom, how the Lord, in answer to his prayer at Gibeon, not only gave
him an understanding heart to judge his people, but also wisdom, riches,
and honour, so that his equal was not to be found among the kings of the
earth; and through his wise rule, more especially through the erection
of the house of Jehovah and of a splendid royal palace, he developed the
glory of the kingdom of God to such an extent that his fame penetrated
to remote nations. The conclusion, in 1 Kings 11, consists of the
account of Solomon's sin in his old age, viz., his falling into
idolatry, whereby he brought about the decay of the kingdom, which
manifested itself during the closing years of his reign in the rising up
of opponents, and at his death in the falling away of ten tribes from
his son Rehoboam. But notwithstanding this speedy decay, the glory of
Solomon's kingdom is elaborately depicted on account of the typical
significance which it possessed in relation to the kingdom of God. Just
as, for example, the successful wars of David with all the enemies of
Israel were a prelude to the eventual victory of the kingdom of God over
all the kingdoms of this world; so was the peaceful rule of Solomon to
shadow forth the glory and blessedness which awaited the people of God,
after a period of strife and conflict, under the rule of Shiloh the
Prince of peace, whom Jacob saw in spirit, and who would increase
government and peace without end upon the throne of David and in his
kingdom ([Isa 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md); [Psa
72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001).md).
