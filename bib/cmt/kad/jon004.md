### [Jonah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md)

[Jonah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jon 4:1</span></span>

Jonah, provoked at the sparing of Nineveh, prayed in his displeasure to
Jehovah to take his soul from him, as his proclamation had not been
fulfilled ([Jon 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001).md). ויּרע אל י, it
was evil for Jonah, i.e., it vexed, irritated him, not merely it
displeased him, for which ירע בּעיניו is generally used. The
construction with אל resembles that with ל in [Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010.md); [Neh
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#008.md). רעה גדולה, "a great evil,"
serves simply to strengthen the idea of ירע. The great vexation grew
even to anger (יחר לו; cf. [Gen 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#002.md),
etc.). The fact that the predicted destruction of Nineveh had not taken
place excited his discontent and wrath. And he tried to quarrel with
God, by praying to Jehovah.

(Note: Calvin observes upon this: "He prayed in a tumult, as if
reproving God. We must necessarily recognise a certain amount of piety
in this prayer of Jonah, and at the same time many faults. There was so
far piety in it, that he directed his complaints to God. For hypocrites,
even when they address God, are nevertheless hostile to Him. But Jonah,
when he complains, although he does not keep within proper bounds, but
is carried away by a blind and vicious impulse, is nevertheless prepared
to submit himself to God, as we shall presently see. This is the reason
why he is said to have prayed.")

"Alas (אנּא as in [Jon 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#014).md), Jehovah,
was not this my word (i.e., did I not say so to myself) when I was still
in my land (in Palestine)?" What his word or his thought then was, he
does not say; but it is evident from what follows: viz., that Jehovah
would not destroy Nineveh, if its inhabitants repented. ‛Al-kēn,
therefore, sc. because this was my saying. קדּמתּי, προέφθασα, I
prevented to flee to Tarshish, i.e., I endeavoured, by a flight to
Tarshish, to prevent, sc. what has now taken place, namely, that Thou
dost not fulfil Thy word concerning Nineveh, because I know that thou
art a God gracious and merciful, etc. (compare [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md) and [Exo
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014.md), as in [Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013).md). The prayer which follows, "Take
my life from me," calls to mind the similar prayer of Elijah in [Kg1
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md); but the motive assigned is a
different one. Whilst Elijah adds, "for I am not better than my
fathers," Jonah adds, "for death is better to me than life." This
difference must be distinctly noticed, as it brings out the difference
in the state of mind of the two prophets. In the inward conflict that
had come upon Elijah he wished for death, because he did not see the
expected result of his zeal for the Lord of Sabaoth; in other words, it
was from spiritual despair, caused by the apparent failure of his
labours. Jonah, on the other hand, did not wish to live any longer,
because God had not carried out His threat against Nineveh. His
weariness of life arose, not like Elijah's from stormy zeal for the
honour of God and His kingdom, but from vexation at the non-fulfilment
of his prophecy. This vexation was not occasioned, however, by offended
dignity, or by anxiety or fear lest men should regard him as a liar or
babbler (ψευδοεπής τε καὶ βωμολόχος, Cyr. Al.; ψεύστης, Theodoret; vanus
et mendax, Calvin and others); nor was he angry, as Calvin supposes,
because he associated his office with the honour of God, and was
unwilling that the name of God should be exposed to the scoffing of the
heathen, quasi de nihilo terreret, or "because he saw that it would
furnish material for impious blasphemies if God changed His purpose, or
if He did not abide by His word;" but, as Luther observes (in his
remarks on Jonah's flight), "he was hostile to the city of Nineveh, and
still held a Jewish and carnal view of God" (for the further development
of this view, see the remarks above, at p. 265). That this was really
Jonah's view, is proved by Luther from the fact that God reproves his
displeasure and anger in these words, "Should I not spare Nineveh?" etc.
([Jon 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011).md). "He hereby implies that
Jonah was displeased at the fact that God had spared the city, and was
angry because He had not destroyed it as he had preached, and would
gladly have seen." Offended vanity or unintelligent zeal for the honour
of God would have been reproved by God in different terms from those in
which Jonah was actually reproved, according to the next verse ([Jon
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#004).md), where Jehovah asks the prophet,
"Is thine anger justly kindled?" היטב is adverbial, as in [Deu
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021.md); [Deu
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#015.md), etc., bene, probe, recte,
δικαίως (Symm.).

Then Jonah went out of Nineveh, sat down on the east of the city, where
Nineveh was bounded by the mountains, from which he could overlook the
city, made himself a hut there, and sat under it in the shade, till he
saw what would become of the city, i.e., what fate would befal it ([Jon
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005).md). This verse is regarded by many
commentators as a supplementary remark, ויּצא, with the verbs which
follow, being rendered in the pluperfect: "Jonah had gone out of the
city," etc. We grant that this is grammatically admissible, but it
cannot be shown to be necessary, and is indeed highly improbable. If,
for instance, Jonah went out of Nineveh before the expiration of the
forty days, to wait for the fulfilment of his prophecy, in a hut to the
east of the city, he could not have been angry at its non-fulfilment
before the time arrived, nor could God have reproved him for his anger
before that time. The divine correction of the dissatisfied prophet,
which is related in [Jon 4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#006.md),
cannot have taken place till the forty days had expired. But this
correction is so closely connected with Jonah's departure from the city
and settlement to the east of it, to wait for the final decision as to
its fate ([Jon 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005).md), that we cannot
possibly separate it, so as to take the verbs in [Jon
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005.md) as pluperfects, or those in [Jon
4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#006.md) as historical imperfects. There
is no valid ground for so forced an assumption as this. As the
expression ויּרע אל יונה in [Jon 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md),
which is appended to ולא עשׁה in [Jon
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010.md), shows that Jonah did not become
irritated and angry till after God had failed to carry out His threat
concerning Nineveh, and that it was then that he poured out his
discontent in a reproachful prayer to God ([Jon
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002).md), there is nothing whatever to
force us to the assumption that Jonah had left Nineveh before the
fortieth day.

(Note: There is no hold in the narrative for Marck's conjecture, that
God had already communicated to him His resolution not to destroy
Nineveh, because of the repentance of the people, and that this was the
reason for his anger.)

Jonah had no reason to be afraid of perishing with the city. If he had
faith, which we cannot deny, he could rely upon it that God would not
order him, His own servant, to perish with the ungodly, but when the
proper time arrived, would direct him to leave the city. But when forty
days elapsed, and nothing occurred to indicate the immediate or speedy
fall of the city, and he was reproved by God for his anger on that
account in these words, "Art thou rightly or justly angry?" the answer
from God determined him to leave the city and wait outside, in front of
it, to see what fate would befal it. For since this answer still left it
open, as a possible thing, that the judgment might burst upon the city,
Jonah interpreted it in harmony with his own inclination, as signifying
that the judgment was only postponed, not removed, and therefore
resolved to wait in a hut outside the city, and watch for the issue of
the whole affair.

(Note: Theod. Mops. correctly observes, that "when he reflected upon the
greatness of the threat, he imagined that something might possibly occur
after all." And Calvin better still, that "although forty days had
passed, Jonah stood as if fastened to the spot, because he could not yet
believe that what he had proclaimed according to the command of God
would fail to be effected .... This was the cause, therefore, of his
still remaining, viz., because he thought, that although the punishment
from God had been suspended, yet his preaching had surely not been in
vain, but the destruction of the city would take place. This was the
reason for his waiting on after the time fixed, as though the result
were still doubtful.")

But his hope was disappointed, and his remaining there became, quite
contrary to his intention, an occasion for completing his correction.

[Jonah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jon 4:6</span></span>

Jehovah-God appointed a Qiqayon, which grew up over Jonah, to give him
shade over his head, "to deliver him from his evil." The Qiqayon, which
Luther renders gourd (Krbiss) after the lxx, but describes in his
commentary on the book of Jonah as the vitis alba, is, according to
Jerome, the shrub called Elkeroa in Syriac, a very common shrub in
Palestine, which grows in sandy places, having broad leaves that throw a
pleasant shadow, and which shoots up to a considerable height in a very
few days.

(Note: Jerome describes it thus: "A kind of bush or shrub, having broad
leaves like vine leaves, casting a very dense shadow, and sustaining
itself by its trunk, which grows very abundantly in Palestine, and
chiefly in sandy places. If placed in sowing land, being quickly
nourished, it grows up into a tree, and in a very few days what you saw
as nothing but a herb you now look upon as a small tree.")

The Elkeroa, however, which Niebuhr also saw at Basra (Beschrieb. v.
Arab. p. 148) and describes in a similar manner, is the ricinus or palma
Christi, the miraculous tree; and, according to Kimchi and the
Talmudists, it was the Kik or Kiki of the Egyptians, from which an oil
was obtained according to Herodotus (ii. 94) and Pliny (Hits. n. xv. 7),
as was the case according to Niebuhr with the Elkeroa. Its rapid growth
is also mentioned by Pliny, who calls it ricinus (see Ges. thes. p.
1214). God caused this shrub to grow up with miraculous rapidity, to
such a height that it cast a shade upon Jonah's head, to procure him
deliverance (להצּיל לו) "from his evil," i.e., not from the burning heat
of the sun (ab aestu solis), from which he suffered in the hut which he
had run up so hastily with twigs, but from his displeasure or vexation,
the evil from which he suffered according to [Jon
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#003) (Rosenmller, Hitzig.md). The
variation in the names of the Deity in [Jon
4:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#006.md) is worthy of notice. The
creation of the miraculous tree to give shade to Jonah is ascribed to
Jehovah-Elohim in [Jon 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#006.md). This
composite name, which occurs very rarely except in Genesis 2 and 3 (see
comm. on [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004).md), is chosen here to
help the transition from Jehovah in [Jon
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#004.md) to Elohim in [Jon
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#007.md), [Jon
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008.md). Jehovah, who replies to the
prophet concerning his discontented complaint ([Jon
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#004).md) as Elohim, i.e., as the divine
creative power, causes the miraculous tree to spring up, to heal Jonah
of his chagrin. And to the same end h-Elohim, i.e., the personal God,
prepares the worm which punctures the miraculous tree and causes it to
wither away ([Jon 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#007).md); and this is
also helped by the east wind appointed by Elohim, i.e., the Deity ruling
over nature ([Jon 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008).md), to bring about
the correction of the prophet, who was murmuring against God. Hence the
different names of God are employed with thoughtful deliberation. Jonah
rejoiced exceedingly at the miraculous growth of the shrub which
provided for him, because he probably saw therein a sign of the goodness
of God and of the divine approval of his intention to wait for the
destruction of Nineveh. But this joy was not to last long.

[Jonah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 4:8</span></span>

On the rising of the dawn of the very next day, God appointed a worm,
which punctured the miraculous tree so that it withered away; and when
the sun arose He also appointed a sultry east wind, and the sun smote
upon Jonah's head, so that he fainted away. Chărı̄shıth, from chârash, to
be silent or quiet, is to be taken when used of the wind in the sense of
sultry, as in the Chaldee (lxx συγκαίων). The meaning ventus, qualis
flat tempore arandi, derived from chârish, the ploughing (Abulw.), or
autumnal east wind (Hitzig), is far less suitable. When Jonah fainted
away in consequence of the sun-stroke (for hith‛allēph, see at [Amo
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#013).md), he wished himself dead, since
death was better for him than life (see [Jon
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#003).md). ישׁאל את־נפשׁו למוּת, as in [Kg1
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md), "he wished that his soul might
die," a kind of accusative with the infinitive (cf. Ewald, 336, b). But
God answered, as in [Jon 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#004.md), by
asking whether he was justly angry. Instead of Jehovah ([Jon
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#004).md) we have Elohim mentioned here,
and Jehovah is not introduced as speaking till [Jon
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#009.md). We have here an intimation, that
just as Jonah's wish to die was simply an expression of the feelings of
his mind, so the admonitory word of God was simply a divine voice within
him setting itself against his murmuring. It was not till he had
persisted in his ill-will, even after this divine admonition within,
that Jehovah pointed out to him how wrong his murmuring was. Jehovah's
speaking in [Jon 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#009.md) is a
manifestation of the divine will by supernatural inspiration. Jehovah
directs Jonah's attention to the contradiction into which he has fallen,
by feeling compassion for the withering of the miraculous tree, and at
the same time murmuring because God has had compassion upon Nineveh with
its many thousands of living beings, and has spared the city for the
sake of these souls, many of whom have no idea whatever of right or
wrong. Chastâ: "Thou hast pitied the Qiqayon, at which thou hast not
laboured, and which thou hast not caused to grow; for (שׁבּן = אשׁר בּן)
son of a night" - i.e., in a night, or over night - "has it grown, and
over night perished, and I should not pity Nineveh?" ואני is a question;
but this is only indicated by the tone. If Jonah feels pity for the
withering of a small shrub, which he neither planted nor tended, nor
caused to grow, shall God not have pity with much greater right upon the
creatures whom He has created and has hitherto sustained, and spare the
great city Nineveh, in which more than 120,000 are living, who cannot
distinguish their right hand from the left, and also much cattle? Not to
be able to distinguish between the right hand and the left is a sign of
mental infancy. This is not to be restricted, however, to the very
earliest years, say the first three, but must be extended to the age of
seven years, in which children first learn to distinguish with certainty
between right and left, since, according to M. v. Niebuhr (p. 278), "the
end of the seventh year is a very common division of age (it is met
with, for example, even among the Persians), and we may regard it as
certain that it would be adopted by the Hebrews, on account of the
importance they attached to the number seven." A hundred and twenty
thousand children under seven years of age would give a population of
six hundred thousand, since, according to Niebuhr, the number of
children of the age mentioned is one-fifth the whole population, and
there is no ground for assuming that the proportion in the East would be
essentially different. This population is quite in accordance with the
size of the city.

(Note: "Nineveh, in the broader sense," says M. v. Niebuhr, "covers an
area of about 400 English square miles. Hence there were about 40,000
persons to the square mile. Jones (in a paper on Nineveh) estimates the
population of the chief city, according to the area, at 174,000 souls.
So that we may reckon the population of the four larger walled cities at
350,000. There remain, therefore, for the smaller places and the level
ground, 300,000 men on about sixteen square miles; that is to say,
nearly 20,000 men upon the square mile." He then shows, from the
agricultural conditions in the district of Elberfeld and the province of
Naples, how thoroughly this population suits such a district. In the
district of Elberfeld there are, in round numbers, 22,000 persons to the
square mile, or, apart from the two large towns, 10,000. And if we take
into account the difference in fertility, this is about the same density
of population as that of Nineveh. The province of Naples bears a very
great resemblance to Nineveh, not only in the kind of cultivation, but
also in the fertility of the soil. And there, in round numbers, 46,000
are found to the square mile, or, exclusive of the capital, 22,000
souls.)

Children who cannot distinguish between right and left, cannot
distinguish good from evil, and are not yet accountable. The allusion to
the multitude of unaccountable children contains a fresh reason for
sparing the city: God would have been obliged to destroy so many
thousand innocent ones along with the guilty. Besides this, there was
"much cattle" in the city. "Oxen were certainly superior to shrubs. If
Jonah was right in grieving over one withered shrub, it would surely be
a harder and more cruel thing for so many innocent animals to perish"
(Calvin). "What could Jonah say to this? He was obliged to keep silence,
defeated, as it were, by his own sentence" (Luther). The history,
therefore, breaks off with these words of God, to which Jonah could make
no reply, because the object of the book was now attained, - namely, to
give the Israelites an insight into the true nature of the compassion of
the Lord, which embracers all nations with equal love. Let us, however,
give heed to the sign of the prophet Jonah, and hold fast to the
confession of Him who could say of Himself, "Behold, a greater than
Jonah is here!"
