[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 9:1</span></span>

When the Lord had instructed Samuel to appoint a king over the nation,
in accordance with its own desire, He very speedily proceeded to show
him the man whom He had chosen. Saul the Benjaminite came to Samuel, to
consult him as a seer about his father's she-asses, which had been lost,
and for which he had been seeking in all directions in vain ([Sa1
9:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001).md). And the Lord had already
revealed to the prophet the day before, that He would send him the man
who had been set apart by Him as the king of Israel; and when Samuel met
with Saul, He pointed him out as the man to whom He had referred ([Sa1
9:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015).md). Accordingly, Samuel invited
Saul to be his guest at a sacrificial meal, which he was about to
celebrate ([Sa1 9:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#018).md). After the
meal he made known to him the purpose of God, anointed him as king ([Sa1
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#025.md); [Sa1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001).md), and sent him away, with an
announcement of three signs, which would serve to confirm his election
on the part of God ([Sa1 10:2-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002).md).
This occurrence is related very circumstantially, to bring out
distinctly the miraculous interposition of God, and to show that Saul
did not aspire to the throne; and also that Samuel did not appoint of
his own accord the man whom he was afterwards obliged to reject, but
that Saul was elected by God to be king over His people, without any
interference on the part of either Samuel or himself.

(Note: There is no tenable ground for the assumption of Thenius and
others, that this account was derived from a different source from 1
Samuel 8, [Sa1 10:17-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#017.md), and [Sa1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#011.md).; for the assertion that [Sa1
10:17-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#017.md) connects itself in the most
natural way with 1 Samuel 8 is neither well-founded nor correct. In the
first place, it was certainly more natural that Samuel, who was to place
a king over the nation according to the appointment of God, should be
made acquainted with the man whom God had appointed, before the people
elected him by lot. And secondly, Saul's behaviour in hiding himself
when the lots were cast ([Sa1 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#021)..md),
can only be explained on the supposition that Samuel had already
informed him that he was the appointed king; whereas, if this had not
been the case, it would be altogether incomprehensible.)

[Sa1 9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md)

Saul searches for his father's asses. - [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md), [Sa1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002.md). The elaborate genealogy of the
Benjaminite Kish, and the minute description of the figure of his son
Saul, are intended to indicate at the very outset the importance to
which Saul attained in relation to the people of Israel, Kish was the
son of Abiel: this is in harmony with [Sa1
14:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#051.md). But when, on the other hand, it
is stated in [Ch1 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md); [Ch1
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#039.md), that Ner begat Kish, the
difference may be reconciled in the simplest manner, on the assumption
that the Ner mentioned there is not the father, but the grandfather, or
a still more remote ancestor of Kish, as the intervening members are
frequently passed over in the genealogies. The other ancestors of Kish
are never mentioned again. חיל גּבּור refers to Kish, and signifies not
a brave man, but a man of property, as in [Rut
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001.md). This son Saul (i.e., "prayed
for:" for this meaning of the word, comp. [Sa1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#017.md), [Sa1
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#027).md) was "young and beautiful." It is
true that even at that time Saul had a son grown up (viz., Jonathan),
according to [Sa1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md); but still, in
contrast with his father, he was "a young man," i.e., in the full vigour
of youth, probably about forty or forty-five years old. There is no
necessity, therefore, to follow the Vulgate rendering electus. No one
equalled him in beauty. "From his shoulder upwards he was higher than
any of the people." Such a figure as this was well adapted to commend
him to the people as their king (cf. [Sa1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#024).md), since size and beauty were
highly valued in rulers, as signs of manly strength (see Herod. iii. 20,
vii. 187; Aristot. Polit. iv. c. 24).

[Sa1 9:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#003.md)

Having been sent out by his father to search for his she-asses which had
strayed, Saul went with his servant through the mountains of Ephraim,
which ran southwards into the tribe-territory of Benjamin (see at [Sa1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001).md), then through the land of
Shalishah and the land of Shaalim, and after that through the land of
Benjamin, without finding the asses; and at length, when he had reached
the land of Zuph, he determined to return, because he was afraid that
his father might turn his mind from the asses, and trouble himself about
them (the son and servant). מן חדל, to desist from a thing, to give it
up or renounce it.

As Saul started in any case from Gibeah of Benjamin, his own home ([Sa1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#010.md)., [Sa1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#026.md), [Sa1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#004.md); [Sa1
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#034.md); [Sa1
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019.md); [Sa1
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001).md), i.e., the present Tuleil el
Phul, which was an hour or an hour and a half to the north of Jerusalem
(see at [Jos 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028).md), and went thence
into the mountains of Ephraim, he no doubt took a north-westerly
direction, so that he crossed the boundary of Benjamin somewhere between
Bireh and Atarah, and passing through the crest of the mountains of
Ephraim, on the west of Gophnah (Jifna), came out into the land of
Shalishah. Shalishah is unquestionably the country round (or of)
Baal-shalishah ([Kg2 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md), which was
situated, according to Eusebius (Onom. s.v. Βαιθσαρισάθ: Beth-sarisa or
Beth-salisa), in regione Thamnitica, fifteen Roman miles to the north of
Diospolis (Lydda), and was therefore probably the country to the west of
Jiljilia, where three different wadys run into one large wady, called
Kurawa; and according to the probable conjecture of Thenius, it was from
this fact that the district received the name of Shalishah, or
Three-land. They proceeded thence in their search to the land of
Shaalim: according to the Onom. (s.v.), "a village seven miles off, in
finibus Eleutheropoleos contra occidentem." But this is hardly correct,
and is most likely connected with the mistake made in transposing the
town of Samuel to the neighbourhood of Diospolis (see at [Sa1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001).md). For since they went on from
Shaalim into the land of Benjamin, and then still further into the land
of Zuph, on the south-west of Benjamin, they probably turned eastwards
from Shalishah, into the country where we find Beni Mussah and Beni
Salem marked upon Robinson's and v. de Velde's maps, and where we must
therefore look for the land of Shaalim, that they might proceed thence
to explore the land of Benjamin from the north-east to the south-west.
If, on the contrary, they had gone from Shaalim in a southerly or
south-westerly direction, to the district of Eleutheropolis, they would
only have entered the land of Benjamin at the south-west corner, and
would have had to go all the way back again in order to go thence to the
land of Zuph. For we may infer with certainty that the land of Zuph was
on the south-west of the tribe-territory of Benjamin, from the fact
that, according to [Sa1 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002.md), Saul and
his companion passed Rachel's tomb on their return thence to their own
home, and then came to the border of Benjamin. On the name Zuph, see at
[Sa1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md).

[Sa1 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006.md)

When Saul proposed to return home from the land of Zuph, his servant
said to him, "Behold, in this city ('this,' referring to the town which
stood in front of them upon a hill) is a man of God, much honoured; all
that he saith cometh surely to pass: now we will go thither; perhaps he
will tell us our way that we have to go" (lit. have gone, and still go,
sc., to attain the object of our journey, viz., to find the asses). The
name of this town is not mentioned either here or in the further course
of this history. Nearly all the commentators suppose it to have been
Ramah, Samuel's home. But this assumption has no foundation at all in
the text, and is irreconcilable with the statements respecting the
return in [Sa1 10:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002.md). The servant did
not say there dwells in this city, but there is in this city ([Sa1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006.md); comp. with this [Sa1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#010.md), "They went into the city where
the man of God was," not "dwelt"). It is still more evident, from the
answer given by the drawers of water, when Saul asked them, "Is the seer
here?" ([Sa1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#011).md), - viz., "He came
to-day to the city, for the people have a great sacrifice upon the high
place" ([Sa1 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#012).md), - that the seer
(Samuel) did not live in the town, but had only come thither to a
sacrificial festival. Moreover, "every impartial man will admit, that
the fact of Samuel's having honoured Saul as his guest at the
sacrificial meal of those who participated in the sacrifice, and of
their having slept under the same roof, cannot possibly weaken the
impression that Samuel was only there in his peculiar and official
capacity. It could not be otherwise than that the presidency should be
assigned to him at the feast itself as priest and prophet, and therefore
that the appointments mentioned should proceed from him. And it is but
natural to assume that he had a house at his command for any repetition
of such sacrifices, which we find from 2 Kings 4 to have been the case
in the history of Elisha" (Valentiner). And lastly, the sacrificial
festival itself does not point to Ramah; for although Samuel had built
an altar to the Lord at Ramah ([Sa1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017).md), this was by no means the only
place of sacrifice in the nation. If Samuel offered sacrifice at Mizpeh
and Gilgal ([Sa1 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#009.md); [Sa1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008.md); [Sa1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008)..md), he could also do the same at
other places. What the town really was in which Saul met with him,
cannot indeed be determined, since all that we can gather from [Sa1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002.md), is, that it was situated on the
south-west of Bethlehem.

[Sa1 9:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007.md)

Saul's objection, that they had no present to bring to the man of God,
as the bread was gone from their vessels, was met by the servant with
the remark, that he had a quarter of a shekel which he would give.

[Sa1 9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009.md)

Before proceeding with the further progress of the affair, the historian
introduces a notice, which was required to throw light upon what
follows; namely, that beforetime, if any one wished to inquire of God,
i.e., to apply to a prophet for counsel from God upon any matter, it was
customary in Israel to say, We will go to the seer, because "he that is
now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer." After this
parenthetical remark, the account is continued in [Sa1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#010.md). Saul declared himself satisfied
with the answer of the servant; and they both went into the town, to ask
the man of God about the asses that were lost.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 9:11</span></span>

As they were going up to the high place of the town, they met maidens
coming out of the town to draw water; and on asking them whether the
seer was there, they received this answer: "Yes; behold, he is before
thee: make haste, now, for he has come into the town to-day; for the
people have a sacrifice to-day upon the high place." Bamah (in the
singular) does not mean the height or hill generally; but throughout it
signifies the high place, as a place of sacrifice or prayer.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 9:13</span></span>

"When ye come into the city, ye will find him directly before he goes up
to the high place to eat." כּן not only introduces the apodosis, but
corresponds to כּ, as, so: here, however, it is used with reference to
time, in the sense of our "immediately." "For the people are not
accustomed to eat till he comes, for he blesses the sacrifice," etc.
בּרך, like εὐλογεῖν, refers to the thanksgiving prayer offered before
the sacrificial meal. "Go now for him; yet will meet him even to-day."
The first אתו is placed at the beginning for the sake of emphasis, and
then repeated at the close. כּהיּום, "Even to-day."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 9:14</span></span>

When they went into the town, Samuel met them on his way out to go to
the high place of sacrifice. Before the meeting itself is described, the
statement is introduced in [Sa1
9:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015.md), that the day before Jehovah
had foretold to Samuel that the man was coming to him whom he was to
anoint as captain over his people. אזן גּלה, to open any one's ear,
equivalent to reveal something to him ([Sa1
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#012.md); [Sa2
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#027), etc..md). אשׁלח, I will send thee,
i.e., "I will so direct his way in my overruling providence, that he
shall come to thee" (J. H. Mich. ). The words, "that he may save my
people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my
people, for their cry is come unto me," are not at all at variance with
[Sa1 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013.md). In that passage there is
simply the assertion, that there was no more any permanent oppression on
the part of the Philistines in the days of Samuel, such as had taken
place before; but an attempt to recover their supremacy over Israel is
not only not precluded, but is even indirectly affirmed (see the comm.
on [Sa1 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013).md). The words before us
simply show that the Philistines had then begun to make a fresh attempt
to contend for dominion over the Israelites. "I have looked upon my
people:" this is to be explained like the similar passage in [Exo
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#025.md), "God looked upon the children of
Israel," and [Exo 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007.md), "I have looked
upon the misery of my people." God's looking was not a quiet, inactive
looking on, but an energetic look, which brought help in trouble. "Their
cry is come unto me:" this is word for word the same as in [Exo
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#009.md). As the Philistines wanted to
tread in the footsteps of the Egyptians, it was necessary that Jehovah
should also send His people a deliverer from these new oppressors, by
giving them a king. The reason here assigned for the establishment of a
monarchy is by no means at variance with the displeasure which God had
expressed to Samuel at the desire of the people for a king ([Sa1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007)..md); since this displeasure had
reference to the state of heart from which the desire had sprung.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 9:17</span></span>

When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord answered him, sc., in reply to the tacit
inquiry, 'Is this he?' "Behold, this is the man of whom I spake to
thee." עצר, coercere imperio.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 9:18</span></span>

The thread of the narrative, which was broken off in [Sa1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015.md), is resumed in [Sa1
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#018.md). Saul drew near to Samuel in the
gate, and asked him for the seer's house. The expression השּׁער בּתוך is
used to define more precisely the general phrase in [Sa1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#014.md), העיר בּתוך בּאים; and there is
no necessity to alter העיר in [Sa1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#014.md) into השּׁער, as Thenius proposes,
for העיר בּתוך כּוא does not mean to go (or be) in the middle of the
town, as he imagines, but to go into, or enter, the town; and the
entrance to the town was through the gate.

[Sa1 9:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#019.md)

Samuel replied, "I am the seer: go up before me to the high place, and
eat with me to-day; and to-morrow I will send thee away, and make known
to thee all that is in thy heart." Letting a person go in front was a
sign of great esteem. The change from the singular עלה to the plural
אכלתּם may be explained on the ground that, whilst Samuel only spoke to
Saul, he intended expressly to invite his servant to the meal as well as
himself. "All that is in thine heart" does not mean "all that thou hast
upon thy heart," i.e., all that troubles thee, for Samuel relieved him
of all anxiety about the asses at once by telling him that they were
found; but simply the thoughts of thy heart generally. Samuel would make
these known to him, to prove to him that he was a prophet. He then first
of all satisfied him respecting the asses ([Sa1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#020).md): "As for the asses that were
lost to thee to-day three days (three days ago), do not set thy heart
upon them (i.e., do not trouble thyself about them), for they are
found." After this quieting announcement, by which he had convinced Saul
of his seer's gift, Samuel directed Saul's thoughts to that higher thing
which Jehovah had appointed for him: "And to whom does all that is worth
desiring of Israel belong? Is it not to thee, and to all thy father's
house?" "The desire of Israel" (optima quaeque Israel, Vulg.; "the best
in Israel," Luther) is not all that Israel desires, but all that Israel
possesses of what is precious or worth desiring (see [Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007).md). "The antithesis here is between
the asses and every desirable thing" (Seb. Schmidt). Notwithstanding the
indefinite character of the words, they held up such glorious things as
in prospect for Saul, that he replied in amazement ([Sa1
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#021).md), "Am not I a Benjaminite, of the
smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family is the least of all the
families of the tribe of Benjamin (בן שׁבטי is unquestionably a
copyist's error for בן שׁבת); and how speakest thou such a word to me?"
Samuel made no reply to this, as he simply wanted first of all to awaken
the expectation in Saul's mind of things that he had never dreamt of
before.

[Sa1 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022.md)

When they arrived at the high place, he conducted Saul and his servant
into the cell (the apartment prepared for the sacrificial meal), and
gave them (the servant as well as Saul, according to the simple customs
of antiquity, as being also his guest) a place at the upper end among
those who had been invited. There were about thirty persons present, no
doubt the most distinguished men of the city, whilst the rest of the
people probably encamped in the open air.

[Sa1 9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#023.md)

He then ordered the cook to bring the piece which he had directed him to
set aside, and to place it before Saul, namely the leg and העליה (the
article in the place of the relative; see Ewald, 331, b.); i.e., not
what was over it, viz., the broth poured upon it (Dathe and Maurer), but
what was attached to it (Luther). The reference, however, is not to the
kidney as the choicest portion (Thenius), for the kidneys were burned
upon the altar in the case of all the slain sacrifices ([Lev
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#004).md), and only the flesh of the
animals offered in sacrifice was applied to the sacrificial meal. What
was attached to the leg, therefore, can only have been such of the fat
upon the flesh as was not intended for the altar. Whether the right or
left leg, is not stated: the earlier commentators decide in favour of
the left, because the right leg fell to the share of the priests ([Lev
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#032)..md). But as Samuel conducted the
whole of the sacrificial ceremony, he may also have offered the
sacrifice itself by virtue of his prophetic calling, so that the right
leg would fall to his share, and he might have it reserved for his
guest. In any case, however, the leg, as the largest and best portion,
was to be a piece of honour for Saul (see [Gen
43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034).md). There is no reason to seek for
any further symbolical meaning in it. The fact that it was Samuel's
intention to distinguish and honour Saul above all his other guests, is
evident enough from what he said to Saul when the cook had brought the
leg: "Behold, that which is reserved is set before thee (שׂים is the
passive participle, as in [Num 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021).md);
for unto this time hath it been kept for thee, as I said I have invited
the people." למּועד is either "to the appointed time of thy coming," or
possibly, "for the (this) meeting together." Samuel mentions this to
give Saul his guest to understand that he had foreseen his coming in a
supernatural way. לאמר, saying, i.e., as I said (to the cook).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 9:25</span></span>

When the sacrificial meal was over, Samuel and Saul went down from the
high place into the town, and he (Samuel) talked with him upon the roof
(of the house into which Samuel had entered). The flat roofs of the East
were used as placed of retirement for private conversation (see at [Deu
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008).md). This conversation did not refer
of course to the call of Samuel to the royal dignity, for that was not
made known to him as a word of Jehovah till the following day ([Sa1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#027).md); but it was intended to prepare
him for that announcement: so that O. v. Gerlach's conjecture is
probably the correct one, viz., that Samuel "talked with Saul concerning
the deep religious and political degradation of the people of God, the
oppression of the heathen, the causes of the inability of the Israelites
to stand against these foes, the necessity for a conversion of the
people, and the want of a leader who was entirely devoted to the Lord."

(Note: For הגּג על עם־שׁאוּל וידבּר the lxx have καὶ διέστρωσαν τῷ Σαοὺλ
ἐπι τῷ δώματι καὶ ἐκοιμήθη, "they prepared Saul a bed upon the house,
and he slept," from which Clericus conjectured that these translators
had read לשאול וירבדו (וירבּדוּ or ויּרבּדוּ); and Ewald and Thenius
propose to alter the Hebrew text in this way. But although וגו
ויּשׁכּימוּ ([Sa1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#026).md) no doubt
presupposes that Saul had slept in Samuel's house, and in fact upon the
roof, the remark of Thenius, "that the private conversation upon the
roof ([Sa1 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#025).md) comes too early, as
Saul did not yet know, and was not to learn till the following day, what
was about to take place," does not supply any valid objection to the
correctness of the Masoretic text, or any argument in favour of the
Septuagint rendering or interpretation, since it rests upon an
altogether unfounded and erroneous assumption, viz., that Samuel had
talked with Saul about his call to the throne. Moreover, "the
strangeness" of the statement in [Sa1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#026.md), "they rose up early," and then
"when the morning dawned, Samuel called," etc., cannot possibly throw
any suspicion upon the integrity of the Hebrew text, as this
"strangeness" vanishes when we take וגו כּעלות ויהי as a more precise
definition of ויּשׁכּימוּ. The Septuagint translators evidently held the
same opinion as their modern defenders. They took offence at Samuel's
private conversation with Saul, because he did not make known to him the
word of God concerning his call to the throne till the next morning;
and, on the other hand, as their rising the next morning is mentioned in
[Sa1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#026.md), they felt the absence of
any allusion to their sleeping, and consequently not only interpreted
ידבר by a conjectural emendation as standing for ירבד rof, because
מרבדּים רבד is used in [Pro 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016.md) to
signify the spreading of mats or carpets for a bed, but also identified
וישׁכמו with ישׁכבו, and rendered it ἐκοιμήθη. At the same time, they
did not reflect that the preparation of the bed and their sleeping
during the night were both of them matters of course, and there was
consequently no necessity to mention them; whereas Samuel's talking with
Saul upon the roof was a matter of importance in relation to the whole
affair, and one which could not be passed over in silence. Moreover, the
correctness of the Hebrew text is confirmed by all the other ancient
versions. Not only do the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic follow the
Masoretic text, but Jerome does the same in the rendering adopted by
him, "Et locutus est cum Saule in solario. Cumque mane surrexissent;"
though the words "stravitque Saul in solario et dormivit" have been
interpolated probably from the Itala into the text of the Vulgate which
has come down to us.)

[Sa1 9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#026.md)

"And they rose up early in the morning: namely, when the morning dawn
arose, Samuel called to Saul upon the roof (i.e., he called from below
within the house up to the roof, where Saul was probably sleeping upon
the balcony; cf. [Kg2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#010).md), Get up, I
will conduct thee." As soon as Saul had risen, "they both (both Samuel
and Saul) went out (into the street)." And when they had gone down to
the extremity of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Let the servant pass on
before us (and he did so), and do thou remain here for the present; I
will show thee a word of God."
