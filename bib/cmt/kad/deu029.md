### [Deuteronomy Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 29:0</span></span>

Conclusion of the Covenant in the Land of Moab - Deuteronomy 29-30

The addresses which follow in ch. 29 and 30 are announced in the heading
in [Deu 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001) as "words (addresses.md) of
the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of
Israel, beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb," and
consist, according to [Deu 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#010.md)., in
a solemn appeal to all the people to enter into the covenant which the
Lord made with them that day; that is to say, it consisted literally in
a renewed declaration of the covenant which the Lord had concluded with
the nation at Horeb, or in a fresh obligation imposed upon the nation to
keep the covenant which had been concluded at Horeb, by the offering of
sacrifices and the sprinkling of the people with the sacrificial blood
(Ex 24). There was no necessity for any repetition of this act, because,
notwithstanding the frequent transgressions on the part of the nation,
it had not been abrogated on the part of God, but still remained in full
validity and force. The obligation binding upon the people to fulfil the
covenant is introduced by Moses with an appeal to all that the Lord had
done for Israel ([Deu 29:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#002).md); and
this is followed by a summons to enter into the covenant which the Lord
was concluding with the now, that He might be their God, and fulfil His
promises concerning them ([Deu
29:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#010).md), with a repeated allusion to
the punishment which threatened them in case of apostasy ([Deu
29:16-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#016).md), and the eventual
restoration on the ground of sincere repentance and return to the Lord
([Deu 30:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001).md), and finally another
solemn adjuration, with a blessing and a curse before them, to make
choice of the blessing ([Deu
30:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015).md).

[Deuteronomy 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 29:1</span></span>

Is not the close of the address in ch. 5-28, as Schultz, Knobel, and
others suppose; but the heading to ch. 29-30, which relate to the making
of the covenant mentioned in this verse (vid., [Deu
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#012.md), [Deu
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#014).md).

[Deuteronomy 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 29:2</span></span>

The introduction in [Deu 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#002.md)
resembles that in [Deu 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#001.md). "All
Israel" is the nation in all its members (see [Deu
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#010.md), [Deu
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#011).md). - Israel had no doubt seen the
mighty acts of the Lord in Egypt ([Deu
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#002.md) and [Deu
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#003.md); cf. [Deu
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md); [Deu
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#019).md), but Jehovah had not given them
a heart, i.e., understanding, to perceive, eyes to see, and ears to
hear, until this day. With this complaint, Moses does not intend to
excuse the previous want of susceptibility on the part of the nation to
the manifestations of grace on the part of the Lord, but simply to
explain the necessity for the repeated allusion to the gracious acts of
God, and to urge the people to lay them truly to heart. "By reproving
the dulness of the past, he would stimulate them to a desire to
understand: just as if he had said, that for a long time they had been
insensible to so many miracles, and therefore they ought not to delay
any longer, but to arouse themselves to hearken better unto God"
(Calvin). The Lord had not yet given the people an understanding heart,
because the people had not yet asked for it, simply because the need of
it was not felt (cf. [Deu 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026).md).

[Deuteronomy 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 29:5</span></span>

With the appeal to the gracious guidance of Israel by God through the
desert, the address of Moses passes imperceptibly into an address from
the Lord, just as in [Deu 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014.md). (On
[Deu 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#005.md), [Deu
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#006.md), vid., [Deu
8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md); on [Deu
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#007.md), vid., [Deu
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026.md)., and [Deu
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001.md). and [Deu
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012)..md).

[Deuteronomy 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 29:9</span></span>

These benefits from the Lord demanded obedience and fidelity. "Keep the
words of this covenant," etc. (cf. [Deu
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#018).md). השׂכּיל, to act wisely (as in
[Deu 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029).md), bearing in mind, however,
that Jehovah Himself is the wisdom of Israel ([Deu
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006).md), and the search for this wisdom
brings prosperity and salvation (cf. [Jos
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#007).md).

[Deuteronomy 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 29:10</span></span>

Summons to enter into the covenant of the Lord, namely, to enter
inwardly, to make the covenant an affair of the heart and life.

[Deu 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#010.md)

"To-day," when the covenant-law and covenant-right were laid before
them, the whole nation stood before the Lord without a single exception
- the heads and the tribes, the elders and the officers, all the men of
Israel. The two members are parallel. The heads of the people are the
elders and officers, and the tribes consist of all the men. The
rendering given by the lxx and Syriac (also in the English version:
Tr.), "heads (captains) of your tribes," is at variance with the
language.

[Deu 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#011.md)

The covenant of the Lord embraced, however, not only the men of Israel,
but also the wives and children, and the stranger who had attached
himself to Israel, such as the Egyptians who came out with Israel ([Exo
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038.md); [Num
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004).md), and the Midianites who joined
the Israelites with Hobab ([Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029).md), down to the very lowest
servant, "from thy hewer of wood to thy drawer of water" (cf. [Jos
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021.md), [Jos
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027).md).

[Deu 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#012.md)

"That thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the Lord thy God, and
the engagement on oath, which the Lord thy God concludeth with thee
to-day." עבר with בּ, as in [Job
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028.md), "to enter into," expresses
entire entrance, which goes completely through the territory entered,
and is more emphatic than בברית בּוא ([Ch2
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#012).md). "Into the oath:" the covenant
confirmed with an oath, covenants being always accompanied with oaths
(vid., [Gen 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#028).md).

[Deu 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#013.md)

"That He may set thee up (exalt thee) to-day into a people for Himself,
and that He may be (become) unto thee a God" (vid., [Deu
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#009.md); [Deu
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#009.md); [Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md).

[Deu 29:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#014.md)

This covenant Moses made not only with those who are present, but with
all whether present or not; for it was to embrace not only those who
were living then, but their descendants also, to become a covenant of
blessing for all nations (cf. [Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039.md), and the intercession of Christ
in [Joh 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#020).md).

[Deuteronomy 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 29:16</span></span>

The summons to enter into the covenant of the Lord is explained by Moses
first of all by an exposition of the evil results which would follow
from apostasy from the Lord, or the breach of His covenant. This
exposition he introduces with an allusion to the experience of the
people with reference to the worthlessness of idols, both in Egypt
itself, and upon their march through the nations, whose territory they
passed through ([Deu 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#016.md), [Deu
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#017).md). The words, "for ye have
learned how we dwelt in Egypt, and passed through the nations...and have
seen their abominations and their idols" (gillulim: lit., clods, see
[Lev 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030).md), have this signification:
In our abode in Egypt, and upon our march through different lands, ye
have become acquainted with the idols of these nations, that they are
not gods, but only wood and stone (see at [Deu
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#028).md), silver and gold. את־אשׁר, as in
[Deu 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007.md), literally "ye know that
which we dwelt,' i.e., know what our dwelling there showed, what
experience we gained there of the nature of heathen idols.

[Deuteronomy 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 29:18</span></span>

"That there may not be among you," etc.: this sentence may be easily
explained by introducing a thought which may be easily supplied, such as
"consider this," or "do not forget what ye have seen, that no one,
either man or woman, family or tribe, may turn away from Jehovah our
God." - "That there may not be a root among you which bears poison and
wormwood as fruit." A striking image of the destructive fruit borne by
idolatry (cf. [Heb 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015).md). Rosh stands
for a plant of a very bitter taste, as we may see from the frequency
with which it is combined with לענה, wormwood: it is not, strictly
speaking, a poisonous plant, although the word is used in [Job
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#016.md) to denote the poison of
serpents, because, in the estimation of a Hebrew, bitterness and poison
were kindred terms. There is no other passage in which it can be shown
to have the meaning "poison." The sense of the figure is given in plain
terms in [Deu 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#019.md), "that no one when
he hears the words of this oath may bless himself in his heart, saying,
I will prosper with me, for I walk in the firmness of my heart." To
bless himself in his heart is to congratulate himself. שׁרירוּת,
firmness, a vox media; in Syriac, firmness, in a good sense, equivalent
to truth; in Hebrew, generally in a bad sense, denoting hardness of
heart; and this is the sense in which Moses uses it here. - "To sweep
away that which is saturated with the thirsty:" a proverbial expression,
of which very different interpretations have been given (see Rosenmller
ad h. l.), taken no doubt from the land and transferred to persons or
souls; so that we might supply Nephesh in this sense, "to destroy all,
both those who have drunk its poison, and those also who are still
thirsting for it" (Knobel). But even if we were to supply ארץ (the
land), we should not have to think of the land itself, but simply of its
inhabitants, so that the thought would still remain the same.

[Deuteronomy 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 29:20</span></span>

"For the Lord will not forgive him (who thinks or speaks in this way);
but then will His anger smoke (break forth in fire; vid., ([Psa
74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001).md), and His jealousy against that
man, and the whole curse of the law will lie upon him, that his name may
be blotted out under heaven (vid., [Deu
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019.md); [Exo
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014).md). "The Lord will separate him
unto evil from all the tribes, - so that he will be shut out from the
covenant nation, and from its salvation, and be exposed to destruction -
according to all the curses of the covenant." Although the pronominal
suffix refers primarily to the man, it also applies, according to [Deu
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md), to the woman, the family, and
the tribe. "That is written," etc., as in [Deu
28:58](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#058.md), [Deu
28:61](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#061.md).

[Deuteronomy 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 29:22</span></span>

How thoroughly Moses was filled with the thought, that not only
individuals, but whole families, and in fact the greater portion of the
nation, would fall into idolatry, is evident from the further expansion
of the threat which follows, and in which he foresees in the Spirit, and
foretells, the extermination of whole families, and the devastation of
the land by distant nations; as in [Lev
26:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031.md). Future generations of
Israel, and the stranger from a distant land, when they saw the strokes
of the Lord which burst upon the land, and the utter desolation of the
land, would ask whence this devastation, and receive the reply, The Lord
had smitten the land thus in His anger, because its inhabitants (the
Israelites) had forsaken His covenant. With regard to the construction,
observe that ואמר, in [Deu 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md), is
resumed in ואמרוּ, in [Deu 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024.md), the
subject of [Deu 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md) being expanded
into the general notion, "all nations" ([Deu
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024).md). With וראוּ, in [Deu
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md), a parenthetical clause is
inserted, giving the reason for the main thought, in the form of a
circumstantial clause; and to this there is attached, by a loose
apposition in [Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md), a still
further picture of the divine strokes according to their effect upon the
land. The nouns in [Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md),
"brimstone and salt burning," are in apposition to the strokes
(plagues), and so far depend upon "they see." The description is
borrowed from the character of the Dead Sea and its vicinity, to which
there is an express allusion in the words, "like the overthrow of
Sodom," etc., i.e., of the towns of the vale of Siddim (see at [Gen
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#002).md), which resembled paradise, the
garden of Jehovah, before their destruction (vid., [Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md) and [Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024)..md).

[Deuteronomy 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 29:24</span></span>

"What is this great burning of wrath?" i.e., what does it mean - whence
does it come? The reply to such a question would be ([Deu
29:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#025).md): The inhabitants of the land
have forsaken the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers;
therefore has the wrath of the Lord burned over the land.

[Deuteronomy 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 29:26</span></span>

"Gods which God had not assigned them" (vid., [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019).md). "All the curses," etc., are the
curses contained in Deut 28:15-68; Lev 26:14-38. - Those who give the
answer close their address in [Deu
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029.md) with an expression of pious
submission and solemn admonition. "That which is hidden belongs to the
Lord our God (is His affair), and that which is revealed belongs to us
and our children for ever, to do (that we may do) all the words of this
law." That which is revealed includes the law with its promises and
threats; consequently that which is hidden can only refer to the mode in
which God will carry out in the future His counsel and will, which He
has revealed in the law, and complete His work of salvation
notwithstanding the apostasy of the people.

(Note: What the puncta extraordinaria above (ע)ד וּלבנינוּ לנוּ mean, is
uncertain. Hiller's conjecture is the most probable, "that they are
intended to indicate a various reading, formed by the omission of eleven
consonants, and the transposition of the rest עולם והנגדלות (at magnalia
saeculi sunt);" whereas there is no foundation for Lightfoot's notion,
that "they served as a warning, that we should not wish to pry with
curiosity into the secret things of God, but should be content with His
revealed will," - a notion which rests upon the supposition that the
points are inspired.)
