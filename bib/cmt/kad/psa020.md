### [Psalms Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 20:0</span></span>

Prayer for the King in Time of War

To [Psa 19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md) is closely attached
[Psa 20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md), because its commencement
is as it were the echo of the prayer with which the former closes; and
to [Psa 20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md) is closely attached
[Psa 21:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md), because both Psalms
refer to the same event relatively, as prayer and thanksgiving. [Psa
20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md) is an intercessory psalm of the
nation, and [Psa 21:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md) a
thanksgiving psalm of the nation, on behalf of its king. It is clearly
manifest that the two Psalms form a pair, being connected by unity of
author and subject. They both open somewhat uniformly with a synonymous
parallelism of the members, [Psa
20:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002.md); [Psa
21:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002.md); they then increase in fervour
and assume a more vivid colouring as they come to speak of the foes of
the king and the empire, [Psa 20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md);
[Psa 21:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md); and they both close with
an ejaculatory cry to Jahve, Ps 20:10; 21:14. In both, the king is
apostrophised through the course of the several verses, [Psa
20:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002.md); [Psa
21:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md); and here and there this is
done in a way that provokes the question whether the words are not
rather addressed to Jahve, [Psa 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md);
[Psa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md). In both Psalms the king is
referred to by המּלך, Ps 20:10; [Psa
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md); both comprehend the goal of the
desires in the word ישׁוּעה, [Psa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md), cf. [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md), [Psa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002.md), [Psa
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md); both delight in rare forms of
expression, which are found only in these instances in the whole range
of Old Testament literature, viz., נדגל [Psa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md), נתעדד [Psa
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009.md), ארשׁת [Psa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md), תחדהו, [Psa
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007.md).

If, as the לדוד indicates, they formed part of the oldest Davidic
Psalter, then it is notwithstanding more probable that their author is a
contemporary poet, than that it is David himself. For, although both as
to form of expression (cf. [Psa 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012.md)
with [Psa 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002).md) and as to thoughts
(cf. [Psa 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007.md) with [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011).md), they exhibit some points of
contact with Davidic Psalms, they still stand isolated by their peculiar
character. But that David is their subject, as the inscription לדוד, and
their position in the midst of the Davidic Psalms, lead one to expect,
is capable of confirmation. During the time of the Syro-Ammonitish war
comes David's deep fall, which in itself and in its consequences made
him sick both in soul and in body. It was not until he was again
restored to God's favour out of this self-incurred peril, that he went
to his army which lay before Rabbath Ammon, and completed the conquest
of the royal city of the enemy. The most satisfactory explanation of the
situation referred to in this couplet of Psalms is to be gained from 2
Sam 11-12. [Psa 20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md) prays for the
recovery of the king, who is involved in war with powerful foes; and
[Psa 21:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md) gives thanks for his
recovery, and wishes him a victorious issue to the approaching campaign.
The "chariots and horses" ([Psa 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008).md)
are characteristic of the military power of Aram ([Sa2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018), and frequently.md), and in [Psa
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md) and [Psa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md) we perceive an allusion to [Sa2
12:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030.md), or at least a remarkable
agreement with what is there recorded.

[Psalms 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 20:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 20:2-6) Litany for the king in distress, who offers sacrifices
for himself in the sanctuary. The futures in [Psa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002.md), standing five times at the head
of the climactic members of the parallelism, are optatives. ימלּא, [Psa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md), also continues the chain of
wishes, of which even נרננה (cf. [Psa
69:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#015).md) forms one of the links. The
wishes of the people accompany both the prayer and the sacrifice. "The
Name of the God of Jacob" is the self-manifesting power and grace of the
God of Israel. יעקב is used in poetry interchangeably with ישראל, just
like אלהים with יהוה. Alshךch refers to [Gen
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#003.md); and it is not improbable that
the desire moulds itself after the fashion of the record of the fact
there handed down to us. May Jahve, who, as the history of Jacob shows,
hears (and answers) in the day of distress, hear the king; may the Name
of the God of Jacob bear him away from his foes to a triumphant height.
שׂגּב alternates with רומם ([Psa
18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049).md) in this sense. This
intercession on the behalf of the praying one is made in the sanctuary
on the heights of Zion, where Jahve sits enthroned. May He send him
succour from thence, like auxiliary troops that decide the victory. The
king offers sacrifice. He offers sacrifice according to custom before
the commencement of the battle ([Sa1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009.md)., and cf. the phrase קדּשׁ
מלחמה), a whole burnt-offering and at the same time a meat or rather
meal offering also, מנחות;

(Note: This, though not occurring in the Old Testament, is the principal
form of the plural, which, as even David Kimchi recognises in his
Lexicon, points to a verb מנח (just as שׂמלות, גּבעות, שׁפחות point to
שׂמל, גּבע, שׂפח); whereas other old grammarians supposed נחה to be the
root, and were puzzled with the traditional pronunciation menachôth, but
without reason.)

for every whole offering and every shelamim - or peace-offering had a
meat-offering and a drink-offering as its indispensable accompaniment.
The word זכר is perfectly familiar in the ritual of the meal-offering.
That portion of the meal-offering, only a part of which was placed upon
the altar (to which, however, according to traditional practice, does
not belong the accompanying meal-offering of the מנחת נסכים, which was
entirely devoted to the altar), which ascended with the altar fire is
called אזכּרה, μνημόσυνον (cf. [Act
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004).md), that which brings to
remembrance with God him for whom it is offered up (not "incense," as
Hupfeld renders it); for the designation of the offering of jealousy,
[Num 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015.md), as "bringing iniquity to
remembrance before God" shows, that in the meal-offering ritual זכר
retains the very same meaning that it has in other instances. Every
meal-offering is in a certain sense a מנחת זכּרון a esnes . Hence here
the prayer that Jahve would graciously remember them is combined with
the meal-offerings.

As regards the ‛olah, the wish "let fire from heaven ([Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md); [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038.md); [Ch1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026).md) turn it to ashes," would not be
vain. But the language does not refer to anything extraordinary; and in
itself the consumption of the offering to ashes (Bttcher) is no mark of
gracious acceptance. Moreover, as a denominative from דּשׁן, fat ashes,
דּשּׁן means "to clean from ashes," and not: to turn into ashes. On the
other hand, דּשּׁן also signifies "to make fat," [Psa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md), and this effective signification
is applied declaratively in this instance: may He find thy
burnt-offering fat, which is equivalent to: may it be to Him a ריח ניחח
\[an odour of satisfaction, a sweet-smelling savour\]. The voluntative
ah only occurs here and in [Job 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017.md)
(which see) and [Isa 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md), in the 3
pers.; and in this instance, just as with the cohortative in [Sa1
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md), we have a change of the
lengthening into a sharpening of the sound (cf. the exactly similar
change of forms in [Sa1 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md); [Isa
59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005.md); [Zac
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004.md); [Pro
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#014.md); [Eze
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013).md) as is very frequently the case
in מה for מה. The alteration to ידשּׁנה or ידשׁנהּ (Hitzig) is a
felicitous but needless way of getting rid of the rare form. The
explanation of the intensifying of the music here is, that the
intercessory song of the choir is to be simultaneous with the
presentation upon the altar (הקטרה). עצה is the resolution formed in the
present wartime. "Because of thy salvation," i.e., thy success in war,
is, as all the language is here, addressed to the king, cf. [Psa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002.md), where it is addressed to Jahve,
and intended of the victory accorded to him. It is needless to read
נגדּל instead of נדגּל, after the rendering of the lxx
megaluntheeso'metha. נדגּל is a denominative from דּגל: to wave a
banner. In the closing line, the rejoicing of hope goes back again to
the present and again assumes the form of an intercessory desire.

[Psalms 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 20:6</span></span>

(Heb.: 20:7-9) While [Psa 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002.md) were
being sung the offering of the sacrifice was probably going on. Now,
after a lengthened pause, there ascends a voice, probably the voice of
one of the Levites, expressing the cheering assurance of the gracious
acceptance of the offering that has been presented by the priest. With
עתּה or ועתּה, the usual word to indicate the turning-point, the
instantaneous entrance of the result of some previous process of
prolonged duration, whether hidden or manifest (e.g., [Kg1
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#024.md); [Isa
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022).md), is introduced. howshiya\` is
the perfect of faith, which, in the certainty of being answered,
realises the fulfilment in anticipation. The exuberance of the language
in [Psa 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md) corresponds to the
exuberance of feeling which thus finds expression.

In [Psa 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003.md) the answer is expected
out of Zion, in the present instance it is looked for from God's holy
heavens; for the God who sits enthroned in Zion is enthroned for ever in
the heavens. His throne on earth is as it were the vestibule of His
heavenly throne; His presence in the sanctuary of Israel is no
limitation of His omnipresence; His help out of Zion is the help of the
Celestial One and Him who is exalted above the heaven of heavens.
גּבוּרות does not here mean the fulness of might (cf. [Psa
90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010).md), but the displays of power
([Psa 106:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#002.md); [Psa
145:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#004.md); [Psa
150:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#002.md); [Psa
63:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001) :15.md), by which His right hand
procures salvation, i.e., victory, for the combatant. The glory of
Israel is totally different from that of the heathen, which manifests
itself in boastful talk. In [Psa 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008.md)
הזכּירוּ or יזכּירוּ must be supplied from the נזכּיר in [Psa
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008.md) (lxx μεγαλυνθησόμεθα = נגביר,
[Psa 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005).md); הזכּיר בּ, to make
laudatory mention of any matter, to extol, and indirectly therefore to
take credit to one's self for it, to boast of it (cf. הלּל בּ, [Psa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009).md). According to the Law Israel was
forbidden to have any standing army; and the law touching the king ([Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016).md) speaks strongly against his
keeping many horses. It was also the same under the judges, and at this
time under David; but under Solomon, who acquired for himself horses and
chariots in great number ([Kg1
10:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026).md), it was very different. It
is therefore a confession that must belong to the time of David which is
here made in [Psa 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008.md), viz., that
Israel's glory in opposition to their enemies, especially the Syrians,
is the sure defence and protection of the Name of their God alone. The
language of David to Goliath is very similar, [Sa1
17:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#045.md). The preterites in [Psa
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009.md) are praet. confidentiae. It is,
as Luther says, "a song of triumph before the victory, a shout of joy
before succour." Since קוּם does not mean to stand, but to rise, קמנוּ
assumes the present superiority of the enemy. But the position of
affairs changes: those who stand fall, and those who are lying down rise
up; the former remain lying, the latter keep the field. The Hithpa.
התעודד signifies to show one's self firm, strong, courageous; like עודד,
[Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md); [Psa
147:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#006.md), to strengthen, confirm,
recover, from עוּד to be compact, firm, cogn. Arab. âd f. i., inf. aid,
strength; as, e.g., the Koran (Sur. xxxviii. 16) calls David dhâ-l-aidi,
possessor of strength, II ajjada, to strengthen, support, and Arab. 'dd,
inf. add, strength superiority, V tāddada, to show one's self strong,
brave, courageous.

[Psalms 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 20:9</span></span>

(Heb.: v. 10) After this solo voice, the chorus again come on. The song
is closed, as it was opened, by the whole congregation; and is rounded
off by recurring to its primary note, praying for the accomplishment of
that which is sought and pledged. The accentuation construes המּלך with
יעננוּ as its subject, perhaps in consideration of the fact, that
הושׁיעה is not usually followed by a governed object, and because thus a
medium is furnished for the transition from address to direct assertion.
But if in a Psalm, the express object of which is to supplicate
salvation for the king, המלך הושׁיעה stand side by side, then, in
accordance with the connection, המלך must be treated as the object; and
more especially since Jahve is called מלך רב, in [Psa
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md), and the like, but never
absolutely המלך. Wherefore it is, with Hupfeld, Hitzig, and others, to
be rendered according to the lxx and Vulgate, Domine salvum fac regem.
The New Testament cry Ὡσαννὰ τῷ υἱῷ Δαυίδ is a peculiar application of
this Davidic "God bless the king (God save the king)," which is brought
about by means of [Psa 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md). The
closing line, [Psa 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009.md), is an
expanded Amen.
