### [Leviticus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 3:1</span></span>

The Peace-Offerings. - The third kind of sacrifice is called שׁלמים זבח,
commonly rendered thank-offering, but more correctly a saving-offering
(Heilsopfer: Angl. peace-offering). Besides this fuller form, which is
the one most commonly employed in Leviticus, we meet with the
abbreviated forms זבחים and שׁלמים: e.g., זבח in [Lev
7:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016.md); [Lev
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037.md), more especially in combination
with עלה, [Lev 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#008.md) cf. [Exo
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#025.md); [Exo
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#012.md); [Num
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003.md), [Num
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#005.md); [Deu
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#027.md); [Jos
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#027.md); [Sa1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#015.md); [Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md); [Kg2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#017.md); [Kg2
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#024.md); [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md); [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020.md); [Jer
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md); [Jer
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026.md), etc., - and שׁלמים in [Lev
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022.md); [Exo
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024.md); [Exo
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006.md); [Deu
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#007.md); [Jos
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#031.md); [Jdg
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md); [Jdg
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#004.md); [Sa1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009.md); [Sa2
6:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md); [Sa2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#025.md); [Kg1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015.md), etc. זבח is derived from זבח,
which is not applied to slaughtering generally (שׁחט), but, with the
exception of [Deu 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md), where the use
of זבח for slaughtering is occasioned by the retrospective reference to
[Lev 17:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003.md), is always used for
slaying as a sacrifice, or sacrificing; and even in [Sa1
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#024.md); [Eze
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003.md) and [Eze
39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017.md), it is only used in a figurative
sense. The real meaning, therefore, is sacrificial slaughtering, or
slaughtered sacrifice. It is sometimes used in a wider sense, and
applied to every kind of bleeding sacrifice ([Sa1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#021.md); [Sa1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#019).md), especially in connection with
minchah ([Sa1 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#029.md); [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md); [Isa
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#021.md); [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027), etc..md); but it is mostly used in
a more restricted sense, and applied to the peace-offerings, or slain
offerings, which culminated in a sacrificial meal, as distinguished from
the burnt and sin-offerings, in which case it is synonymous with שׁלמים
or שׁלמים זבח. The word shelamim, the singular of which (Shelem) is only
met with in [Amo 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022.md), is applied
exclusively to these sacrifices, and is derived from שׁלם to be whole,
uninjured. It does not mean "compensation or restitution," for which we
find the nouns שׁלּם ([Deu 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035).md),
שׁלּוּם ([Hos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007).md), and שׁלּוּמה ([Psa
91:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008).md), formed from the Piel שׁלּם, but
integritas completa, pacifica, beata, answering to the Sept. rendering
σωτήριον. The plural denotes the entire round of blessings and powers,
by which the salvation or integrity of man in his relation to God is
established and secured. The object of the shelamim was invariably
salvation: sometimes they were offered as an embodiment of thanksgiving
for salvation already received, sometimes as a prayer for the salvation
desired; so that they embraced both supplicatory offerings and
thank-offerings, and were offered even in times of misfortune, or on the
day on which supplication was offered for the help of God ([Jdg
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md); [Jdg
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#004.md); [Sa1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009.md); [Sa2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#025).md).

(Note: Cf. Hengstenberg, Dissertations. Outram's explanation is quite
correct: Sacrificia salutaria in sacris litteris shelamim dicta, ut quae
semper de rebus prosperis fieri solerent, impetratis utique aut
impetrandis.)

The law distinguishes three different kinds: praise-offerings,
vow-offerings, and freewill-offerings ([Lev
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012.md), [Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016).md). They were all restricted to
oxen, sheep, and goats, either male or female, pigeons not being
allowed, as they were always accompanied with a common sacrificial meal,
for which a pair of pigeons did not suffice.

[Lev 3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md)

In the act of sacrificing, the presentation of the animal before
Jehovah, the laying on of hands, the slaughtering, and the sprinkling of
the blood were the same as in the case of the burnt-offering ([Lev
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003).md). It was in the application of
the flesh that the difference first appeared.

[Lev 3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md)

The person presenting the sacrifice was to offer as a firing for
Jehovah, first, "the fat which covered the entrails" ([Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009).md), i.e., the large net which
stretches from the stomach over the bowels and completely envelopes the
latter, and which is only met with in the case of men and the mammalia
generally, and in the ruminant animals abounds with fat; secondly, "all
the fat on the entrails," i.e., the fat attached to the intestines,
which could easily be peeled off; thirdly, "the two kidneys, and the fat
upon them (and) that upon the loins (הכּסלים), i.e., upon the inner
muscles of the loins, or in the region of the kidneys; and fourthly,
"the net upon the liver." The net (היּתרת) upon (על [Lev
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#004.md), [Lev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#010.md), [Lev
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#015.md); [Lev
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#009.md); [Lev
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#004.md); [Exo
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#013).md), or from (מן [Lev
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#010).md), or of the liver ([Lev
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#016.md), [Lev
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#025.md); [Lev
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#019.md); [Exo
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#022).md), cannot be the large lobe of
the liver, ὁ λοβὸς τοῦ ἥπατος (lxx), because this is part of the liver
itself, and does not lie על־כּבד over (upon) the liver; nor is it simply
a portion of fat, but the small net (omentum minus), the liver-net, or
stomach-net (recticulum jecoris; Vulg., Luth., De Wette, and Knobel),
which commences at the division between the right and left lobes of the
liver, and stretches on the one side across the stomach, and on the
other to the region of the kidneys. Hence the clause, "on the kidneys
(i.e., by them, as far as it reaches) shall he take it away." This
smaller net is delicate, but not so fat as the larger net; though it
still forms part of the fat portions. The word יתרת, which only occurs
in the passages quoted, is to be explained from the Arabic and Ethiopic
(to stretch over, to stretch out), whence also the words יתר a cord
([Jdg 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#007.md); [Psa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002).md), and מיתר the bow-string ([Psa
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013).md) or extended tent-ropes ([Exo
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#018).md), are derived. The four portions
mentioned comprehended all the separable fat in the inside of the
sacrificial animal. Hence they were also designated "all the fat" of the
sacrifice ([Lev 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#016.md); [Lev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#008.md), [Lev
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#019.md), [Lev
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026.md), [Lev
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#031.md), [Lev
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035.md); [Lev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#003).md), or briefly "the fat" (החלב [Lev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009.md); [Lev
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#033.md); [Lev
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#025.md); [Lev
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#006.md); [Num
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#017).md), "the fat portions" (החלבים
[Lev 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005.md); [Lev
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#026.md); [Lev
9:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#019.md), [Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md); [Lev
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#015).md).

[Lev 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#005.md)

This fat the priests were to burn upon the altar, over the burnt
sacrifice, on the pieces of wood upon the fire. על־העלה does not mean
"in the manner or style of the burnt-offering" (Knobel), but "upon
(over) the burnt-offering." For apart from the fact that על cannot be
shown to have this meaning, the peace-offering was preceded as a rule by
the burnt-offering. At any rate it was always preceded by the daily
burnt-offering, which burned, if not all day, at all events the whole of
the forenoon, until it was quite consumed; so that the fat portions of
the peace-offerings were to be laid upon the burnt-offering which was
burning already. That this is the meaning of על־העלה is placed beyond
all doubt, both by [Lev 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005.md), where the
priest is directed to burn wood every morning upon the fire of the
altar, and then to place the burnt-offering upon it (עליה), and upon
that to cause the fat portions of the peace-offerings to evaporate in
smoke, and also by [Lev 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#014.md), where
Aaron is said first of all to have burned the flesh and head of the
burnt-offering upon the altar, then to have washed the entrails and legs
of the animal, and burned them on the altar, העלה על, i.e., upon (over)
the portions of the burnt-offering that were burning already.

[Leviticus 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 3:6</span></span>

The same rules apply to the peace-offerings of sheep and goats, except
that, in addition to the fat portions, which were to be burned upon the
altar in the case of the oxen ([Lev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md), [Lev
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#004).md) and goats ([Lev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#014.md), [Lev
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#015).md), the fat tail of the sheep was
to be consumed as well. תמימה האליה: "the fat tail whole" ([Lev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009).md), cauda ovilla vel arietina eaque
crassa et adiposa; the same in Arabic (Ges. thes. p. 102). The fat tails
which the sheep have in Northern Africa and Egypt, also in Arabia,
especially Southern Arabia, and Syria, often weigh 15 lbs. or more, and
small carriages on wheels are sometimes placed under them to bear their
weight (Sonnini, R. ii. p. 358; Bochart, Hieroz. i. pp. 556ff.). It
consists of something between marrow and fat. Ordinary sheep are also
found in Arabia and Syria; but in modern Palestine all the sheep are "of
the broad-tailed species." The broad part of the tail is an excresence
of fat, from which the true tail hangs down (Robinson, Pal. ii. 166).
"Near the rump-bone shall he (the offerer) take it (the fat tail) away,"
i.e., separate it from the body. עצם, ἁπ. λεγ., is, according to Saad.,
os caudae s. coccygis, i.e., the rump or tail-bone, which passes over
into the vertebrae of the tail (cf. Bochart, i. pp. 560-1). In [Lev
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#011.md) and [Lev
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#016.md) the fat portions which were
burned are called "food of the firing for Jehovah," or "food of the
firing for a sweet savour," i.e., food which served as a firing for
Jehovah, or reached Jehovah by being burned; cf. [Num
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#024.md), "food of the firing of a sweet
savour for Jehovah." Hence not only are the daily burnt-offerings and
the burnt and sin-offerings of the different feasts called "food of
Jehovah" ("My bread," [Num 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#002).md); but
the sacrifices generally are described as "the food of God" ("the bread
of their God," [Lev 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#006.md), [Lev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#008.md), [Lev
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#017.md), [Lev
21:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#021.md), and [Lev
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#025).md), as food, that is, which Israel
produced and caused to ascend to its God in fire as a sweet smelling
savour. - Nothing is determined here with regard to the appropriation of
the flesh of the peace-offerings, as their destination for a sacrificial
meal was already known from traditional custom. The more minute
directions for the meal itself are given in Lev 7:11-36, where the
meaning of these sacrifices is more fully explained. - In [Lev
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017.md) ([Lev
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#016).md) the general rule is added, "all
fat belongs to Jehovah," and the law, "eat neither fat nor blood," is
enforced as "an eternal statute" for the generations of Israel (see at
[Exo 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014.md), [Exo
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#024).md) in all their dwelling-places
(see [Exo 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#023.md) and [Exo
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#020).md).
