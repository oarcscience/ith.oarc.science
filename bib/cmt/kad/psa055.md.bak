### [Psalms Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 55:0</span></span>

Prayer of One Who Is Maliciously Beset and Betrayed by His Friend

[Psa 54:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001.md) is followed by another
Davidic Psalm bearing the same inscription: To the Precentor, with
accompaniment of stringed instruments, a meditation, by David. It also
accords with the former in the form of the prayer with which it opens
(cf. [Psa 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002.md) with [Psa
54:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#003)..md); and it is the Elohimic
counterpart of the Jahve- [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md). If the Psalm is by David, we
require (in opposition to Hengstenberg) an assignable occasion for it in
the history of his life. For how could the faithless bosom friend, over
whom the complaint concerning malicious foes here, as in [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md), lingers with special sadness,
be a mere abstract personage; since it has in the person of Judas
Iscariot its historical living antitype in the life and passion of the
second David? This Old Testament Judas is none other than Ahithphel, the
right hand of Absalom. Ps 55 belongs, like [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md), to the four years during
which the rebellion of Absalom was forming; only to a somewhat later
period, when Absalom's party were so sure of their cause that they had
no need to make any secret of it. How it came to pass that David left
the beginnings and progressive steps of the rebellion of Absalom to take
their course without bringing any other weapon to bear against it than
the weapon of prayer, is discussed on [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md).

Hitzig also holds this Psalm to be Jeremianic. But it contains no
coincidences with the language and thoughts of Jeremiah worth speaking
of, excepting that this prophet, in [Psa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md), gives utterance to a similar wish
to that of the psalmist in [Psa 55:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#007.md),
and springing from the same motive. The argument in favour of Jeremiah
in opposition to David is consequently referred to the picture of life
and suffering which is presented in the Psalm; and it becomes a question
whether this harmonizes better with the persecuted life of Jeremiah or
of David. The exposition which follows here places itself - and it is at
least worthy of being attempted - on the standpoint of the writer of the
inscription.

[Psalms 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 55:1</span></span>

In this first group sorrow prevails. David spreads forth his deep grief
before God, and desires for himself some lonely spot in the wilderness
far away from the home or lurking-place of the confederate band of those
who are compassing his overthrow. "Veil not Thyself" here, where what is
spoken of is something audible, not visible, is equivalent to "veil not
Thine ear," [Lam 3:56](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#056.md), which He
designedly does, when the right state of heart leaves the praying one,
and consequently that which makes it acceptable and capable of being
answered is wanting to the prayer (cf. [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015).md). שׂיח signifies a shrub (Syriac
shucho, Arabic šı̂ḥ), and also reflection and care (Arabic, carefulness,
attention; Aramaic, סח, to babble, talk, discourse). The Hiph. חריד,
which in [Gen 27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040.md) signifies to lead
a roving life, has in this instance the signification to move one's self
backwards and forwards, to be inwardly uneasy; root רד, Arab. rd, to
totter, whence râda, jarûda, to run up and down (IV to desire, will);
raida, to shake (said of a soft bloated body); radda, to turn (whence
taraddud, a moving to and fro, doubting); therefore: I wander hither and
thither in my reflecting or meditating, turning restlessly from one
thought to another. It is not necessary to read ואחמיה after [Psa
77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004.md) instead of ועהימה, since the verb
הוּם = המה, [Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md), 12, is secured
by the derivatives. Since these only exhibit הוּם, and not הים (in
Arabic used more particularly of the raving of love), ואהימה, as also
אריד, is Hiph., and in fact like this latter used with an inward object:
I am obliged to raise a tumult or groan, break out into the dull
murmuring sounds of pain. The cohortative not unfrequently signifies "I
have to" or "I must" of incitements within one's self which are under
the control of outward circumstances. In this restless state of mind he
finds himself, and he is obliged to break forth into this cry of pain on
account of the voice of the foe which he cannot but hear; by reason of
the pressure or constraint (עקת) of the evil-doer which he is compelled
to feel. The conjecture צעקת (Olshausen and Hupfeld) is superfluous. עקה
is a more elegant Aramaizing word instead of צרה.

The second strophe begins with a more precise statement of that which
justifies his pain. The Hiph. חמיט signifies here, as in [Psa
140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011) (Chethb.md), declinare: they cast
or roll down evil (calamity) upon him and maliciously lay snares for him
בּאף, breathing anger against him who is conscious of having manifested
only love towards them. His heart turns about in his body, it writhes
(יהיל); cf. on this, [Psa 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011.md). Fear
and trembling take possession of his inward parts; יבא in the expression
יבא בי, as is always the case when followed by a tone syllable, is a
so-called נסוג אחור, i.e., it has the tone that has retreated to the
penult. ([Deu 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#038.md); [Isa
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#024.md); [Isa
60:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#020).md), although this is only with
difficulty discernible in our printed copies, and is therefore (vid.,
Accentsystem, vi. 2) noted with Mercha. The fut. consec. which follows
introduces the heightened state of terror which proceeds from this
crowding on of fear and trembling. Moreover, the wish that is thereby
urged from him, which David uttered to himself, is introduced in the
third strophe by a fut. consec.

(Note: That beautiful old song of the church concerning Jesus has grown
out of this strophe: -

Ecquis binas columbinas

Alas dabit animae?

Et in almam crucis palmam

Evolat citissime, etc.)

"Who will give me?" is equivalent to "Oh that I had!" Ges. 136, 1. In
ואשׁכּנה is involved the self-satisfying signification of settling down
([Eze 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#013).md), of coming to rest and
remaining in a place ([Sa2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010).md).
Without going out of our way, a sense perfectly in accordance with the
matter in hand may be obtained for אחישׁה מפלט לי, if אחישׁה is taken
not as Kal ([Psa 71:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#012).md), but after
[Isa 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md); [Isa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012.md), as Hiph.: I would hasten, i.e.,
quickly find for myself a place which might serve me as a shelter from
the raging wind, from the storm. רוּח סעה is equivalent to the Arabic
rihin sâijat-in, inasmuch as Arab. s‛â, "to move one's self quickly, to
go or run swiftly," can be said both of light (Koran, 66:8) and of
water-brooks (vid., Jones, Comm. Poes. Asiat., ed. Lipsiae, p. 358), and
also of strong currents of air, of winds, and such like. The correction
סערה, proposed by Hupfeld, produces a disfiguring tautology. Among those
about David there is a wild movement going on which is specially aimed
at his overthrow. From this he would gladly flee and hide himself, like
a dove taking refuge in a cleft of the rock from the approaching storm,
or from the talons of the bird of prey, fleeing with its noiseless but
persevering flight.

(Note: Kimchi observes that the dove, when she becomes tired, draws in
one wing and flies with the other, and thus the more surely escapes.
Aben-Ezra finds an allusion here to the carrier-pigeon.)

[Psalms 55:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 55:9</span></span>

In the second group anger is the prevailing feeling. In the city all
kinds of party passions have broken loose; even his bosom friend has
taken a part in this hostile rising. The retrospective reference to the
confusion of tongues at Babel which is contained in the word פּלּג (cf.
[Gen 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#025).md), also in remembrance of
בּלל ([Gen 11:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001).md), involves the
choice of the word בּלּע, which here, after [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003.md), denotes a swallowing up, i.e.,
annihilation by means of confounding and rendering utterly futile.
לשׁונם is the object to both imperatives, the second of which is פּלּג
(like the pointing usual in connection with a final guttural) for the
sake of similarity of sound. Instead of חמס וריב, the pointing is חמס
וריב, which is perfectly regular, because the וריב with a conjunctive
accent logically hurries on to בּעיר as its supplement.

(Note: Certain exceptions, however, exist, inasmuch as ו sometimes
remains even in connection with a disjunctive accent, [Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md); [Jer
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#010.md); [Jer
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016.md); and it is pointed ו in
connection with a conjunctive in [Gen
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#023.md); [Gen
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012.md); [Lev
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003.md); [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md); [Job
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#016.md); [Ecc
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008)..md)

The subjects to [Psa 55:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#011.md) are not
violence and strife (Hengstenberg, Hitzig), for it is rather a comical
idea to make these personified run round about upon the city walls; but
(cf. [Psa 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007.md), [Psa
59:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#015).md) the Absalomites, and in fact
the spies who incessantly watch the movements of David and his
followers, and who to this end roam about upon the heights of the city.
The narrative in 2 Sam. 15 shows how passively David looked on at this
movement, until he abandoned the palace of his own free will and quitted
Jerusalem The espionage in the circuit of the city is contrasted with
the movements going on within the city itself by the word בּקרב. We are
acquainted with but few details of the affair; but we can easily fill in
the details for ourselves in accordance with the ambitious, base, and
craftily malicious character of Absalom. The assertion that deceit
(מרמה) and the extremest madness had taken possession of the city is
confirmed in [Psa 55:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#013.md) by כּי. It is
not open enemies who might have had cause for it that are opposed to
him, but faithless friends, and among them that Ahithophel of Giloh, the
scum of perfidious ingratitude. The futures ואשּׂא and ואסּתר are used
as subjunctives, and ו is equivalent to alioqui, as in [Psa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018.md), cf. [Job
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014.md). He tells him to his face, to his
shame, the relationship in which he had stood to him whom he now
betrays. [Psa 55:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#014.md) is not to be
rendered: and thou art, etc., but: and thou (who dost act thus) wast,
etc.; for it is only because the principal clause has a retrospective
meaning that the futures נמתּיק and נהלּך describe what was a custom in
the past. The expression is designedly אנושׁ כּערכּי and not אישׁ כערכי;
David does not make him feel his kingly eminence, but places himself in
the relation to him of man to man, putting him on the same level with
himself and treating him as his equal. The suffix of כערכי is in this
instance not subjective as in the כערכך of the law respecting the asham
or trespass-offering: according to my estimation, but objectively: equal
to the worth at which I am estimated, that is to say, equally valued
with myself. What heart-piercing significance this word obtains when
found in the mouth of the second David, who, although the Son of God and
peerless King, nevertheless entered into the most intimate human
relationship as the Son of man to His disciples, and among them to that
Iscariot! אלּוּף from אלף, Arabic alifa, to be accustomed to anything,
assuescere, signifies one attached to or devoted to any one; and מידּא,
according to the Hebrew meaning of the verb ידע, an intimate
acquaintance. The first of the relative clauses in [Psa
55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015.md) describes their confidential
private intercourse; the second the unrestrained manifestation of it in
public. סוד here, as in [Job 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#019.md)
(vid., supra on [Psa 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014).md). המתּיק
סוד, to make friendly intercourse sweet, is equivalent to cherishing it.
רגשׁ stands over against סוד, just like סוד, secret counsel, and רגשׁה,
loud tumult, in [Psa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md). Here רגשׁ
is just the same as that which the Korahitic poet calls המון חוגג in
[Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md).

In the face of the faithless friends who has become the head of the
Absalomite faction David now breaks out, in [Psa
55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md), into fearful imprecations. The
Chethb is ישׁימות, desolationes (super eos); but this word occurs only
in the name of a place ("House of desolations"), and does not well suit
such direct reference to persons. On the other hand, the Ker ישּׁיאמות,
let death ensnare or impose upon them, gives a sense that is not to be
objected to; it is a pregnant expression, equivalent to: let death come
upon them unexpectedly. To this ישּׁיא corresponds the חיּים of the
second imprecation: let them go down alive into Hades (שׁאול, perhaps
originally שׁאולה, the ה of which may have been lost beside the ח that
follows), i.e., like the company of Korah, while their life is yet
vigorous, that is to say, let them die a sudden, violent death. The
drawing together of the decipiat (opprimat) mors into one word is the
result of the ancient scriptio continua and of the defective mode of
writing, ישּׁי, like יני, [Psa 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005.md),
אבי, [Kg1 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md). Bttcher renders it
differently: let death crash in upon them; but the future form ישּׁי =
ישׁאה from שׁאה = שׁאי is an imaginary one, which cannot be supported by
[Num 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030.md). Hitzig renders it: let
death benumb them (ישּׁים); but this gives an inconceivable figure, with
the turgidity of which the trepidantes Manes in Virgil, Aenid viii. 246,
do not admit of comparison. In the confirmation, [Psa
55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md), בּמגוּרם, together with the
בּקרבּם which follows, does not pretend to be any advance in the
thought, whether מגור be rendered a settlement, dwelling, παροικία (lxx,
Targum), or an assembly (Aquila, Symmachus, Jerome). Hence Hitzig's
rendering: in their shrine, in their breast (= ἐν τῷ θησαυρῷ τῆς καρδίας
αὐτῶν, [Luk 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#045).md), מגוּרם being short
for מגוּרתם in accordance with the love of contraction which prevails in
poetry (on [Psa 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005).md). But had the
poet intended to use this figure he would have written בּמגוּרת קרבם,
and is not the assertion that wickedness is among them, that it is at
home in them, really a climax? The change of the names of God in [Psa
55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017.md) is significant. He calls upon
Him who is exalted above the world, and He who mercifully interposes in
the history of the world helps him.

[Psalms 55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 55:17</span></span>

In the third group confidence prevails, the tone that is struck up in
[Psa 55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017.md) being carried forward.
Evening morning, and noon, as the beginning, middle, and close of the
day, denote the day in its whole compass or extent: David thus gives
expression to the incessancy with which he is determined to lay before
God, both in the quiet of his spirit and in louder utterances,
whatsoever moves him. The fut. consec. ויּשׁמע connects the hearing
(answer) with the prayer as its inevitable result. Also in the praet.
פּדה expression is given to the certainty of faith; and בּשׁלום side by
side with it denotes, with the same pregnancy of meaning as in [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md), the state of undisturbed
outward and inward safety and prosperity, into which God removes his
soul when He rescues him. If we read mi-kerob, then קרב is, as the
ancient versions regard it, the infinitive: ne appropinquent mihi;
whereas since the time of J. H. Michaelis the preference has been given
to the pronunciation mi-kerāb: a conflictu mihi sc. parato, in which
case it would be pointed מקּרב־ (with Metheg), whilst the MSS, in order
to guard against the reading with ā, point it מקּרב־. Hitzig is right
when he observes, that after the negative מן the infinitive is indicated
beforehand, and that לי = עלי, [Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md), is better suited to this.
Moreover, the confirmatory clause [Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md) is connected with what precedes
in a manner less liable to be misunderstood if מקרב is taken as
infinitive: that they may not be able to gain any advantage over me,
cannot come near me to harm me ([Psa
91:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010).md). For it is not until now less
precarious to take the enemies as the subject of היוּ, and to take עמּדי
in a hostile sense, as in [Job 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#017.md);
[Job 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#019.md); [Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md); [Job
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md), cf. עם [Psa
94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016.md), and this is only possible where
the connection suggests this sense. Heidenheim's interpretation: among
the magnates were those who succoured me (viz., Hushai, Zadok, and
Abiathar, by whom the counsel of Athithopel was frustrated), does not
give a thought characteristic of the Psalms. And with Aben-Ezra, who
follows Numeri Rabba 294a, to think of the assistance of angels in
connection with בּרבּים, certainly strongly commends itself in view of
[Kg2 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016.md) (with which Hitzig also
compares [Ch2 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#007).md); here, however, it
has no connection, whereas the thought, "as many (consisting of many)
are they with me, i.e., do they come forward and fight with me," is very
loosely attached to what has gone before. The Beth essentiae serves
here, as it does frequently, e.g., [Psa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md), to denote the qualification of
the subject. The preterite of confidence is followed in [Psa
55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020.md) by the future of hope. Although
side by side with שׁמע, ענה presumptively has the signification to
answer, i.e., to be assured of the prayer being heard, yet this meaning
is in this instance excluded by the fact that the enemies are the
object, as is required by [Psa 55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020.md)
(even if [Psa 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md) is understood of
those who are on the side of the poet). The rendering of the lxx:
εἰσακούσεται ὁ Θεὸς καὶ ταπεινώσει αὐτοὺς ὁ ὑπάρχων πρὸ τῶν αἰώνων, is
appropriate, but requires the pronunciation to be ויעשנּם, since the
signification to bow down, to humble, cannot be proved to belong either
to Kal or Hiphil. But even granted that יענם might, according to [Kg1
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#035) (vid., Keil.md), signify ταπεινώσει
αὐτοὺς, it is nevertheless difficult to believe that ויענם is not
intended to have a meaning correlative with ישׁמע, of which it is the
continuation. Saadia has explained יענם in a manner worthy of attention,
as being for יענה בם, he will testify against them; an interpretation
which Aben-Ezra endorses. Hengstenberg's is better: "God will hear (the
tumult of the enemies) and answer them (judicially)." The original text
may have been ויענמו ישׁב קדם. But as it now stands, וישׁב קדם
represents a subordinate clause, with the omission of the הוּא, pledging
that judicial response: since He it is who sitteth enthroned from
earliest times (vid., on [Psa 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010).md).
The bold expression ישׁב קדם is an abbreviation of the view of God
expressed in [Psa 74:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012.md), [Hab
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md), cf. [Deu
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#027.md), as of Him who from primeval
days down to the present sits enthroned as King and Judge, who therefore
will be able even at the present time to maintain His majesty, which is
assailed in the person of His anointed one.

[Psa 55:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md)

In spite of this interruption and the accompanying clashing in of the
music. אשׁר .ci with its dependent clause continues the ויאנם, more
minutely describing those whom God will answer in His wrath. The
relative clause at the same time gives the ground for this their fate
from the character they bear: they persevere in their course without any
regard to any other in their godlessness. The noun חליפה, which is used
elsewhere of a change of clothes, of a reserve in time of war, of a
relief of bands of workmen, here signifies a change of mind (Targum), as
in [Job 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014.md) a change of condition;
the plural means that every change of this kind is very far from them.
In [Psa 55:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#021.md) David again has the one
faithless foe among the multitude of the rebels before his mind. שׁלמיו
is equivalent to שׁלמים אתּו, [Gen
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#021.md), those who stood in peaceful
relationship to him (שׁלום, [Psa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010).md). David classes himself with his
faithful adherents. בּרית is here a defensive and offensive treaty of
mutual fidelity entered into in the presence of God. By שׁלח and חלּל is
meant the intention which, though not carried out as yet, is already in
itself a violation and profanation of the solemn compact. In [Psa
55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022.md) the description passes into the
tone of the caesural schema. It is impossible for מחמאת, so far as the
vowels are concerned, to be equivalent to מחמאות, since this change of
the vowels would obliterate the preposition; but one is forbidden to
read מחמאות (Targum, Symmachus, Jerome) by the fact that פּיו (lxx τοῦ
προσώπου αὐτοῦ, as in [Pro 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006).md) cannot
be the subject to חלקוּ. Consequently מ belongs to the noun itself, and
the denominative מחמאות (from חמאה), like מעדנּות (from עדן), dainties,
signifies articles of food prepared from curdled milk; here it is used
figuratively of "milk-words" or "butter-words" which come from the lips
of the hypocrite softly, sweetly, and supplely as cream: os nectar
promit, mens aconita vomit. In the following words וּקרב־לבּו (וּקרב)
the Makkeph (in connection with which it would have to be read ukerob
just the same as in [Psa 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md), since
the - has not a Metheg) is to be crossed out (as in fact it is even
wanting here and there in MSS and printed editions). The words are an
independent substantival clause: war (קרב, a pushing together, assault,
battle, after the form כּתב mrof eh with an unchangeable â) is his
inward part and his words are swords; these two clauses correspond.
רכּוּ (properly like Arab. rkk, to be thin, weak, then also: to be soft,
mild; root רך, רק, tendere, tenuare) has the accent on the ultima, vid.,
on [Psa 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#020.md). פּתיחה is a drawn,
unsheathed sword ([Psa 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#014).md).

The exhortation, [Psa 55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023.md), which
begins a new strophe and is thereby less abrupt, is first of all a
counsel which David gives to himself, but at the same time to all who
suffer innocently, cf. [Psa 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md).
Instead of the obscure ἅπαξ γεγραμ. יהבך, we read in [Psa
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005.md) דרכך, and in [Pro
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#003.md) מעשׂיך, according to which the
word is not a verb after the form ידעך (Chajug', Gecatilia, and Kimchi),
but an accusative of the object (just as it is in fact accented; for the
Legarme of יהוה has a lesser disjunctive value than the Zinnor of יהבך).
The lxx renders it ἐπίῤῥιψον ἐπὶ κύριον τὴν μέριμνάν σου. Thus are these
words of the Psalm applied in [Pe1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md). According to the Talmud יהב (the
same form as קרב) signifies a burden. "One day," relates Rabba
bar-Chana, B. Rosh ha-Shana, 26b, and elsewhere, "I was walking with an
Arabian (Nabataean?) tradesman, and happened to be carrying a heavy
pack. And he said to me, שׁקיל יהביך ושׁדי אגמלאי, Take thy burden and
throw it on my camel." Hence it is wiser to refer יהב to יהב, to give,
apportion, than to a stem יהב = יאב, [Psa
119:131](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#131) (root אב, או.md), to desire; so
that it consequently does not mean desiring, longing, care, but that
which is imposed, laid upon one, assigned or allotted to one (Bttcher),
in which sense the Chaldee derivatives of יהב (Targum [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md); [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005), for מנת.md) do actually occur. On
whomsoever one casts what is allotted to him to carry, to him one gives
it to carry. The admonition proceeds on the principle that God is as
willing as He is able to bear even the heaviest burden for us; but this
bearing it for us is on the other side our own bearing of it in God's
strength, and hence the promise that is added runs: He will sustain thee
(כּלכּל), that thou mayest not through feebleness succumb. [Psa
55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023.md) also favours this figure of a
burden: He will not give, i.e., suffer to happen ([Psa
78:66](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#066).md), tottering to the righteous for
ever, He will never suffer the righteous to totter. The righteous shall
never totter (or be moved) with the overthrow that follows; whereas
David is sure of this, that his enemies shall not only fall to the
ground, but go down into Hades (which is here, by a combination of two
synonyms, בּאר שׁחת, called a well, i.e., an opening, of a sinking in,
i.e., a pit, as e.g., in [Pro 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031.md);
[Eze 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003).md), and that before they have
halved their days, i.e., before they have reached the half of the age
that might be attained under other circumstances (cf. [Psa
102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md); [Jer
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011).md). By ואתּה אלהים prominence is
given to the fact that it is the very same God who will not suffer the
righteous to fall who casts down the ungodly; and by ואני David
contrasts himself with them, as being of good courage now and in all
time to come.
