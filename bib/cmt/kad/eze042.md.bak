[Ezekiel 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md)

The Cell-Building in the Outer Court for Holy Use

[Eze 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md). And he brought me out into
the outer court by the way toward the north, and brought me to the
cell-building, which was opposite to the separate place, and opposite to
the building toward the north, [Eze
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002.md). Before the long side of a
hundred cubits, with the door toward the north, and the breadth fifty
cubits, [Eze 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003.md). Opposite to the
twenty of the inner court and opposite to the stone pavement of the
outer-court; gallery against gallery was in the third storey. [Eze
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004.md). And before the cells a walk, ten
cubits broad; to the inner a way of a hundred cubits; and their doors
went to the north. [Eze 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md). And the
upper cells were shortened, because the galleries took away space from
them, in comparison with the lower and the central ones in the building.
[Eze 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#006.md). For they were
three-storied, and had no columns, like the columns of the courts;
therefore a deduction was made from the lower and from the central ones
from the ground. [Eze 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#007.md). And a wall
outside parallel with the cells ran toward the outer court in front of
the cells; its length fifty cubits. [Eze
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#008.md). For the length of the cells of
the outer court was fifty cubits, and, behold, against the sanctuary it
was a hundred cubits. [Eze 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#009.md). And
out from underneath it rose up these cells; the entrance was from the
east, when one went to them from the outer court. [Eze
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#010.md). In the breadth of the court
wall toward the south, before the separate place and before the
building, there were cells, [Eze
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#011.md). With a way before them, like
the cells, which stood toward the north, as according to their length so
according to their breadth, and according to all their exits as
according to all their arrangements. And as their doorways, [Eze
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#012.md). So were also the doorways of
the cells, which were toward the south, an entrance at the head of the
way, of the way opposite to the corresponding wall, of the way from the
east when one came to them. [Eze
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013.md). And he said to me, The cells in
the north, the cells in the south, which stood in front of the separate
place, are the holy cells where the priests, who draw near to Jehovah,
shall eat the most holy thing; there they shall place the most holy
thing, both the meat-offering and the sin-offering and the
trespass-offering; for the place is holy. [Eze
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014.md). When they go in, the priests,
they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court; but there
shall they place their clothes, in which they perform the service, for
they are holy; they shall put on other clothes, and so draw near to what
belongs to the people.

It is evident from [Eze 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013.md) and [Eze
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014.md), which furnish particulars
concerning the cells already described, that the description itself
refers to two cell-buildings only, one on the north side and the other
on the south side of the separate place (see Plate I L). Of these the
one situated on the north is described in a more circumstantial manner
([Eze 42:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001).md); that on the south, on
the contrary, is merely stated in the briefest manner to have resembled
the other in the main ([Eze 42:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#010).md).
That these two cell-buildings are not identical either with those
mentioned in [Eze 40:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044.md). or with those
of [Eze 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017.md), as Hvernick supposes,
but are distinct from both, is so obvious that it is impossible to
understand how they could ever have been identified. The difference in
the description is sufficient to show that they are not the same as
those in [Eze 40:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044.md). The cells
mentioned in [Eze 40:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044.md) were set apart
as dwelling-places for the priests during their administration of the
service in the holy place and at the altar; whereas these serve as
places for depositing the most holy sacrificial gifts and the official
dresses of the priests. To this may be added the difference of
situation, which distinguishes those mentioned here both from those of
[Eze 40:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044.md)., and also from those of
[Eze 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017.md). Those in [Eze
40:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044.md) were in the inner court, ours in
the outer. It is true that those mentioned in [Eze
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017.md) were also in the latter, but in
entirely different situations, as the description of the position of
those noticed in the chapter before us indisputably proves. Ezekiel is
led out of the inner court into the outer, by the way in the direction
toward the north, to הלּשׁכּה, the cell-building (that הלּשׁכּה is used
here in a collective sense is evident from the plural לשׁכות in [Eze
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004.md), [Eze
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005).md). This stood opposite to the
gizrah, i.e., the separate space behind the temple house ([Eze
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012)..md), and opposite to the בּנין,
i.e., neither the outer court wall, which is designated as בּנין in [Eze
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md), but cannot be intended here,
where there is no further definition, nor the temple house, as Kliefoth
imagines, for this is invariably called הבּית. We have rather to
understand by הבּנין the building upon the gizrah described in [Eze
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012.md)., to which no valid objection
can be offered on the ground of the repetition of the relative ואשׁר, as
it is omitted in [Eze 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#010.md), and in
general simply serves to give greater prominence to the second
definition in the sense of "and, indeed, opposite to the building (sc.,
of the separate place) toward the north."

As אל־הצּפון belongs to אשׁר as a more precise definition of the
direction indicated by נגד, the 'אל־פּני א which follows in [Eze
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002.md) depends upon ויביאני, and is
co-ordinate with אל־הלּשׁכּה, defining the side of the cell-building to
which Ezekiel was taken: "to the face of the length," i.e., to the long
side of the building, which extended to a hundred cubits. The article in
המּאה requires that the words should be connected in this manner, as it
could not be used if the words were intended to mean "on the surface of
a length of a hundred cubits." Since, then, the separate place was also
a hundred cubits, that is to say, of the same length as the
cell-building opposite to it, we might be disposed to assume that as the
separate place reached to the outer court wall on the west, the
cell-building also extended to the latter with its western narrow side.
But this would be at variance with the fact that, according to [Eze
46:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#019.md), the sacrificial kitchens for
the priests stood at the western end of this portion of the court, and
therefore behind the cell-building. The size of these kitchens is not
given; but judging from the size of the sacrificial kitchens for the
people ([Eze 46:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#022).md), we must reserve a
space of forty cubits in length; and consequently the cell-building,
which was a hundred cubits long, if built close against the kitchens,
would reach the line of the back wall of the temple house with its front
(or eastern) narrow side, since, according to the calculation given in
the comm. on [Eze 41:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md), this wall
was forty cubits from the front of the separate place, so that there was
no prominent building standing opposite to the true sanctuary on the
northern or southern side, by which any portion of it could have been
concealed. And not only is there no reason for leaving a vacant space
between the sacrificial kitchens and the cell-buildings, but this is
precluded by the fact that if the kitchens had been separated from the
cell building by an intervening space, it would have been necessary to
carry the holy sacrificial flesh from the kitchen to the cell in which
it was eaten, after being cooked, across a portion of the outer court.
It is not stated here how far this cell-building was from the northern
boundary of the gizrah, and the open space (מנּח) surrounding the temple
house; but this may be inferred from [Eze
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010.md), according to which the
intervening space between the munnach and the cells was twenty cubits.
For the cells mentioned there can only be those of our cell-building, as
there were no other cells opposite to the northern and southern sides of
the temple house. But if the distance of the southern longer side of the
cell-building, so far as it stood opposite to the temple house, was only
twenty cubits, the southern wall of the cell-building coincided with the
boundary wall of the inner court, so that it could be regarded as a
continuation of that wall. - The further definition פּתח , door to the
north, is to be taken as subordinate to the preceding clause, in the
sense of "with the door to the north," because it would otherwise come
in between the accounts of the length and breadth of the building, so as
to disturb the connection. The breadth of the building corresponds to
the breadth of the gate-buildings of the inner court.

The meaning of the third verse is a subject of dispute. "האשׂרים," says
Bttcher, "is difficult on account of the article as well as the number,
inasmuch as, with the exception of the twenty cubits left open in the
temple ground ([Eze 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010).md), there are
no אשׂרים mentioned as belonging to the actual 'חצר הפן, and the numeral
does not stand with sufficient appropriateness by the side of the
following רצפה." But there is not sufficient weight in the last
objection to render the reference to the twenty cubits a doubtful one,
since the "twenty cubits" is simply a contracted form of expression for
"the space of twenty cubits," and this space forms a fitting antithesis
to the pavement (רצפה), i.e., the paved portion of the court. Moreover,
it is most natural to supply the missing substantive to the "twenty"
from the אמּות mentioned just before, - much more natural certainly than
to supply לשׁכות, as there is no allusion either before or afterwards to
any other cells than those whose situation is intended to be defined
according to the twenty. We therefore agree with J. H. Michaelis,
Rosenmller, Hvernick, and Hitzig, that the only admissible course is to
supply אמּות; for the description of the priests' cells in [Eze
40:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044.md), to which Kliefoth imagines that
האשׂרים refers, is far too distant for us to be able to take the word
לשׁכות thence and supply it to העשׂרים. And again, the situation of
these priests' cells to the east of the cell-building referred to here
does not harmonize with the נגד, as the second definition introduced by
the correlative ונגד points to the stone pavement on the north. East and
north do not form such a vis--vis as the double נגד requires. - Our view
of the העשׂרים eht is also in harmony with the explanatory relative
clause, "which were to the inner court," i.e., belonged to it. For the
open space of twenty cubits' breadth, which ran by the long side of the
temple house between the munnach belonging to the temple and the wall of
the inner court, formed the continuation of the inner court which
surrounded the temple house on the north, west, and south.

(Note: The statement of Kliefoth, that "this space of twenty cubits in
breadth did not belong to the inner court at all," cannot be established
from [Eze 40:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#047.md), where the size of the
inner court is given as a hundred cubits in length and the same in
breadth. For this measurement simply refers to the space in front of the
temple.)

If, therefore, this first definition of the נגד refers to what was
opposite to the cell-building on the south, the second נגד defines what
stood opposite to it on the northern side. There the portion of the
outer court which was paved with stones ran along the inner side of the
surrounding wall. This serves to define as clearly as possible the
position of the broad side of the cell-building. For Kliefoth and Hitzig
are right in connecting these definitions with [Eze
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002.md), and taking the words from אתּיק
onwards as introducing a fresh statement. Even the expression itself
אל־פּני אתּיק does not properly harmonize with the combination of the
two halves of the third verse as one sentence, as Bttcher proposes,
thus: "against the twenty cubits of the inner court and against the
pavement of the outer court there ran gallery in front of gallery
threefold." For if the galleries of the building were opposite to the
pavement on the north, and to the space in front of the temple on the
south of the building, they must of necessity have run along the
northern and southern walls of the building in a parallel direction, and
אל־פּני is not the correct expression for this. אל־פּני, to the front -
that is to say, one gallery to the front of the other, or up to the
other. This could only be the case if the galleries surrounded the
building on all four sides, or at any rate on three; for with the latter
arrangement, the gallery upon the eastern side would terminate against
those on the southern and northern sides. Again, the rendering
"threefold," or into the threefold, cannot be defended either from the
usage of the language or from the facts. The only other passage in which
the plural שׁלשׁים occurs is [Gen
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#016.md), where it signifies chambers, or
rooms of the third storey, and the singular שׁלשׁי means the third.
Consequently בּשׁלשׁים is "in the third row of chambers or rooms," i.e.,
in the third storey. And so far as the fact is concerned, it does not
follow from the allusion to upper, central, and lower cells ([Eze
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md) and [Eze
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#006).md), that there were galleries round
every one of the three storeys.

[Eze 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004.md). "Before the cells there was
a walk of ten cubits' breadth" (m). In what sense we are to understand
לפני, "before," whether running along the northern longer side of the
building, or in front of the eastern wall, depends upon the explanation
of the words which follow, and chiefly of the words דּרך אמּה אחת, by
which alone the sense in which אל־הפּנימית is to be understood can also
be determined. Hvernick and Kliefoth take דּרך אמּה אחת, "a way of one
cubit," in the sense of "the approaches (entrances into the rooms) were
a cubit broad." But the words cannot possibly have this meaning; not
only because the collective use of דּרך after the preceding מהלך, which
is not collective, and with the plural פּתחיהם following, is extremely
improbable, if not impossible; but principally because דּרך, a way, is
not synonymous with מבוא, an entrance, or פּתח, a doorway. Moreover, an
entrance, if only a cubit in breadth, to a large building would be much
too narrow, and bear no proportion whatever to the walk of ten cubits in
breadth. It is impossible to get any suitable meaning from the words as
they stand, "a way of one cubit;" and no other course remains than to
alter אמה אחת into מאה אמּת, after the ἐπὶ πήχεις ἑκατόν of the
Septuagint. There is no question that we have such a change of מאה into
אמּה in [Eze 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md), where even the
Rabbins acknowledge that it has occurred. And when once מאה had been
turned into אמּה, this change would naturally be followed by the
alteration of אמת into a numeral - that is to say, into אחת. The
statement itself, "a way of a hundred cubits" (in length), might be
taken as referring to the length of the walk in front of the cells, as
the cell-building was a hundred cubits long. But אל־הפּנימית is hardly
reconcilable with this. If, for example, we take these words in
connection with the preceding clause, "a walk of ten cubits broad into
the interior," the statement, "a way of a hundred cubits," does not
square with this. For if the walk which ran in front of the cells was a
hundred cubits long, it did not lead into the interior of the
cell-building, but led past it to the outer western wall. We must
therefore take אל־הפּנימית in connection with what follows, so that it
corresponds to לפני הלשׁכות: in front of the cells there was a walk of
ten cubits in breadth, and to the inner there led a way of a hundred
cubits in length. הפּנימית would then signify, not the interior of the
cell-building, but the inner court (החצר הפּנימית, [Eze
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017.md); [Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027), etc..md). This explanation derives
its principal support from the circumstance that, according to [Eze
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#009.md) and [Eze
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#011.md), a way ran from the east, i.e.,
from the steps of the inner court gates, on the northern and southern
sides, to the cell-buildings on the north and south of the separate
place, the length of which, from the steps of the gate-buildings already
mentioned to the north-eastern and south-eastern corners of our
cell-buildings, was exactly a hundred cubits, as we may see from the
plan in Plate I. This way (l) was continued in the walk in front of the
cells (m), and may safely be assumed to have been of the same breadth as
the walk. - The last statement of the fourth verse is perfectly clear;
the doorways to the cells were turned toward the north, so that one
could go from the walk in front of the cells directly into the cells
themselves.

In [Eze 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md) and [Eze
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#006.md) there follow certain statements
concerning the manner in which the cells were built. The building
contained upper, lower, and middle cells; so that it was three-storied.
This is expressed in the words כּי משׁלּשׁות , "for the cells were
tripled;" three rows stood one above another. But they were not all
built alike; the upper ones were shortened in comparison with the lower
and the central ones, i.e., were shorter than these (מן before התּחתּנות
and התּיכונות is comparative); "for galleries ate away part of them" -
that is to say, took away a portion of them (יוכלוּ for יאכלוּ, in an
architectural sense, to take away from). How far this took place is
shown in the first two clauses of the sixth verse, the first of which
explains the reference to upper, lower, and middle cells, while the
second gives the reason for the shortening of the upper in comparison
with the lower and the central cones. As the three rows of cells built
one above another had no columns on which the galleries of the upper row
could rest, it was necessary, in order to get a foundation for the
gallery of the third storey, that the cells should be thrown back from
the outer wall, or built as far inwards as the breadth of the gallery
required. This is expressly stated in the last clause, 'על־כּן נאצל וגו.
נאצל, with an indefinite subject: there was deducted from the lower and
the middle cells from the ground, sc. which these rooms covered. מהארץ
is added for the purpose of elucidation. From the allusion to the
columns of the courts we may see that the courts had colonnades, like
the courts in the Herodian temple, and probably also in that of Solomon,
though their character is nowhere described, and no allusion is made to
them in the description of the courts.

The further statements concerning this cell-building in [Eze
42:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#007.md) are obscure. גּדר is a wall
serving to enclose courtyards, vineyards, and the like. The predicate to
וגּדר follows in אל־פּני הלשׁכות: a boundary wall ran along the front of
the cells (אל־פּני stands for על־פּני rof sdn, as the corresponding
על־פּני ההיכל in [Eze 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#008) shows.md). The
course of this wall (n) is more precisely defined by the relative
clause, "which ran outwards parallel with the cells in the direction of
the outer court," i.e., toward the outer court. The length of this wall
was fifty cubits. It is evident from this that the wall did not run
along the north side of the building, - for in that case it must have
been a hundred cubits in length, - but along the narrow side, the length
of which was fifty cubits. Whether it was on the western or eastern side
cannot be determined with certainty from [Eze
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#007.md), although אל פּני favours the
eastern, i.e., the front side, rather than the western side, or back.
And what follows is decisive in favour of the eastern narrow side. In
explanation of the reason why this wall was fifty cubits long, it is
stated in [Eze 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#008.md) that "the length
of the cells, which were to the outer court, was fifty cubits; but,
behold, toward the temple front a hundred cubits." Consequently "the
cells which the outer court had" can only be the cells whose windows
were toward the outer court - that is to say, those on the eastern
narrow side of the building; for the sacrificial kitchens were on the
western narrow side ([Eze 46:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#019).md).
The second statement in [Eze 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#008.md),
which is introduced by הנּה is an indication of something important, is
intended to preclude any misinterpretation of ארך הלשׁ' fo noitat, as
though by length we must necessarily understand the extension of the
building from east to west, as in [Eze
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002.md) and most of the other
measurements. The use of ארך for the extension of the narrow side of the
building is also suggested by the ארכוּ, "length of the wall," in [Eze
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#007.md), where רחב would have been
inadmissible, because רחב, the breadth of a wall, would have been taken
to mean its thickness. פּני ההיכל is the outer side of the temple house
which faced the north.

A further confirmation of the fact that the boundary wall was situated
on the eastern narrow side of the building is given in the first clause
of the ninth verse, in which, however, the reading fluctuates. The
Chetib gives מתּחתּהּ לשׁכות, the Keri מתּחת הלשׁכות. But as we
generally find, the Keri is an alteration for the worse, occasioned by
the objection felt by the Masoretes, partly to the unusual circumstance
that the singular form of the suffix is attached to תּחת, whereas it
usually takes the suffixes in the plural form, and partly to the
omission of the article from לשׁכות by the side of the demonstrative
האלּה, which is defined by the article. But these two deviations from
the ordinary rule do not warrant any alterations, as there are analogies
in favour of both. תּחת has a singular suffix not only in תּחתּנּה ([Gen
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021).md) and תּחתּני ([Sa2
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#037.md), [Sa2
22:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#040.md), and [Sa2
22:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#048).md), instead of תּחתּי ([Psa
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#037.md), [Psa
18:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040.md),[Psa
18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048).md), which may undoubtedly be
explained on the ground that the direction whither is thought of (Ges.
103. 1, Anm. 3), but also in תּחתּם, which occurs more frequently than
תּחתּיהם, and that without any difference in the meaning (compare, for
example, [Deu 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012.md), [Deu
2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#021.md); [Jos
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#007.md); [Job
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024.md), and [Job
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#012.md), with [Kg1
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#024.md); [Ch1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022.md); [Ch2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#010).md). And לשׁכות האלּה is analogous
to הר in [Zac 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007.md), and many other
combinations, in which the force of the definition (by means of the
article) is only placed in the middle for the sake of convenience (vid.,
Ewald, ֗293a). If, therefore, the Chetib is to be taken without reserve
as the original reading, the suffix in תּחתּהּ can only refer to גּדר,
which is of common gender: from underneath the wall were these cells,
i.e., the cells turned toward the outer court; and the meaning is the
following: toward the bottom these cells were covered by the wall, which
ran in front of them, so that, when a person coming toward them from the
east fixed his eyes upon these cells, they appeared to rise out of the
wall. Kliefoth, therefore, who was the first to perceive the true
meaning of this clause, has given expression to the conjecture that the
design of the wall was to hide the windows of the lower row of cells
which looked toward the east, so that, when the priests were putting on
their official clothes, they might not be seen from the outside. - המבוא
commences a fresh statement. To connect these words with the preceding
clause ("underneath these cells was the entrance from the east"), as
Bttcher has done, yields no meaning with which a rational idea can
possibly be associated, unless the מן in מתּחתּהּ be altogether ignored.
The lxx have therefore changed וּמתּחתּהּ, which was unintelligible to
them, into καὶ αἱ θύραι (ופתחי), and Hitzig has followed them in doing
so. No such conjecture is necessary if וּמתּחתּהּ be rightly
interpreted, for in that case המבוא must be the commencement of a new
sentence. המבוא (by the side of which the senseless reading of the Keri
המּביא cannot be taken into consideration for a moment) is the approach,
or the way which led to the cells. This was from the east, from the
outer court, not from the inner court, against the northern boundary of
which the building stood. מהחצר החצנה is not to be taken in connection
with בּבאו להנּה, but is co-ordinate with מהקּדים, of which it is an
explanatory apposition.

In [Eze 42:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#010.md) the cell-building on
the south of the separate place is described, though very briefly; all
that is said in addition to the notice of its situation being, that it
resembled the northern one in its entire construction. But there are
several difficulties connected with the explanation of these verses,
which are occasioned, partly by an error in the text, partly by the
unmeaning way in which the Masoretes have divided the text, and finally,
in part by the brevity of the mode of expression. In the first clause of
[Eze 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#010.md), הקּדים is a copyist's
error for הדּרום, which has arisen from the fact that it is preceded by
מהקּדים ([Eze 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#009).md). For there is an
irreconcilable discrepancy between דּרך הקּדים and אל־פּני הגּזרה, which
follows. The building stood against, or upon, the broad side (רחב) of
the wall of the court, i.e., the wall which separated the inner court
from the outer, opposite to the separate place and the building upon it
(אל פּני, from the outer side hither, is practically equivalent to נגד
in [Eze 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md); and הבּנין is to be
taken in the same sense here and there). The relation in which this
cell-building stands to the separate place tallies exactly with the
description given of the former one in [Eze
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002.md). If, then, according to [Eze
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002.md), the other stood to the north of
the separate place, this must necessarily have stood to the south of it,
- that is to say, upon the broad side of the wall of the court, not in
the direction toward the east (דּרך הקּדים), but in that toward the
south (דּרך הדּרום), as is expressly stated in [Eze
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#012.md) and [Eze
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013.md) also. Kliefoth has affirmed, it
is true, in opposition to this, that "the breadth of the wall enclosing
the inner court must, as a matter of course, have been the eastern side
of the inner court;" but on the eastern side of the wall of the inner
court there was not room for a cell-building of a hundred cubits in
length, as the wall was only thirty-seven cubits and a half long (broad)
on each side of the gate-building. If, however, one were disposed so to
dilute the meaning of 'בּרחב גּדר הח as to make it affirm nothing more
than that the building stood upon, or against, the breadth of the wall
of the court to the extent of ten or twenty cubits, and with the other
eighty or ninety cubits stood out into the outer court, as Kliefoth has
drawn it upon his "ground plan;" it could not possibly be described as
standing אל־פּני הגּזרה, because it was not opposite to (in face of) the
gizrah, but was so far removed from it, that only the north-west corner
would be slightly visible from the south-east corner of the gizrah. And
if we consider, in addition to this, that in [Eze
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013.md) and [Eze
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014.md), where the intention of the
cell-buildings described in [Eze
42:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md) is given, only cells on the
north and on the south are mentioned as standing אל־פּני הגּזרה, there
can be no doubt that by רחב we are to understand the broad side of the
wall which bounded the inner court on the south side from east to west,
and that דּרך הקּדים should be altered into דּרך הדּרום.

In [Eze 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#011.md) the true meaning has
been obscured by the fact that the Masoretic verses are so divided as to
destroy the sense. The words ודּרך לפּניהם belong to לשׁכות in [Eze
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#010.md) : "cells and a way before them,"
i.e., cells with a way in front. דּרך corresponds to the מהלך in [Eze
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004.md). - כּמראה, like the appearance =
appearing, or constructed like, does not belong to דּרך in the sense of
made to conform to the way in front of the cells, but to לשׁכות, cells
with a way in front, conforming to the cells toward the north. The
further clauses from כּארכּן to וּכמשׁפּטיהן are connected together, and
contain two statements, loosely subordinated to the preceding notices,
concerning the points in which the cells upon the southern side were
made to conform to those upon the northern; so that they really depend
upon כּמראה, and to render them intelligible in German (English tr.)
must be attached by means of a preposition: "with regard to," or
"according to" (secundum). Moreover, the four words contain two
co-ordinated comparisons; the first expressed by keen כּן...כּ, the
second simply indicated by the particle כּ before משׁפּטיהן (cf. Ewald,
360a). The suffixes of all four words refer to the cells in the north,
which those in the south were seen to resemble in the points referred
to. The meaning is this: the cells in the south were like the cells in
the north to look at, as according to their length so according to their
breadth, and according to all their exits as according to their
arrangements (משׁפּטים, lit., the design answering to their purpose,
i.e., the manner of their arrangement and their general character: for
this meaning, compare [Exo 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#030.md); [Kg2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#007).md). The last word of the verse,
וּכפתחיהן, belongs to [Eze 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#012.md),
viz., to וּכפתחי הלשׁ', the comparison being expressed by כ-וּך, as in
[Jos 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#011.md); [Dan
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#029.md); [Sa1
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#024) (cf. Ewald, l.c..md). Another
construction also commences with כפתחיהן. וּכפתחיהן is a nominative: and
like their doors (those of the northern cells), so also were the doors
of the cells situated toward the south. Consequently there is no
necessity either to expunge וּכפתחי arbitrarily as a gloss, for which
procedure even the lxx could not be appealed to, or to assent to the
far-fetched explanation by which Kliefoth imagines that he has
discovered an allusion to a third cell-building in these words. - Light
is thrown upon the further statements in [Eze
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#012.md) by the description of the
northern cells. "A door was at the head," i.e., at the beginning of the
way. דּרך corresponds to the way of a hundred cubits in [Eze
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004.md), and ראשׁ דּרך is the point where
this way, which ran to the southern gate-building of the inner court,
commenced - that is to say, where it met the walk in front of the cells
([Eze 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004).md). The further statement
concerning this way is not quite clear to us, because the meaning of the
ἁπ. λεγ. חגינה is uncertain. In the Chaldee and Rabbinical writings the
word signifies decens, conveniens. If we take it in this sense, הגּדרת
חגינה is the wall corresponding (to these cells), i.e., the wall which
ran in front of the eastern narrow side of the building parallel to the
cells, the wall of fifty cubits in length described in [Eze
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#007.md) in connection with the northern
building (for the omission of the article before חגינה after the
substantive which it defines, compare [Eze
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#027.md); [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021), etc..md). בּפּני, in conspectu,
which is not perfectly synonymous with לפני, also harmonizes with this.
For the way referred to was exactly opposite to this wall at its upper
end, inasmuch as the wall joined the way at right angles. The last words
of [Eze 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#012.md) are an abbreviated
repetition of [Eze 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#009.md); דּרך הקּדים
is equivalent to המבוא מהקּדים, the way from the east on coming to them,
i.e., as one went to these cells.

According to [Eze 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013.md) and [Eze
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014.md), these two

(Note: For no further proof is needed after what has been observed
above, that the relative clause, "which were in front of the separate
place," belongs to the two subjects: cells of the north and cells of the
south, and does not refer to a third cell-building against the eastern
wall, as Kliefoth supposes.)

cell-buildings were set apart as holy cells, in which the officiating
priests were to deposit the most holy sacrifices, and to eat them, and
to put on and off the sacred official clothes in which they drew near to
the Lord. קדשׁי were that portion of the meat-offering which was not
burned upon the altar ([Lev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md), [Lev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#010.md); [Lev
6:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#009.md); [Lev
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md); see my Bibl. Archהologie, I
֗52), and the flesh of all the sin- and trespass-offerings, with the
exception of the sin-offerings offered for the high priest and all the
congregation, the flesh of which was to be burned outside the camp (cf.
[Lev 6:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#019.md); [Lev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006).md). All these portions of the
sacrifices were called most holy, because the priests were to eat them
as the representatives of Jehovah, to the exclusion not only of all the
laity, but also of their own families (women and children; see my
Archהol. I ֗֗45 and 47). The depositing (ינּיחוּ) is distinguished from
the eating (יאכלוּ) of the most holy portions of the sacrifices; because
neither the meal of the meat-offering, which was mixed with oil, nor the
flesh of the sin- and trespass-offerings, could be eaten by the priests
immediately after the offering of the sacrifice; but the former had
first of all to be baked, and the latter to be boiled, and it was not
allowable to deposit them wherever they liked previous to their being so
prepared. The putting on and off, and also the custody of the sacred
official clothes, were to be restricted to a sacred place. בּבאם, on
their coming, sc. to the altar, or into the holy place, for the
performance of service. There not going out of the holy place into the
outer court applies to their going into the court among the people
assembled there; for in order to pass from the altar to the sacred
cells, they were obliged to pass through the inner gate and go thither
by the way which led to these cells (Plate I l).

Extent of the Holy Domain around the Temple

[Eze 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015.md). And when he had finished
the measurements of the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the
gate, which is directed toward the east, and measured there round about.
[Eze 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md). He measured the eastern
side with the measuring rod five hundred rods by the measuring rod round
about; [Eze 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#017.md). He measured the
northern side five hundred rods by the measuring rod round about; [Eze
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#018.md). The southern side he measured
five hundred rods by the measuring rod; [Eze
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#019.md). He turned round to the western
side, measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod. [Eze
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md). To the four winds he measured
it. It had a wall round about; the length was five hundred and the
breadth five hundred, to divide between the holy and the common. - There
has been a division of opinion from time immemorial concerning the area,
the measuring of which is related in these verses, and the length and
breadth of which are stated in [Eze
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md) to have been five hundred; as
the Seventy, and after them J. D. Michaelis, Bttcher, Maurer, Ewald, and
Hitzig, understand by this the space occupied by the temple with its two
courts. But as that space was five hundred cubits long and five hundred
broad, according to the sum of the measurements given in Ezekiel
40-42:15, the lxx have omitted the word קנים in [Eze
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md), [Eze
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#018.md), and [Eze
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#019.md), whilst they have changed it
into πήχεις in [Eze 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#017.md), and have
also attached this word to the numbers in [Eze
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md). According to this, only the
outer circumference of the temple area would be measured in our verses,
and the wall which was five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits
broad ([Eze 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020).md) would be the
surrounding wall of the outer court mentioned in [Eze
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md). [Eze
42:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015.md) could certainly be made to
harmonize with this view. For even if we understood by the "inner house"
not merely the temple house, which the expression primarily indicates,
but the whole of the inner building, i.e., all the buildings found in
the inner and outer court, and by the east gate the eastern gate of the
outer court; the expression 'מדדו סביב , "he measured it round about,"
merely affirms that he measured something round about outside this gate.
The suffix in מדדו is indefinite, and cannot be taken as referring to
any of the objects mentioned before, either to השּׁער or to הבּית
הפּנימי. The inner house he had already measured; and the measurements
which follow are not applicable to the gate. Nor can the suffix be taken
as referring to הבּית, illam sc. aedem (Ros.); or at any rate, there is
nothing in [Eze 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md) to sustain such
a reference. Nevertheless, we might think of a measuring of the outer
sides of the whole building comprehended under the idea of the inner
house, and regard the wall mentioned in [Eze
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md) as that which had been measured
round about on the outer side both in length and breadth. But it is
difficult to reconcile this view even with [Eze
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md); and with the measurements given
in [Eze 42:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md) it is perfectly
irreconcilable. Even if we were disposed to expunge קנים as a gloss in
[Eze 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md), [Eze
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#017.md), [Eze
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#018.md), and [Eze
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#019.md), the words, "he measured the
east side with the measuring rod, five hundred by the measuring rod,"
are equivalent to five hundred rods, according to the well-known Hebrew
usage; just as indisputably as מאה, a hundred by the cubit, is
equivalent to a hundred cubits (see the comm. on [Eze
40:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#021) at the close.md). The rejection of
קנים as an imaginary gloss is therefore not only arbitrary, but also
useless; as the appended words בּקנה המּדּה, even without קנים, affirm
that the five hundred were not cubits, but rods.

(Note: The חמשׁ אמות for חמשׁ מאות in [Eze
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md) is utterly useless as a proof
that cubits and not rods are intended; as it is obviously a copyist's
error, a fact which even the Masoretes admit. Rabbi ben-Asher's view of
this writing is an interesting one. Prof. Dr. Delitzsch has sent me the
following, taken from a fragment in his possession copied from a codex
of the Royal Library at Copenhagen. R. ben-Asher reckons אמות among the
מוקדם ומאוחר, i.e., words written ὑστερον προτερον, of which there are
forty-seven in the whole of the Old Testament, the following being
quoted by ben-Asher (l.c.) by way of example: גּלון, [Jos
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008.md); [Jos
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#027.md); ויּקּלהוּ, [Sa2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#014.md); בּעברות, [Sa2
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#028.md); והימשׁני, [Jdg
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#026.md); ותּראנה, [Sa1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027)..md)

The סביב in [Eze 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md) and [Eze
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#017.md) is not to be understood as
signifying that on the east and north sides he measured a square on each
side of five hundred rods in length and breadth, but simply indicates
that he measured on all sides, as is obvious from [Eze
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md). For according to this, the
space which was measured toward every quarter at five hundred rods had a
boundary wall, which was five hundred rods long on every side. This
gives an area of 250,000 square rods; whereas the temple,with the inner
and outer courts, covered only a square of five hundred cubits in length
and breadth, or 250,000 square cubits. It is evident from this that the
measuring related in [Eze 42:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015.md)
does not refer to the space occupied by the temple and its courts, and
therefore that the wall which the measured space had around it ([Eze
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020).md) cannot be the wall of the outer
court mentioned in [Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md), the
sides of which were not more than five hundred cubits long. The meaning
is rather, that around this wall, which enclosed the temple and its
courts, a further space of five hundred rods in length and breadth was
measured off "to separate between the holy and profane," i.e., a space
which was intended to form a separating domain between the sanctuary and
the common land. The purpose thus assigned for the space, which was
measured off on all four sides of the "inner house," leaves no doubt
remaining that it was not the length of the surrounding wall of the
outer court that was measured, but a space outside this wall. The
following clause חומה , "a wall was round about it," is irreconcilable
with the idea that the suffix in מדדו ([Eze
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#020.md) and [Eze
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#015).md) refers to this wall, inasmuch
as the לו can only refer to the object indicated by the suffix attached
to מדדו. This object, i.e., the space which was five hundred rods long
and the same broad round about, i.e., on every one of the four sides,
had a wall enclosing it on the outside, and forming the partition
between the holy and the common. הקּדשׁ is therefore הבּית הפּנימי, "the
inner house;" but this is not the temple house with its side-building,
but the sanctuary of the temple with its two courts and their buildings,
which was measured in Ezekiel 40:5-42:12.

The arguments which have been adduced in opposition to this explanation
of our verses, - the only one in harmony with the words of the text, -
and in vindication of the alterations made in the text by the lxx, are
without any force. According to Bttcher (p. 355), Hitzig, and others,
קנים is likely to be a false gloss, (1) "because בּקנה המּדּה stands
close to it; and while this is quite needless after קנים, it may also
have occasioned the gloss." But this tells rather against the suspicion
that קנים is a gloss, since, as we have already observed, according to
the Hebrew mode of expression, the "five hundred" would be defined as
rods by בּקנה המּדּה, even without קנים. Ezekiel, however, had added
בּקנה המּדּה for the purpose of expressing in the clearest manner the
fact that the reference here is not to cubits, but to a new measurement
of an extraordinary kind, to which nothing corresponding could be shown
in the earlier temple. And the Seventy, by retaining this clause, ἐν
καλάμῳ τοῦ μέτρου, have pronounced sentence upon their own change of the
rods into cubits; and it is no answer to this that the Talmud (Midd. c.
ii. note 5) also gives only five hundred cubits to the הר הבּ, since
this Talmudic description is treating of the historical temple and not
of Ezekiel's prophetic picture of a temple, although the Rabbins have
transferred various statements from the latter to the former. The second
and third reasons are weaker still - viz. "because there is no other
instance in which the measurement is expressed by rods in the plural;
and, on the other hand, אמּה is frequently omitted as being the ordinary
measurement, and therefore taken for granted." For the first assertion
is proved to be erroneous, not only by our verses, but also by [Eze
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md). and [Eze
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016.md)., whilst there is no force
whatever in the second. The last argument employed is a more plausible
one - namely, that "the five hundred rods are not in keeping with the
sanctuary, because the edifice with the courts and gates would look but
a little pile according to the previous measurements in the wide expanse
of 20,000 (?) rods." But although the space measured off around the
temple-building for the separation between the holy and the profane was
five times as long and five times as broad, according to the Hebrew
text, or twenty-five times as large as the whole extent of the temple
and its courts,

\(a\) Area of the temple with the two courts, 500 cubits square.

\(b\) Surrounding space, five hundred rods = 3000 cubits square.

\(c\) Circuit of fifty cubits in breadth around the surrounding space. -
[Eze 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002.md)

the appearance of the temple with its courts is not diminished in
consequence, because the surrounding space was not covered with
buildings; on the contrary, the fact that it was separated from the
common by so large a surrounding space, would rather add to the
importance of the temple with its courts. This broad separation is
peculiar to Ezekiel's temple, and serves, like many other arrangements
in the new sanctuary and worship, to symbolize the inviolable holiness
of that sanctuary. The earlier sanctuary had nothing answering to this;
and Kliefoth is wrong in supposing that the outer court served the same
purpose in the tabernacle and Solomon's temple, whereas in the temple of
Ezekiel this had also become part of the sanctuary, and was itself holy.
The tabernacle had no outer court at all, and in Solomon's temple the
outer court did form a component part of the sanctuary. The people might
enter it, no doubt, when they desired to draw near to the Lord with
sacrifices and gifts; but this continued to be the case in Ezekiel's
temple, though with certain restrictions (cf. [Eze
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#009.md) and [Eze
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#010).md). Only, in the case of Solomon's
temple, the outer court bordered directly upon the common soil of the
city and the land, so that the defilement of the land produced by the
sin of the people could penetrate directly even into the holy space of
the courts. In the sanctuary of the future, a safeguard was to be placed
against this by the surrounding space which separated the holy from the
common. It is true that the surface of Moriah supplied no room for this
space of five hundred rods square; but the new temple was not to be
built upon the real Moriah, but upon a very high mountain, which the
Lord would exalt and make ready for the purpose when the temple was
erected. Moreover, the circumstance that Moriah was much too small for
the extent of the new temple and its surroundings, cannot furnish any
argument against the correctness of our view of the verses in question,
for the simple reason that in Ezekiel 45 and 48 there follow still
further statements concerning the separation of the sanctuary from the
rest of the land, which are in perfect harmony with this, and show most
indisputably that the temple seen by Ezekiel was not to have its seat in
the ancient Jerusalem.
