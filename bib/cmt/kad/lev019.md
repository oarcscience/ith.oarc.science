### [Leviticus Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 19:1</span></span>

Holiness of Behaviour Towards God and Man. - However manifold the
commandments, which are grouped together rather according to a loose
association of ideas than according to any logical arrangement, they are
all linked together by the common purpose expressed in [Lev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002.md) in the words, "Ye shall be holy,
for I am holy, Jehovah your God." The absence of any strictly logical
arrangement is to be explained chiefly from the nature of the object,
and the great variety of circumstances occurring in life which no
casuistry can fully exhaust, so that any attempt to throw light upon
these relations must consist more or less of the description of a series
of concrete events.

[Leviticus 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 19:2</span></span>

The commandment in [Lev 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002.md), "to be
holy as God is holy," expresses on the one hand the principle upon which
all the different commandments that follow were based, and on the other
hand the goal which the Israelites were to keep before them as the
nation of Jehovah.

[Lev 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#003.md)

The first thing required is reverence towards parents and the observance
of the Lord's Sabbaths-the two leading pillars of the moral government,
and of social well-being. To fear father and mother answers to the
honour commanded in the decalogue to be paid to parents; and in the
observance of the Sabbaths the labour connected with a social calling is
sanctified to the Lord God.

[Lev 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#004.md)

[Lev 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#004.md) embraces the first two
commandments of the decalogue: viz., not to turn to idols to worship
them ([Deu 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#018.md), [Deu
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#020).md), nor to make molten gods (see
at [Exo 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#017).md). The gods beside
Jehovah are called elilim, i.e., nothings, from their true nature.

[Lev 19:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#005.md)

True fidelity to Jehovah was to be shown, so far as sacrifice, the
leading form of divine worship, was concerned, in the fact, that the
holiness of the sacrificial flesh was strictly preserved in the
sacrificial meals, and none of the flesh of the peace-offerings eaten on
the third day. To this end the command in [Lev
7:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015.md) is emphatically repeated, and
transgressors are threatened with extermination. On the singular ישּׂא
in [Lev 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#008.md), see at [Gen
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md), and for the expression "shall
be cut off," [Gen 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#014.md).

[Leviticus 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 19:9</span></span>

Laws concerning the conduct towards one's neighbour, which should flow
from unselfish love, especially with regard to the poor and distressed.

[Lev 19:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009.md)

In reaping the field, "thou shalt not finish to reap the edge of thy
field," i.e., not reap the field to the extreme edge; "neither shalt
thou hold a gathering up (gleaning) of thy harvest," i.e., not gather
together the ears left upon the field in the reaping. In the vineyard
and olive-plantation, also, they were not to have any gleaning, or
gather up what was strewn about (peret signifies the grapes and olives
that had fallen off), but to leave them for the distressed and the
foreigner, that he might also share in the harvest and gathering. כּרם,
lit., a noble plantation, generally signifies a vineyard; but it is also
applied to an olive-plantation ([Jdg
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#005).md), and her it is to be understood
of both. For when this command is repeated in [Deu
24:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#020.md), both vineyards and
olive-plantations are mentioned. When the olives had been gathered by
being knocked off with sticks, the custom of shaking the boughs (פּאר)
to get at those olives which could not be reached with the sticks was
expressly forbidden, in the interest of the strangers, orphans, and
widows, as well as gleaning after the vintage. The command with regard
to the corn-harvest is repeated again in the law for the feast of Weeks
or Harvest Feast ([Lev 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#020).md); and in
[Deu 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#019.md) it is extended, quite in
the spirit of our law, so far as to forbid fetching a sheaf that had
been overlooked in the field, and to order it to be left for the needy.
(Compare with this [Deu 23:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024)..md)

[Lev 19:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#011.md)

The Israelites were not to steal ([Exo
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#015).md); nor to deny, viz., anything
entrusted to them or found ([Lev
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#002)..md); nor to lie to a neighbour,
i.e., with regard to property or goods, for the purpose of overreaching
and cheating him; nor to swear by the name of Jehovah to lie and
defraud, and so profane the name of God (see [Exo
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md), [Exo
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#016).md); nor to oppress and rob a
neighbour (cf. [Lev 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#002).md), by the
unjust abstraction or detention of what belonged to him or was due to
him, - for example, they were not to keep the wages of a day-labourer
over night, but to pay him every day before sunset ([Deu
24:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014).md).

[Lev 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014.md)

They were not to do an injury to an infirm person: neither to ridicule
or curse the deaf, who could not hear the ridicule or curse, and
therefore could not defend himself ([Psa
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#015).md); nor "to put a stumblingblock
before the blind," i.e., to put anything in his way over which he might
stumble and fall (compare [Deu 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#018.md),
where a curse is pronounced upon the man who should lead the blind
astray). But they were to "fear before God," who hears, and sees, and
will punish every act of wrong (cf. [Lev
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032.md), [Lev
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#017.md), [Lev
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036.md), [Lev
25:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#043).md).

[Lev 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015.md)

In judgment, i.e., in the administration of justice, they were to do no
unrighteousness: neither to respect the person of the poor (πρόσωπον
λαμβάνειν, to do anything out of regard to a person, used in a good
sense in [Gen 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#021.md), in a bad sense
here, namely, to act partially from unmanly pity); nor to adorn the
person of the great (i.e., powerful, distinguished, exalted), i.e., to
favour him in a judicial decision (see at [Exo
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#003).md).

[Lev 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#016.md)

They were not to go about as calumniators among their countrymen, to
bring their neighbour to destruction ([Eze
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009).md); nor to set themselves against
the blood of a neighbour, i.e., to seek his life. רכיל does not mean
calumny, but, according to its formation, a calumniator (Ewald, 149e).

[Lev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017.md)

They were not to cherish hatred in their hearts towards their brother,
but to admonish a neighbour, i.e., to tell him openly what they had
against him, and reprove him for his conduct, just as Christ teaches His
disciples in [Mat 18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md), and "not
to load a sin upon themselves." חטא עליו נשׁא does not mean to have to
bear, or atone for a sin on his account (Onkelos, Knobel, etc.), but, as
in [Lev 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#009.md); [Num
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#032.md), to bring sin upon one's self,
which one then has to bear, or atone for; so also in [Num
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#022.md), חטא שׂאת, from which the
meaning "to bear," i.e., atone for sin, or suffer its consequences, was
first derived.

[Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md)

Lastly, they were not to avenge themselves, or bear malice against the
sons of their nation (their countrymen), but to love their neighbour as
themselves. נטר to watch for ([Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md); [Sol
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011.md), [Sol
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012)), hence (= τηρεῖν.md) to cherish a
design upon a person, or bear him malice ([Psa
103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009.md); [Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005.md), [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md); [Nah
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002).md).

[Leviticus 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 19:19</span></span>

The words, "Ye shall keep My statutes," open the second series of
commandments, which make it a duty on the part of the people of God to
keep the physical and moral order of the world sacred. This series
begins in [Lev 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019.md) with the
commandment not to mix the things which are separated in the creation of
God. "Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou
shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed, or put on a garment of
mixed stuff." כּלאים, from כּלא separation, signifies duae res diversi
generis, heterogeneae, and is a substantive in the accusative, giving a
more precise definition. שעטנז is in apposition to כּלאים בּגד, and
according to [Deu 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#011.md) refers to
cloth or a garment woven of wool and flax, to a mixed fabric therefore.
The etymology is obscure, and the rendering given by the lxx, κίβδηλον,
i.e., forged, not genuine, is probably merely a conjecture based upon
the context. The word is probably derived from the Egyptian; although
the attempt to explain it from the Coptic has not been so far
satisfactory. In [Deu 22:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009.md), instead
of the field, the vineyard is mentioned, as that which they were not to
sow with things of two kinds, i.e., so that a mixed produce should
arise; and the threat is added, "that thy fulness (full fruit, [Exo
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028).md), the seed, and the produce of
the vineyard (i.e., the corn and wine grown upon the vineyard) may not
become holy" (cf. [Lev 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#010.md), [Lev
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#021).md), i.e., fall to the sanctuary
for its servants. It is also forbidden to plough with an ox and ass
together, i.e., to yoke them to the same plough. By these laws the
observance of the natural order and separation of things is made a duty
binding upon the Israelites, the people of Jehovah, as a divine
ordinance founded in the creation itself ([Gen
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011.md), [Gen
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021.md), [Gen
1:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024).md). All the symbolical,
mystical, moral, and utilitarian reasons that have been supposed to lie
at the foundation of these commands, are foreign to the spirit of the
law. And with regard to the observance of them, the statement of
Josephus and the Rabbins, that the dress of the priests, as well as the
tapestries and curtains of the tabernacle, consisted of wool and linen,
is founded upon the assumption, which cannot be established, that שׁשׁ,
βύσσος, is a term applied to linen. The mules frequently mentioned,
e.g., in [Sa2 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029.md); [Sa2
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md); [Kg1
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#033.md), may have been imported from
abroad, as we may conclude from [Kg1
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#025.md).

[Lev 19:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#020.md)

Even the personal rights of slaves were to be upheld; and a maid, though
a slave, was not to be degraded to the condition of personal property.
If any one lay with a woman who was a slave and betrothed to a man, but
neither redeemed nor emancipated, the punishment of death was not to be
inflicted, as in the case of adultery ([Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010).md), or the seduction of a free
virgin who was betrothed ([Deu
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023)..md), because she was not set free;
but scourging was to be inflicted, and the guilty person was also to
bring a trespass-offering for the expiation of his sin against God (see
at [Lev 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015)..md). נחרפת, from חרף
carpere, lit., plucked, i.e., set apart, betrothed to a man, not
abandoned or despised. הפדּה redeemed, חפשׁה emancipation without
purchase, - the two ways in which a slave could obtain her freedom.
בּקּרת, ἁπ. λεγ., from בּקּר to examine ([Lev
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#036).md), lit., investigation, then
punishment, chastisement. This referred to both parties, as is evident
from the expression, "they shall not be put to death;" though it is not
more precisely defined. According to the Mishnah, Kerith. ii. 4, the
punishment of the woman consisted of forty stripes.

[Lev 19:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023.md)

The garden-fruit was also to be sanctified to the Lord. When the
Israelites had planted all kinds of fruit-trees in the land of Canaan,
they were to treat the fruit of every tree as uncircumcised for the
first three years, i.e., not to eat it, as being uncircumcised. The
singular suffix in ערלתו refers to כּל, and the verb ערל is a denom.
from ערלה, to make into a foreskin, to treat as uncircumcised, i.e., to
throw away as unclean or uneatable. The reason for this command is not
to be sought for in the fact, that in the first three years fruit-trees
bear only a little fruit, and that somewhat insipid, and that if the
blossom or fruit is broken off the first year, the trees will bear all
the more plentifully afterwards (Aben Esra, Clericus, J. D. Mich.),
though this end would no doubt be thereby attained; but it rests rather
upon ethical grounds. Israel was to treat the fruits of horticulture
with the most careful regard as a gift of God, and sanctify the
enjoyment of them by a thank-offering. In the fourth year the whole of
the fruit was to be a holiness of praise for Jehovah, i.e., to be
offered to the Lord as a holy sacrificial gift, in praise and
thanksgiving for the blessing which He had bestowed upon the
fruit-trees. This offering falls into the category of first-fruits, and
was no doubt given up entirely to the Lord for the servants of the
altar; although the expression הלּוּלים עשׂה ([Jdg
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#027).md) seems to point to sacrificial
meals of the first-fruits, that had already been reaped: and this is the
way in which Josephus has explained the command (Ant. iv. 8, 19). For
([Lev 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#025).md) they were not to eat the
fruits till the fifth year, "to add (increase) its produce to you,"
viz., by the blessing of God, not by breaking off the fruits that might
set in the first years.

[Lev 19:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026.md)

The Israelites were to abstain from all unnatural, idolatrous, and
heathenish conduct.

[Lev 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026.md)

"Ye shall not eat upon blood" (על as in [Exo
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#008.md), referring to the basis of the
eating), i.e., no flesh of which blood still lay at the foundation,
which was not entirely cleansed from blood (cf. [Sa1
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#032).md). These words were not a mere
repetition of the law against eating blood ([Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010).md), but a strengthening of the
law. Not only were they to eat no blood, but no flesh to which any blood
adhered. They were also "to practise no kind of incantations." נחשׁ:
from נחשׁ to whisper (see [Gen 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#005).md),
or, according to some, a denom. verb from נחשׁ a serpent; literally, to
prophesy from observing snakes, then to prophesy from auguries
generally, augurari. עונן a denom. verb, not from ענן a cloud, with the
signification to prophesy from the motion of the clouds, of which there
is not the slightest historical trace in Hebrew; but, as the Rabbins
maintain, from עין an eye, literally, to ogle, then to bewitch with an
evil eye.

[Lev 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#027.md)

"Ye shall not round the border of your head:" i.e., not cut the hair in
a circle from one temple to the other, as some of the Arab tribes did,
according to Herodotus (3, 8), in honour of their god Ὀροτάλ, whom he
identifies with the Dionysos of the Greeks. In [Jer
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025.md); [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md); [Jer
49:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#032.md), the persons who did this are
called פאה קצוּצי, round-cropped, from their peculiar tonsure. "Neither
shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard," sc., by cutting it off (cf.
[Lev 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005).md), which Pliny reports some
of the Arabs to have done, barba abraditur, praeterquam in superiore
labro, aliis et haec intonsa, whereas the modern Arabs either wear a
short moustache, or shave off the beard altogether (Niebuhr, Arab. p.
68).

[Lev 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028.md)

"Ye shall not make cuttings on your flesh (body) on account of a soul,
i.e., a dead person (נפשׁ = מת נפשׁ, [Lev
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#011.md); [Num
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#006.md), or מת, [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md); so again in [Lev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#004.md); [Num
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#002.md); [Num
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006.md), [Num
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#010)), nor make engraven (or branded.md)
writing upon yourselves." Two prohibitions of an unnatural disfigurement
of the body. The first refers to passionate outbursts of mourning,
common among the excitable nations of the East, particularly in the
southern parts, and to the custom of scratching the arms, hands, and
face ([Deu 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001).md), which is said to
have prevailed among the Babylonians and Armenians (Cyrop. iii. 1, 13,
iii. 3, 67), the Scythians (Herod. 4, 71), and even the ancient Romans
(cf. M. Geier de Ebraeor. luctu, c. 10), and to be still practised by
the Arabs (Arvieux Beduinen, p. 153), the Persians (Morier Zweite Reise,
p. 189), and the Abyssinians of the present day, and which apparently
held its ground among the Israelites notwithstanding the prohibition
(cf. [Jer 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006.md); [Jer
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005.md); [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005).md), - as well as to the custom,
which is also forbidden in [Lev 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005.md)
and [Deu 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md), of cutting off the hair
of the head and beard (cf. [Isa 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md);
[Isa 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md); Micah. [Lev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#016.md); [Amo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010.md); [Eze
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#018).md). It cannot be inferred from the
words of Plutarch, quoted by Spencer, δοκοῦντες χαρίζεσθαι τοῖς
τετελευκηκόσιν, that the heathen associated with this custom the idea of
making an expiation to the dead. The prohibition of קעקע כּתבת, scriptio
stigmatis, writing corroded or branded (see Ges. thes. pp. 1207-8),
i.e., of tattooing, - a custom not only very common among the savage
tribes, but still met with in Arabia (Arvieux Beduinen, p. 155;
Burckhardt Beduinen, pp. 40, 41) and in Egypt among both men and women
of the lower orders (Lane, Manners and Customs i. pp. 25, 35, iii. p.
169), - had no reference to idolatrous usages, but was intended to
inculcate upon the Israelites a proper reverence for God's creation.

[Lev 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#029.md)

"Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore, lest the
land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of vice" (zimmah: see
[Lev 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017).md). The reference is not to
spiritual whoredom or idolatry ([Exo
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#016).md), but to fleshly whoredom, the
word zimmah being only used in this connection. If a father caused his
daughter to become a prostitute, immorality would soon become
predominant, and the land (the population of the land) fall away to
whoredom.

[Lev 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#030.md)

The exhortation now returns to the chief point, the observance of the
Lord's Sabbaths and reverence for His sanctuary, which embrace the true
method of divine worship as laid down in the ritual commandments. When
the Lord's day is kept holy, and a holy reverence for the Lord's
sanctuary lives in the heart, not only are many sins avoided, but social
and domestic life is pervaded by the fear of God and characterized by
chasteness and propriety.

[Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031.md)

True fear of God, however, awakens confidence in the Lord and His
guidance, and excludes all superstitious and idolatrous ways and methods
of discovering the future. This thought prepares the way for the warning
against turning to familiar spirits, or seeking after wizards. אוב
denotes a departed spirit, who was called up to make disclosures with
regard to the future, hence a familiar spirit, spiritum malum qui certis
artibus eliciebatur ut evocaret mortuorum manes, qui praedicarent quae
ab eis petebantur (Cler.). This is the meaning in [Isa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004.md), as well as here and in [Lev
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006.md), as is evident from [Lev
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027.md), "a man or woman in whom is an
ob," and from [Sa1 28:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007.md), baalath ob,
"a woman with such a spirit." The name was then applied to the
necromantist himself, by whom the departed were called up ([Sa1
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#003.md); [Kg2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024).md). The word is connected with ob,
a skin. ידּעני, the knowing, so to speak, "clever man" (Symm. γνώστης,
Aq. γνωριστής), is only found in connection with ob, and denotes
unquestionably a person acquainted with necromancy, or a conjurer who
devoted himself to the invocation of spirits. (For further remarks, see
as [Sa1 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007)..md).

[Lev 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032.md)

This series concludes with the moral precept, "Before a hoary head thou
shalt rise up (sc., with reverence, [Job
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008).md), and the countenance (the
person) of the old man thou shalt honour and fear before thy God." God
is honoured in the old man, and for this reason reverence for age is
required. This virtue was cultivated even by the heathen, e.g., the
Egyptians (Herod. 2, 80), the Spartans (Plutarch), and the ancient
Romans (Gellius, ii. 15). It is still found in the East (Lane, Sitten
und Gebr. ii. p. 121).

[Leviticus 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 19:33</span></span>

A few commandments are added of a judicial character. - [Lev
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#033.md), [Lev
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#034.md). The Israelite was not only not
to oppress the foreigner in his land (as had already been commanded in
[Exo 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020.md) and [Exo
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#009).md), but to treat him as a native,
and love him as himself.

[Leviticus 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 19:35</span></span>

As a universal rule, they were to do no wrong in judgment (the
administration of justice, [Lev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015).md), or in social intercourse and
trade with weights and measures of length and capacity; but to keep just
scales, weights, and measures. On ephah and hin, see at [Exo
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036.md) and [Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040.md). In the renewal of this command
in [Deu 25:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013.md), it is forbidden to
carry "stone and stone" in the bag, i.e., two kinds of stones (namely,
for weights), large and small; or to keep two kinds of measures, a large
one for buying and a small one for selling; and full (unadulterated) and
just weight and measure are laid down as an obligation. This was a
command, the breach of which was frequently condemned ([Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011.md); [Pro
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010.md), [Pro
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#023.md); [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md); [Mic
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md), cf. [Eze
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#010).md).

[Leviticus 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#037.md)
