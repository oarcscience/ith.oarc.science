[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 15:1</span></span>

Reign of Azariah (Uzziah) or Judah (cf. 2 Chron 26). - The statement
that "in the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam Azariah began to reign" is
at variance with [Kg2 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#002.md), [Kg2
14:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#016.md), and [Kg2
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md). If, for example, Azariah
ascended the throne in the fifteenth year of Joash of Israel, and with
his twenty-nine years' reign outlived Joash fifteen years ([Kg2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#002.md), [Kg2
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#017).md); if, moreover, Jeroboam
followed his father Joash in the fifteenth year of Amaziah ([Kg2
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023).md), and Amaziah died in the
fifteenth year of Jeroboam; Azariah (Uzziah) must have become king in
the fifteenth year of Jeroboam, since, according to [Kg2
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md), the people made him king after
the murder of his father, which precludes the supposition of an
interregnum. Consequently the datum "in the twenty-seventh year" can
only have crept into the text through the confounding of the numerals טו
(15) with כז (27), and we must therefore read "in the fifteenth year."

[Kg2 15:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#002.md)

Beside the general characteristics of Uzziah's fifty-two years' reign,
which are given in the standing formula, not a single special act is
mentioned, although, according to 2 Chron 26, he raised his kingdom to
great earthly power and prosperity; probably for no other reason than
because his enterprises had exerted no permanent influence upon the
development of the kingdom of Judah, but all the useful fruits of his
reign were destroyed again by the ungodly Ahaz. Uzziah did what was
right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done. For as
the latter was unfaithful to the Lord in the closing years of his reign,
so did Uzziah seek God only so long as Zechariah, who was experienced in
divine visions, remained alive, and God gave success to his enterprises,
so that during this time he carried on successful wars against the
Philistines and Arabians, fortified the walls of Jerusalem with strong
towers, built watch-towers in the desert, and constructed cisterns for
the protection and supply of his numerous flocks, promoted agriculture
and vine-growing, and organized a numerous and well-furnished army ([Ch2
26:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005).md). But the great power to which
he thereby attained produced such haughtiness, that he wanted to make
himself high priest in his kingdom after the manner of the heathen
kings, and usurping the sacred functions, which belonged according to
the law to the Levitical priests alone, to offer incense in the temple,
for which he was punished with leprosy upon the spot ([Kg2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005.md) compared with [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016)..md). The king's leprosy is
described in our account also as a punishment from God. יי ויננּע:
Jehovah smote him, and he became leprous. This presupposes an act of
guilt, and confirms the fuller account of this guilt given in the
Chronicles, which Thenius, following the example of De Wette and Winer,
could only call in question on the erroneous assumption "that the
powerful king wanted to restore the regal high-priesthood exercised by
David and Solomon" Oehler (Herzog's Cycl.) has already shown that such
an opinion is perfectly "groundless," since it is nowhere stated that
David and Solomon performed with their own hands the functions assigned
in the law to the priests in connection with the offering of sacrifice,
as the co-operation of the priests is not precluded in connection with
the sacrifices presented by these kings ([Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md), and [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004), etc..md). - Uzziah being afflicted
with leprosy, was obliged to live in a separate house, and appoint his
son Jotham as president of the royal house to judge the people, i.e., to
conduct the administration of the kingdom. - The time when this event
occurred is not stated either in our account or in the Chronicles. But
this punishment from God cannot have fallen upon him before the last ten
years of his fifty-two years' reign, because his son, who was only
twenty-five years old when his father died ([Kg2
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#033.md), and [Ch2
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001).md), undertook the administration of
the affairs of the kingdom at once, and therefore must have been at
least fifteen years old. החפשׁית בּית is taken by Winer, Gesenius, and
others, after the example of Iken, to signify nosocomium, an infirmary
or lazar-house, in accordance with the verb Arab. xfs̆, fecit, II
debilis, imbecillis fuit. But this meaning cannot be traced in Hebrew,
where חפשׁי is used in no other sense than free, set at liberty,
manumissus. Consequently the rendering adopted by Aquila is correct,
οἶκος ἐλευθερίας; and the explanation given by Kimchi of this epithet
is, that the persons who lived there were those who were sent away from
human society, or perhaps more correctly, those who were released from
the world and its privileges and duties, or cut off from intercourse
with God and man.

[Kg2 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#007.md)

When Uzziah died, he was buried with his fathers in the city of David,
but because he died of leprosy, not in the royal family tomb, but, as
the Chronicles ([Kg2 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#023).md) add to
complete the account, "in the burial-field of the kings;" so that he was
probably buried in the earth according to our mode. His son Jotham did
not become king till after Uzziah's death, as he had not been regent,
but only the administrator of the affairs of the kingdom during his
father's leprosy.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 15:8</span></span>

Reign of Zachariah of Israel. - [Kg2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008.md). "In the thirty-eighth year of
Uzziah, Zachariah the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel six
months." As Jeroboam died in the twenty-seventh year of Uzziah,
according to our remarks on [Kg2
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#029.md), there is an interregnum of
eleven years between his death and the ascent of the throne by his son,
as almost all the chronologists since the time of Usher have assumed. It
is true that this interregnum may be set aside by assuming that Jeroboam
reigned fifty-one or fifty-three years instead of forty-one, without the
synchronism being altered in consequence. but as it is not very probable
that the numeral letters נב or נג should be confounded with מא, and as
the conflict for the possession of the throne, which we meet with after
the very brief reign of Zachariah, when taken in connection with various
allusions in the prophecies of Hosea, rather favours the idea that the
anarchy broke out immediately after the death of Jeroboam, we regard the
assumption of an interregnum as resting on a better foundation than the
removal of the chronological discrepancy by an alteration of the text.

[Kg2 15:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#009.md)

Zechariah also persevered in the sin of his fathers in connection with
the calf-worship therefore the word of the Lord pronounced upon Jehu
([Kg2 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030).md) was fulfilled in him. -
Shallum the son of Jabesh formed a conspiracy and put him to death
קבל־עם, before people, i.e., openly before the eyes of all.

(Note: Ewald in the most marvellous manner has made קבל־עם into a king
(Gesch. iii. p. 598).)

As Israel would not suffer itself to be brought to repentance and to
return to the Lord, its God and King, by the manifestations of divine
grace in the times of Joash and Jeroboam, any more than by the severe
judgments that preceded them, and the earnest admonitions of the
prophets Hosea and Amos; the judgment of rejection could not fail
eventually to burst forth upon the nation, which so basely despised the
grace, long-suffering, and covenant-faithfulness of God. We therefore
see the kingdom hasten with rapid steps towards its destruction after
the death of Jeroboam. In the sixty-two years between the death of
Jeroboam and the conquest of Samaria by Shalmaneser anarchy prevailed
twice, in all for the space of twenty years, and six kings followed one
another, only one of whom, viz., Menahem, died a natural death, so as to
be succeeded by his son upon the throne. The other five were dethroned
and murdered by rebels, so that, as Witsius has truly said, with the
murder of Zachariah not only was the declaration of Hosea ([Hos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004).md) fulfilled, "I visit the
blood-guiltiness of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu," but also the
parallel utterance, "and I destroy the kingdom of the house of Israel,"
since the monarchy in Israel really ceased with Zachariah. "For the
successors of Zachariah were not so much kings as robbers and tyrants,
unworthy of the august name of kings, who lost with ignominy the tyranny
which they had wickedly acquired, and as wickedly exercised." - Witsius,
Δεκαφυλ. p. 320.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 15:13</span></span>

Reign of Shallum. - Shallum reigned only a full month (ירח־ימים, as in
[Deu 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#013.md); see at [Gen
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014).md). Menahem the son of Gadi then
made war upon him from Tirzah; and by him he was smitten and slain.
Menahem must have been a general or the commander-in-chief, as Josephus
affirms. As soon as he became king he smote Tiphsach, - i.e., Thapsacus
on the Euphrates, which has long since entirely disappeared, probably to
be sought for in the neighbourhood of the present Rakka, by the ford of
el Hamman, the north-eastern border city of the Israelitish kingdom in
the time of Solomon ([Kg1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#004).md), which
came into the possession of the kingdom of Israel again when the ancient
boundaries were restored by Jeroboam II ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md) and [Kg2
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028).md), but which had probably
revolted again during the anarchy which arose after the death of
Jeroboam, - "and all that were therein, and the territory thereof, from
Tirzah; because they opened not (to him), therefore he smote it, and had
them that were with child ripped up." מתּרצה does not mean that Menahem
laid the land or district waste from Tirzah to Tiphsach, but is to be
taken in connection with יכּה in this sense: he smote Tiphsach
proceeding from Tirzah, etc. The position of this notice, namely,
immediately after the account of the usurpation of the throne by Menahem
and before the history of his reign, is analogous to that concerning
Elath in the case of Uzziah ([Kg2
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022).md), and, like the latter, is to be
accounted for from the fact that the expedition of Menahem against
Tiphsach formed the commencement of his reign, and, as we may infer from
[Kg2 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md), became very eventful not
only for his own reign, but also for the kingdom of Israel generally.
The reason why he proceeded from Tirzah against Tiphsach, was no doubt
that it was in Tirzah, the present Tallusa, which was only three hours
to the east of Samaria (see at [Kg1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017).md), that the army of which Menahem
was commander was posted, so that he had probably gone to Samaria with
only a small body of men to overthrow Shallum, the murderer of Zachariah
and usurper of the throne, and to make himself king. It is possible that
the army commanded by Menahem had already been collected in Tirzah to
march against the city of Tiphsach, which had revolted from Israel when
Shallum seized upon the throne by the murder of Zachariah; so that after
Menahem had removed the usurper, he carried out at once the campaign
already resolved upon, and having taken Tiphsach, punished it most
cruelly for its revolt. On the cruel custom of ripping up the women with
child, i.e., of cutting open their wombs, see [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md); [Amo
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md), and [Hos
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001.md). Tiphsach, Thapsacus, appears to
have been a strong fortress; and from its situation on the western bank
of the Euphrates, at the termination of the great trade-road from Egypt,
Phoenicia, and Syria to Mesopotamia and the kingdoms of Inner Asia
(Movers, Phniz. ii. 2, pp. 164,165; and Ritter, Erdkunde, x. pp.
1114-15), the possession of it was of great importance to the kingdom of
Israel.

(Note: There is no foundation for the view propounded by Ewald (Gesch.
iii. p. 599), Simson (Hosea, pp. 20, 21), Thenius, and many others, that
Tiphsach was a city between Tirzah and Samaria, which Menahem laid waste
on his march from Tirzah to Samaria to dethrone Shallum; for it rests
upon nothing more than the perfectly unwarrantable and ungrammatical
combination of מתרצה with את־גבוליה, "its boundaries towards Tirzah"
(Sims.), and upon the two worthless objections: (1) that the great
distance of מתרצה from יכה precludes the rendering "going out from
Tirzah;" and (2) that Menahem was not the man to be able to conquer
Thapsacus on the Euphrates. But there is no foundation for the latter
assertion, as we have no standard by which to estimate the strength and
bravery of the Israelitish army commanded by Menahem. And the first
objection falls to the ground with the correct rendering of מתרצה, viz.,
"proceeding from Tirzah," which is preferred even by Ewald and Thenius.
With this rendering, the words by no means affirm that Menahem smote
Tiphsach from Tirzah on the way to Samaria. This is merely an inference
drawn from v. 13, according to which Menahem went from Tirzah to Samaria
to overthrow Shallum. But this inference is open to the following
objections: (1) that it is very improbable that there was a strong
fortress between Tirzah and Samaria, which Menahem was obliged to take
on his march before he could overthrow the usurper in the capital of the
kingdom; and (2) that the name Tiphsach, trajectus, ford, is by no means
a suitable one for a city situated on the mountains between Tirzah and
Samaria, and therefore, in order to carry out the hypothesis in
question, Thenius proposes to alter Tiphsach into Tappuach, without any
critical warrant for so doing.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 15:17</span></span>

Reign of Menahem. - Menahem's reign lasted ten full years (see at [Kg2
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#023).md), and resembled that of his
predecessors in its attitude towards God. In [Kg2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#018.md), the expression כּל־ימיו (all
his days) is a very strange one, inasmuch as no such definition of time
occurs in connection with the usual formula, either in this chapter (cf.
[Kg2 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#024.md) and [Kg2
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#028).md) or elsewhere (cf. [Kg2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#003.md); [Kg2
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#031.md); [Kg2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#002.md), [Kg2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#011), etc..md). The lxx have instead of
this, ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ (in his days). If we compare [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md), בּא פּקח בּימי (in the days of
Pekah came, etc.), בּא בּימיו might possibly be regarded as the original
reading, from which a copyist's error בּא כּל־מיו arose, after which
כּל־ימיו was connected with the preceding clause.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 15:19</span></span>

In the time of Menahem, Pul king of Assyria invaded the land, and
Menahem gave him 1000 talents of silver - more than two and a half
millions of thalers (375,000) - "that his hands might be with him, to
confirm the kingdom in his hand." These words are understood by the
majority of commentators from the time of Ephraem Syrus, when taken in
connection with [Hos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md), as
signifying that Menahem invited Pul, that he might establish his
government with his assistance. But the words of Hosea, "Ephraim goes to
the Assyrian," sc. to seek for help ([Kg2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013.md), cf. [Kg2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#011.md) and [Kg2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#009).md), are far too general to be taken
as referring specially to Menahem; and the assumption that Menahem
invited Pul into the land is opposed by the words in the verse before
us, "Pul came over the land." Even the further statement that Menahem
gave to Pul 1000 talents of silver when he came into the land, that he
might help him to establish his government, presupposes at the most that
a party opposed to Menahem had invited the Assyrians, to overthrow the
usurper. At any rate, we may imagine, in perfect harmony with the words
of our account, that Pul marched against Israel of his own accord,
possibly induced to do so by Menahem's expedition against Thapsacus, and
that his coming was simply turned to account as a good opportunity for
disputing Menahem's possession of the throne he had usurped, so that
Menahem, by paying the tribute mentioned, persuaded the Assyrian to
withdraw, that he might deprive the opposing party of the Assyrian
support, and thereby establish his own rule.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 15:20</span></span>

To collect the requisite amount, Menahem imposed upon all persons of
property a tax of fifty shekels each. יצא with על, he caused to arise,
i.e., made a collection. הציא in a causative sense, from יצא, to arise,
to be paid ([Kg2 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#013).md). חיל גּבּורי:
not warriors, but men of property, as in Ruth. [Kg2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001.md); [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md). אחד לאישׁ, for the individual.
Pul was the first king of Assyria who invaded the kingdom of Israel and
prepared the way for the conquest of this kingdom by his successors, and
for the extension of the Assyrian power as far as Egypt. According to
the thorough investigation made by Marc. v. Niebuhr (Gesch. Assurs u.
Babels, pp. 128ff.), Pul, whose name has not yet been discovered upon
the Assyrian monuments, was the last king of Nineveh of the family of
the Derketades, who still ruled over Babylon according to Berosus, and
the last king but one of this dynasty.

(Note: It is true that some trace of his expedition has been found in
the monuments, since an inscription has been deciphered with tolerable
certainty, stating that king Minikhimmi of Samirina (Menahem of Shomron
or Samaria) paid tribute to an Assyrian king. But the name of this
Assyrian king is not determined with certainty, as Rawlinson, and Oppert
read it Tiglat-palassar, and suppose Tiglath-pileser to be intended;
whereas M. v. Niebuhr (p. 132, note 1) imagines it to be the full name
of Pul, since no Assyrian king ever had a name of one syllable like Pul
as his official name, and even before that Hincks had detected in the
name Minikhimmi the king Menahem who had to purchase the friendship of
the Assyrian ruler Pul with 1000 talents of silver. (Comp. J. Brandis,
uber d. histor. Gewinn aus der Entzifferung der assyr. Inschriften,
Berl. 1856, p. 50.))

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 15:23</span></span>

Reign of Pekahiah. - Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign "in the
fiftieth year of Uzziah." As Menahem had begun to reign in the
thirty-ninth year of Uzziah and reigned ten years, he must have died in
the forty-ninth year of Uzziah; and therefore, if his son did not become
king till the fiftieth year, some months must have elapsed between the
death of Menahem and Pekahiah's ascent of the throne, probably cause, in
the existing disorganization of the kingdom, the possession of the
throne by the latter was opposed. Pekahiah reigned in the spirit of his
predecessors, but only for two years, as his aide-de-camp (שׁלישׁ, see
at [Sa2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008).md) Pekah conspired against
him and slew him in the citadel (ארמון, see at [Kg1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008).md) of the king's palace, with Argob
and Aryeh. Argob and Aryeh were not fellow-conspirators of Pekah, who
helped to slay the king, but principes Pekachijae, as Seb. Schmidt
expresses it, probably aides-de-camp of Pekahiah, who were slain by the
conspirators when defending their king. We must take the words in this
sense on account of what follows: וגו חמשּׁים ועמּו, "and with him
(Pekah) were fifty men of the Gileadites" (i.e., they helped him). The
Gileadites probably belonged to the king's body-guard, and were under
the command of the aides-de-camp of Pekah.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 15:27</span></span>

Reign of Pekah. - Pekah the son of Remaliah reigned twenty years.

(Note: As this is apparently at variance not only with [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030.md), according to which Pekah was
slain in the twentieth year of Jotham, i.e., in the fourth year of Ahaz,
abut also with [Kg2 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001.md), according to
which Hosea the murderer of Pekah became king in the twelfth year of
Ahaz and reigned nine years, Ewald has added ותשׁע after עשׂרים without
any hesitation, and lengthened Pekah's reign to twenty-nine years,
whereas Thenius proposes to alter twenty into thirty. But we do not
thereby obtain an actual agreement either with [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030.md) or with [Kg2
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001.md), so that in both these passages
Thenius is obliged to make further alterations in the text. For
instance, if Pekah had reigned for thirty years from the fifty-second or
closing year of Uzziah's reign, Hosea would have ascended the throne in
the fourteenth year of Ahaz, supposing that he really became king
immediately after the murder of Pekah, and not in the twelfth, as is
stated in [Kg2 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001.md). It is only with a
reign of twenty-eight years and a few months (one year of Uzziah,
sixteen of Jotham, and eleven of Ahaz), which might be called
twenty-nine years, that the commencement of Hosea's reign could fall in
the twelfth year of Ahaz. But the discrepancy with [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030.md), that Hosea conspired against
Pekah and slew him in the twentieth year of Jotham, is not removed
thereby. For further remarks see at [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030.md) and [Kg2
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001)..md)

During his reign the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser came, and after
conquering the fortified cities round Lake Merom took possession of
Gilead and Galilee, namely the whole land of Naphtali, and led the
inhabitants captive to Assyria. Tiglath-pileser (פּלאסר תּגלת or פּלסר
תּגלת, [Kg2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md); פּלנאסר or פּלנסר
תּלגת פּלנסר, [Ch1 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md), and [Ch2
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md); Θεγλαθφαλασάρ or
Θαλγαθφελλασάρ, lxx; written Tiglat-palatsira or Tiglat-palatsar on the
Assyrian monuments, and interpreted by Gesenius and others "ruler of the
Tigris," although the reading of the name upon the monuments is still
uncertain, and the explanation given a very uncertain one, since Tiglat
or Tilgat is hardly identical with Diglath = Tigris, but is probably a
name of the goddess Derketo, Atergatis), was, according to M. v. Niebuhr
(pp. 156, 157), the last king of the Derketade dynasty, who, when the
Medes and Babylonians threw off the Assyrian supremacy after the death
of Pul, attempted to restore and extend the ancient dominion.

(Note: M. Duncker (Gesch. des Alterthums, i. pp. 658, 659) also assumes
that the dynasty changed with the overthrow of the Derketades, but he
places it considerably earlier, about the year 900 or 950 b.c., because
on the one hand Niebuhr's reasons for his view cannot be sustained, and
on the other hand there are distinct indications that the change in the
reigning family must have taken place about this time: viz., 1. in the
ruins of the southern city of Nineveh, at Kalah, where we find the
remains of the palace of two rulers, who sat upon the throne of Assyria
between the years 900 and 830, whereas the castles of Ninos and his
descendants must undoubtedly have stood in the northern city, in
Nineveh; 2. in the circumstance that from the time mentioned the
Assyrian kingdom advanced with fresh warlike strength and in a fresh
direction, which would agree with the change in the dynasty. - Which of
these two assumptions is the correct one, cannot yet be decided in the
present state of the researches on this subject.)

His expedition against Israel falls, according to [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md) and [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md), in the closing years of Pekah,
when Ahaz had come to the throne in Judah. The enumeration of his
conquests in the kingdom of Israel commences with the most important
cities, probably the leading fortifications. Then follow the districts
of which he took possession, and the inhabitants of which he led into
captivity. The cities mentioned are Ijon, probably the present Ayun on
the north-eastern edge of the Merj Ayun; Abel-beth-maacah, the present
Abil el Kamh, on the north-west of Lake Huleh (see at [Kg1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020).md); Janoach, which must not be
confounded with the Janocha mentioned in [Jos
16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006.md), on the border of Ephraim and
Manasseh, but is to be sought for in Galilee or the tribe-territory of
Naphtali, and has not yet been discovered; Kedesh, on the mountains to
the west of Lake Huleh, which has been preserved as an insignificant
village under the ancient name (see at [Jos
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022).md); Hazor, in the same region, but
not yet traced with certainty (see at [Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001).md). Gilead is the whole of the land
to the east of the Jordan, the territory of the tribes of Reuben, Gad,
and half-Manasseh ([Ch1 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md), which
had only been wrested from the Syrians again a short time before by
Jeroboam II, and restored to Israel ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md). הגּלילה (the feminine form of
הגּליל, see Ewald, 173, h.) is more precisely defined by the apposition
"all the land of Naphtali" (see at [Kg1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011).md). - In the place of אשּׁוּרה, "to
the land of Assyria," the different regions to which the captives were
transported are given in [Ch1 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md).
For further remarks on this point see at [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md).

Pekah met with his death in a conspiracy organized by Hosea the son of
Elah, who made himself king "in the twentieth year of Jotham." There is
something very strange in this chronological datum, as Jotham only
reigned sixteen years ([Kg2 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#033).md),
and Ahaz began to reign in the seventeenth year of Pekah ([Kg2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001).md); so that Pekah's death would
fall in the fourth year of Ahaz. The reason for this striking statement
can only be found, as Usher has shown (Chronol. sacr. p. 80), in the
fact that nothing has yet been said about Jotham's successor Ahaz,
because the reign of Jotham himself is not mentioned till [Kg2
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032.md).

(Note: Other attempts to solve this difficulty are either arbitrary and
precarious, e.g., the conjectures of the earlier chronologists quoted by
Winer (R. W. s. v. Jotham), or forced, like the notion of Vaihinger in
Herzog's Cycl. (art. Jotham), that the words בן־עזיה ליותם are to be
eliminated as an interpolation, in which case the datum "in the
twentieth year" becomes perfectly enigmatical; and again the assertion
of Hitzig (Comm. z. Jesaj. pp. 72, 73), that instead of in the twentieth
year of Jotham, we should read "in the twentieth year of Ahaz the son of
Jotham," which could only be consistently carried out by altering the
text of not less than seven passages (viz., [Kg2
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#033.md); [Kg2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001.md), and [Kg2
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002.md), [Kg2
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md); [Ch2
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001.md) and [Ch2
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#008.md), and [Ch2
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001).md); and lastly, the assumption of
Thenius, that the words from בשׁנת to עזיה have crept into the text
through a double mistake of the copyist and an arbitrary alteration of
what had been thus falsely written, which is much too complicated to
appear at all credible, even if the reasons which are supposed to render
it probable had been more forcible and correct than they really are. For
the first reason, viz., that the statement in what year of the
contemporaneous ruler a king came to the throne is always first given
when the history of this king commences, is disproved by [Kg2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017.md); the second, that the name of the
king by the year of whose reign the accession of another is defined is
invariably introduced with the epithet king of Judah or king of Israel,
is shown by [Kg2 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#002.md) and [Kg2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001.md) to be not in accordance with
fact; and the third, that this very king is never described by the
introduction of his father's name, as he is here, except where the
intention is to prevent misunderstanding, as in [Kg2
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001.md), [Kg2
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md), or in the case of usurpers
without ancestors ([Kg2 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032.md), [Kg2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001.md) and [Kg2
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015).md), is also incorrect in its first
portion, for in the case of Amaziah in [Kg2
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md) there was no misunderstanding to
prevent, and even in the case of Joash in [Kg2
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001.md) the epithet king of Israel would
have been quite sufficient to guard against any misunderstanding.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 15:32</span></span>

Reign of Jotham of Judah (cf. [Ch2
27:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001).md). - [Kg2
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032.md). "In the second year of Pekah
Jotham began to reign." This agrees with the statement in [Kg2
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#027.md), that Pekah became king in the
last year of Uzziah, supposing that it occurred at the commencement of
the year. Jotham's sixteen years therefore came to a close in the
seventeenth year of Pekah's reign ([Kg2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001).md). His reign was like that of his
father Uzziah (compare [Kg2 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#034.md),
[Kg2 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035.md) with [Kg2
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#003.md), [Kg2
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#004).md), except, as is added in Chr.
[Kg2 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#002.md), that he did not force
himself into the temple of the Lord, as Uzziah had done ([Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016).md). All that is mentioned of his
enterprises in the account before us is that he built the upper gate of
the house of Jehovah, that is to say, that he restored it, or perhaps
added to its beauty. The upper gate, according to [Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md) compared with [Kg2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#003.md), [Kg2
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#005.md),[Kg2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#014.md) and [Kg2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016.md), is the gate at the north side of
the inner or upper court, where all the sacrifices were slaughtered,
according to [Eze 40:38-43](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#038.md). We also
find from [Ch2 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003.md). that he built
against the wall of Ophel, and several cities in the mountains of Judah,
and castles and towers in the forests, and subdued the Ammonites, so
that they paid him tribute for three years. Jotham carried on with great
vigour, therefore, the work which his father had began, to increase the
material prosperity of his subjects.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 15:37</span></span>

In those days the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin, etc. It is
evident from the position of this verse at the close of the account of
Jotham, that the incursions of the allied Syrians and Israelites into
Judah under the command of Rezin and Pekah commenced in the closing
years of Jotham, so that these foes appeared before Jerusalem at the
very beginning of the reign of Ahaz. - It is true that the Syrians had
been subjugated by Jeroboam II ([Kg2
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028).md); but in the anarchical
condition of the Israelitish kingdom after his death, they had no doubt
recovered their independence. They must also have been overcome by the
Assyrians under Pul, for he could never have marched against Israel
without having first of all conquered Syria. But as the power of the
Assyrians was greatly weakened for a time by the falling away of the
Medes and Babylonians, the Syrians had taken advantage of this weakness
to refuse the payment of tribute to Assyria, and had formed an alliance
with Pekah of Israel to conquer Judah, and thereby to strengthen their
power so as to be able to offer a successful resistance to any attack
from the side of the Euphrates. - But as [Kg2
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006.md). and 2 Kings 17 show, it was
otherwise decreed in the counsels of the Lord.
