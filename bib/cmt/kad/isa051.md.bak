### [Isaiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 51:1</span></span>

The prophetic address now turns again from the despisers of the word,
whom it has threatened with the torment of fire, to those who long for
salvation. "Hearken to me, ye that are in pursuit of righteousness, ye
that seek Jehovah. Look up to the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the
hollow of the pit whence ye are dug. Look up toe Abraham your
forefather, and to Sara who bare you, that he was one when I called him,
and blessed him, and multiplied him. For Jehovah hath comforted Zion,
comforted all her ruins, and turned her desert like Eden, and her steppe
as into the garden of God; joy and gladness are found in her,
thanksgiving and sounding music." The prophecy is addressed to those who
are striving after the right kind of life and seeking Jehovah, and not
turning from Him to make earthly things and themselves the object of
their pursuit; for such only are in a condition by faith to regard that
as possible, and in spirit to behold that as real, which seems
impossible, and in spirit to behold that as real, which seems impossible
to human understanding, because the very opposite is lying before the
eye of the senses. Abraham and Sarah they are mentally to set before
them, for they are types of the salvation to be anticipated now. Abraham
is the rock whence the stones were hewn, of which the house of Jacob is
composed; and Sarah with her maternal womb the hollow of the pit out of
which Israel was brought to the light, just as peat is dug out of a pit,
or copper out of a mine. The marriage of Abraham and Sarah was for a
long time unfruitful; it was, as it were, out of hard stone that God
raised up children to Himself in Abraham and Sarah. The rise of Israel
was a miracle of divine power and grace. In antithesis to the masculine
tsūr, bōr is made into a feminine through maqqebheth, which is chosen
with reference to neqēbhâh. to חצּבתּם we must supply ממּנּוּ ... אשׁר,
and to נקּרתּם, ממּנּה ... אשׁר. [Isa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002.md) informs them who the rock and the
hollow of the pit are, viz., Abraham your forefather, and Sarah
techōlelkhem, who bare you with all the pains of childbirth: "you," for
the birth of Isaac, the son of promise, was the birth of the nation. The
point to be specially looked at in relation to Abraham (in comparison
with whom Sarah falls into the background) is given in the words quod
unum vocavi eum (that he was one when I called him). The perfect קראתיו
relates the single call of divine grace, which removed Abraham from the
midst of idolaters into the fellowship of Jehovah. The futures that
follow (with Vav cop.) point out the blessing and multiplication that
were connected with it ([Gen 12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001).md).
He is called one ('echâd as in [Eze
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#024.md); [Mal
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015).md), because he was one at the time
of his call, and yet through the might of the divine blessing became the
root of the whole genealogical tree of Israel, and of a great multitude
of people that branched off from it. This is what those who are now
longing for salvation are to remember, strengthening themselves by means
of the olden time in their faith in the future which so greatly
resembles it. The corresponding blessing is expressed in preterites
(nicham, vayyâsem), inasmuch as to the eye of faith and in prophetic
vision the future has the reality of a present and the certainty of a
completed fact. Zion, the mother of Israel ([Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001).md), the counterpart of Sarah, the
ancestress of the nation-Zion, which is now mourning so bitterly,
because she is lying waste and in ruins - is comforted by Jehovah. The
comforting word of promise ([Isa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001).md)
becomes, in her case, the comforting fact of fulfilment ([Isa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013).md). Jehovah makes her waste like
Eden (lxx ὡς παράδεισον), like a garden, as glorious as if it had been
directly planted by Himself ([Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md); [Num
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#006).md). And this paradise is not
without human occupants; but when you enter it you find joy and gladness
therein, and hear thanksgiving at the wondrous change that has taken
place, as well as the voice of melody (zimrâh as in [Amo
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023).md). The pleasant land is therefore
full of men in the midst of festal enjoyment and activity. As Sarah gave
birth to Isaac after a long period of barrenness, so Zion, a second
Sarah, will be surrounded by a joyous multitude of children after a long
period of desolation.

[Isaiah 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 51:4</span></span>

But the great work of the future extends far beyond the restoration of
Israel, which becomes the source of salvation to all the world. "Hearken
unto me, my people, and give ear unto me, O my congregation! for
instruction will go forth from me, and I make a place for my right, to
be a light of the nations. My righteousness is near, my salvation is
drawn out, and my arms will judge nations: the hoping of the islands
looks to me, and for mine arm is their waiting." It is Israel which is
here summoned to hearken to the promise introduced with kı̄. לאוּמּי is
only used here of Israel, like גּוי in [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009); and the lxx (καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς.md)
have quite misunderstood it. An address to the heathen would be quite
out of harmony with the character of the whole prophecy, which is
carried out quite consistently throughout. עמי and לאומי, therefore, are
not plurals, as the Syriac supposes, although it cannot be disputed that
it is a rare thing to meet with the plural form apocopated thus, after
the form of the talmudic Aramaean; and see also at [Psa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009).md). What [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md). describes as the calling of the
servant of Jehovah, viz., to carry out justice among the nations, and to
plant it on the earth, appears here as the act of Jehovah; but, as a
comparison of מאתּי with מצּיּון ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003).md) clearly shows, as the act of the
God who is present in Israel, and works from Israel outwards. Out of
Israel sprang the Saviour; out of Israel the apostleship; and when God
shall have mercy upon Israel again, it will become to the whole world of
nations "life from the dead." The thorâh referred to here is that of
Sion, as distinguished from that of Sinai, the gospel of redemption, and
mishpât the new order of life in which Israel and the nations are
united. Jehovah makes for this a place of rest, a firm standing-place,
from which its light to lighten the nations streams forth in all
directions. הרגּיע as in [Jer 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#002.md);
[Jer 50:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#034.md), from רגע, in the sense of
the Arabic rj‛, to return, to procure return, entrance, and rest; a
different word from רגע in [Isa 51:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#015.md),
which signifies the very opposite, viz., to disturb, literally to throw
into trembling. צדק and ישע, which occur in [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005.md), are synonyms throughout these
prophecies. The meaning of the former is determined by the character of
the thorah, which gives "the knowledge of salvation" ([Luk
1:77](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#077).md), and with that "the
righteousness of God" ([Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md); cf.,
[Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011).md). This righteousness is now
upon the point of being revealed; this salvation has started on the way
towards the fullest realization. The great mass of the nations fall
under the judgment which the arms of Jehovah inflict, as they cast down
to the ground on the right hand and on the left. When it is stated of
the islands, therefore, that they hope for Jehovah, and wait for His
arm, the reference is evidently to the remnant of the heathen nations,
which outlives the judgment, and not only desires salvation, and is
susceptible of it, but which actually receives salvation (compare the
view given in [Joh 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052.md), which agrees
with that of Isaiah, and which, in fact, is the biblical view generally,
e.g., [Joe 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#005).md). To these the saving
arm (the singular only was suitable here; cf., [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011).md) now brings that salvation,
towards which their longing was more or less consciously directed, and
which satisfied their inmost need. Observe in [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005.md) the majestic and self-conscious
movement of the rhythm, with the effective tone of yeyachēlûn.

[Isaiah 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 51:6</span></span>

The people of God are now summoned to turn their eyes upwards and
downwards: the old world above their heads and under their feet is
destined to destruction. "Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look
upon the earth beneath: for the heavens will pass away like smoke, and
the earth fall to pieces like a garment, and its inhabitants die out
like a nonentity; and my salvation will last for ever, and my
righteousness does not go to ruin." The reason for the summons follows
with kı̄. The heavens will be resolved into atoms, like smoke: nimlâchū
from mâlach, related to mârach, root mal, from which comes mâlal (see at
[Job 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002).md), to rub to pieces, to
crumble to pieces, or mangle; Aquila, ἠλοήθησαν, from ἀλοᾶν, to thresh.
As melâchı̄m signifies rags, the figure of a garment that has fallen to
pieces, which was then quite ready to hand ([Isa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009).md), presented itself from the
natural association of ideas. כּמו־כן, however, cannot mean "in like
manner" (lxx, Targ., Jerome); for if we keep to the figure of a garment
falling to pieces, the figure is a very insipid one; and if we refer it
to the fate of the earth generally, the thought which it offers is a
very tame one. The older expositors were not even acquainted with what
is now the favourite explanation, viz., "as gnats perish" (Hitzig,
Ewald, Umbreit, Knobel, Stier, etc.); since the singular of kinnı̄m is no
more kēn than the singular of בּיצים is בּיץ. The gnat (viz., a species
of stinging gnat, probably the diminutive but yet very troublesome
species which is called akol uskut, "eat and be silent," in Egyptian) is
called kinnâh, as the talmudic usage shows, where the singular, which
does not happen to be met with in the Old Testament, is found in the
case of kinnı̄m as well as in that of bētsı̄m.

(Note: Kinnâm, in [Exo 8:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#013.md),
whether it be a collective plural or a singular, also proves nothing in
support of kēn, any more than middâh in [Job
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#009) (which see.md) in favour of mad, in
the sense of measure. It does not follow, that because a certain form
lies at the foundation of a derivative, it must have been current in
ordinary usage.)

We must explain the word in the same manner as in [Sa2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005.md); [Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md); [Job
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#035.md). In all these passages kēn merely
signifies "so" (ita, sic); but just as in the classical languages, these
words often derive their meaning from the gesture with which they are
accompanied (e.g., in Terence's Eunuch: Cape hoc flabellum et ventulum
sic facito). This is probably Rckert's opinion, when he adopts the
rendering: and its inhabitants "like so" (so wie so) do they die. But
"like so" is here equivalent to "like nothing." That the heavens and the
earth do not perish without rising again in a renewed form, is a thought
which may naturally be supplied, and which is distinctly expressed in
[Isa 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016.md); [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022). Righteousness (tsedâqâh.md) and
salvation (yeshū‛âh) are the heavenly powers, which acquire dominion
through the overthrow of the ancient world, and become the foundations
of the new ([Pe2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013).md). That the
tsedâqâh will endure for ever, and the yeshū‛âh will not be broken
(yēchath, as in [Isa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md),
confringetur, whereas in [Isa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007.md) the
meaning is consternemini), is a prospect that opens after the
restoration of the new world, and which indirectly applies to men who
survive the catastrophe, having become partakers of righteousness and
salvation. For righteousness and salvation require beings in whom to
exert their power.

[Isaiah 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 51:7</span></span>

Upon this magnificent promise of the final triumph of the counsel of
God, an exhortation is founded to the persecuted church, not to be
afraid of men. "Hearken unto me, ye that know about righteousness, thou
people with my law in the heart; fear ye not the reproach of mortals,
and be ye not alarmed at their revilings. For the moth will devour them
like a garment, and the worm devour them like woollen cloth; and my
righteousness will stand for ever, and my salvation to distant
generations." The idea of the "servant of Jehovah," in its middle sense,
viz., as denoting the true Israel, is most clearly set forth in the
address here. They that pursue after righteousness, and seek Jehovah
([Isa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001).md), that is to say, the
servants of Jehovah ([Isa 65:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008).md), are
embraced in the unity of a "people," as in [Isa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010.md) (cf., [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024).md), i.e., of the true people of
God in the people of His choice, and therefore of the kernel in the
heart of the whole mass - an integral intermediate link in the organism
of the general idea, which Hvernick and, to a certain extent, Hofmann
eliminate from it,

(Note: Hvernick, in his Lectures on the Theology of the Old Testament,
published by H. A. Hahn, 1848, and in a second edition by H. Schultz,
1863; Drechsler, in his article on the Servant of Jehovah, in the Luth.
Zeitschrift, 1852; V. Hofmann, in his Schriftbeweis, ii. 1, 147. The
first two understand by the servant of Jehovah as an individual, the
true Israel personified: the idea has simply Israel as a whole at its
base, i.e., Israel which did not answer to its ideal, and the Messiah as
the summit, in whom the ideal of Israel was fully realized. Drechsler
goes so far as to call the central link, viz., an Israel true to its
vocation, a modern abstraction that has no support in the Scriptures.
Hofmann, however, says that he has no wish to exclude this central idea,
and merely wishes to guard against the notion that a number of
individuals, whether Israelites generally or pious Israelites, are ever
intended by the epithet "servant of Jehovah." "The nation," he says
himself at p. 145, "was called as a nation to be the servant of God, but
it fulfilled its calling as a church of believers." And so say we; but
we also add that this church is a kernel always existing within the
outer ecclesia mixta, and therefore always a number of individuals,
though they are only known to God.)

but not without thereby destroying the typical mirror in which the
prophet beholds the passion of the One. The words are addressed to those
who know from their own experience what righteousness is as a gift of
grace, and as conduct in harmony with the plan of salvation, i.e., to
the nation, which bears in its heart the law of God as the standard and
impulse of its life, the church which not only has it as a letter
outside itself, but as a vital power within (cf., [Psa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009).md). None of these need to be afraid
of men. Their despisers and blasphemers are men ('ĕnōsh; cf., [Isa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md), [Psa
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020.md); [Psa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018).md), whose pretended omnipotence,
exaltation, and indestructibility, are an unnatural self-convicted lie.
The double figure in [Isa 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008.md), which
forms a play upon words that cannot well be reproduced, affirms that the
smallest exertion of strength is quite sufficient to annihilate their
sham greatness and sham power; and that long before they are actually
destroyed, they carry the constantly increasing germ of it within
themselves. The sâs, says a Jewish proverb, is brother to the ‛âsh. The
latter (from ‛âshēsh, collabi, Arab. ‛aththa, trans. corrodere)
signifies a moth; the former (like the Arabic sūs, sūse, Gr. σής) a
moth, and also a weevil, curculio. The relative terms in Greek are σής
(Armen. tzetz) and κίς. But whilst the persecutors of the church succumb
to these powers of destruction, the righteousness and salvation of God,
which are even now the confidence and hope of His church, and the full
and manifest realization of which it will hereafter enjoy, stand for
ever, and from "generation to generation," ledōr dōrı̄m, i.e., to an age
which embraces endless ages within itself.

[Isaiah 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 51:9</span></span>

But just as such an exhortation as this followed very naturally from the
grand promises with which they prophecy commenced, so does a longing for
the promised salvation spring out of this exhortation, together with the
assurance of its eventual realization. "Awake, awake, clothe thyself in
might, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of ancient time, the ages
of the olden world! Was it not thou that didst split Rahab in pieces,
and pierced the dragon? Was it not thou that didst dry up the sea, the
waters of the great billow; that didst turn the depths of the sea into a
way for redeemed to pass through? Ad the emancipated of Jehovah will
return, and come to Zion with shouting, and everlasting joy upon their
head: they grasp at gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing flee away."
The paradisaical restoration of Zion, the new world of righteousness and
salvation, is a work of the arm of Jehovah, i.e., of the manifestation
of His might. His arm is now in a sleeping state. It is not lifeless,
indeed, but motionless. Therefore the church calls out to it three
times, "Awake" (‛ūrı̄: to avoid monotony, the milra and milel tones are
interchanged, as in [Jdg 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#012).md).

(Note: See Norzi and Luzzatto's Grammatica della Lingua Ebr. 513.)

It is to arise and put on strength out of the fulness of omnipotence
(lâbhēsh as in [Psa 93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md); cf.,
λαμβάνειν δύναμιν [Rev 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017.md), and
δύσεο ἀλκήν, arm thyself with strength, in Il. 19:36; 9:231). The arm of
Jehovah is able to accomplish what the prophecy affirms and the church
hopes for; since it has already miraculously redeemed Israel once.
Rahabh is Egypt represented as a monster of the waters (see [Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007).md), and tannı̄n is the same (cf.,
[Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md), but with particular
reference to Pharaoh ([Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003).md).
אתּ־היא, tu illud, is equivalent to "thou, yea thou" (see at [Isa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016).md). The Red Sea is described as
the "waters of the great deep" (tehōm rabbâh), because the great
storehouse of waters that lie below the solid ground were partially
manifested there. השּׂמה has double pashta; it is therefore milel, and
therefore the third pr. = שׂמה אשׁר (Ges. 109, Anf.). [Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md) is repeated in [Isa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011.md), being attached to גּאוּלים of
the previous verse, jut as it is there. Instead of נסוּ ישּׂיגוּן, which
we find here, we have there ונסוּ ישּׂיגוּ; in everything else the two
passages are word for word the same. Hitzig, Ewald, and Knobel suppose
that [Isa 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011.md) was not written by the
author of these addresses, but was interpolated by some one else. But in
[Isa 65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025.md) we meet with just the same
kind of repetition from chapters 1-39; and in the first part we find, at
any rate, repetitions in the form of refrains and others of a smaller
kind (like [Isa 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#015.md), cf., [Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013).md). And [Isa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011.md) forms a conclusion here, just as
it does in [Isa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md). An argument is
founded upon the olden time with reference to the things to be expected
now; the look into the future is cleared and strengthened by the look
into the past. And thus will the emancipated of Jehovah return, being
liberated from the present calamity as they were delivered from the
Egyptian then. The first half of this prophecy is here brought to a
close. It concludes with expressions of longing and of hope, the echo of
promises that had gone before.

[Isaiah 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 51:12</span></span>

In the second half the promise commences again, but with more distinct
reference to the oppression of the exiles and the sufferings of
Jerusalem. Jehovah Himself begins to speak now, setting His seal upon
what is longed and hoped for. "I am your comforter: who art thou, that
thou shouldst be afraid of a mortal who will die, and of a son of man
who is made a blade of grass; that thou shouldst forget Jehovah thy
Creator, who stretched out the heavens and founded the earth; that thou
shouldst be afraid continually all the day of the fury of the tormentor,
as he aims to destroy? and where is the fury of the tormentor left? He
that is bowed down is quickly set loose, and does not die to the grave,
and his bread does not fail him; as truly as I Jehovah am thy God, who
frighteneth up the sea, so that its waves roar: Jehovah of hosts is His
name." הוּא after אנכי אנכי is an emphatic repetition, and therefore a
strengthening of the subject (αὐτὸς ἐγώ), as above, in [Isa
51:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#010.md), in אתּ־היא. From this major,
that Jehovah is the comforter of His church, and by means of a minor,
that whoever has Him for a comforter has no need to fear, the conclusion
is drawn that the church has no cause to fear. Consequently we cannot
adopt Knobel's explanation, "How small thou art, that thou art afraid."
The meaning is rather, "Is it really the case with thee (i.e., art thou
then so small, so forsaken), that thou hast any need to fear" (fut.
consec., according to Ges. 129, 1; cf., ki, [Exo
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#011.md); [Jdg
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#028).md)? The attributive sentence tâmūth
(who will die) brings out the meaning involved in the epithet applied to
man, viz., 'ĕnōsh (compare in the Persian myth Gayomard, from the old
Persian gaya meretan, mortal life); חציר = כּחציר ([Psa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002.md); [Psa
90:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005.md); [Psa
103:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015.md); compare above, [Isa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006).md) is an equation instead of a
comparison. In [Isa 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md) the address
is thrown into a feminine form, in [Isa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013.md) into a masculine one; Zion being
the object in the former, and (what is the same thing) Israel in the
latter: that thou forgettest thy Creator, who is also the almighty Maker
of the universe, and soarest about in constant endless alarm at the
wrath of the tormentor, whilst he is aiming to destroy (pichad,
contremiscere, as in [Pro 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014.md);
ka'ăsher as in [Psa 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#007.md); [Num
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md), lit., according as; kōnēn,
viz., his arrows, or even his bow, as in [Psa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002.md); [Psa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013.md), cf., [Isa
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013).md). We must not translate this
quasi disposuisset, which is opposed to the actual fact, although
syntactically possible ([Job 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#019.md);
[Zac 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006).md). The question with which
the fear is met, "And where is the fury of the tormentor?" looks into
the future: "There is not a trace of him to be seen, he is utterly swept
away." If hammētsı̄q signifies the Chaldean, [Isa
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#014.md), in which the warning passes
into a promise, just as in the first half the promise passed into a
warning, is not to be understood as referring to oppression by their own
countrymen, who were more heathenish than Israelitish in their
disposition, as Knobel supposes; but tsō‛eh (from tsâ‛âh, to stoop or
bend) is an individualizing description of the exiles, who were in
captivity in Babylon, and some of them actually in prison (see [Isa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007.md), [Isa
42:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#022).md). Those who were lying there in
fetters, and were therefore obliged to bend, hastened to be loosed,
i.e., would speedily be set at liberty (the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus
may be referred to here); they would not die and fall into the pit
(constr. praegnans), nor would their bread fail; that is to say, if we
regard the two clauses as the dissection of one thought (which is not
necessary, however, though Hitzig supports it), "he will not die of
starvation." The pledge of this is to be found in the all-sufficiency of
Jehovah, who throws the sea into a state of trembling (even by a
threatening word, geârâh; רגע is the construct of the participle, with
the tone upon the last syllable, as in [Lev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#007.md); [Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009.md) : see Br's Psalter, p. 132, from
râga‛, tremefacere), so that its waves roar (cf., [Jer
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035.md), and the original passage in
[Job 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 51:16</span></span>

The promise, as the pledge of which Jehovah has staked His absolute
power, to which everything must yield, now rises up to an eschatological
height, from the historical point at which it began. "And I put my words
into thy mouth, and in the shadow of my hand have I covered thee, to
plant heavens, and to found an earth, and to say to Zion, Thou art my
people." It is a lofty calling, a glorious future, for the preparation
and introduction of which Israel, although fallen as low as [Isa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007.md) describes, has been equipped and
kept in the shadow of unapproachable omnipotence. Jehovah has put His
words into the mouth of this Israel - His words, the force and certainty
of which are measured by His all-determining absoluteness. And what is
the exalted calling which it is to subserve through the medium of these
words, and for which it is preserved, without previously, or indeed at
any time, passing away? We must not render it, "that thou mayest plant,"
etc., with which the conclusion does not harmonize, viz., "that thou
mayest say," etc.; for it is not Israel who says this to Israel, but
Jehovah says it to Israel. The planter, founder, speaker, is therefore
Jehovah. It is God's own work, to which Israel is merely instrumentally
subservient, by means of the words of God place din its mouth, viz., the
new creation of the world, and the restoration of Israel to favour; both
of them, the former as well as the latter, regalia of God. The reference
is to the last times. The Targum explains it thus: "to restore the
people of whom it is said, They will be as numerous as the stars of
heaven; and to perfect the church, of which it is said, They will be as
numerous as the dust of the earth." Knobel understands by this a
completion of the theocracy, and a new arrangement of the condition of
the world; Ewald, a new spiritual creation, of which the liberation of
Israel is the first corner-stone. But the prophecy speaks of a new
heaven and a new earth, in something more than a figurative sense, as a
new creation of God ([Isa 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017).md).
Jehovah intends to create a new world of righteousness and salvation,
and practically to acknowledge Zion as His people. The preparation for
this great and all-renewing work of the future is aided by the true
Israel, which is now enslaved by the heathen, and disowned and
persecuted by its own countrymen. A future of salvation, embracing
Israel and the heaven and the earth, is implied in the words placed by
Jehovah in the mouth of His church, which was faithful to its calling.
These words in their mouth are the seed-corns of a new world in the
midst of the old. The fact that the very same thing is said here of the
true spiritual Israel, as in [Isa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002.md)
of the one servant of Jehovah, may be explained in the same manner as
when the apostles apply to themselves, in [Act
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047.md), a word of God relating to the
one Servant of Jehovah, by saying, "So hath the Lord commanded us." The
One is, in fact, one with this Israel; He is this Israel in its highest
potency; He towers above it, but only as the head rises above the
members of the body, with which it forms a living whole. There is no
necessity, therefore, to assume, as Hengstenberg and Philippi do, that
[Isa 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013.md) contains an address from
the One who then stood before the mind of the prophet. "There is no
proof," as Vitringa affirms, "of any change in the object in this
passage, nor any solid reason for assuming it." The circumference of the
idea is always the same. Here, however, it merely takes the direction
towards the centre, and penetrates its smaller inner circle, but does
not go back to the centre itself.

[Isaiah 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 51:17</span></span>

Just as we found above, that the exclamation "awake" (‛ūrı̄), which the
church addresses to the arm of Jehovah, grew out of the preceding great
promises; so here there grows out of the same another "awake"
(hith‛ōrerı̄), which the prophet addresses to Jerusalem in the name of
his God, and the reason for which is given in the form of new promises.
"Wake thyself up, wake thyself up, stand up, O Jerusalem, thou that hast
drunk out of the hand of Jehovah the goblet of His fury: the goblet cup
of reeling hast thou drunk, sipped out. There was none who guided her of
all the children that she had brought forth; and none who took her by
the hand of all the children that she had brought up. There were two
things that happened to thee; who should console thee? Devastation, and
ruin, and famine, and the sword: how should I comfort thee? Thy children
were benighted, lay at the corners of all the streets like a snared
antelope: as those who were full of the fury of Jehovah, the rebuke of
thy God. Therefore hearken to this, O wretched and drunken, but not with
wine: Thus saith thy Lord, Jehovah, and thy God that defendeth His
people, Behold, I take out of thine hand the goblet of reeling, the
goblet cup of my fury: thou shalt not continue to drink it any more. And
I put it into the hand of thy tormentors; who said to thy soul, Bow
down, that we may go over; and thou madest thy back like the ground, and
like a public way for those who go over it." In [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md), Jerusalem is regarded as a
woman lying on the ground in the sleep of faintness and stupefaction.
She has been obliged to drink, for her punishment, the goblet filled
with the fury of the wrath of God, the goblet which throws those who
drink it into unconscious reeling; and this goblet, which is called
qubba‛ath kōs (κύπελλον ποτηιρίου, a genitive construction, though
appositional in sense), for the purpose of giving greater prominence to
its swelling sides, she has not only had to drink, but to drain quite
clean (cf., [Psa 75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md), and more
especially [Eze 23:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#032).md). Observe the
plaintive falling of the tone in shâthı̄th mâtsı̄th. In this state of
unconscious stupefaction was Jerusalem lying, without any help on the
part of her children; there was not one who came to guide the stupefied
one, or took her by the hand to lift her up. The consciousness of the
punishment that their sins had deserved, and the greatness of the
sufferings that the punishment had brought, pressed so heavily upon all
the members of the congregation, that not one of them showed the
requisite cheerfulness and strength to rise up on her behalf, so as to
make her fate at any rate tolerable to her, and ward off the worst
calamities. What elegiac music we have here in the deep cadences:
mikkol-bânı̄m yâlâdâh, mikkol-bânı̄m giddēlâh! So terrible was her
calamity, that no one ventured to break the silence of the terror, or
give expression to their sympathy. Even the prophet, humanly speaking,
is obliged to exclaim, "How (mı̄, literally as who, as in [Amo
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#002.md), [Amo
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#005).md) should I comfort thee!" He knew
of no equal or greater calamity, to which he could point Jerusalem,
according to the principle which experience confirms, solamen miseris
socios habuisse malorum. This is the real explanation, according to [Lam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013.md), though we must not therefore
take mı̄ as an accusative = bemı̄, as Hitzig does. The whole of the group
is in the tone of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. There were two kinds of
things (i.e., two kinds of evils: mishpâchōth, as in [Jer
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003).md) that had happened to her (קרא =
קרה, with which it is used interchangeably even in the Pentateuch) -
namely, the devastation and ruin of their city and their land, famine
and the sword to her children, their inhabitants.

In [Isa 51:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020.md) this is depicted with
special reference to the famine. Her children were veiled (‛ullaph,
deliquium pati, lit., obvelari), and lay in a state of unconsciousness
like corpses at the corner of every street, where this horrible
spectacle presented itself on every hand. They lay ketho' mikhmâr
(rendered strangely and with very bad taste in the lxx, viz., like a
half-cooked turnip; but given correctly by Jerome, sicut oryx, as in the
lxx at [Deu 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#005), illaqueatus.md), i.e.,
like a netted antelope (see at [Job
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#009).md), i.e., one that has been taken
in a hunter's net and lies there exhausted, after having almost
strangled itself by ineffectual attempts to release itself. The
appositional וגו המלאים, which refers to בניך, gives as a quippe qui the
reason for all this suffering. It is the punishment decreed by God,
which has pierced their very heart, and got them completely in its
power. This clause assigning the reason, shows that the expression "thy
children" (bânayikh) is not to be taken here in the same manner as in
[Lam 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md); [Lam
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md), viz., as referring to children
in distinction from adults; the subject is a general one, as in [Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md). With lâkhē̄n (therefore, [Isa
51:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021).md) the address turns from the
picture of sufferings to the promise, in the view of which the cry was
uttered, in [Isa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md), to awake and
arise. Therefore, viz., because she had endured the full measure of
God's wrath, she is to hear what His mercy, that has now begun to move,
purposes to do. The connecting form shekhurath stands here, according to
Ges. 116, 1, notwithstanding the (epexegetical) Vav which comes between.
We may see from [Isa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md) how
thoroughly this "drunk, but not with wine," is in Isaiah's own style
(from this distinction between a higher and lower sphere of related
facts, compare [Isa 47:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#014.md); [Isa
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010).md). The intensive plural 'ădōnı̄m
is only applied to human lords in other places in the book of Isaiah;
but in this passage, in which Jerusalem is described as a woman, it is
used once of Jehovah. Yârı̄bh ‛ammō is an attributive clause, signifying
"who conducts the cause of His people," i.e., their advocate or
defender. He takes the goblet of reeling and wrath, which Jerusalem has
emptied, for ever out of her hand, and forces it newly filled upon her
tormentors. There is no ground whatever for reading מוניך (from ינה, to
throw down, related to יון, whence comes יון, a precipitate or sediment)
in the place of מוגי (pret. hi. of יגה, (laborare, dolere), that
favourite word of the Lamentations of Jeremiah ([Lam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#005.md), [Lam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012.md); [Lam
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#032.md), cf., [Isa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004).md), the tone of which we recognise
here throughout, as Lowth, Ewald, and Umbreit propose after the Targum
ליך מונן דהוו. The words attributed to the enemies, shechı̄ vena‛ăbhorâh
(from shâchâh, the kal of which only occurs here), are to be understood
figuratively, as in [Psa 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003.md).
Jerusalem has been obliged to let her children be degraded into the
defenceless objects of despotic tyranny and caprice, both at home in
their own conquered country, and abroad in exile. But the relation is
reversed now. Jerusalem is delivered, after having been punished, and
the instruments of her punishment are given up to the punishment which
their pride deserved.
