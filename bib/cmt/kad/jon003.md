Jonah's Preaching in Nineveh - [Jon
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#001.md)

After Jonah had been punished for his disobedience, and miraculously
delivered from death by the mercy of God, he obeyed the renewed command
of Jehovah, and preached to the city of Nineveh that it would be
destroyed within forty days on account of its sins ([Jon
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#001).md). But the Ninevites believed in
God, and repented in sackcloth and ashes, to avert the threatened
destruction ([Jon 3:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005).md); and the Lord
spared the city ([Jon 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010).md).

[Jonah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jon 3:1</span></span>

The word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time, to go to Nineveh and
proclaim to that city what Jehovah would say to him. קריאה: that which
is called out, the proclamation, τὸ κήρυγμα (lxx). Jonah now obeyed the
word of Jehovah. But Nineveh was a great city to God (lē'lōhı̄m), i.e.,
it was regarded by God as a great city. This remark points to the motive
for sparing it (cf. [Jon 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011).md), in
case its inhabitants hearkened to the word of God. Its greatness
amounted to "a three days' walk." This is usually supposed to refer to
the circumference of the city, by which the size of a city is generally
determined. But the statement in [Jon
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004.md), that "Jonah began to enter into
the city the walk of a day," i.e., a day's journey, is apparently at
variance with this. Hence Hitzig has come to the conclusion that the
diameter or length of the city is intended, and that, as the walk of a
day in [Jon 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004.md) evidently points to
the walk of three days in [Jon 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003.md),
the latter must also be understood as referring to the length of
Nineveh. But according to Diod. ii. 3 the length of the city was 150
stadia, and Herodotus (v. 53) gives just this number of stadia as a
day's journey. Hence Jonah would not have commenced his preaching till
he had reached the opposite end of the city. This line of argument, the
intention of which is to prove the absurdity of the narrative, is based
upon the perfectly arbitrary assumption that Jonah went through the
entire length of the city in a straight line, which is neither probable
in itself, nor implied in בּוא בעיר. This simply means to enter, or go
into the city, and says nothing about the direction of the course he
took within the city. But in a city, the diameter of which was 150
stadia, and the circumference 480 stadia, one might easily walk for a
whole day without reaching the other end, by winding about from one
street into another. And Jonah would have to do this to find a suitable
place for his preaching, since we are not warranted in assuming that it
lay exactly in the geographical centre, or at the end of the street
which led from the gate into the city. But if Jonah wandered about in
different directions, as Theodoret says, "not going straight through the
city, but strolling through market-places, streets, etc.," the distance
of a day's journey over which he travelled must not be understood as
relating to the diameter or length of the city; so that the objection to
the general opinion, that the three days' journey given as the size of
the city refers to the circumference, entirely falls to the ground.
Moreover, Hitzig has quite overlooked the word ויּחל in his argument.
The text does not affirm that Jonah went a day's journey into the city,
but that he "began to go into the city a day's journey, and cried out."
These words do not affirm that he did not begin to preach till after he
had gone a whole day's journey, but simply that he had commenced his
day's journey in the city when he found a suitable place and a fitting
opportunity for his proclamation. They leave the distance that he had
really gone, when he began his preaching, quite indefinite; and by no
means necessitate the assumption that he only began to preach in the
evening, after his day's journey was ended. All that they distinctly
affirm is, that he did not preach directly he entered the city, but only
after he had commenced a day's journey, that is to say, had gone some
distance into the city. And this is in perfect harmony with all that we
know about the size of Nineveh at that time. The circumference of the
great city Nineveh, or the length of the boundaries of the city of
Nineveh in the broadest sense, was, as Niebuhr says (p. 277), "nearly
ninety English miles, not reckoning the smaller windings of the
boundary; and this would be just three days' travelling for a good
walker on a long journey." "Jonah," he continues, "begins to go a day's
journey into the city, then preaches, and the preaching reaches the ears
of the king (cf. [Jon 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006).md). He
therefore came very near to the citadel as he went along on his first
day's journey. At that time the citadel was probably in Nimrud (Calah).
Jonah, who would hardly have travelled through the desert, went by what
is now the ordinary caravan road past Amida, and therefore entered the
city at Nineveh. And it was on the road from Nineveh to Calah, not far
off the city, possibly in the city itself, that he preached. Now the
distance between Calah and Nineveh (not reckoning either city), measured
in a straight line upon the map, is 18 1/2 English miles." If, then, we
add to this, (1) that the road from Nineveh to Calah or Nimrud hardly
ran in a perfectly straight line, and therefore would be really longer
than the exact distance between the two parts of the city according to
the map, and (2) that Jonah had first of all to go through Nineveh, and
possibly into Calah, he may very well have walked twenty English miles,
or a short day's journey, before he preached. The main point of his
preaching is all that is given, viz., the threat that Nineveh would be
destroyed, which was the point of chief importance, so far as the object
of the book was concerned, and which Jonah of course explained by
denouncing the sins and vices of the city. The threat ran thus: "Yet
forty days, and Nineveh will be destroyed." נהפּך, lit., overturned,
i.e., destroyed from the very foundations, is the word applied to the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The respite granted is fixed at forty
days, according to the number which, even as early as the flood, was
taken as the measure for determining the delaying of visitations of God.

(Note: The lxx, however, τρεῖς ἡμέρας, probably from a peculiar and
arbitrary combination, and not merely from an early error of the pen.
The other Greek translators (Aquil., Symm., and Theodot.) had, according
to Theodoret, the number forty; and so also had the Syriac.)

[Jonah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jon 3:5</span></span>

The Ninevites believed in God, since they hearkened to the preaching of
the prophet sent to them by God, and humbled themselves before God with
repentance. They proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth (penitential
garments: see at [Joe 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013.md); [Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027), etc..md), "from their great one
even to their small one," i.e., both old and young, all without
exception. Even the king, when the matter (had-dâbhâr) came to his
knowledge, i.e., when he was informed of Jonah's coming, and of his
threatening prediction, descended from his throne, laid aside his royal
robe ('addereth, see at [Jos 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021).md),
wrapt himself in a sackcloth, and sat down in ashes, as a sign of the
deepest mourning (compare [Job 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008).md),
and by a royal edict appointed a general fast for man and beast. ויּזעק,
he caused to be proclaimed. ויּאמר, and said, viz., through his heralds.
מפּעם הם, ex decreto, by command of the king and his great men, i.e.,
his ministers (פעם = פעם, [Dan 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#010.md),
[Dan 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#029.md), a technical term for the
edicts of the Assyrian and Babylonian kings). "Man and beast (viz., oxen
and sheep) are to taste nothing; they are not to pasture (the cattle are
not to be driven to the pasture), and are to drink no water." אל, for
which we should expect לא, may be explained from the fact that the
command is communicated directly. Moreover, man and beast are to be
covered with mourning clothes, and cry to God bechozqâh, i.e., strongly,
mightily, and to turn every one from his evil ways: so "will God perhaps
(מי יודע) turn and repent (yâshūbh venicham, as in [Joe
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014).md), and desist from the fierceness
of His anger (cf. [Exo 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012).md), that we
perish not." This verse ([Jon 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#009).md)
also belongs to the king's edict. The powerful impression made upon the
Ninevites by Jonah's preaching, so that the whole city repented in
sackcloth and ashes, is quite intelligible, if we simply bear in mind
the great susceptibility of Oriental races to emotion, the awe of one
Supreme Being which is peculiar to all the heathen religions of Asia,
and the great esteem in which soothsaying and oracles were held in
Assyria from the very earliest times (vid., Cicero, de divinat. i. 1);
and if we also take into calculation the circumstance that the
appearance of a foreigner, who, without any conceivable personal
interest, and with the most fearless boldness, disclosed to the great
royal city its godless ways, and announced its destruction within a very
short period with the confidence so characteristic of the God-sent
prophets, could not fail to make a powerful impression upon the minds of
the people, which would be all the stronger if the report of the
miraculous working of the prophets of Israel had penetrated to Nineveh.
There is just as little to surprise us in the circumstance that the
signs of mourning among the Ninevites resemble in most respects the
forms of penitential mourning current among the Israelites, since these
outward signs of mourning are for the most part the common human
expressions of deep sorrow of heart, and are found in the same or
similar forms among all the nations of antiquity (see the numerous
proofs of this which are collected in Winer's Real-wrterbuch, art.
Trauer; and in Herzog's Cyclopaedia). Ezekiel ([Eze
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#016).md) depicts the mourning of the
Tyrian princes over the ruin of their capital in just the same manner in
which that of the king of Nineveh is described here in [Jon
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006.md), except that, instead of
sackcloth, he mentions trembling as that with which they wrap themselves
round. The garment of haircloth (saq) worn as mourning costume reaches
as far back as the patriarchal age (cf. [Gen
37:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#034.md); [Job
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015).md). Even the one feature which is
peculiar to the mourning of Nineveh - namely, that the cattle also have
to take part in the mourning - is attested by Herodotus (9:24) as an
Asiatic custom.

(Note: Herodotus relates that the Persians, when mourning for their
general, Masistios, who had fallen in the battle at Platea, shaved off
the hair from their horses, and adds, "Thus did the barbarians, in their
way, mourn for the deceased Masistios." Plutarch relates the same thing
(Aristid. 14 fin. Compare Brissonius, de regno Pers. princip. ii. p.
206; and Periz. ad Aeliani Var. hist. vii. 8). The objection made to
this by Hitzig - namely, that the mourning of the cattle in our book is
not analogous to the case recorded by Herodotus, because the former was
an expression of repentance - has no force whatever, for the simple
reason that in all nations the outward signs of penitential mourning are
the same as those of mourning for the dead.)

This custom originated in the idea that there is a biotic rapport
between man and the larger domestic animals, such as oxen, sheep, and
goats, which are his living property. It is only to these animals that
there is any reference here, and not to "horses, asses, and camels,
which were decorated at other times with costly coverings," as Marck,
Rosenmller, and others erroneously assume. Moreover, this was not done
"with the intention of impelling the men to shed hotter tears through
the lowing and groaning of the cattle" (Theodoret); or "to set before
them as in a mirror, through the sufferings of the innocent brutes,
their own great guilt" (Chald.); but it was a manifestation of the
thought, that just as the animals which live with man are drawn into
fellowship with his sin, so their sufferings might also help to appease
the wrath of God. And although this thought might not be free from
superstition, there lay at the foundation of it this deep truth, that
the irrational creature is made subject to vanity on account of man's
sins, and sighs along with man for liberation from the bondage of
corruption ([Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)..md). We cannot
therefore take the words "cry mightily unto God" as referring only to
the men, as many commentators have done, in opposition to the context;
but must regard "man and beast" as the subject of this clause also,
since the thought that even the beasts cry to or call upon God in
distress has its scriptural warrant in [Joe
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020.md).

[Jonah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jon 3:10</span></span>

But however deep the penitential mourning of Nineveh might be, and
however sincere the repentance of the people, when they acted according
to the king's command; the repentance was not a lasting one, or
permanent in its effects. Nor did it evince a thorough conversion to
God, but was merely a powerful incitement to conversion, a waking up out
of the careless security of their life of sin, an endeavour to forsake
their evil ways which did not last very long. The statement in [Jon
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010.md), that "God saw their doing, that
they turned from their evil ways; and He repented of the evil that He
had said that He would do to them, and did it not" (cf. [Exo
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014).md), can be reconciled with this
without difficulty. The repentance of the Ninevites, even if it did not
last, showed, at any rate, a susceptibility on the part of the heathen
for the word of God, and their willingness to turn and forsake their
evil and ungodly ways; so that God, according to His compassion, could
extend His grace to them in consequence. God always acts in this way. He
not only forgives the converted man, who lays aside his sin, and walks
in newness of life; but He has mercy also upon the penitent who
confesses and mourns over his sin, and is willing to amend. The Lord
also directed Jonah to preach repentance to Nineveh; not that this
capital of the heathen world might be converted at once to faith in the
living God, and its inhabitants be received into the covenant of grace
which He had made with Israel, but simply to give His people Israel a
practical proof that He was the God of the heathen also, and could
prepare for Himself even among them a people of His possession.
Moreover, the readiness, with which the Ninevites hearkened to the word
of God that was proclaimed to them and repented, showed that with all
the depth to which they were sunken in idolatry and vice they were at
that time not yet ripe for the judgment of extermination. The punishment
was therefore deferred by the long-suffering of God, until this great
heathen city, in its further development into a God-opposing imperial
power, seeking to subjugate all nations, and make itself the mistress of
the earth, had filled up the measure of its sins, and had become ripe
for that destruction which the prophet Nahum predicted, and the Median
king Cyaxares inflicted upon it in alliance with Nabopolassar of
Babylonia.
