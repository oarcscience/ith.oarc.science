Division of the Army. Tribal Princes, Administrators of the Domains, and
Councillors of State - 1 Chronicles 27

This chapter treats of the organization of the army ([Ch1
27:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001).md) and the public
administration; in [Ch1 27:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016.md), the
princes of the twelve tribes being enumerated; in [Ch1
27:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025.md), the managers of the royal
possessions and domains; and in [Ch1
27:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#032.md), the chief councillors of the
king. The information on these points immediately succeeds the
arrangement of the service of the Levites, because, as we learn from
[Ch1 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#023.md)., David attempted in the
last year of his reign to give a more stable form to the political
constitution of the kingdom also. In the enumeration of the twelve
divisions of the army, with their leaders ([Ch1
27:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001).md), it is not indeed said when
David organized the men capable of bearing arms for the alternating
monthly service; but the reference in [Ch1
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#023.md). of our chapter to the numbering
of the people, spoken of in 1 Chron 21, leaves no doubt of the fact that
this division of the people stands in intimate connection with that
numbering of the people, and that David caused the people to be numbered
in order to perfect the military constitution of the kingdom, and to
leave his kingdom to his son strong within and mighty without.

[1 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 27:1</span></span>

The twelve divisions of the army. - [Ch1
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001.md). The lengthy superscription, "And
the sons of Israel according to their number, the heads of the
fathers'-houses, and the princes over the thousands and the hundreds,
and their scribes, who swerved the king in regard to every matter of the
divisions; which month for month of all months of the year went and
came, one division 24,000 men," is towards the end so intimately
interwoven with the divisions of the army, that it can only refer to
this, i.e., only to the catalogue, [Ch1
27:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002.md). Since, then, we find in this
catalogue only the twelve classes, the number of the men belonging to
each, and their leaders, and since for this the short superscription,
"the Israelites according to their number, and the princes of the
divisions which served the king," would be amply sufficient, Bertheau
thinks that the superscription originally belonged to a more complete
description of the classes and their different officers, of which only a
short extract is here communicated. This hypothesis is indeed possible,
but is not at all certain; for it is questionable whether, according to
the above superscription, we have a right to expect an enumeration by
name of the various officials who served the king in the classes of the
army. The answer to this question depends upon our view of the relation
of the words, "the heads of the fathers'-houses, and the princes," to
the first clause, "the sons of Israel according to their number." Had
these words been connected by the conjunction ו (וראשׁי) with this
clause, and thereby made co-ordinate with it, we should be justified in
having such an expectation. But the want of the conjunction shows that
these words form an apposition, which as to signification is subordinate
to the main idea. If we take this appositional explanation to mean
something like this, "the sons of Israel, according to their number,
with the heads of the fathers'-houses and the princes," the emphasis of
the superscription falls upon למספּרם, and the number of the sons of
Israel, who with their heads and princes were divided into classes, is
announced to be the important thing in the following catalogue. That
this is the meaning and object of the words may be gathered from this,
that in the second half of the verse, the number of the men fit for
service, who from month to month came and went as one class, is stated
האחת, one at a time (distributive), as in [Jdg
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#018.md); [Num
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#006.md), etc.; cf. Ew. 313, a, note 1.
וצא בּוא, used of entering upon and leaving the service (cf. [Ch2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#004.md), [Ch2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#008.md); [Kg2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005.md), [Kg2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007.md),[Kg2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#009).md). But the words are hardly to be
understood to mean that the classes which were in service each month
were ordered from various parts of the kingdom to the capital, and there
remained under arms; but rather, as Clericus, that they paratae essent
ducum imperiis parere, si quid contigisset, dum ceterae copiae, si
necesse essent, convenirent.

[Ch1 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002.md)

Over the first division was Jashobeam, scil. commander. The second
מחלקתּו על is to be rendered, "in his division were 24,000 men," i.e.,
they were reckoned to it. As to Jashobeam, see on [Ch1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#011.md) and [Sa2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008.md).

[Ch1 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#003.md)

[Ch1 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#003.md) further relates of him that
he was of the sons (descendants) of Perez, and the head of all the army
chiefs in the first month (i.e., in the division for the first month).

[Ch1 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#004.md)

Before דּודי, according to [Ch1 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#012.md),
בּן אלעזר has been dropped out (see on [Sa2
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#009).md). The words הנּגיד וּמקלות
וּמחלקתּו are obscure. At the end of the sixth verse similar words
occur, and hence Bertheau concludes that וּ before מקלות is to be struck
out, and translated, "and his divisions, Mikloth the prince," which
might denote, perhaps, "and his division is that over which Mikloth was
prince." Older commentators have already translated the word in a
similar manner, as signifying that Mikloth was prince or chief of this
division under the Ahohite Eleazar. All that is certain is, that מקלות
is a name which occurred in [Ch1 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#032.md)
and [Ch1 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#037.md) among the Benjamites.

[Ch1 27:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#005.md)

Here the form of expression is changed; הצּבא שׂר, the chief of the
third host, begins the sentence. As to Benaiah, see [Ch1
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#022.md) and the commentary on [Sa2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020.md). ראשׁ does not belong to הכּהן,
but is the predicate of Benaiah: "the prince of the ... was Benaiah ...
as head," sc. of the division for the third month. This is added,
because in [Ch1 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#006.md) still a third
military office held by Benaiah is mentioned. He was hero of the (among
the) thirty, and over the thirty, i.e., more honoured than they (cf.
[Ch1 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#025.md) and [Sa2
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#023).md). - With [Ch1
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#006.md) cf. what is said on the similar
words, [Ch1 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#004.md).

[Ch1 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#007.md)

From here onwards the mode of expression is very much compressed: the
fourth of the fourth month, instead of the chief of the fourth host of
the fourth month. Asahel (see [Ch1
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#026.md) and on [Sa2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#024).md) was slain by Abner ([Sa2
2:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018).md) in the beginning of David's
reign, and consequently long before the division of the army here
recorded. The words, "and Zebadiah his son after him," point to his
death, as they mention his son as his successor in the command of the
fourth division of the army. When Asahel, therefore, is called commander
of the fourth division of the host, it is done merely honoris caus,
since the division over which his son was named, de patris defuncti
nomine (Cler.).

[Ch1 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#008.md)

Shamhuth is called in [Ch1 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#027.md)
Shammoth, and in [Sa2 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#025.md) Shamma. He
was born in Harod; here he is called היּזרח the Jizrahite, = הזּרחי,
[Ch1 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#013.md), of the family of Zerah the
son of Judah ([Ch1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#004.md), [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006).md).

[Ch1 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#009.md)

Ira; see [Ch1 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#028.md), [Sa2
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#026.md).

[Ch1 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#010.md)

Helez: [Ch1 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#027.md); [Sa2
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#026.md).

Sibbecai; see [Ch1 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#029.md), [Sa2
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#027.md).

[Ch1 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#012.md)

Abiezer; see [Ch1 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#028.md); [Sa2
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#027.md); he was of Anathoth in the tribe
of Benjamin ([Jer 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001).md).

[Ch1 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#013.md)

Maharai (see [Ch1 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#030.md); [Sa2
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#028).md) belonged also to the family of
Zerah; see [Ch1 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#011.md), [Ch1
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#008.md).

[Ch1 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#014.md)

Benaiah of Pirathon; see [Ch1 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#031.md),

[Ch1 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#015.md)

Heldai, in [Ch1 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#030.md) Heled, in [Sa2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#029.md) erroneously called Heleb,
belonging to Othniel's family ([Jos
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#017).md).

[1 Chronicles 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 27:16</span></span>

The princes of the twelve tribes. - The enumeration of the tribal
princes, commencing with the words, "and over the tribes of Israel,"
immediately follows the catalogue of the divisions of the army with
their commanders, because the subjects are in so far connected as the
chief management of the internal business of the people, divided as they
were into tribes, was deposited in their hands. In the catalogue the
tribes Gad and Asher are omitted for reasons unknown to us, just as in 1
Chron 4-7, in the genealogies of the tribes, Dan and Zebulun are. In
reference to Levi, on the contrary, the Nagid of Aaron, i.e., the head
of the priesthood, is named, viz., Zadok, the high priest of the family
of Eleazar.

[1 Chronicles 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 27:18</span></span>

Elihu, of the brethren of David, is only another form of the name Eliab,
[Ch1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013.md), David's eldest brother,
who, as Jesse's first-born, had become tribal prince of Judah.

[1 Chronicles 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 27:20</span></span>

Of Manasseh two tribal princes are named, because the one half of this
tribe had received its inheritance on this side Jordan, the other beyond
Jordan. גּלעדה, towards Gilead, to designate the East-Jordan Manassites.

[1 Chronicles 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 27:23</span></span>

[Ch1 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#023.md) and [Ch1
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#024.md) contain a concluding remark on
the catalogue of the twelve detachments into which the men capable of
bearing arms in Israel were divided, contained in [Ch1
27:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002.md). David had not taken their
number from the men of twenty years and under, i.e., he had only caused
those to be numbered who were over twenty years old. The word מספּרם
points back to למספּרם, [Ch1 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001.md).
מספּר נשׂא as in [Num 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040.md) = ראשׁ
נשׂא, [Exo 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012.md); [Num
1:49](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#049.md), to take up the sum or total. The
reason of this is given in the clause, "for Jahve had said (promised) to
increase Israel like to the stars of heaven" ([Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017).md), which cannot mean: For it was
impossible for David to number all, because they were as numerous as the
stars of heaven, which of course cannot be numbered (Berth.). The
thought is rather that David never intended to number the whole people
from the youngest to the eldest, for he did not desire in fidem
divinarum promissionum inquirere aut eam labefactare (J. H. Mich.); and
he accordingly caused only the men capable of bearing arms to be
numbered, in order to organize the military constitution of the kingdom
in the manner recorded in [Ch1
27:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002.md). But even this numbering which
Joab had begun was not completed, because wrath came on Israel because
of it, as is narrated in 1 Chron 21. For this reason also the number,
i.e., the result of the numbering begun by Joab, but not completed, is
not included in the number of the chronicle of King David, i.e., in the
official number which was usually inserted in the public annals. בּמספּר
neither stands for בּספר (according to [Ch2
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034).md), nor does it denote, "in the
section which treats of the numberings" (Berth.). היּמים דּברי is a
shorter expression for h' דּברי ספר, book of the events of the day.

[1 Chronicles 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 27:25</span></span>

The managers of David's possessions and domains. - The property and the
income of the king were ([Ch1 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025).md)
divided into treasures of the king, and treasures in the country, in the
cities, the villages, and the castles. By the "treasures of the king" we
must therefore understand those which were in Jerusalem, i.e., the
treasures of the royal palace. These were managed by Azmaveth. The
remaining treasures are specified in [Ch1
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#026.md). They consisted in fields which
were cultivated by labourers ([Ch1
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#026).md); in vineyards ([Ch1
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#027).md); plantations of olive trees and
sycamores in the Shephelah, the fruitful plain on the Mediterranean Sea
([Ch1 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#028).md); in cattle, which
pastured partly in the plain of Sharon between Caesarea Palestina and
Joppa, partly in various valleys of the country ([Ch1
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#029).md); and in camels, asses, and
sheep ([Ch1 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#030)..md). All these
possessions are called רכוּשׁ, and the overseers of them הרכוּשׁ שׂרי.
They consisted in the produce of agriculture and cattle-breeding, the
two main branches of Israelitish industry.

[1 Chronicles 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 27:27</span></span>

Special officers were set over the vineyards and the stores of wine. The
שׁ in שׁבּכּרמים is a contraction of אשׁר: "over that which was in the
vineyards of treasures (stores) of wine." The officer over the
vineyards, Shimei, was of Ramah in Benjamin (cf. [Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025).md); he who was over the stores of
wine, Zabdi, is called השּׁפמי, probably not from שׁפם on the northern
frontier of Canaan, [Num 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010.md), the
situation of which has not yet been discovered, but from the equally
unknown שׁפמוה in the Negeb of Judah, [Sa1
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#028.md). For since the vineyards, in
which the stores of wine were laid up, must certainly have lain in the
tribal domain of Judah, so rich in wine ([Num
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md).; [Gen
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011).md), probably the overseers of it
were born in the same district.

[1 Chronicles 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 27:28</span></span>

As to the שׁפלה, see on [Jos 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033.md).
הגּדרי, he who was born in Geder, not Gedera, for which we should expect
הגּדרתי ([Ch1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#004).md), although the
situation of Gedera, south-east from Jabne (see on [Jos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004).md), appears to suit better than
that of גּדר or גּדור in the hill country of Judah; see [Jos
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#013.md) and [Jos
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058.md).

[1 Chronicles 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 27:30</span></span>

The name of the Ishmaelite who was set over the camels, Obil (אוביל),
reminds us of the Arab. abila, multos possedit vel acquisivit camelos.
המּרנמי, he of Meronoth ([Ch1 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#030.md)
and [Neh 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#017).md). The situation of this
place is unknown. According to [Neh
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#007.md), it is perhaps to be sought in the
neighbourhood of Mizpah. Over the smaller cattle (sheep and goats) Jaziz
the Hagarite, of the people Hagar (cf. [Ch1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010).md), was set. The oversight,
consequently, of the camels and sheep was committed to a Hagarite and an
Ishmaelite, probably because they pastured in the neighbourhood where
the Ishmaelites and Hagarites had nomadized from early times, they
having been brought under the dominion of Israel by David. The total
number of these officials amounted to twelve, of whom we may conjecture
that the ten overseers over the agricultural and cattle-breeding affairs
of the king had to deliver over the annual proceeds of the property
committed to them to the chief manager of the treasures in the field, in
the cities, and villages, and towns.

[1 Chronicles 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 27:32</span></span>

David's councillors. This catalogue of the king's officials forms a
supplementary companion piece to the catalogues of the public officials,
[Ch1 18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#015.md), and [Sa2
8:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015.md) and [Sa2
20:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025.md). Besides Joab, who is met
with in all catalogues as prince of the host, i.e., commander-in-chief,
we find in our catalogue partly other men introduced, partly other
duties of the men formerly named, than are mentioned in these three
catalogues. From this it is clear that it is not the chief public
officials who are enumerated, but only the first councillors of the
king, who formed as it were his senate, and that the catalogue probably
is derived from the same source as the preceding catalogues. Jonathan,
the דּוד of David. The word דּוד generally denotes a father's brother;
but since a Jonathan, son of Shimea, the brother of David, occurs [Ch1
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#007.md) and [Sa2
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#021.md), Schmidt and Bertheau hold him
to be the same as our Jonathan, when דּוד would be used in the general
signification of "relative," here of a nephew. Nothing certain can be
ascertained in reference to it. He was יויץ, councillor, and, as is
added, a wise and learned man. סופר is here not an official designation,
but signifies literatus, learned, scholarly, as in [Ezr
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006.md). Jehiel, the son of Hachmon, was
with the children of the king, i.e., was governor of the royal princes.

[Ch1 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#033.md)

Ahithophel was also, according to [Sa2
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031.md); [Sa2
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#023.md), David's confidential adviser,
and took his own life when Absalom, in his conspiracy against David, did
not regard his counsel (2 Sam 17). Hushai the Archite was also a friend
and adviser of David ([Sa2 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#037.md) and
[Sa2 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#016).md), who caused Absalom to
reject Ahithophel's counsel (2 Sam 17).

[Ch1 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#034.md)

After Ahithophel, i.e., after his death, was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah
(scil. counsellor of the king), and Abiathar. As Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada is elsewhere, when named among the public officials of David,
called chief of the royal body-guard (cf. [Ch1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017).md), Bertheau does not scruple to
transpose the names here. But the hypothesis of such a transposition is
neither necessary nor probable in the case of a name which, like Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, so frequently occurs (e.g., in [Ch1
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#005).md). Since sons not unfrequently
received the name of the grandfather, Jehoiada the son of the hero
Benaiah may have been named after his grandfather Jehoiada. Abiathar is
without doubt the high priest of this name of Ithamar's family) [Ch1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011.md), etc.; see on [Ch1
6:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001).md), and is here mentioned as being
also a friend and adviser of David. As to Joab, see on [Ch1
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#015.md).
