### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 7:1</span></span>

"Better is a name than precious ointment; and better is the day of death
than the day when one is born." Like ראה and ירא, so שׁם and שׁמן stand
to each other in the relation of a paronomasia (vid., Song under [Sol
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003).md). Luther translates: "Ein gut
Gercht ist besser denn gute Salbe" "a good odour (= reputation) is
better than good ointment. If we substitute the expression denn
Wolgeruch than sweet scent, that would be the best possible rendering of
the paronomasia. In the arrangement טוב ... טוב שׁם, tov would be adj.
to shem (a good reputation goes beyond sweet scent); but tov standing
first in the sentence is pred., and shem thus in itself alone, as in the
cogn. prov., [Pro 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#001.md), signifies a
good, well-sounding, honourable, if not venerable name; cf. anshē
hashshem, [Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md); veli-shem,
nameless, [Job 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008.md). The author gives
the dark reverse to this bright side of the distich: the day of death
better than the day in which one (a man), or he (the man), is born; cf.
for this reference of the pronoun, [Ecc
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012.md); [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md). It is the same lamentation as at
[Ecc 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md)., which sounds less strange
from the mouth of a Greek than from that of an Israelite; a Thracian
tribe, the Trausi, actually celebrated their birthdays as days of
sadness, and the day of death as a day of rejoicing (vid., Bhr's Germ.
translat. of Herodotus, [Ecc 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004).md). -
Among the people of the Old Covenant this was not possible; also a
saying such as [Ecc 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md) is not in the
spirit of the O.T. revelation of religion; yet it is significant that it
was possible

(Note: "The reflections of the Preacher," says Hitzig (Sd. deut. ev.
protest. Woch. Blatt, 1864, No. 2) "present the picture of a time in
which men, participating in the recollection of a mighty religious past,
and become sceptical by reason of the sadness of the present time,
grasping here and there in uncertainty, were in danger of abandoning
that stedfastness of faith which was the first mark of the religion of
the prophets.")

within it, without apostasy from it; within the N.T. revelation of
religion, except in such references as [Mat
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024.md), it is absolutely impossible
without apostasy from it, or without rejection of its fundamental
meaning.

[Ecclesiastes 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 7:2</span></span>

Still more in the spirit of the N.T. (cf. e.g., [Luk
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025).md) are these words of this singular
book which stands on the border of both Testaments: "It is better to go
into a house of mourning than to go into a house of carousal (drinking):
for that is the end of every man; and the living layeth it to heart." A
house is meant in which there is sorrow on account of a death; the
lamentation continued for seven days (Sirach 22:10), and extended
sometimes, as in the case of the death of Aaron and Moses, to thirty
days; the later practice distinguished the lamentations (אנינוּת) for
the dead till the time of burial, and the mournings for the dead
(אבלוּת), which were divided into seven and twenty-three days of greater
and lesser mourning; on the return from carrying away the corpse, there
was a Trostmahl (a comforting repast), to which, according as it appears
to an ancient custom, those who were to be partakers of it contributed
([Jer 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007.md); [Hos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md); [Job
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017.md), funde vinum tuum et panem tuum
super sepulchra justorum).

(Note: Cf. Hamb. Real Encyc. fr Bibel u. Talmud (1870), article
"Trauer.")

This feast of sorrow the above proverb leaves out of view, although also
in reference to it the contrast between the "house of carousal" and
"house of mourning" remains, that in the latter the drinking must be in
moderation, and not to drunkenness.

(Note: Maimuni's Hilchoth Ebel, iv. 7, xiii. 8.)

The going into the house of mourning is certainly thought of as a visit
for the purpose of showing sympathy and of imparting consolation during
the first seven days of mourning ([Joh
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#031).md).

(Note: Ibid. xiii. 2.)

Thus to go into the house of sorrow, and to show one's sympathy with the
mourners there, is better than to go into a house of drinking, where all
is festivity and merriment; viz., because the former (that he is mourned
over as dead) is the end of every man, and the survivor takes it to
heart, viz., this, that he too must die. הוּא follows attractionally the
gender of סוף (cf. [Job 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#011), Kerı̂.md).
What is said at [Ecc 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md) regarding
כּל־ה is appropriate to the passage before us. החי is rightly vocalised;
regarding the form החי, vid., Baer in the critical remarks of our ed. of
Isaiah under [Isa 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#022.md). The phrase נתן
אל־לב here and at [Ecc 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md) is synon.
with שׂים אל־לב, שׂים על־לב (e.g., [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001).md) and שׂים בּלב. How this saying
agrees with Koheleth's ultimatum: There is nothing better than to eat
and drink, etc. ([Ecc 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024), etc..md), the
Talmudists have been utterly perplexed to discover; Manasse ben-Israel
in his Conciliador (1632) loses himself in much useless discussion.

(Note: Vid., the English translation by Lindo (London 1842), vol. ii.
pp. 306-309.)

The solution of the difficulty is easy. The ultimatum does not relate to
an unconditional enjoyment of life, but to an enjoyment conditioned by
the fear of God. When man looks death in the face, the two things occur
to him, that he should make use of his brief life, but make use of it in
view of the end, thus in a manner for which he is responsible before
God.

[Ecclesiastes 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 7:3</span></span>

The joy of life must thus be not riot and tumult, but a joy tempered
with seriousness: "Better is sorrow than laughter: for with a sad
countenance it is well with the heart. The heart of the wise is in the
house of mourning, and the heart of fools in the house of mirth." Grief
and sorrow, כּעס, whether for ourselves or occasioned by others, is
better, viz., morally better, than extravagant merriment; the heart is
with רע פּ (inf. as רע, [Jer 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#006.md); cf.
פן ר, [Gen 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#007.md); [Neh
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#002).md), a sorrowful countenance, better
than with laughter, which only masks the feeling of disquiet peculiar to
man, [Pro 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013.md). Elsewhere לב ייטב =
"the heart is (may be) of good cheer," e.g., [Rut
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#007.md); [Jdg
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#006.md); here also joyful experience is
meant, but well becoming man as a religious moral being. With a sad
countenance it may be far better as regards the heart than with a merry
countenance in boisterous company. Luther, in the main correct, after
Jerome, who on his part follows Symmachus: "The heart is made better by
sorrow." The well-being is here meant as the reflex of a moral: bene se
habere.

Sorrow penetrates the heart, draws the thought upwards, purifies,
transforms. Therefore is the heart of the wise in the house of sorrow;
and, on the other hand, the heart of fools is in the house of joy, i.e.,
the impulse of their heart goes thither, there they feel themselves at
home; a house of joy is one where there are continual feasts, or where
there is at the time a revelling in joy. That [Ecc
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#004.md) is divided not by Athnach, but by
Zakef, has its reason in this, that of the words following אבל, none
consists of three syllables; cf. on the contrary, [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md), חכם. From this point forward the
internal relation of the contents is broken up, according to which this
series of sayings as a concluding section hangs together with that
containing the observations going before in [Ecc
6:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001.md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 7:5</span></span>

A fourth proverb of that which is better (מן טוב) presents, like the
third, the fools and the wise over against each other: "Better to hear
the reproof of a wise man, than that one should hear the song of fools.
For like the crackling of Nesseln (nettles) under the Kessel (kettle),
so the laughter of the fool: also this is vain." As at [Pro
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001.md); [Pro
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#010.md), גּערה is the earnest and severe
words of the wise, which impressively reprove, emphatically warn, and
salutarily alarm. שׁיר in itself means only song, to the exclusion,
however, of the plaintive song; the song of fools is, if not immoral,
yet morally and spiritually hollow, senseless, and unbridled madness.
Instead of משּׁמע, the words מא שׁ are used, for the twofold act of
hearing is divided between different subjects. A fire of thorn-twigs
flickers up quickly and crackles merrily, but also exhausts itself
quickly ([Psa 118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012).md), without
sufficiently boiling the flesh in the pot; whilst a log of wood, without
making any noise, accomplishes this quietly and surely.

We agree with Knobel and Vaihinger in copying the paronomasia
\[Nessel-Kessel\]. When, on the other hand, Zckler remarks that a fire
of nettles could scarcely crackle, we advise our friend to try it for
once in the end of summer with a bundle of stalks of tall dry nettles.
They yield a clear blaze, a quickly expiring fire, to which here, as he
well remarks, the empty laughter of foolish men is compared, who are
devoid of all earnestness, and of all deep moral principles of life.
This laughter is vain, like that crackling.

There is a hiatus between [Ecc 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md) and
[Ecc 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md). For how [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md) can be related to [Ecc
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md) as furnishing evidence, no
interpreter has as yet been able to say. Hitzig regards [Ecc
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md) as assigning a reason for [Ecc
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005.md), but 6b as a reply (as [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007) containing its motive shows.md) to
the assertion of [Ecc 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005.md), - a piece
of ingenious thinking which no one imitates. Elster translates: "Yet
injustice befools a wise man," being prudently silent about this "yet."
Zckler finds, as Knobel and Ewald do, the mediating thought in this,
that the vanity of fools infects and also easily befools the wise. But
the subject spoken of is not the folly of fools in general, but of their
singing and laughter, to which [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md) has not the most remote reference.
Otherwise Hengst.: "In [Ecc 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md), the
reason is given why the happiness of fools is so brief; first, the mens
sana is lost, and then destruction follows." But in that case the words
ought to have been כסיל יהולל; the remark, that חכם here denotes one who
ought to be and might be such, is a pure volte. Ginsburg thinks that the
two verses are co-ordinated by כי; that [Ecc
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md) gives the reason for [Ecc
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005.md), and [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md) that for [Ecc
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005.md), since here, by way of example,
one accessible to bribery is introduced, who would act prudently in
letting himself therefore be directed by a wise man. But if he had
wished to be thus understood, the author would have used another word
instead of חכם, 7a, and not designated both him who reproves and him who
merits reproof by the one word - the former directly, the latter at
least indirectly. We do not further continue the account of the many
vain attempts that have been made to bring [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md) into connection with [Ecc
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md) and [Ecc
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005.md). Our opinion is, that [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md) is the second half of a
tetrastich, the first half of which is lost, which began, as is to be
supposed, with tov. The first half was almost the same as [Psa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016.md), or better still, as [Pro
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#008.md), and the whole proverb stood
thus:

טוב מעט בּחדקה

מרב תּבוּאות בּלא משׁפּט׃

\[and then follows [Ecc 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md) as it lies
before us in the text, formed into a distich, the first line of which
terminates with חכם\]. We go still further, and suppose that after the
first half of the tetrastich was lost, that expression, "also this is
vain," added to [Ecc 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md) by the
punctuation, was inserted for the purpose of forming a connection for כי
עשק: Also this is vain, that, etc. (כי, like asher, [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 7:7</span></span>

Without further trying to explain the mystery of the כי, we translate
this verse: "... For oppression maketh wise men mad, and corruption
destroyeth the understanding." From the lost first half of the verse, it
appears that the subject here treated of is the duties of a judge,
including those of a ruler into whose hands his subjects, with their
property and life, are given. The second half is like an echo of [Exo
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#008.md); [Deu
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#019.md). That which שׁחד there means is
here, as at [Pro 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#027.md), denoted by
מתּנה; and עשׁק is accordingly oppression as it is exercised by one who
constrains others who need legal aid and help generally to purchase it
by means of presents. Such oppression for the sake of gain, even if it
does not proceed to the perversion of justice, but only aims at courting
and paying for favour, makes a wise man mad (הולל, as at [Job
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017.md); [Isa
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025).md), i.e., it hurries him forth,
since the greed of gold increases more and more, to the most blinding
immorality and regardlessness; and such presents for the purpose of
swaying the judgment, and of bribery, destroys the heart, i.e., the
understanding (cf. [Hos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md),
Bereschith rabba, chap. lvi.), for they obscure the judgment, blunt the
conscience, and make a man the slave of his passion. The conjecture
העשׁר (riches) instead of the word העשׁק (Burger, as earlier Ewald) is
accordingly unnecessary; it has the parallelism against it, and thus
generally used gives an untrue thought. The word הולל does not mean
"gives lustre" (Desvoeux), or "makes shine forth = makes manifest"
(Tyler); thus also nothing is gained for a better connection of [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md) and [Ecc
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md). The Venet. excellently: ἐκστήσει.
Aben Ezra supposes that מתנה is here = דּבר מת; Mendelssohn repeats it,
although otherwise the consciousness of the syntactical rule, Gesen.
147a, does not fail him.

[Ecclesiastes 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 7:8</span></span>

There now follows a fourth, or, taking into account the mutilated one, a
fifth proverb of that which is better: "Better the end of a thing than
its beginning; better one who forbears than one who is haughty. Hasten
thyself not in thy spirit to become angry: for anger lieth down in the
bosom of fools." The clause 8a is first thus to be objectively
understood as it stands. It is not without limitation true; for of a
matter in itself evil, the very contrary is true, [Pro
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004.md); [Pro
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#032.md). But if a thing is not in itself
evil, the end of its progress, the reaching to its goal, the completion
of its destination, is always better than its beginning, which leaves it
uncertain whether it will lead to a prosperous issue. An example of this
is Solon's saying to Croesus, that only he is to be pronounced happy
whose good fortune it is to end his life well in the possession of his
wealth (Herod. i. 32).

The proverb [Ecc 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008.md) will stand in
some kind of connection with 8a, since what it says is further continued
in [Ecc 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#009.md). In itself, the frequently
long and tedious development between the beginning and the end of a
thing requires expectant patience. But if it is in the interest of a man
to see the matter brought to an issue, an ארך אףּ will, notwithstanding,
wait with self-control in all quietness for the end; while it lies in
the nature of the רוּח גּבהּ, the haughty, to fret at the delay, and to
seek to reach the end by violent means; for the haughty man thinks that
everything must at once be subservient to his wish, and he measures what
others should do by his own measureless self-complacency. We may with
Hitzig translate: "Better is patience (ארך = ארך) than haughtiness"
(גּבהּ, inf., as שׁפל, [Ecc 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#004.md); [Pro
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#019).md). But there exists no reason for
this; גּבהּ is not to be held, as at [Pro
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#005.md), and elsewhere generally, as the
connecting form of גּבהּ, and so ארך for that of ארך; it amounts to the
same thing whether the two properties (characters) or the persons
possessing them are compared.

[Ecclesiastes 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 7:9</span></span>

In this verse the author warns against this pride which, when everything
does not go according to its mind, falls into passionate excitement, and
thoughtlessly judges, or with a violent rude hand anticipates the end.
אל־תּב: do not overturn, hasten not, rush not, as at [Ecc
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md). Why the word בּרוּחך, and not
בנפשך or בלבך, is used, vid., Psychol. pp. 197-199: passionate
excitements overcome a man according to the biblical representation of
his spirit, [Pro 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#028.md), and in the
proving of the spirit that which is in the heart comes forth in the mood
and disposition, [Pro 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013.md). כּעוס is
an infin., like ישׁון, [Ecc 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011.md). The
warning has its reason in this, that anger or (כעס, taken more
potentially than actually) fretfulness rests in the bosom of fools,
i.e., is cherished and nourished, and thus is at home, and, as it were
(thought of personally, as if it were a wicked demon), feels itself at
home (ינוּח, as at [Pro 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033).md). The
haughty impetuous person, and one speaking out rashly, thus acts like a
fool. In fact, it is folly to let oneself be impelled by contradictions
to anger, which disturbs the brightness of the soul, takes away the
considerateness of judgment, and undermines the health, instead of
maintaining oneself with equanimity, i.e., without stormy excitement,
and losing the equilibrium of the soul under every opposition to our
wish.

From this point the proverb loses the form "better than," but tov still
remains the catchword of the following proverbs. The proverb here first
following is so far cogn., as it is directed against a particular kind
of ka'as (anger), viz., discontentment with the present.

[Ecclesiastes 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 7:10</span></span>

"Say not: How comes it that the former times were better than these now?
for thou dost not, from wisdom, ask after this." Cf. these lines from
Horace (Poet. 173, 4):

"Difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti

Se puero, censor castigatorque minorum."

Such an one finds the earlier days - not only the old days described in
history ([Deu 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032).md), but also those he
lived in before the present time (cf. e.g., [Ch2
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029).md) - thus by contrast to much
better than the present tones, that in astonishment he asks: "What is it
= how comes it that?" etc. The author designates this question as one
not proceeding from wisdom: מח, like the Mishnic חכמה מתּוך, and על
שׁאל, as at [Neh 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002.md); 'al-zeh refers
to that question, after the ground of the contrast, which is at the same
time an exclamation of wonder. The כי, assigning a reason for the
dissuasion, does not mean that the cause of the difference between the
present and the good old times is easily seen; but it denotes that the
supposition of this difference is foolish, because in truth every age
has its bright and its dark sides; and this division of light and shadow
between the past and the present betrays a want of understanding of the
signs of the times and of the ways of God. This proverb does not furnish
any point of support for the determination of the date of the authorship
of the Book of Koheleth. But if it was composed in the last century of
the Persian domination, this dissatisfaction with the present times is
explained, over against which Koheleth leads us to consider that it is
self-deception and one-sidedness to regard the present as all dark and
the past as all bright and rosy.

[Ecclesiastes 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 7:11</span></span>

Externally connecting itself with "from wisdom," there now follows
another proverb, which declares that wisdom along with an inheritance is
good, but that wisdom is nevertheless of itself better than money and
possessions: "Wisdom is good with family possessions, and an advantage
for those who see the sun. For wisdom affordeth a shadow, money
affordeth a shadow; yet the advantage of knowledge is this, that wisdom
preserveth life to its possessor." Most of the English interpreters,
from Desvoeux to Tyler, translate: "Wisdom is as good as an
inheritance;" and Bullock, who translates: "with an inheritance," says
of this and the other translations: "The difference is not material."
But the thought is different, and thus the distinction is not merely a
formal one. Zckl. explains it as undoubted that עם here, as at [Ecc
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016) (vid., l.c..md), means aeque ac;
(but (1) that aeque ac has occurred to no ancient translator, till the
Venet. and Luther, nor to the Syr., which translates: "better is wisdom
than weapons (מאנא זינא)," in a singular way making [Ecc
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011.md) a duplette of [Ecc
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#018); (2.md) instead of "wisdom is better
than wealth," as e.g., [Pro 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#011); (3.md)
the proverb is formed like Aboth ii. 2, "good is study connected with a
citizen-like occupation," and similar proverbs; (4) one may indeed say:
"the wise man dieth with (together with) the fool" = just as well as the
fool; but "good is wisdom with wealth" can neither be equivalent to "as
well as wealth," nor: "in comparison with wealth" (Ewald, Elster), but
only: "in connection with wealth (possessions);" aeque ac may be
translated for una cum where the subject is common action and suffering,
but not in a substantival clause consisting of a subst. as subject and
an adj. as pred., having the form of a categorical judgment. נחלה
denotes a possession inherited and hereditary (cf. [Pro
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#021).md); and this is evidence in favour
of the view that עם is meant not of comparison, but of connection; the
expression would otherwise be עם־עשׁר. ויתר is now also explained. It is
not to be rendered: "and better still" (than wealth), as Herzf., Hitz.,
and Hengst. render it; but in spite of Hengst., who decides in his own
way, "יותר never means advantage, gain," it denotes a prevailing good,
avantage; and it is explained also why men are here named "those who see
the sun" - certainly not merely thus describing them poetically, as in
Homer ζώειν is described and coloured by ὁρᾶν φάος ἠελίοιο. To see the
sun, is = to have entered upon this earthly life, in which along with
wisdom, also no inheritance is to be despised. For wisdom affords
protection as well as money, but the former still more than the latter.
So far, the general meaning of [Ecc
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#012.md) is undisputed. Buthow is [Ecc
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#012.md) to be construed? Knobel, Hitz.,
and others regard ב as the so-called beth essentiae: a shadow
(protection) is wisdom, a shadow is money, - very expressive, yet out of
harmony, if not with the language of that period, yet with the style of
Koheleth; and how useless and misleading would this doubled בּ be here!
Hengstenberg translates: in the shadow of wisdom, at least according to
our understanding of [Ecc 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011.md), is not
likened to the shadow of silver; but in conformity with that עם, it must
be said that wisdom, and also that money, affords a shadow; (2) but that
interpretation goes quite beyond the limits of gnomic brachyology. We
explain: for in the shadow (בּצל, like בּצּל, [Jon
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005).md) is wisdom, in the shadow, money;
by which, without any particularly bold poetic licence, is meant that he
who possesses wisdom, he who possesses money, finds himself in a shadow,
i.e., of pleasant security; to be in the shadow, spoken of wisdom and
money, is = to sit in the shadow of the persons who possess both.

12b. The exposition of this clause is agreed upon. It is to be construed
according to the accentuation: and the advantage of knowledge is this,
that "wisdom preserveth life to its possessors." The Targ. regards דעת
החכמה as connected genit.; that might be possible (cf. [Ecc
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017.md); [Ecc
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016).md), but yet is improbable. Wherever
the author uses דעת as subst., it is an independent conception placed
beside חך, [Ecc 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md); [Ecc
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md), etc. We now translate, not:
wisdom gives life (lxx, Jerome, Venet., Luther) to its possessors; for
חיּה always means only either to revive (thus Hengst., after [Psa
119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025.md); cf. [Psa
71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020).md) or to keep in life; and this
latter meaning is more appropriate to this book than the former, - thus
(cf. [Pro 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018).md): wisdom preserves in
life, - since, after Hitzig, it accomplishes this, not by rash
utterances of denunciation, - a thought lying far behind [Ecc
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md), and altogether too mean, - but
since it secures it against self-destruction by vice and passions and
emotions, e.g., anger ([Ecc 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#009).md),
which consume life. The shadow in which wisdom (the wise man) sits keeps
it fresh and sound, - a result which the shadow in which money (the
capitalist) sits does not afford: it has frequently the directly
contrary effect.

[Ecclesiastes 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 7:13</span></span>

There now follows a proverb of devout submission to the providence of
God, connecting itself with the contents of [Ecc
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md) : "Consider the work of God: for
who can make that straight which He hath made crooked! In the good day
be of good cheer, and in the day of misfortune observe: God hath also
made this equal to that, to the end that man need not experience
anything (further) after his death." While ראה, [Ecc
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#010.md); [Ecc
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027.md), [Ecc
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md), is not different from הנּה, and
in [Ecc 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009.md) has the meaning of
"enjoy," here the meaning of contemplative observation, mental seeing,
connects itself both times with it. כּי before מי can as little mean
quod, as asher, [Ecc 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md), before mi
can mean quoniam. "Consider God's work" means: recognise in all that is
done the government of God, which has its motive in this, that, as the
question leads us to suppose, no creature is able (cf. [Ecc
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010.md) and [Ecc
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#015).md) to put right God's work in cases
where it seems to contradict that which is right ([Job
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003.md); [Job
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012).md), or to make straight that which
He has made crooked ([Psa 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009).md).

14a. The call here expressed is parallel to Sir. 14:14 (Fritz.):
"Withdraw not thyself from a good day, and let not thyself lose
participation in a right enjoyment." The ב of בּטובis, as little as that
of בּצל, the beth essentiae - it is not a designation of quality, but of
condition: in good, i.e., cheerful mood. He who is, [Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017.md), personally tov, cheerful (= tov
lev), is betov (cf. [Psa 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013.md), also
[Job 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013).md). The reverse side of the
call, 14ab, is of course not to be translated: and suffer or bear the
bad day (Ewald, Heiligst.), for in this sense we use the expression רעה
ראה, [Jer 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017.md), but not ברעה ראה,
which much rather, [Oba 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#013.md), means a
malicious contemplation of the misfortune of a stranger, although once,
[Gen 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#016.md), ב ראה also occurs in the
sense of a compassionate, sympathizing look, and, moreover, the parall.
shows that רעה ביום is not the obj., but the adv. designation of time.
Also not: look to = be attentive to (Salomon), or bear it patiently
(Burger), for ראה cannot of itself have that meaning.

(Note: Similarly also Sohar (Par. (מחור): הוי וגו, i.e., cave et
circumspice, viz., that thou mayest not incur the judgment which is
pronounced.)

But: in the day of misfortune observe, i.e., perceive and reflect: God
has also made (cf. [Job 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010).md) the
latter לעמּת corresponding, parallel, like to (cf. under [Ecc
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015).md) the former.

So much the more difficult is the statement of the object of this
mingling by God of good and evil in the life of man. It is translated:
that man may find nothing behind him; this is literal, but it is
meaningless. The meaning, according to most interpreters, is this: that
man may investigate nothing that lies behind his present time, - thus,
that belongs to the future; in other words: that man may never know what
is before him. But aharav is never (not at [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012).md) = in the future, lying out from
the present of a man; but always = after his present life. Accordingly,
Ewald explains, and Heiligst. with him: that he may find nothing which,
dying, he could take with him. But this rendering (cf. [Ecc
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014).md) is here unsuitable. Better,
Hitzig: because God wills it that man shall be rid of all things after
his death, He puts evil into the period of his life, and lets it
alternate with good, instead of visiting him therewith after his death.
This explanation proceeds from a right interpretation of the words:
idcirco ut (cf. [Ecc 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018).md) non
inveniat homo post se quidquam, scil. quod non expertus sit, but gives a
meaning to the expression which the author would reject as unworthy of
his conception of God. What is meant is much more this, that God causes
man to experience good and evil that he may pass through the whole
school of life, and when he departs hence that nothing may be
outstanding (in arrears) which he has not experienced.

[Ecclesiastes 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 7:15</span></span>

The first of these counsels warns against extremes, on the side of good
as well as on that of evil: "All have I seen in the days of my vanity:
there are righteous men who perish by their righteousness, and there are
wicked men who continue long by their wickedness. Be not righteous
over-much, and show not thyself wise beyond measure: why wilt thou ruin
thyself? Be not wicked overmuch, and be no fool: why wilt thou die
before thy time is? It is good that thou holdest thyself to the one, and
also from the other withdrawest not thine hand: for he that feareth God
accomplisheth it all." One of the most original English interpreters of
the Book of Koheleth, T. Tyler (1874), finds in the thoughts of the book
- composed, according to his view, about 200 b.c. - and in their
expression, references to the post-Aristotelian philosophy, particularly
to the Stoic, variously interwoven with orientalism. But here, in [Ecc
7:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md), we perceive, not so much the
principle of the Stoical ethics - τῇ φύσει ὁμολογουμένως ζῆν - as that
of the Aristotelian, according to which virtue consists in the art μέσως
ἔξηειν, the art of holding the middle between extremes.

(Note: Cf. Luthardt's Lectures on the Moral Truths of Christianity, 2nd
ed. Edin., T. and T. Clark.)

Also, we do not find here a reference to the contrasts between
Pharisaism and Sadduceeism (Zckl.), viz., those already in growth in the
time of the author; for if it should be also true, as Tyler conjectures,
that the Sadducees had such a predilection for Epicurism, - as,
according to Josephus (Vit. c. 2), "the doctrine of the Pharisees is of
kin to that of the Stoics," - yet צדקה and רשׁעה are not apportioned
between these two parties, especially since the overstraining of
conformity to the law by the Pharisees related not to the moral, but to
the ceremonial law. We derive nothing for the right understanding of the
passage from referring the wisdom of life here recommended to the
tendencies of the time. The author proceeds from observation, over
against which the O.T. saints knew not how to place any satisfying
theodicee. הבלי ימי (vid., [Ecc 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012).md)
he so designates the long, but for the most part uselessly spent life
lying behind him. 'et-hakol is not "everything possible" (Zckl.), but
"all, of all kinds" (Luth.), which is defined by 15b as of two kinds;
for 15a is the introduction of the following experience relative to the
righteous and the unrighteous, and thus to the two classes into which
all men are divided. We do not translate: there are the righteous, who
by their righteousness, etc. (Umbr., Hitzig, and others); for if the
author should thus commence, it would appear as if he wished to give
unrighteousness the preference to righteousness, which, however, was far
from him. To perish in or by his righteousness, to live long in or by
his wickedness (מאריך, scil. ימים, [Ecc
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#013.md), as at [Pro
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#002).md), is = to die in spite of
righteousness, to live in spite of wickedness, as e.g., [Deu
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#032.md) : "in this thing" = in spite of,
etc. Righteousness has the promise of long life as its reward; but if
this is the rule, it has yet its exceptions, and the author thence
deduces the doctrine that one should not exaggerate righteousness; for
if it occurs that a righteous man, in spite of his righteousness,
perishes, this happens, at earliest, in the case in which, in the
practice of righteousness, he goes beyond the right measure and limit.
The relative conceptions הרבּה and יותר have here, since they are
referred to the idea of the right measure, the meaning of nimis. חתחכּם
could mean, "to play the wise man;" but that, whether more or less done,
is objectionable. It means, as at [Exo
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#010.md), to act wisely (cf. [Psa
105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025), הת, to act cunningly.md). And
השׁ, which is elsewhere used of being inwardly torpid, i.e., being
astonished, obstupescere, has here the meaning of placing oneself in a
benumbed, disordered state, or also, passively, of becoming
disconcerted; not of becoming desolate or being deserted (Hitz.,
Ginsburg, and others), which it could only mean in highly poetic
discourse ([Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001).md). The form
תּשּׁומם is syncop., like תּךּ, [Num
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027.md); and the question, with למּה,
here and at [Ecc 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017.md), is of the same
kind as [Ecc 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#005.md); Luther, weakening
it: "that thou mayest not destroy thyself."

[Ecclesiastes 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 7:17</span></span>

Up to this point all is clear: righteousness and wisdom are good and
wholesome, and worth striving for; but even in these a transgressing of
the right measure is possible (Luther remembers the summum just summa
injuria), which has as a consequence, that they become destructive to
man, because he thereby becomes a caricature, and either perishes
rushing from one extreme into another, or is removed out of the way by
others whose hatred he provokes. But it is strange that the author now
warns against an excess in wickedness, so that he seems to find
wickedness, up to a certain degree, praiseworthy and advisable. So much
the stranger, since "be no fool" stands as contrast to "show not thyself
wise," etc.; so that "but also be no wicked person" was much rather to
be expected as contrast to "be not righteous over-much." Zckler seeks to
get over this difficulty with the remark: "Koheleth does not recommend a
certain moderation in wickedness as if he considered it allowable, but
only because he recognises the fact as established, that every man is by
nature somewhat wicked." The meaning would then be: man's life is not
free from wickedness, but be only not too wicked! The offensiveness of
the advice is not thus removed; and besides, [Ecc
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md) demands in a certain sense, an
intentional wickedness, - indeed, as [Ecc
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md) shows, a wickedness in union with
the fear of God. The correct meaning of "be not wicked over-much" may be
found if for תרשׁע we substitute תּחטא; in this form the good counsel at
once appears as impossible, for it would be immoral, since "sinning," in
all circumstances, is an act which carries in itself its own sentence of
condemnation. Thus רשׁע must here be a setting oneself free from the
severity of the law, which, although sin in the eyes of the
over-righteous, is yet no sin in itself; and the author here thinks, in
accordance with the spirit of his book, principally of that fresh, free,
joyous life to which he called the young, that joy of life in its
fulness which appeared to him as the best and fairest reality in this
present time; but along with that, perhaps also of transgressions of the
letter of the law, of shaking off the scruples of conscience which
conformity to God-ordained circumstances brings along with it. He means
to say: be not a narrow rigorist, - enjoy life, accommodate thyself to
life; but let not the reins be too loose; and be no fool who wantonly
places himself above law and discipline: Why wilt thou destroy thy life
before the time by suffering vice to kill thee ([Psa
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#022).md), and by want of understanding
ruin thyself ([Pro 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021).md)?

(Note: An old proverb, Sota 3a, says: "A man commits no transgression
unless there rules in him previously the spirit of folly.")

[Ecclesiastes 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 7:18</span></span>

"It is good that thou holdest fast to the one," - viz. righteousness and
wisdom, - and withdrawest not thy hand from the other, - viz. a
wickedness which renounces over-righteousness and over-wisdom, or an
unrestrained life; - for he who fears God accomplishes all, i.e., both,
the one as well as the other. Luther, against the Vulg.: "for he who
fears God escapes all." But what "all"? Tyler, Bullock, and others
reply: "All the perplexities of life;" but no such thing is found in the
text here, however many perplexities may be in the book. Better, Zckler:
the evil results of the extreme of false righteousness as of bold
wickedness. But that he does not destroy himself and does not die before
his time, is yet only essentially one thing which he escapes; also, from
[Ecc 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md), only one thing, אבד, is
taken. Thus either: the extremes (Umbr.), or: the extremes together with
their consequences. The thought presents a connected, worthy conclusion.
But if ěth-kullam, with its retrospective suffix, can be referred to
that which immediately precedes, this ought to have the preference.
Ginsburg, with Hitzig: "Whoso feareth God will make his way with both;"
but what an improbable phrase! Jerome, with his vague nihil negligit, is
right as to the meaning. In the Bible, the phrase ה ... יחא, egressus
est urbem, [Gen 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#004.md), cf. [Jer
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020.md), is used; and in the Mishna, יצא
את־ידי חובתו, i.e., he has discharged his duty, he is quit of it by
fulfilling it. For the most part, יצא merely is used: he has satisfied
his duty; and יצא לא, he has not satisfied it, e.g., Berachoth 2:1.
Accordingly יחא - since ěth-kullam relates to, "these ought he to have
done, and not to leave the other undone," [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md) - here means: he who fears God
will set himself free from all, will acquit himself of the one as well
as of the other, will perform both, and thus preserve the golden via
media.

[Ecclesiastes 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 7:19</span></span>

"Wisdom affords strong protection to the wise man more than ten mighty
men who are in the city." We have to distinguish, as is shown under [Psa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003.md), the verbs עזז, to be strong, and
עוּז, to flee for refuge; תּעז is the fut. of the former, whence מעז,
stronghold, safe retreat, protection, and with ל, since עזז means not
only to be strong, but also to show oneself strong, as at Eccl 9:20, to
feel and act as one strong; it has also the trans. meaning, to
strengthen, as shown in [Psa 68:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029.md),
but here the intrans. suffices: wisdom proves itself strong for the wise
man. The ten shallithim are not, with Ginsburg, to be multiplied
indefinitely into "many mighty men." And it is not necessary, with
Desvoeux, Hitz., Zckl., and others, to think of ten chiefs (commanders
of forces), including the portions of the city garrison which they
commanded. The author probably in this refers to some definite political
arrangement, perhaps to the ten archons, like those Assyrian salaṭ,
vice-regents, after whom as eponyms the year was named by the Greeks.
שׁלּיט, in the Asiatic kingdom, was not properly a military title. And
did a town then need protection only in the time of war, and not also at
other times, against injury threatening its trade, against encroachments
on its order, against the spread of infectious diseases, against the
force of the elements? As the Deutero-Isaiah ([Isa
60:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#017).md) says of Jerusalem: "I will make
thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness," so Koheleth says
here that wisdom affords a wise man as strong a protection as a powerful
decemvirate a city; cf. [Pro 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#005.md): "A
wise man is ba'oz," i.e., mighty.

[Ecclesiastes 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 7:20</span></span>

"For among men there is not a righteous man on the earth, who doeth
good, and sinneth not." The original passage, found in Solomon's prayer
at the consecration of the temple, is briefer, [Kg1
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046.md) : "There is no man who sinneth
not." Here the words might be וגו צדּיק אדם אין, there is no righteous
man ... . Adam stands here as representing the species, as when we say
in Germ.: Menschen gibt es keine gerechten auf Erden \[men, there are
none righteous on earth\]; cf. [Exo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#016.md) : "Straw, none was given." The
verification of [Ecc 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md) by reference
to the fact of the common sinfulness from which even the most righteous
cannot free himself, does not contradict all expectation to the same
degree as the ki in [Ecc 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md); but yet
it surprises us, so that Mercer and Grtz, with Aben Ezra, take [Ecc
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md) as the verification of [Ecc
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md), here first adduced, and Knobel
and Heiligst. and others connect it with [Ecc
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#021.md), [Ecc
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#022.md), translating: "Because there is
not a just man ... , therefore it is also the part of wisdom to take no
heed unto all words," etc. But these are all forced interpretations;
instead of the latter, we would rather suppose that [Ecc
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md) originally stood after [Ecc
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#022.md), and is separated from its
correct place. But yet the sequence of thought lying before us may be
conceived, and that not merely as of necessity, but as that which was
intended by the author. On the whole, Hitzig is correct: "For every one,
even the wise man, sins; in which case virtue, which has forsaken him,
does not protect him, but wisdom proves itself as his means of defence."
Zckler adds: "against the judicial justice of God;" but one escapes from
this by a penitent appeal to grace, for which there is no need for the
personal property of wisdom; there is thus reason rather for thinking on
the dangerous consequences which often a single false step has for a man
in other respects moral; in the threatening complications in which he is
thereby involved, it is wisdom which then protects him and delivers him.
Otherwise Tyler, who by the עז, which the wise has in wisdom,
understands power over evil, which is always moving itself even in the
righteous. But the sinning spoken of in [Ecc
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md) is that which is unavoidable,
which even wisdom cannot prevent or make inefficacious. On the contrary,
it knows how to prevent the destruction which threatens man from his
transgressions, and to remove the difficulties and derangements which
thence arise. The good counsel following is connected by gam with the
foregoing. The exhortation to strive after wisdom, contained in [Ecc
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md), which affords protection against
the evil effects of the failures which run through the life of the
righteous, is followed by the exhortation, that one conscious that he
himself is not free from transgression, should take heed to avoid that
tale-bearing which finds pleasure in exposing to view the shortcomings
of others.

"Also give not thy heart to all the words which one speaketh, lest thou

not about "thee who givest heed to the counsels just given" (Hitz.,
Zckl.), for the restrictive עליך is wanting; and why should a servant be
zealous to utter imprecations on the conduct of his master, which rests
on the best maxims? It is the babbling of the people in general that is

σε, but τὸν δοῦλόν σου καταρᾶσθαι σε. The warning has its motive in
this, that by such roundabout hearing one generally hears most
unpleasant things; and on hearsay no reliance can be placed. Such
gossiping one should ignore, should not listen to it at all; and if,
nevertheless, something so bad is reported as that our own servant has
spoken words of imprecation against us, yet we ought to pass that by
unheeded, well knowing that we ourselves have often spoken harsh words
against others. The expression וגו ידע, "thou art conscious to thyself
that," is like פּע ר, [Kg1 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#044.md), not
the obj. accus. dependent on ידע (Hitz.), "many cases where also thou
...," but the adv. accus. of time to קּלּלתּ; the words are inverted
(Ewald, 336b), the style of Koheleth being fond of thus giving
prominence to the chief conception ([Ecc
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md), [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md); [Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013).md). The first gam, although it
belongs to "thine, thy," as at [Ecc
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#022.md) it is also connected with "thou,"

(Note: גּם־אתּ, on account of the half pause, accented on the penult.
according to the Masora.)

stands at the beginning of the sentence, after such syntactical examples
as [Hos 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md); [Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md); and even with a two-membered
sentence, [Job 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ecc 7:23</span></span>

"All this have I proved by wisdom: I thought, Wise I will become; but it
remained far from me." The ב in בּחכמה is, as at [Ecc
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013.md), that designating the organon,
the means of knowledge. Thus he possessed wisdom up to a certain degree,
and in part; but his purpose, comprehended in the one word אחכּמה, was
to possess it fully and completely; i.e., not merely to be able to
record observations and communicate advices, but to adjust the
contradictions of life, to expound the mysteries of time and eternity,
and generally to solve the most weighty and important questions which
perplex men. But this wisdom was for him still in the remote distance.
It is the wisdom after which Job, chap. 28, made inquiry in all regions
of the world and at all creatures, at last to discover that God has
appointed to man only a limited share of wisdom. Koheleth briefly
condenses [Job 28:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012.md) in the words
following:

[Ecclesiastes 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 7:24</span></span>

"For that which is, is far off, and deep, - yes, deep; who can reach
it?" Knobel, Hitz., Vaih., and Bullock translate: for what is remote and
deep, deep, who can find it? i.e., investigate it; but mah-shehayah is
everywhere an idea by itself, and means either id quod fuit, or id quod
exstitit, [Ecc 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009.md); [Ecc
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015.md); [Ecc
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010.md); in the former sense it is the
contrast of mah-shěihyěh, [Ecc 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#007.md);
[Ecc 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#014.md), cf. [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); in the latter, it is the
contrast of that which does not exist, because it has not come into
existence. In this way it is also not to be translated: For it is far
off what it (wisdom) is (Zckl.) \[= what wisdom is lies far off from
human knowledge\], or: what it is (the essence of wisdom), is far off
(Elst.) - which would be expressed by the words מה־שּׁהיא. And if
מה־שׁהיה is an idea complete in itself, it is evidently not that which
is past that is meant (thus e.g., Rosenm. quod ante aderat), for that is
a limitation of the obj. of knowledge, which is unsuitable here, but
that which has come into existence. Rightly, Hengst.: that which has
being, for wisdom is τῶν ὄντων γνῶσις ἀψευδής, Wisd. 7:17. He compares
[Jdg 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011.md), "the work which God does,"
and [Ecc 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md), "the work which is done
under the sun." What Koheleth there says of the totality of the
historical, he here says of the world of things: this (in its essence
and its grounds) remains far off from man; it is for him, and also in
itself and for all creatures, far too deep (עמק עמק, the ancient
expression for the superlative): Who can intelligibly reach (ימץ, from
מצא, assequi, in an intellectual sense, as at [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md); [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md); cf. [Job
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007)) it (this all of being.md)? The
author appears in the book as a teacher of wisdom, and emphatically here
makes confession of the limitation of his wisdom; for the consciousness
of this limitation comes over him in the midst of his teaching.

[Ecclesiastes 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ecc 7:25</span></span>

But, on the other side, he can bear testimony to himself that he has
honestly exercised himself in seeking to go to the foundation of things:
"I turned myself, and my heart was there to discern, and to explore, and
to seek wisdom, and the account, and to perceive wickedness as folly,
and folly as madness." Regarding sabbothi, vid., under [Ecc
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020.md) : a turning is meant to the theme
as given in what follows, which, as we have to suppose, was connected
with a turning away form superficiality and frivolity. Almost all
interpreters-as also the accentuation does - connect the two words ולבּי
אני; but "I and my heart" is so unpsychological an expression, without
example, that many Codd. (28 of Kennicott, 44 of de Rossi) read בּלבּי
daer )i with my heart. The erasure of the vav (as e.g., Luther: "I
applied my heart") would at the same time require the change of סבותי
into הסבּותי. The Targ., Jerome, and the Venet. render the word בלבי;
the lxx and Syr., on the contrary, ולבי; and this also is allowable, if
we place the disjunctive on אני and take ולבי as consequent: my heart,
i.e., my striving and effort, was to discern (Aben Ezra, Herzf.,
Stuart), - a substantival clause instead of the verbal את־לבּי ונתתּי,
[Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013.md), [Ecc
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017.md). Regarding tur in an intellectual
sense, vid., [Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013.md). Hhěshbon, with
hhochmah, we have translated by "Rechenschaft" account, ratio; for we
understand by it a knowledge well grounded and exact, and able to be
established, - the facit of a calculation of all the facts and
circumstances relating thereto; נתן חשׁבין is Mishnic, and = the N.T.
λόγον ἀποδιδόναι. Of the two accus. [Ecc
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md) following לדעת, the first, as may
be supposed, and as the determination in the second member shows, is
that of the obj., the second that of the pred. (Ewald, 284b): that רשׁע,
i.e., conduct separating from God and from the law of that which is
good, is kěsěl, Thorheit, folly (since, as Socrates also taught, all
sinning rests on a false calculation, to the sinner's own injury); and
that hassichluth, Narrheit, foolishness, stultitia (vid., sachal, and
[Ecc 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017).md), is to be thus translated
(in contradistinction to כּסל), i.e., an intellectual and moral
obtuseness, living for the day, rising up into foolery, not different
from holeloth, fury, madness, and thus like a physical malady, under
which men are out of themselves, rage, and are mad. Koheleth's striving
after wisdom thus, at least is the second instance (ולדעת), with a
renunciation of the transcendental, went towards a practical end. And
now he expresses by ומוצא one of the experiences he had reached in this
way of research. How much value he attaches to this experience is
evident from the long preface, by means of which it is as it were
distilled. We see him there on the way to wisdom, to metaphysical
wisdom, if we may so speak - it remains as far off from him as he seeks
to come near to it. We then see him, yet not renouncing the effort after
wisdom, on the way toward practical wisdom, which exercises itself in
searching into the good and the bad; and that which has presented itself
to him as the bitterest of the bitter is - a woman.

[Ecclesiastes 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ecc 7:26</span></span>

"And I found woman more bitter than death; she is like hunting-nets. and
like snares is her heart, her hands are bands: he who pleaseth God will
escape from her; but the sinner is caught by them." As א ושׁ, [Ecc
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md), so here וּם א gains by the
preceding אני וסבּותי a past sense;

(Note: With reference to this passage and [Pro
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022.md), it was common in Palestine when
one was married to ask מצא או מוחא = happy or unhappy? Jebamoth 63b.)

the particip. clause stands frequently thus, not only as a
circumstantial clause, [Gen 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#012.md).,
but also as principal clause, [Gen
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010.md), in an historical connection. The
preceding pred. מר, in the mas. ground-form, follows the rule, Gesen.
147. Regarding the construction of the relative clause, Hitzig judges
quite correctly: "היא is copula between subj. and pred., and precedes
for the sake of the contrast, giving emphasis to the pred. It cannot be
a nomin., which would be taken up by the suff. in לבהּ, since if this
latter were subject also to מץ, היא would not certainly be found. Also
asher here is not a conj." This הוּא (היא), which in relative
substantival clauses represents the copula, for the most part stands
separated from asher, e.g., [Gen 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#002.md);
[Gen 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012.md); [Num
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#005.md); [Deu
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md); less frequently immediately
with it, [Num 35:31](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031.md); [Sa1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#019.md); [Kg2
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019.md); [Lev
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#026.md); [Deu
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#020). But this asher hu (hi.md) never
represents the subj., placed foremost and again resumed by the reflex.
pronoun, so as to be construed as the accentuation requires: quae quidem
retia et laquei cor ejus = cajus quidem cor sunt retia et laquei
(Heiligst.). מצוד is the means of searching, i.e., either of hunting:
hunting-net (mitsodah, [Ecc 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012).md), or
of blockading: siege-work, bulwarks, [Ecc
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#014.md); here it is the plur. of the word
in the former meaning. חרם, [Hab 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014.md),
plur. [Eze 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#005.md), etc. (perhaps from
חרם, to pierce, bore through), is one of the many synon. for
fishing-net. אסוּרים, fetters, the hands (arms) of voluptuous embrace.
The primary form, after [Jer 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015.md), is
אסוּר, אסוּר; cf. אבוּס, אב, [Job
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#009.md). Of the three clauses following
asher, vav is found in the second and is wanting to the third, as at
[Deu 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md); [Job
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#009.md); [Psa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009.md); [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013.md); cf. on the other hand, [Isa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006.md). Similar in their import are
these Leonine verses:

Femina praeclara facie quasi pestis amara,

Et quasi fermentum corrumpit cor sapientum.

That the author is in full earnest in this harsh judgment regarding
woman, is shown by 26b: he who appears to God as good (cf. [Ecc
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026).md) escapes from her (the fut. of
the consequence of this his relation to God); but the sinner (חוטאו) is
caught by her, or, properly, in her, viz., the net-like woman, or the
net to which she is compared ([Psa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md); [Isa
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018).md). The harsh judgment is,
however, not applicable to woman as such, but to woman as she is, with
only rare exceptions; among a thousand women he has not found one
corresponding to the idea of a woman.

[Ecclesiastes 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ecc 7:27</span></span>

"Behold what I have found, saith Koheleth, adding one thing to another,
to find out the account: What my soul hath still sought, and I have not
found, (is this): one man among a thousand have I found; and a woman
among all these have I not found." It is the ascertained result, "one
man, etc.," which is solemnly introduced by the words preceding. Instead
of אם קה, the words ראמר הקּה are to be read, after [Ecc
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008.md), as is now generally
acknowledged; errors of transcription of a similar kind are found at
[Sa2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002.md); [Job
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#012.md). Ginsburg in vain disputes this,
maintaining that the name Koheleth, as denoting wisdom personified, may
be regarded as fem. as well as mas.; here, where the female sex is so
much depreciated, was the fem. self-designation of the stern judge
specially unsuitable. Hengst. supposes that Koheleth is purposely fem.
in this one passage, since true wisdom, represented by Solomon, stands
opposite to false philosophy. But this reason for the fem. rests on the
false opinion that woman here is heresy personified; he further remarks
that it is significant for this fem. personification, that there is "no
writing of female authorship in the whole canon of the O.T. and N.T."
But what of Deborah's triumphal song, the song of Hannah, the magnificat
of Mary? We hand this absurdity over to the Clementines! The woman here
was flesh and blood, but pulchra quamvis pellis est mens tamen plean
procellis; and Koheleth is not incarnate wisdom, but the official name
of a preacher, as in Assyr., for חזּנרם, curators, overseers, hazanâti

(Note: Vid., Fried. Delitzsch's Assyr. Stud. (1874), p. 132.)

is used. זה, [Ecc 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027.md), points, as at
[Ecc 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#010.md), to what follows. אחת ל, one
thing to another (cf. [Isa 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012).md),
must have been, like summa summarum and the like, a common arithmetical
and dialectical formula, which is here subordinate to מצא, since an adv.
inf. such as לקוח is to be supplemented: taking one thing to another to
find out the חשׁבּון, i.e., the balance of the account, and thus to
reach a facit, a resultat.

(Note: Cf. Aboth iv. 29, וגו ליתן, "to give account;" וגו הכל, "all
according to the result.")

That which presented itself to him in this way now follows. It was, in
relation to woman, a negative experience: "What my soul sought on and
on, and I found not, (is this)." The words are like the superscription
of the following result, in which finally the זה of [Ecc
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027.md) terminates. Ginsburg,
incorrectly: "what my soul is still seeking," which would have required
מבקּשׁת. The pret. בּקשׁה (with ק without Dagesh, as at [Ecc
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029).md)

(Note: As generally the Piel forms of the root בקשׁ, Masor. all have
Raphe on the ,ק except the imper. בּקּשׁוּ; vid., Luzzatto's Gramm.
417.)

is retrospective; and עוד, from עוּד, means redire, again and again,
continually, as at Gen.. [Gen 46:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#029.md).
He always anew sought, and that, as biqshah naphshi for בקשׁתי denotes,
with urgent striving, violent longing, and never found, viz., a woman
such as she ought to be: a man, one of a thousand, I have found, etc.
With right, the accentuation gives Garshayim to adam; it stands forth,
as at [Ecc 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md), as a general
denominator - the sequence of accents, Geresh, Pashta, Zakef, is as at
[Gen 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009.md). "One among a thousand"
reminds us of [Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md), cf. [Ecc
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#003.md); the old interpreters (vid.,
Dachselt's Bibl. Accentuata), with reference to these parallels, connect
with the one man among a thousand all kinds of incongruous
christological thoughts. Only, here adam, like the Romanic l'homme and
the like, means man in sexual contrast to woman. It is thus ideally
meant, like ish, [Sa1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#009.md); [Sa1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#015.md), and accordingly also the parall.
אשּׁה. For it is not to be supposed that the author denies thereby
perfect human nature to woman. But also Burger's explanation: "a human
being, whether man or woman," is a useless evasion. Man has the name
adam κατ ̓ ἐξ. by primitive hist. right: "for the man is not of the
woman, but the woman of the man," [Co1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#008.md). The meaning, besides, is not
that among a thousand human beings he found one upright man, but not a
good woman (Hitz.), - for then the thousand ought to have had its proper
denominator, אדם בני, - but that among a thousand persons of the male
sex he found only one man such as he ought to be, and among a thousand
of the female sex not one woman such as she ought to be; "among all
these" is thus = among an equal number. Since he thus actually found the
ideal of man only seldom, and that of woman still seldomer (for more
than this is not denoted by the round numbers), the more surely does he
resign himself to the following resultat, which he introduces by the
word לבד (only, alone), as the clear gain of his searching:

[Ecclesiastes 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ecc 7:29</span></span>

"Lo, this only have I found, that God created man upright; but they seek
many arts." Also here the order of the words is inverted, since זה,
belonging as obj. to מץ (have I found), which is restricted by לבד, is
amalgamated with ראה (Lo! see!). The author means to say: Only this
(solummodo hocce) have I found, that ...; the ראה is an interjected nota
bene. The expression: God has made man ישׁר, is dogmatically
significant. Man, as he came from the Creator's hand, was not placed in
the state of moral decision, nor yet in the state of absolute
indifference between good and evil; he was not neither good nor bad, but
he was טוב, or, which is the same thing, ישׁר; i.e., in every respect
normal, so that he could normally develope himself from this positively
good foundation. But by the expression ישׁר \`שׁ, Koheleth has certainly
not exclusively his origin in view, but at the same time his relative
continuation in the propagation of himself, not without the concurrence
of the Creator; also of man after the fall the words are true, ישׁר
עשׂה, in so far as man still possesses the moral ability not to indulge
sinful affections within him, nor suffer them to become sinful actions.
But the sinful affections in the inborn nature of weak sinful man have
derived so strong a support from his freedom, that the power of the will
over against this power of nature is for the most part as weakness; the
dominance of sin, where it is not counteracted by the grace of God, has
always shown itself so powerful, that Koheleth has to complain of men of
all times and in all circles of life: they seek many arts (as Luther
well renders it), or properly, calculations, inventions, devices
(hhishshevonoth,

(Note: If we derive this word from hhěshbon, the Dagesh in the שׁ is the
so-called Dag. dirimens.)

as at [Ch2 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015.md), from hhishshevon,
which is as little distinguished from the formation hhěshbon, as
hhizzayon from hhězyon), viz., of means and ways, by which they go
astray from the normal natural development into abnormities. In other
words: inventive refined degeneracy has come into the place of moral
simplicity, ἁπλότης ([Ch2 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#003).md). As to
the opinion that caricatures of true human nature, contrasts between the
actual and that which ought to be (the ideal), are common, particularly
among the female sex, the author has testimonies in support of it from
all nations. It is confirmed by the primitive history itself, in which
the woman appears as the first that was led astray, and as the seducer
(cf. Psychol. pp. 103-106). With reference to this an old proverb says:
"Women carry in themselves a frivolous mind," Kiddushin 80b.

(Note: Cf. Tendlau's Sprichw. (1860), No. 733.)

And because a woman, when she has fallen into evil, surpasses a man in
fiendish superiority therein, the Midrash reckons under this passage
before us fifteen things of which the one is worse than the other; the
thirteenth is death, and the fourteenth a bad woman.

(Note: Duke's Rabb. Blumenl. (1844), No. 32.)

Hitzig supposes that the author has before him as his model Agathoclea,
the mistress of the fourth Ptolemy Philopator. But also the history of
the Persian Court affords dreadful examples of the truth of the proverb:
"Woe to the age whose leader is a woman;"

(Note: Ibid. No. 118.)

and generally the harem is a den of female wickedness.
