III\. Third Discourse, or Renewal of the Covenant - Deuteronomy 27-30

The conclusion of the covenant in the land of Moab, as the last address
in this section (ch. 29 and 30) is called in the heading ([Deu
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001).md) and in the introduction ([Deu
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#009)..md), i.e., the renewal of the
covenant concluded at Horeb, commences with instructions to set up the
law in a solemn manner in the land of Canaan after crossing over the
Jordan (ch. 27). After this there follows an elaborate exposition of the
blessings and curses which would come upon the people according to their
attitude towards the law (ch. 28). And lastly, Moses places the whole
nation with a solemn address before the face of the Lord, and sets
before it once more the blessing and the curse in powerful and alarming
words, with the exhortation to choose the blessing and life (ch. 29 and
30).

[Deuteronomy 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 27:1</span></span>

The command in [Deu 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#001.md) to keep the
whole law (שׁמר, inf. abs. for the imperative, as in [Exo
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#003), etc..md), with which the
instructions that follow are introduced, indicates at the very outset
the purpose for which the law written upon stones was to be set up in
Canaan, namely, as a public testimony that the Israelites who were
entering into Canaan possessed in the law their rule and source of life.
The command itself is given by Moses, together with the elders, because
the latter had to see to the execution of it after Moses' death; on the
other hand, the priests are mentioned along with Moses in [Deu
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#009.md), because it was their special
duty to superintend the fulfilment of the commands of God.

[Deu 27:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#001.md)

[Deu 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#002.md) and [Deu
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#003.md) contain the general instructions;
[Deu 27:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#004.md), more minute details. In
the appointment of the time, "on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan
into the land," etc., the word "day" must not be pressed, but is to be
understood in a broader sense, as signifying the time when Israel should
have entered the land and taken possession of it. The stones to be set
up were to be covered with lime, or gypsum (whether sid signifies lime
or gypsum cannot be determined), and all the words of the law were to be
written upon them. The writing, therefore, was not to be cut into the
stones and then covered with lime (as J. D. Mich., Ros.), but to be
inscribed upon the plaistered stones, as was the custom in Egypt, where
the walls of buildings, and even monumental stones, which they were
about to paint with figures and hieroglyphics, were first of all covered
with a coating of lime or gypsum, and then the figures painted upon this
(see the testimonies of Minutoli, Heeren, Prokesch in Hengstenberg's
Dissertations, i. 433, and Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 90). The
object of this writing was not to hand down the law in this manner to
posterity without alteration, but, as has already been stated, simply to
set forth a public acknowledgement of the law on the part of the people,
first of all for the sake of the generation which took possession of the
land, and for posterity, only so far as this act was recorded in the
book of Joshua and thus transmitted to future generations.

[Deu 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#003.md)

Upon the stones there were to be written "all the words of this law:"
obviously, therefore, not only the blessings and curses in [Deu
27:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015.md) (as Josephus, Ant. iv. 8, 44,
Masius, Clericus, and others maintain), nor only Deuteronomy (J.
Gerhard, A. Osiander, Vater, etc.), since this contained no independent
"second law," but the whole of the Mosaic law; not, indeed, the entire
Pentateuch, with its historical narratives, its geographical,
ethnographical, and other notices, but simply the legal part of it - the
commandments, statutes, and rights of the Thorah. But whether all the
613 commandments contained in the Pentateuch, according to the Jewish
reckoning (vid., Bertheau, die 7 Gruppen Mos. Ges. p. 12), or only the
quintessence of them, with the omission of the numerous repetitions of
different commands, cannot be decided, and is of no importance to the
matter in hand. The object aimed at would be attained by writing the
essential kernel of the whole law; though the possibility of all the
commandments being written, of course without the reasons and
exhortations connected with them, cannot be denied, since it is not
stated how many stones were set up, but simply that large stones were to
be taken, which would therefore contain a great deal. In the clause,
"that thou mayest come into the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee,"
etc., the coming involves the permanent possession of the land. Not only
the treading or conquest of Canaan, but the maintenance of the conquered
land as a permanent hereditary possession, was promised to Israel; but
it would only permanently rejoice in the fulfilment of this promise, if
it set up the law of its God in the land, and observed it.

[Deu 27:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#004.md)

In the further expansion of this command, Moses first of all fixes the
place where the stones were to be set up, namely, upon Mount Ebal (see
at [Deu 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#029).md), - not upon Gerizim,
according to the reading of the Samaritan Pentateuch; for since the
discussion of the question by Verschuir (dissertt. phil. exeg. diss. 3)
and Gesenius (de Pent. Samar. p. 61), it may be regarded as an
established fact, that this reading is an arbitrary alteration. The
following clause, "thou shalt plaister," etc., is a repetition in the
earliest form of historical writing among the Hebrews. To this there are
appended in [Deu 27:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#005.md) the new and
further instructions, that an altar was to be built upon Ebal, and
burnt-offerings and slain-offerings to be sacrificed upon it. The notion
that this altar was to be built of the stones with the law written upon
them, or even with a portion of them, needs no refutation, as it has not
the slightest support in the words of the text. For according to these
the altar was to be built of unhewn stones (therefore not of the stones
covered with cement), in obedience to the law in [Exo
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022.md) (see the exposition of this
passage, where the reason for this is discussed). The spot selected for
the setting up of the stones with the law written upon it, as well as
for the altar and the offering of sacrifice, was Ebal, the mountain upon
which the curses were to be proclaimed; not Gerizim, which was appointed
for the publication of the blessings, for the very same reason for which
only the curses to be proclaimed are given in [Deu
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#014.md). and not the blessings, - not,
as Schultz supposes, because the law in connection with the curse speaks
more forcibly to sinful man than in connection with the blessing, or
because the curse, which manifests itself on every hand in human life,
sounds more credible than the promise; but, as the Berleburger Bible
expresses it, "to show how the law and economy of the Old Testament
would denounce the curse which rests upon the whole human race because
of sin, to awaken a desire for the Messiah, who was to take away the
curse and bring the true blessing instead." For however remote the
allusion to the Messiah may be here, the truth is unquestionably pointed
out in these instructions, that the law primarily and chiefly brings a
curse upon man because of the sinfulness of his nature, as Moses himself
announces to the people in [Deu
31:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016.md). And for this very reason the
book of the law was to be laid by the side of the ark of the covenant as
a "testimony against Israel" ([Deu
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026).md). But the altar was built for
the offering of sacrifices, to mould and consecrate the setting up of
the law upon the stones into a renewal of the covenant. In the
burnt-offerings Israel gave itself up to the Lord with all its life and
labour, and in the sacrificial meal it entered into the enjoyment of the
blessings of divine grace, to taste of the blessedness of vital
communion with its God. By connecting the sacrificial ceremony with the
setting up of the law, Israel gave a practical testimony to the fact
that its life and blessedness were founded upon its observance of the
law. The sacrifices and the sacrificial meal have the same signification
here as at the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai ([Exo
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#011).md). - In [Deu
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#008.md) the writing of the law upon the
stones is commanded once more, and the further injunction is added,
"very plainly." - The writing of the law is mentioned last, as being the
most important, and not because it was to take place after the
sacrificial ceremony. The different instructions are arranged according
to their character, and not in chronological order.

[Deu 27:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#009.md)

The words of Moses which follow in [Deu
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#009.md) and [Deu
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#010.md), "Be silent, and hearken, O
Israel; To-day thou hast become the people of the Lord thy God," show
the significance of the act enjoined; although primarily they simply
summon the Israelites to listen attentively to the still further
commands. When Israel renewed the covenant with the Lord, by solemnly
setting up the law in Canaan, it became thereby the nation of God, and
bound itself, at the same time, to hearken to the voice of the Lord and
keep His commandments, as it had already done (cf. [Deu
26:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#017).md).

[Deuteronomy 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 27:11</span></span>

With the solemn erection of the stones with the law written upon them,
Israel was to transfer to the land the blessing and curse of the law, as
was already commanded in [Deu 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#029.md);
that is to say, according to the more minute explanation of the command
which is given here, the people themselves were solemnly to give
expression to the blessing and the curse: to the former upon Mount
Gerizim, and to the latter upon Ebal. On the situation of these
mountains, see at [Deu 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#029.md). To this
end six tribes were to station themselves upon the top or side of
Gerizim, and six upon the top or side of Ebal. The blessing was to be
uttered by the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and
Benjamin, who sprang from the two wives of Jacob; and the curse by
Reuben, with the two sons of Leah's maid Zilpah, and by Zebulun, with
Dan and Naphtali, the sons of Rachel's maid Bilhah. It was natural that
the utterance of the blessing should be assigned to the tribes which
sprang from Jacob's proper wives, since the sons of the wives occupied a
higher position than the sons of the maids - just as the blessing had
pre-eminence over the curse. But in order to secure the division into
two sixes, it was necessary that two of the eight sons of the wives
should be associated with those who pronounced the curses. The choice
fell upon Reuben, because he had forfeited his right of primogeniture by
his incest ([Gen 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004).md), and upon
Zebulun, as the youngest son of Leah. "They shall stand there upon the
curse:" i.e., to pronounce the curse.

[Deuteronomy 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 27:14</span></span>

"And the Levites shall lift up and speak to all the men of Israel with a
high (loud) voice:" i.e., they shall pronounce the different formularies
of blessing and cursing, turning towards the tribes to whom these
utterances apply; and all the men of Israel shall answer "Amen," to take
to themselves the blessing and the curse, as uttered by them; just as in
the case of the priestly blessing in [Num
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#022.md), and in connection with every
oath, in which the person swearing took upon himself the oath that was
pronounced, by replying "Amen." "The Levites" are not all the members of
the tribe of Levi, but those "in whom the spiritual character of Levi
was most decidedly manifested" (Baumgarten), i.e., the levitical
priests, as the guardians and teachers of the law, and those who carried
the ark of the covenant ([Jos 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033).md).
From the passage in Joshua, where the fulfilment of the Mosaic
injunctions is recorded, we learn that the Levitical priests stationed
themselves in the centre between the two mountains, with the ark of the
covenant, and that the people took up their position, on both sides,
opposite to the ark, viz., six tribes on Gerizim, and six on Ebal. The
priests, who stood in the midst, by the ark of the covenant, then
pronounced the different formularies of blessing and cursing, to which
the six tribes answered "Amen." From the expression "all the men of
Israel," it is perfectly evident that in this particular ceremony the
people were not represented by their elders or heads, but were present
in the persons of all their adult men who were over twenty years of age;
and with this [Jos 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033.md), when rightly
interpreted, fully harmonizes.

[Deuteronomy 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 27:15</span></span>

In [Deu 27:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015.md) there follow twelve
curses, answering to the number of the tribes of Israel. The first is
directed against those who make graven or molten images of Jehovah, and
set them up in secret, that is to say, against secret breaches of the
second commandment ([Exo 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004).md); the
second against contempt of, or want of reverence towards, parents ([Exo
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017).md); the third against those who
remove boundaries ([Deu 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014).md); the
fourth against the man who leads the blind astray ([Lev
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014).md); the fifth against those who
pervert the right of orphans and widows ([Deu
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017).md); the sixth against incest with
a mother ([Deu 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md); [Deu
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#008).md); the seventh against unnatural
vices ([Lev 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#023).md); the eighth and
ninth against incest with a sister or a mother-in-law ([Lev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009.md) and [Lev
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017).md); the tenth against secret
murder ([Exo 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#013.md); [Num
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016)..md); the eleventh against judicial
murder ("he that taketh reward to slay a soul, namely, innocent blood:"
[Exo 23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#007).md); the twelfth against the
man who does not set up the words of this law to do them, who does not
make the laws the model and standard of his life and conduct. From this
last curse, which applied to every breach of the law, it evidently
follows, that the different sins and transgressions already mentioned
were only selected by way of example, and for the most part were such as
could easily be concealed from the judicial authorities. At the same
time, "the office of the law is shown in this last utterance, the
summing up of all the rest, to have been pre-eminently to proclaim
condemnation. Every conscious act of transgression subjects the sinner
to the curse of God, from which none but He who has become a curse for
us can possibly deliver us" ([Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md), [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013). O. v. Gerlach.md). - On the reason
why the blessings are not given, see the remarks on [Deu
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#004.md). As the curses against particular
transgressions of the law simply mention some peculiarly grievous sins
by way of example, it would be easy to single out corresponding
blessings from the general contents of the law: e.g., "Blessed be he who
faithfully follows the Lord his God, or loves Him with the heart, who
honours his father and his mother," etc.; and lastly, all the blessings
of the law could be summed up in the words, "Blessed be he who setteth
up the words of this law, to do them."
