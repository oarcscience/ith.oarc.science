### [Ezra Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 3:0</span></span>

The Altar of Burnt-Offering Erected, the Feast of Tabernacles
Celebrated, and the Foundations of the Temple Laid - [Ezr
3:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md)

On the approach of the seventh month, the people assembled in Jerusalem
to restore the altar of burnt-offering and the sacrificial worship, and
to keep the feast of tabernacles ([Ezr
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001).md); and in the second month of the
following year the foundations of the new temple were laid with due
solemnity ([Ezr 3:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008).md). Comp. 1 Esdr.
5:46-62.

[Ezra 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 3:1</span></span>

The building of the altar, the restoration of the daily sacrifice, and
the celebration of the feast of tabernacles. - [Ezr
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md) When the seventh month was come,
and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered
themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. The year is not stated, but
the year in which they returned from Babylon is intended, as appears
from [Ezr 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md), which tells us that the
foundations of the temple were laid in the second month of the second
year of their return. The words, "and the children of Israel were in the
cities," are a circumstantial clause referring to [Ezr
2:70](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#070.md), and serving to elucidate what
follows. From the cities, in which each had settled in his own ([Ezr
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001).md), the people came to Jerusalem as
one man, i.e., not entirely (Bertheau), but unanimously (ὁμοθυμαδόν, 1
Esdr. 5:46); comp. [Neh 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001.md); [Jdg
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md).

(Note: The more precise statement of 1 Esdr. 5:46, εἰς τὸ εὐρύχωρον τοῦ
πρώτου πυλῶνος τοῦ πρὸς τῇ ἀνατολῇ, according to which Bertheau insists
upon correcting the text of Ezra, is an arbitrary addition on the part
of the author of this apocryphal book, and derived from [Neh
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001)..md)

[Ezr 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md)

Then the two leaders of the people, Joshua the high priest and
Zerubbabel the prince (see on [Jos
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#002).md), with their brethren, i.e., the
priests and the men of Israel (the laity), arose and built the altar, to
offer upon it burnt-offerings, as prescribed by the law of Moses, i.e.,
to restore the legal sacrifices. According to [Ezr
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#006.md), the offering of burnt-offerings
began on the first day of the seventh month; hence the altar was by this
day already completed. This agrees with the statement, "When the seventh
month approached" ([Ezr 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001).md),
therefore before the first day of this month.

[Ezr 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md)

They reared the altar על־מכונתו, upon its (former) place; not, upon its
bases. The feminine מכונה has here a like signification with the
masculine form מכון, [Ezr 2:68](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#068.md), and
מכוּנה, [Zac 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#011.md). The Keri מכונתיו is
an incorrect revision. "For fear was upon them, because of the people of
those countries." The ב prefixed to אימה is the so-called ב essentiae,
expressing the being in a condition; properly, a being in fear had come
or lay upon them. Comp. on ב essentiae, Ewald, 217, f, and 299, b,
though in 295, f, he seeks to interpret this passage differently. The
"people of those countries" are the people dwelling in the neighbourhood
of the new community; comp. [Ezr 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md);
[Ezr 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#002.md). The notion is: They erected
the altar and restored the worship of Jahve, for the purpose of securing
the divine protection, because fear of the surrounding heathen
population had fallen upon them. J. H. Mich. had already a correct
notion of the verse when he wrote: ut ita periculi metus eos ad Dei opem
quaerendam impulerit.

(Note: Bertheau, on the contrary, cannot understand the meaning of this
sentence, and endeavours, by an alteration of the text after 1 Esdras,
to make it signify that some of the people of the countries came with
the purpose of obstructing the building of the altar, but that the
Israelites were able to effect the erection because a fear of God came
upon the neighbouring nations, and rendered them incapable of hostile
interference.)

Comp. the similar case in [Kg2 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025.md).,
when the heathen colonists settled in the deserted cities of Samaria
entreated the king of Assyria to send them a priest to teach them the
manner of worshipping the God of the land, that thus they might be
protected from the lions which infested it. The Chethiv ויאל must be
taken impersonally: "one (they) offered;" but is perhaps only an error
of transcription, and should be read ויּעלוּ. On the morning and evening
sacrifices, see on [Exo 28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038.md)., [Num
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003.md).

[Ezr 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004.md)

They kept the feast of tabernacles as prescribed in the law, [Lev
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md). "The burnt-offering day by day,
according to number," means the burnt-offering day by day, according to
number," means the burnt-offerings commanded for the several days of
this festival, viz., on the first day thirteen oxen, on the second
twelve, etc.; comp. Num 29:13-34, where the words כּמשׁפּט בּמספּרם,
[Num 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#018.md), [Num
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#021.md), [Num
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#024.md), etc., occur, which are written
in our present verse כּם בּמספּר, by number, i.e., counted; comp. [Ch1
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#028.md); [Ch1
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#031.md), etc.

[Ezr 3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#005.md)

And afterward, i.e., after the feast of tabernacles, they offered the
continual, i.e., the daily, burnt-offering, and (the offerings) for the
new moon, and all the festivals of the Lord (the annual feasts). עלות
must be inserted from the context before לחדשׁים to complete the sense.
"And for every one that willingly offered a free-will offering to the
Lord." נדבה is a burnt-offering which was offered from free inclination.
Such offerings might be brought on any day, but were chiefly presented
at the annual festivals after the sacrifices prescribed by the law;
comp. [Num 29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039.md). - In [Ezr
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#006.md) follows the supplementary remark,
that the sacrificial worship began from the first day of the seventh
month, but that the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet
laid. This forms a transition to what follows.

(Note: Bertheau, comparing [Ezr 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#006.md)
with [Ezr 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#005.md), incorrectly interprets
it as meaning: "From the first day of the seventh month the offering of
thank-offerings began (comp. [Ezr
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002).md); then, from the fifteenth day of
the second month, during the feast of tabernacles, the burnt-offerings
prescribed by the law ([Ezr 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004).md); but
the daily burnt-offerings were not recommenced till after the feast of
tabernacles, etc. Hence it was not from the first day of the seventh
month, but subsequently to the feast of tabernacles, that the worship of
God, so far as this consisted in burnt-offerings, was fully restored."
The words of the cursive manuscript, however, do not stand in the text,
but their opposite. In [Ezr 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md), not
thank-offerings (זבהים or שׁלמים), but burnt-offerings (עלות), are
spoken of, and indeed those prescribed in the law, among which the daily
morning and evening burnt-offering, expressly named in [Ezr
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md), held the first place. With this,
[Ezr 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#005.md), "After the feast of
tabernacles they offered the continual burnt-offering, and the
burnt-offerings for the new moon," etc., fully harmonizes. The offering
of the continual, i.e., of the daily, burnt-offerings, besides the new
moon, the feast-days, and the free-will offerings, is named again merely
for the sake of completeness. The right order is, on the contrary, as
follows: The altar service, with the daily morning and evening
sacrifice, began on the first day of the seventh month; this daily
sacrifice was regularly offered, according to the law, from then till
the fifteenth day of the second month, i.e., till the beginning of the
feast of tabernacles; all the offerings commanded in the law for the
separate days of this feast were then offered according to the numbers
prescribed; and after this festival the sacrifices ordered at the new
moon and the other holy days of the year were offered, as well as the
daily burnt-offerings, - none but these, neither the sacrifice on the
new moon (the first day of the seventh month) nor the sin-offering on
the tenth day of the same month, i.e., the day of atonement, having been
offered before this feast of tabernacles.)

[Ezr 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007.md)

Preparations were also made for the rebuilding of the temple; money was
given to hewers of wood and to masons, and meat and drink (i.e., corn
and wine) and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians (i.e., the Phoenicians;
comp. [Ch1 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#004).md), to bring cedar trees
from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa (i.e., to the coast of Joppa), as was
formerly done by Solomon, [Kg1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md).,
[Ch2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007.md). כּרשׁיון, according to the
grant of Cyrus to them, i.e., according to the permission given them by
Cyrus, sc. to rebuild the temple. For nothing is said of any special
grant from Cyrus with respect to wood for building. רשׁיון is in the
O.T. ἁπ. λεγ.; in Chaldee and rabbinical Hebrew, רשׁא and רשׁי mean
facultatem habere; and רשׁוּ power, permission.

[Ezra 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 3:8</span></span>

The foundation of the temple laid. - [Ezr
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md) In the second year of their coming
to the house of God at Jerusalem, i.e., after their arrival at Jerusalem
on their return from Babylon, in the second month, began Zerubbabel and
Joshua to appoint the Levites from twenty years old and upwards to the
oversight of the work (the building) of the house of the Lord. That is
to say, the work of building was taken in hand. Whether this second year
of the return coincides with the second year of the rule of Cyrus, so
that the foundations of the temple were laid, as Theophil. Antioch. ad
Autolic. lib. 3, according to Berosus, relates, in the second year of
Cyrus, cannot be determined. For nothing more is said in this book than
that Cyrus, in the first year of his reign, issued the decree concerning
the return of the Jews from Babylon, whereupon those named in the list,
Ezra 2, set out and returned, without any further notice as to whether
this also took place in the first year of Cyrus, or whether the many
necessary preparations delayed the departure of the first band till the
following year. The former view is certainly a possible though not a
very probable one, since it is obvious from [Ezr
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md) that they arrived at Jerusalem and
betook themselves to their cities as early as the seventh month of the
year. Now the period between the beginning of the year and the seventh
month, i.e., at most six months, seems too short for the publication of
the edict, the departure, and the arrival at Jerusalem, even supposing
that the first year of Cyrus entirely coincided with a year of the
Jewish calendar. The second view, however, would not make the difference
between the year of the rule of Cyrus and the year of the return to
Jerusalem a great one, since it would scarcely amount to half a year.
ויּעמידוּ...החלּוּ, they began and appointed, etc., they began to
appoint, i.e., they began the work of building the temple by appointing.
Those enumerated are-1. Zerubbabel and Joshua, the two rulers: 2. The
remnant of their brethren = their other brethren, viz., a, the priests
and Levites as brethren of Joshua; b, all who had come out of captivity,
i.e., the men of Israel, as brethren of Zerubbabel. These together
formed the community who appointed the Levites to preside over, i.e., to
conduct the building of the temple. For the expression, comp. 1 Chron
23:4-24.

[Ezr 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#009.md)

The Levites undertook this appointment, and executed the commission. The
singular ויּעמד stands before a plural subject, as is frequently the
case when the verb precedes its subject. Three classes or orders of
Levites are named: 1. Jeshua with his sons and brethren; 2. Kadmiel with
his sons, the sons of Hodaviah; 3. The sons of Henadad, their sons and
brethren. Jeshua and Kadmiel are the two heads of orders of Levites
already named ([Ezr 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040).md). From a
comparison of these passages, we perceive that יהוּדה בּני is a clerical
error for הודויה (or הודיּה) בּני. This more precise designation is not
"a comprehensive appellation for all hitherto enumerated" (Bertheau),
but, as is undoubtedly obvious from [Ezr
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040.md), only a more precise designation
of the sons of Kadmiel. כּאחד, as one, i.e., all, without exception. The
third class, the sons of Henadad, are not expressly named in [Ezr
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040.md) among those who returned from
Babylon; but a son of Henadad appears, [Neh
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#024.md) and [Neh
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#010.md), as head of an order of Levites.
The naming of this order after the predicate, in the form of a
supplementary notice, and unconnected by a ו cop., is striking. Bertheau
infers therefrom that the construction of the sentence is incorrect, and
desires to alter it according to 1 Esdr. 5:56, where indeed this class
is named immediately after the two first, but יהוּדה בּני is separated
from what precedes; and of these בני יהודה is made a fourth class, υἱοὶ
Ἰωδά τοῦ Ἡλιαδούδ. All this sufficiently shows that this text cannot be
regarded as authoritative. The striking position or supplementary
enumeration of the sons of Henadad may be explained by the fact to which
the placing of כּאחד after בני יהודה points, viz., that the two classes,
Jeshua with his sons and brethren, and Kadmiel with his sons, were more
closely connected with each other than with the sons of Henadad, who
formed a third class. The הלויּם at the end of the enumeration offers no
argument for the transposition of the words, though this addition
pertains not only to the sons of Henadad, but also to the two first
classes. hm' עשׂה is plural, and only an unusual reading for עשׁי; see
on [Ch1 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md).

[Ezr 3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md)

When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they
(Zerubbabel and Joshua, the heads of the community) set the priests in
their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with
cymbals, to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David. The perf.
ויסּדוּ, followed by an imperf. connected by a Vav consecutive, must be
construed: When they laid the foundations, then. מלבּשׁים, clothed, sc.
in their robes of office; comp. [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md); [Ch2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021.md). ידי על as [Ch1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md). On [Ezr
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011.md), comp. remarks on [Ch1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034.md), [Ch1
16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041.md); [Ch2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013.md); [Ch2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#003.md), and elsewhere. Older expositors
(Clericus, J. H. Mich.), referring to [Exo
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#021.md), understand בהלּל ויּענוּ of the
alternative singing of two choirs, one of which sang, "Praise the Lord,
for He is good;" and the other responded, "And His mercy endureth for
ever." In the present passage, however, there is no decided allusion to
responsive singing; hence (with Bertheau) we take יענוּ in the sense of,
"They sang to the Lord with hymns of thanksgiving." Probably they sang
such songs as Ps 106-107, or Ps 118, which commence with an invitation
to praise the Lord because He is good, etc. All the people, moreover,
raised a loud shout of joy. גּדולה תּרוּעה is repeated in [Ezr
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#013.md) by השּׂמחה תּרוּעת. הוּסד על, on
account of the founding, of the foundation-laying, of the house of the
Lord. הוּסד as in [Ch2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003.md).

[Ezr 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012.md)

But many of the priests and Levites, and chief of the people, the old
men who had seen (also) the former temple, at the foundation of this
house before their eyes (i.e., when they saw the foundation of this
house laid), wept with a loud voice. Solomon's temple was destroyed b.c.
588, and the foundation of the subsequent temple laid b.c. 535 or 534:
hence the older men among those present at the latter event might
possibly have seen the former house; indeed, some (according to Hagg.
[Ezr 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002).md) were still living in the
second year of Darius Hystaspis who had beheld the glory of the earlier
building. Upon these aged men, the miserable circumstances under which
the foundations of the new temple were laid produced so overwhelming an
impression, that they broke into loud weeping. בּיסדו is connected by
its accents with the words preceding: the former temple in its
foundation, i.e., in its stability. But this can scarcely be correct.
For not only does no noun יסד, foundation, occur further on; but even
the following words, "of this house before their eyes," if severed from
בּיסדו, have no meaning. Hence (with Aben Ezra, Cler., Berth., and
others) we connect בּיסדו with the parenthetical sentence following,
"when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes;" and then
the suffix of the infinitive יסדו expressly refers to the object
following, as is sometimes the case in Hebrew, e.g., [Ch2
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#014.md); [Ezr
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md), and mostly in Chaldee; comp. Ew.
209, c, "But many were in rejoicing and joy to raise their voice," i.e.,
many so joyed and rejoiced that they shouted aloud.

[Ezr 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#013.md)

And the people could not discern (distinguish) the loud cry of joy in
the midst of (beside) the loud weeping of the people; for the people
rejoiced with loud rejoicings, and the sound was heard afar off. The
meaning is not, that the people could not hear the loud weeping of the
older priests, Levites, and heads of the people, because it was
overpowered by the loud rejoicings of the multitude. The verse, on the
contrary, contains a statement that among the people also (the assembly
exclusive of priests, Levites, and chiefs) a shout of joy and a voice of
weeping arose; but that the shouting for joy of the multitude was so
loud, that the sounds of rejoicing and weeping could not be
distinguished from each other. הכּיר, with the acc. and ל, to perceive
something in the presence of (along with) another, i.e., to distinguish
one thing from another. "The people could not discern" means: Among the
multitude the cry of joy could not be distinguished from the noise of
weeping. למרחוק עד as [Ch2 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015.md).
