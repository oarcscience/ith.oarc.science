### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 11:1</span></span>

"Let thy bread go forth over the watery mirror: for in the course of
many days shalt thou find it." Most interpreters, chiefly the Talm.,
Midrash, and Targ.,

(Note: The Midrash tells the following story: Rabbi Akiba sees a ship
wrecked which carried in it one learned in the law. He finds him again
actively engaged in Cappadocia. What whale, he asked him, has vomited
thee out upon dry land? How hast thou merited this? The scribe learned
in the law thereupon related that when he went on board the ship, he
gave a loaf of bread to a poor man, who thanked him for it, saying: As
thou hast saved my life, may thy life be saved. Thereupon Akiba thought
of the proverb in [Ecc 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md). Similarly
the Targ.: Extend to the poor the bread for thy support; they sail in
ships over the water.)

regard this as an exhortation to charity, which although practised
without expectation of reward, does not yet remain unrewarded at last.
An Aram. proverb of Ben Sira's (vid., Buxtorf's Florilegium, p. 171)
proceeds on this interpretation: "Scatter thy bread on the water and on
the dry land; in the end of the days thou findest it again." Knobel
quotes a similar Arab. proverb from Diez' Denkwrdigkeiten von Asien
(Souvenirs of Asia), II 106: "Do good; cast thy bread into the water:
thou shalt be repaid some day." See also the proverb in Goethe's Westst.
Divan, compared by Herzfeld. Voltaire, in his Prcis de l'Ecclsiaste en
vers, also adopts this rendering:

Repandez vos bien faits avec magnificence,

Mme aux moins vertueux ne les refusez pas.

Ne vous informez pas de leur reconnaissance -

Il est grand, il est beau de faire des ingrats.

That instead of "into the water (the sea)" of these or similar proverbs,
Koheleth uses here the expression, "on the face of (על־פּני) the
waters," makes no difference: Eastern bread has for the most part the
form of cakes, and is thin (especially such as is prepared hastily for
guests, 'ughoth or matstsoth, [Gen
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#006.md); [Gen
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003).md); so that when thrown into the
water, it remains on the surface (like a chip of wood, [Hos
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#007).md), and is carried away by the
stream. But שׁלּח, with this reference of the proverb to beneficence, is
strange; instead of it, the word השׁלך was rather to be expected; the
lxx renders by ἀπόστειλον; the Syr., shadar; Jerome, mitte; Venet.
πέμπε; thus by none is the pure idea of casting forth connected with
שׁלּח. And the reason given does not harmonize with this reference: "for
in the course of many days (berov yamin, cf. mērov yamim, [Isa
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#022).md) wilt thou find it" (not "find
it again," which would be expressed by תּשׁוּב תּם). This indefinite
designation of time, which yet definitely points to the remote future,
does not thus indicate that the subject is the recompense of noble
self-renunciation which is sooner or later rewarded, and often
immediately, but exactly accords with the idea of commerce carried on
with foreign countries, which expects to attain its object only after a
long period of waiting. In the proper sense, they send their bread over
the surface of the water who, as [Psa
107:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033.md) expresses, "do business in
great waters." It is a figure taken from the corn trade of a seaport, an
illustration of the thought: seek thy support in the way of bold,
confident adventure.

(Note: The Greek phrase σπείρειν πόντον, "to sow the sea" = to undertake
a fruitless work, is of an altogether different character; cf. [Amo
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012)..md)

Bread in לח is the designation of the means of making a living or gain,
and bread in תּמצאנּוּ the designation of the gain (cf. [Ecc
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011).md). Hitzig's explanation: Throw thy
bread into the water = venture thy hope, is forced; and of the same
character are all the attempts to understand the word of agricultural
pursuits; e.g., by van der Palm: sementem fac muxta aquas (or: in loca
irrigua); Grtz even translates: "Throw thy corn on the surface of the
water," and understands this, with the fancy of a Martial, of begetting
children. Mendelssohn is right in remarking that the exhortation shows
itself to be that of Koheleth-Solomon, whose ships traded to Tarshish
and Ophir. Only the reference to self-sacrificing beneficence stands on
a level with it as worthy of consideration. With Ginsburg, we may in
this way say that a proverb as to our dealings with those who are above
us, is followed by a proverb regarding those who are below us; with
those others a proverb regarding judicious courageous venturing, ranks
itself with a proverb regarding a rashness which is to be
discountenanced; and the following proverb does not say: Give a portion,
distribute of that which is thine, to seven and also to eight: for it is
well done that thou gainest for thee friends with the unrighteous mammon
for a time when thou thyself mayest unexpectedly be in want; but it is a
prudent rule which is here placed by the side of counsel to bold
adventure:

[Ecclesiastes 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 11:2</span></span>

"Divide the portion into seven, yea, eight (parts); for thou knowest not
what evil shall happen on the earth." With that other interpretation,
עליך was to be expected instead of 'al-haarets; for an evil spreading
abroad over the earth, a calamity to the land, does not yet fall on
every one without exception; and why was not the רעה designated directly
as personal? The impression of the words לשׁם ... תּן־, established in
this general manner, is certainly this, that on the supposition of the
possibility of a universal catastrophe breaking in, they advise a
division of our property, so that if we are involved in it, our all may
not at once be lost, but only this or that part of it, as Jacob, [Gen
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md), says. With reference to 1a, it
is most natural to suppose that one is counselled not to venture his all
in one expedition, so that if this is lost in a storm, all might not at
once be lost (Mendelss., Preston, Hitz., Stuart); with the same right,
since 1a is only an example, the counsel may be regarded as denoting
that one must not commit all to one caravan; or, since in [Ecc
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md) לחמך is to be represented not
merely as a means of obtaining gain, that one ought not to lay up all he
has gathered in one place, [Jdg 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md);
[Jer 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#008) (Nachtigal.md); in short, that
one ought not to put all into one business, or, as we say literally,
venture all on one card. חלק is either the portion which one possesses,
i.e., the measure of the possession that has fallen to him ([Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005).md), or חלק נתן means to make
portions, to undertake a division. In the first case, the expression ל
... נתן follows the scheme of [Gen
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020.md) : make the part into seven, yea,
into eight (parts); in the second case, the scheme of [Jos
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#005.md) : make division into seven, etc.
We prefer the former, because otherwise that which is to be divided
remains unknown; חלק is the part now in possession: make the much or the
little that thou hast into seven or yet more parts. The rising from
seven to eight is as at [Job 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md), and
like the expression ter quaterque, etc. The same inverted order of words
as in [Ecc 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md) is found in [Est
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#003.md); [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md).

[Ecclesiastes 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 11:3</span></span>

With this verse there is not now a transition, εἰς ἄλλο γένος (as when
one understands [Ecc 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md). of
beneficence); the thoughts down to [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md) move in the same track. "When the
clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth: and if a
tree fall in the south, or in the north - the place where the tree
falleth, there it lieth." Man knows not - this is the reference of the
verse backwards - what misfortune, as e.g., hurricane, flood, scarcity,
will come upon the earth; for all that is done follows fixed laws, and
the binding together of cause and effect is removed beyond the influence
of the will of man, and also in individual cases beyond his knowledge.
The interpunction of 3a: אם־ימּלאוּ העבים גּשׁם (not as by v. d. Hooght,
Mendelss., and elsewhere העבים, but as the Venet. 1515, 21, Michael.
העבים, for immediately before the tone syllable Mahpach is changed into
Mercha) appears on the first glance to be erroneous, and much rather it
appears that the accentuation ought to be

אם־ימלאו העבים גשם על־הארץ יריקו

but on closer inspection גשׁם is rightly referred to the conditional
antecedent, for "the clouds could be filled also with hail, and thus not
pour down rain" (Hitz.). As in [Ecc
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#010.md), the fut. stands in the protasis
as well as in the apodosis. If A is done, then as a consequence B will
be done; the old language would prefer the words והריקו ... נמלאו (כי)
אם, Ewald, 355b: as often as A happens, so always happens B. יריקוּ
carries (without needing an external object to be supplied), as
internally transitive, its object is itself: if the clouds above fill
themselves with rain, they make an emptying, i.e., they empty themselves
downwards. Man cannot, if the previous condition is fixed, change the
necessary consequences of it.

The second conditioning clause: si ceciderit lignum ad austraum aut ad
aquilonem, in quocunque loco cociderit ibi erit. Thus rightly Jerome. It
might also be said: ואם־יפול עץ אם בדרום ואם בחפין, and if a tree falls,
whether it be in the south or in the north; this sive ... sive would
thus be a parenthetic parallel definition. Thus regarded, the protasis
as it lies before us consists in itself, as the two veim in [Amo
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003.md), of two correlated halves: "And if
a tree falls on the south side, and (or) if it fall on the north side,"
i.e., whether it fall on the one or on the other. The Athnach, which
more correctly belongs to יריקי, sets off in an expressive way the
protasis over against the apodosis; that a new clause begins with veim
yippol is unmistakeable; for the contrary, there was need for a chief
disjunctive to בץ. Meqom is accus. loci for bimqom, as at [Est
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#003.md); [Est
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017.md). Sham is rightly not connected
with the relat. clause (cf. [Eze
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013).md); the relation is the same as at
[Est 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#007.md). The fut. יהוּא is formed
from הוה, whence [Ecc 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md), as at [Neh
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#006.md), and in the Mishna (Aboth, vi. 1;

(Note: Vid., Baer, Abodath Jisrael, p. 290.)

Aboda zara, iii. 8) the part. הוה. As the jussive form יהי is formed
from יהיה, so יהיה (יהוה) passes into יהוּ, which is here written יהוּא.
Hitzig supposes that, according to the passage before us and [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md), the word appears to have been
written with א, in the sense of "to fall." Certainly הוה has the
root-signification of delabi, cadere, and derives from thence the
meaning of accidere, exsistere, esse (vid., under [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006).md); in the Book of Job, however,
הוה may have this meaning as an Arabism; in the usus loq. of the author
of the Book of Koheleth it certainly was no longer so used. Rather it
may be said that יהוּ had to be written with an א added to distinguish
it from the abbreviated tetragramm, if the א, as in אבוּא, [Isa
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012.md), and הל, [Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md), does not merely represent the
long terminal vowel (cf. the German-Jewish דוא = thou, דיא = the, etc.).

(Note: Otherwise Ewald, 192b: יהוּא, Aram. of הוּא (as בּוא) = הוא.)

Moreover, יהוּא, as written, approaches the Mishnic inflection of the
fut. of the verb הוה; the sing. there is יהא, תּהא, אהא, and the plur.
יהוּ, according to which Rashi, Aben Ezra, and Kimchi interpret יהוּא
here also as plur.; Luzzatto, 670, hesitates, but in his Commentary he
takes it as sing., as the context requires: there will it (the tree) be,
or in accordance with the more lively meaning of the verb הוה: there
will it find itself, there it continues to lie. As it is an invariable
law of nature according to which the clouds discharge the masses of
water that have become too heavy for them, so it is an unchangeable law
of nature that the tree that has fallen before the axe or the tempest
follows the direction in which it is impelled. Thus the future forms
itself according to laws beyond the control of the human will, and man
also has no certain knowledge of the future; wherefore he does well to
be composed as to the worst, and to adopt prudent preventive measures
regarding it. This is the reference of [Ecc
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md) looking backwards. But, on the
other hand, from this incalculableness of the future-this is the
reference of [Ecc 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md) looking
forwards-he ought not to vie up fresh venturesome activity, much rather
he ought to abstain from useless and impeding calculations and scruples.

[Ecclesiastes 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 11:4</span></span>

"He who observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the
clouds shall not reap." The proverb is not to be understood literally,
but in the spirit of the whole paraenesis: it is not directed against
the provident observation, guided by experience, of the monitions and
warnings lying in the present condition of the weather, but against that
useless, because impossible, calculation of the coming state of the
weather, which waits on from day to day, from week to week, till the
right time for sowing and reaping has passed away. The seed-time
requires rain so as to open up and moisten the ground; he who has too
much hesitation observes (שׁמר) the wind whether it will bring rain
([Pro 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023).md), and on that account puts
off the sowing of the seed till it is too late. The time of harvest
requires warmth without rain ([Pro
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001).md); but the scrupulous and timid
man, who can never be sure enough, looks at the clouds (cf. [Isa
47:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#013).md), scents rainy weather, and
finds now and never any security for the right weather for the gathering
in of the fruits of the field. He who would accomplish and gain
anything, must have confidence and courage to venture something; the
conditions of success cannot be wholly reckoned upon, the future is in
the hand of God, the All-Conditioning.

[Ecclesiastes 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 11:5</span></span>

"As thou hast no knowledge what is the way of the wind, like as the
bones in the womb of her who is with child; so thou knowest not the work
of God who accomplisheth all." Luther, after Jerome, renders rightly:
"As thou knowest not the way of the wind, and how the bones in the
mother's womb do grow; so," etc. The clause, instar ossium in ventre
praegnantis, is the so-called comparatio decurtata for instar
ignorantiae tuae ossium, etc., like thy ignorance regarding the bones,
i.e., the growth of the bones. כּעץ,

(Note: The Targ. reads בעץ, and construes: What the way of the spirit in
the bones, i.e., how the embryo becomes animated.)

because more closely defined by 'בּב הם, has not the art. used elsewhere
after כ of comparison; an example for the regular syntax (vid., Riehm,
under [Psa 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012).md) is found at [Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md). That man has no power over the
wind, we read at [Ecc 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md); the way of
the wind he knows not ([Joh 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008).md),
because he has not the wind under his control: man knows fundamentally
only that which he rules. Regarding the origin and development of the
embryo as a \_secret which remained a mystery to the Israel. Chokma,
vid., Psychol. p. 209ff. For עצם, cf. [Psa
139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015.md) and [Job
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#011.md). Regarding meleah, pregnant
(like the Lat. plena). With fine discrimination, the fut. תדע לא in the
apodosis interchanges with the particip. יודע אינך in the protasis, as
when we say: If thou knowest not that, as a consequence thou shalt also
not know this. As a man must confess his ignorance in respect to the way
of the wind, and the formation of the child in the mother's womb; so in
general the work of God the All-Working lies beyond his knowledge: he
can neither penetrate it in the entireness of its connection, nor in the
details of its accomplishment. The idea 'oseh kol, [Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024.md), is intentionally unfolded in a
fut. relat. clause, because here the fut. in the natural world, as well
as in human history, comes principally into view. For that very reason
the words את־הכּל are also used, not: (as in passages where there is a
reference to the world of creation in its present condition)
eth-kol-elleh, [Isa 66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md). Also the
growth of the child in the mother's womb is compared to the growth of
the future in the womb of the present, out of which it is born ([Pro
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md); cf. [Zep
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#002).md). What is established by this
proof that man is not lord of the future, - viz. that in the activity of
his calling he should shake off anxious concern about the future, - is
once again inferred with the combination of what is said in [Ecc
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004.md) and [Ecc
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md) (according to our interpretation,
here confirmed).

[Ecclesiastes 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 11:6</span></span>

"In the morning sow thy seed, and towards evening withdraw not thine
hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or
whether both together shall well succeed." The cultivation of the land
is the prototype of all labour ([Gen
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#015).md), and sowing is therefore an
emblem of all activity in one's pursuit; this general meaning for ידך
... אל־ (like [Ecc 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md); synon. with
ידך ... אל־, [Jos 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006.md), of the older
language) is to be accepted. The parallel word to babokěr is not
ba'ěTrěv; for the cessation from work ([Jdg
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#016.md); [Psa
104:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#023).md) must not be excluded, but
incessant labour (cf. [Luk 9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062).md) must
be continued until the evening. And as [Ecc
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md) counsels that one should not make
his success depend exclusively on one enterprise, but should divide that
which he has to dispose of, and at the same time make manifold trials;
so here also we have the reason for restless activity of manifold labour
from morning till evening: success or failure ([Ecc
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#005).md) is in the hand of God, - man
knows not which (quid, here, according to the sense, utrum) will
prosper, whether (ה) this or (או) that, and whether (אמו), etc.; vid.,
regarding the three-membered disjunctive question, Ewald, 361; and
regarding keěhhad, it is in common use in the more modern language, as
e.g., also in the last benediction of the Shemone-Esra: כאחד ... ברכנו,
"bless us, our Father, us all together." שׁניהם goes back to the two זה,
understood neut. (as at [Ecc 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md); cf.
on the contrary, [Ecc 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005).md). The lxx
rightly: καὶ ἐὰν (better: εἴτε) τὰ δύο επὶτὸ αυτὸ ἀγατηά. Luther, who
translates: "and if both together it shall be better," has been misled
by Jerome.

The proverb now following shows its connection with the preceding by the
copula vav. "The tendency of the advice in [Ecc
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md), [Ecc
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md), [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md), to secure guarantees for life,
is justified in [Ecc 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md) : life is
beautiful, and worthy of being cared for." Thus Hitzig; but the
connection is simpler. It is in the spirit of the whole book that, along
with the call to earnest activity, there should be the call to the
pleasant enjoyment of life: he who faithfully labours has a right to
enjoy his life; and this joy of life, based on fidelity to one's
calling, and consecrated by the fear of God, is the most real and the
highest enjoyment here below. In this sense the fruere vita here
connects itself with the labora:

[Ecclesiastes 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 11:7</span></span>

"And sweet is the light, and pleasant it is for the eyes to see the sun;
for if a man live through many years, he ought to rejoice in them all,
and remember the days of darkness; that there will be many of them. All
that cometh is vain." Dale translates the copula vav introducing [Ecc
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md) by "yes," and Bullock by "truly,"
both thus giving to it a false colouring. "Light," Zckler remarks,
stands here for "life." But it means only what the word denotes, viz.,
the light of life in this world (Ps. 56:14; [Job
33:30](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#030).md), to which the sun, as the
source of it, is related, as מאור is to אור. Cf. Eurip. Hippol., ὧ
λαμπρὸς αἰθὴρ κ.τ.λ, and Iphigen. in Aulis, 1218-19, μὴ μ ̓ ἀπολέσης
κ.τ.λ: "Destroy not my youth; to see the light is sweet," etc. The ל in
לע has the short vowel Pattach, here and at [Sa1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007.md), after the Masora.

(Note: Cf. on the contrary, at [Gen
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#006.md) and [Pro
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md), where it has the Kametz; cf.
also Michlol 53b.)

The ki beginning [Ecc 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#008.md) is
translated by Knobel, Hitz., Ewald, and others by "ja" (yes); by
Heiligstedt, as if a negative preceded by immo; but as the vav of [Ecc
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md) is copulative "and," so here the
ki is causal "for." If it had been said: man must enjoy himself as long
as he lives, for the light is sweet, etc., then the joy would have its
reason in the opportunity given for it. Instead of this, the occasion
given for joy has its reason in this, that a man ought to rejoice, viz.,
according to God's arrangement and ordinance: the light is sweet, and it
is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun; for it ought thus to be, that a
man, however long he may live, should continue to enjoy his fair life,
especially in view of the night which awaits him. Ki im are not here, as
at [Ecc 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md); [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md), where a negative precedes, to be
taken together; but ki assigns the reason, and im begins a hypothetical
protasis, as at [Exo 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#017.md), and
frequently. Im, with the conclusion following, presents something
impossible, as e.g., [Psa 50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012.md), si
esurirem, or also the extreme of that which is possible as actual, e.g.,
[Isa 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md), si peccata vestra sint
instar coccini. In the latter case, the clause with the concessive
particle may be changed into a sentence with a concessive conjunctive,
as at [Isa 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md) : "for though thy
people, O Israel, be as numerous as the sand of the sea;" and here:
"though a man may live ever so many years." The second ki after ויז is
the explicat. quod, as at [Ecc 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md);
[Ecc 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004.md); [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md), etc.: he must remember the days
of darkness, that there shall be many of them, and, at all events, not
fewer than the many years available for the happy enjoyment of life. In
this connection kol-shebba' denotes all that will come after this life.
If Hitz. remarks that the sentence: "All that is future is vanity," is a
false thought, this may now also be said of his own sentence extracted
from the words: "All that is, is transitory." For all that is done, in
time may pass away; but it is not actually transitory (הבל). But the
sentence also respects not all that is future, but all that comes after
this life, which must appear as vain (hěvel) to him for whom, as for
Koheleth, the future is not less veiled in the dark night of Hades, as
it was for Horace, i. 4. 16 s.:

"Jam te premet nox fabulaeque

Manes Et domus exilis Plutonia."

Also, for Koheleth as for Horace, iv. 7. 16, man at last becomes pulvis
et umbra, and that which thus awaits him is hevel. Tyler is right, that
"the shadowy and unsubstantial condition of the dead and the darkness of
Sheol" is thus referred to. הבּא signifies not that which is nascens,
but futurum, e.g., Sanhedrin 27a, "from the present ולהבא and for the
future" (for which, elsewhere, the expression לעתיד לבא is used). The
Venet. construes falsely: All (the days) in which vanity will overtake
(him); and Luther, referring בא as the 3rd pers. to the past, follows
the misleading of Jerome. Rightly the lxx and Theod.: πᾶν τὸ ἐρξηόμενον.

[Ecclesiastes 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 11:9</span></span>

"Rejoice, young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the
days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight
of thine eyes: but know, that for all this God will bring thee to
judgment." The parallel בּימי shows that the beth in בּילד (with ד
aspirated) does not introduce the reason of the joy, but the time
suitable for it. Instead of veyithav libbecha, "let thy heart be of good
cheer," as the expression might also be, the words are vithivecha
libbecha, "make thy heart of good cheer to thee," - so, viz., that from
this centre brightness may irradiate thy countenance ([Pro
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013).md) and thy whole personality,
vid., Psychologie, p. 249. Vehhuroth, the period of youth, is here and
at [Ecc 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md) = [Num
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#028.md), vehhurim, as the only once
occurring ne'uroth, [Jer 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#030.md), is =
the elsewhere generally used ne'urim; the form in ôth is the more modern
(cf. keluloth, [Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002).md). "Ways of the
heart" are thus ways into which the impulse of the heart leads, and
which satisfy the heart. מר עין, at [Ecc
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#009.md), designates the pleasure felt in
the presence of the object before one; here, a sight which draws and
fastens the eyes upon it. The Chethı̂b has the plur. מראי, which is known
to the language ([Dan 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#015.md); [Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014).md), and which would here designate
the multitude of the objects which delight the eyes, which is not
unsuitable; the Pih. הלּך denotes also elsewhere, frequently, e.g., [Psa
131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md), walking, in an ethical sense;
Hitz., Zckl., and others interpret the first ב as specifying the sphere,
and the second as specifying the norm ("according to the sight of thine
eyes"); but they both introduce that wherein he ought to act freely and
joyfully: in the ways of thy heart, into which it draws thee; and in the
sight of thine eyes, towards which they direct themselves with interest.
The lxx B. renders, "and not after the sight of thine eyes." This "not"
(μή), which is wanting in A.C., is an interpolation, in view of the
warning, [Num 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#039.md), against following
the impulse of the heart and of the eyes; the Targ. also therefore has:
"be prudent with reference to the sight of thine eyes." But this
moralizing of the text is superfluous, since the call to the youthful
enjoyment of life is accompanied with the nota bene: but know that God
will bring thee to an account for all this; and thus it excludes sinful
sensual desire. In the midst of an address, where a yet closer
definition follows, בּמש is thus punctuated, [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md); [Job
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#003.md); [Psa
143:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#003.md); here, in the conclusion of the
sentence, it is במש. Hitzig supposes that there is denoted by it, that
the sins of youth are punished by chronic disease and abandonment in old
age; Knobel and others understand by the judgment, the self-punishment
of sins by all manner of evil consequences, which the O.T. looks upon as
divinely inflicted penalties. But in view of the facts of experience,
that God's righteous requital is in this life too frequently escaped,
[Ecc 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md), the author, here and at
[Ecc 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017.md); [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md), postulates a final judgment,
which removes the contradiction of this present time, and which must
thus be in the future; he has no clear idea of the time and manner of
this final judgment, but his faith in God places the certainty of it
beyond all doubt. The call to rejoice is now completed by the call to
avoid all that occasions inward and outward sorrow.

[Ecclesiastes 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 11:10</span></span>

"And remove sorrow from thy heart, and banish evil from thy flesh: for
youth and age, not yet grown to grey hairs, are vain." Jerome
translates: aufer iram a corde tuo, and remarks in his Comm.: in ira
omnes perturbationes animi comprehendit; but כּעס (R. כס, contundere,
confringere) does not signify anger, but includes both anger and sorrow,
and thus corresponds to the specific ideas, "sadness, moroseness,
fretfulness." The clause following, Jerome translates: et amove malitiam
a carne tua, with the remark: in carnis malitia universas significat
corporis voluptates; but רעה is not taken in an ethical, but in a
physical sense: כעס is that which brings sorrow to the heart; and רעה,
that which brings evil to the flesh (בשׂר, opp. לב, [Ecc
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md); [Pro
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030).md). More correctly than the
Vulgate, Luther renders: "banish sorrow from thy heart, and put evil
from thy body." He ought to free himself from that which is injurious to
the inner and the outer man, and hurtfully affects it; for youth,
destined for and disposed to joy, is hevel, i.e., transitory, and only
too soon passes away. Almost all modern interpreters (excepting the
Jewish), in view of [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md), gives
to שׁחרוּת the meaning of "the dawn of the morning;" but the connection
with ילדוּת would then be tautological; the Mishn.-Midrash usus loq., in
conformity with which the Targ. translates, "days of black hair," proves
that the word does not go back to שׁחר, morning dawn, morning-red, but
immediately to שׁחור, black, and as the contrast of שׂיבה (non-bibl.
שׂיבוּת, סיב, סב), canities, denotes the time of black hair, and thus,
in the compass of its conception, goes beyond ילדות, since it
comprehends both the period of youth and of manhood, and thus the whole
period during which the strength of life remains unbroken.

(Note: The Mishna, Nedarim iii. 8, jurist. determines that שׁחורי הראשׁ
denotes men, with the exclusion of women (whose hair is covered) and
children. It is disputed (vid., Baer's Abodath Jisrael, p. 279) whether
תּשׁחרת, Aboth iii. 16, Derech erez c. II., Midrash under [Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md), is = שׁחרוּת, but without right;
ben-tishhorěth is used for a grown-up son in full manly strength.)
