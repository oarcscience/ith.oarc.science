### [Ezekiel Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

Jerusalem, the Useless Wood of a Wild Vine

As certainly as God will not spare Jerusalem for the sake of the
righteousness of the few righteous men therein, so certain is it that
Israel has no superiority over other nations, which could secure
Jerusalem against destruction. As the previous word of God overthrows
false confidence in the righteousness of the godly, what follows in this
chapter is directed against the fancy that Israel cannot be rejected and
punished by the overthrow of the kingdom, because of its election to be
the people of God.

[Ezekiel 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 15:1</span></span>

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, [Eze
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md). Son of man, what advantage has
the wood of the vine over every wood, the vine-branch, which was among
the trees of the forest? [Eze 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#003.md). Is
wood taken from it to use for any work? or do men take a peg from it to
hang all kinds of vessels upon? [Eze
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md). Behold, it is given to the fire
to consume. If the fire has consumed its two ends, and the middle of it
is scorched, will it then be fit for any work? [Eze
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#005.md). Behold, when it is uninjured, it
is not used for any work: how much less when the fire has consumed it
and scorched it can it be still used for work? [Eze
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#006.md). Therefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, As the wood of the vine among the wood of the forest, which I
give to the fire to consume, so do I give up the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, [Eze 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#007.md). And direct my
face against them. They have gone out of the fire, and the fire will
consume them; that ye may learn that I am Jehovah, when I set my face
against them. [Eze 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#008.md). And I make
the land a desert, because they committed treachery, is the saying of
the Lord Jehovah. - Israel is like the wood of the wild vine, which is
put into the fire to burn, because it is good for nothing. From [Deu
32:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md) onwards, Israel is frequently
compared to a vine or a vineyard (cf. [Psa
80:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md).; Isa 5; [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md); [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021).md), and always, with the exception
of Ps 80, to point out its degeneracy. This comparison lies at the
foundation of the figure employed, in [Eze
15:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md), of the wood of the wild vine.
This wood has no superiority over any other kind of wood. It cannot be
used, like other timber, for any useful purposes; but is only fit to be
burned, so that it is really inferior to all other wood ([Eze
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md) and [Eze
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#003).md). And if, in its perfect state,
it cannot be used for anything, how much less when it is partially
scorched and consumed ([Eze 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md) and
[Eze 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#005).md)! מה־יּהיה, followed by מן,
means, what is it above (מן, comparative)? - i.e., what superiority has
it to כּל־עץ, all kinds of wood? i.e., any other wood. 'הזמורה אשׁר וגו
is in apposition to עץ הנּפן, and is not to be connected with מכּל־עץ,
as it has been by the lxx and Vulgate, - notwithstanding the Masoretic
accentuation, - so as to mean every kind of fagot; for זמורה does not
mean a fagot, but the tendril or branch of the vine (cf. [Eze
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017).md), which is still further defined
by the following relative clause: to be a wood-vine, i.e., a wild vine,
which bears only sour, uneatable grapes. The preterite היה (which was;
not, "is") may be explained from the idea that the vine had been fetched
from the forest in order that its wood might be used. The answer given
in [Eze 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#003.md) is, that this vine-wood
cannot be used for any purpose whatever, not even as a peg for hanging
any kind of domestic utensils upon (see comm. on [Zac
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004).md). It is too weak even for this.
The object has to be supplied to לעשׂות למלאכה: to make, or apply it,
for any work. Because it cannot be used as timber, it is burned. A fresh
thought is introduced in [Eze 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md) by
the words 'את שׁני ק. The two clauses in [Eze
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md) are to be connected together. The
first supposes a case, from which the second is deduced as a conclusion.
The question, "Is it fit for any work?" is determined in [Eze
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#005.md) in the negative. אף כּי: as in
[Eze 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021.md). נחר: perfect; and יחר:
imperfect, Niphal, of חרר, in the sense of, to be burned or scorched.
The subject to waויּחר is no doubt the wood, to which the suffix in
אכלתהוּ refers. At the same time, the two clauses are to be understood,
in accordance with [Eze 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md), as
relating to the burning of the ends and the scorching of the middle. -
[Eze 15:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#006.md). In the application of the
parable, the only thing to which prominence is given, is the fact that
God will deal with the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the same manner as
with the vine-wood, which cannot be used for any kind of work. This
implies that Israel resembles the wood of a forest-vine. As this
possesses no superiority to other wood, but, on the contrary, is utterly
useless, so Israel has no superiority to other nations, but is even
worse than they, and therefore is given up to the fire. This is
accounted for in [Eze 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#007.md) : "They
have come out of the fire, and the fire will consume them" (the
inhabitants of Jerusalem). These words are not to be interpreted
proverbially, as meaning, "he who escapes one judgment falls into
another" (Hvernick), but show the application of [Eze
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md) and [Eze
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#005.md) to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Out of a fire one must come either burned or scorched. Israel has been
in the fire already. It resembles a wild vine which has been consumed at
both ends by the fire, while the middle has been scorched, and which is
now about to be given up altogether to the fire. We must not restrict
the fire, however, out of which it has come half consumed, to the
capture of Jerusalem in the time of Jehoiachin, as Hitzig does, but must
extend it to all the judgments which fell upon the covenant nation, from
the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes to the catastrophe in
the reign of Jehoiachin, and in consequence of which Israel now
resembled a vine burned at both ends and scorched in the middle. The
threat closes in the same manner as the previous one. Compare [Eze
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#007.md) with [Eze
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#008.md), and [Eze
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#008.md) with [Eze
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#015.md) and [Eze
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013.md).
