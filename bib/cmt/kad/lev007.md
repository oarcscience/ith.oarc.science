### [Leviticus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 7:1</span></span>

The Law of the Trespass-Offering embraces first of all the regulations
as to the ceremonial connected with the presentation.

[Lev 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#002.md)

The slaughtering and sprinkling of the blood were the same as in the
case of the burnt-offering ([Lev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005).md);
and therefore, no doubt, the signification was the same.

[Lev 7:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#003.md)

The fat portions only were to be burned upon the altar, viz., the same
as in the sin and peace-offerings (see [Lev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#008.md) and [Lev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009).md); but the flesh was to be eaten by
the priests, as in the sin-offering ([Lev
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#022).md), inasmuch as there was the same
law in this respect for both the sin-offering and trespass-offering; and
these parts of the sacrificial service must therefore have had the same
meaning, every trespass being a sin (see [Lev
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#026).md). - Certain analogous
instructions respecting the burnt-offering and meat-offering are
appended in [Lev 7:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008.md) by way of
supplement, as they ought properly to have been given in ch. 6, in the
laws relating to the sacrifices in question.

[Lev 7:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008.md)

In the case of the burnt-offering, the skin of the animal was to fall to
the lot of the officiating priest, viz., as payment for his services.
הכּהן is construed absolutely: "as for the priest, who offereth - the
skin of the burnt-offering which he offereth shall belong to the priest"
(for "to him"). This was probably the case also with the
trespass-offerings and sin-offerings of the laity; whereas the skin of
the peace-offerings belonged to the owner of the animal (see Mishnah,
Sebach. 12, 3). - In [Lev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009.md), [Lev
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#010.md), the following law is laid down
with reference to the meat-offering, that everything baked in the oven,
and everything prepared in a pot or pan, was to belong to the priest,
who burned a portion of it upon the altar; and that everything mixed
with oil and everything dry was to belong to all the sons of Aaron,
i.e., to all the priests, to one as much as another, so that they were
all to receive an equal share. The reason for this distinction is not
very clear. That all the meat-offerings described in ch. 2 should fall
to the sons of Aaron (i.e., to the priests), with the exception of that
portion which was burned upon the altar as an azcarah, followed from the
fact that they were most holy (see at [Lev
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003).md). As the meat-offerings, which
consisted of pastry, and were offered in the form of prepared food ([Lev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009).md), are the same as those described
in [Lev 2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004.md), it is evident that by
those mentioned in [Lev 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#010.md) we are to
understand the kinds described in [Lev
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md) and [Lev
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014.md), and by the "dry," primarily
the קלוּי אביב, which consisted of dried grains, to which oil was to be
added (נתן [Lev 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#015).md), though not
poured upon it, as in the case of the offering of flour ([Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001).md), and probably also in that of the
sin-offerings and jealousy-offerings ([Lev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011.md), and [Num
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015).md), which consisted simply of flour
(without oil). The reason therefore why those which consisted of cake
and pastry fell to the lot of the officiating priest, and those which
consisted of flour mixed with oil, of dry corn, or of simple flour, were
divided among all the priests, was probably simply this, that the former
were for the most part offered only under special circumstances, and
then merely in small quantities, whereas the latter were the ordinary
forms in which the meat-offerings were presented, and amounted to more
than the officiating priests could possibly consume, or dispose of by
themselves.

[Leviticus 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 7:11</span></span>

The Law of the Peace-Offerings, "which he shall offer to Jehovah" (the
subject is to be supplied from the verb), contains instructions, (1) as
to the bloodless accompaniment to these sacrifices ([Lev
7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012)), (2.md) as to the eating of the
flesh of the sacrifices ([Lev
7:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015).md), with the prohibition against
eating fat and blood ([Lev 7:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#022).md),
and (3) as to Jehovah's share of these sacrifices ([Lev
7:28-36](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#028).md). - In [Lev
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012.md) and [Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016.md) three classes of shelamim are
mentioned, which differ according to their occasion and design, viz.,
whether they were brought על־תּודה, upon the ground of praise, i.e., to
praise God for blessings received or desired, or as vow-offerings, or
thirdly, as freewill-offerings ([Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016)). To (lit., upon, in addition to.md)
the sacrifice of thanksgiving ([Lev
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012.md), "sacrifice of thanksgiving of
his peace-offerings," [Lev 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013.md) and
[Lev 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015).md) they were to present
"unleavened cakes kneaded with oil, and flat cakes anointed with oil
(see at [Lev 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004).md), and roasted fine
flour (see [Lev 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014).md) mixed as cakes
with oil," i.e., cakes made of fine flour roasted with oil, and
thoroughly kneaded with oil (on the construction, see Ges. 139, 2; Ewald
284 a). This last kind of cakes kneaded with oil is also called
oil-bread-cake ("a cake of oiled bread," [Lev
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#026.md); [Exo
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#023).md), or "cake unleavened, kneaded
with oil" ([Exo 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#002).md), and probably
differed from the former simply in the fact that it was more thoroughly
saturated with oil, inasmuch as it was not only made of flour that had
been mixed with oil in the kneading, but the flour itself was first of
all roasted in oil, and then the dough was moistened still further with
oil in the process of kneading.

[Leviticus 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 7:13</span></span>

This sacrificial gift the offerer was to present upon, or along with,
cakes of leavened bread (round, leavened bread-cakes), and to offer
"thereof one out of the whole oblation," namely, one cake of each of the
three kinds mentioned in [Lev 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012.md), as
a heave-offering for Jehovah, which was to fall to the priest who
sprinkled the blood of the peace-offering. According to [Lev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#009.md), an azcarah of the unleavened
pastry was burned upon the altar, although this is not specially
mentioned here any more than at [Lev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009.md) and [Lev
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#010.md); whereas none of the leavened
bread-cake was placed upon the altar ([Lev
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#012).md), but it was simply used as bread
for the sacrificial meal. There is nothing here to suggest an allusion
to the custom of offering unleavened sacrificial cakes upon a plate of
leavened dough, as J. D. Michaelis, Winer, and others suppose.

[Leviticus 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 7:15</span></span>

The flesh of the praise-offering was to be eaten on the day of
presentation, and none of it was to be left till the next morning (cf.
[Lev 22:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#029).md); but that of the vow
and freewill-offerings might be eaten on both the first and second days.
Whatever remained after that was to be burnt on the third day, i.e., to
be destroyed by burning. If any was eaten on the third day, it was not
well-pleasing (ירצה "good pleasure," see [Lev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004).md), and was "not reckoned to the
offerer," sc., as a sacrifice well-pleasing to God; it was "an
abomination." פּגּוּל, an abomination, is only applied to the flesh of
the sacrifices ([Lev 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#007.md); [Eze
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#014.md); [Isa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#004).md), and signifies properly a
stench; - compare the talmudic word פּגּל faetidum reddere. Whoever ate
thereof would bear his sin (see [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001).md). "The soul that eateth" is not to
be restricted, as Knobel supposes, to the other participators in the
sacrificial meal, but applies to the offerer also, in fact to every one
who partook of such flesh. The burning on the third day was commanded,
not to compel the offerer to invite the poor to share in the meal
(Theodoret, Clericus, etc.), but to guard against the danger of a
desecration of the meal. The sacrificial flesh was holy ([Exo
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#034).md); and in [Lev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#008.md), where this command is repeated,

(Note: There is no foundation for Knobel's assertion, that in [Lev
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#005.md). another early lawgiver
introduces a milder regulation with regard to the thank-offering, and
allows all the thank-offerings to be eaten on the second day. For [Lev
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#005.md). does not profess to lay down a
universal rule with regard to all the thank-offerings, but presupposes
our law, and simply enforces its regulations with regard to the vow and
freewill-offerings, and threatens transgressors with severe punishment.)

eating it on the third day is called a profanation of that which was
holy to Jehovah, and ordered to be punished with extermination. It
became a desecration of what was holy, through the fact that in warm
countries, if flesh is not most carefully preserved by artificial means,
it begins to putrefy, or becomes offensive (פּגּוּל) on the third day.
But to eat flesh that was putrid or stinking, would be like eating
unclean carrion, or the נבלה with which putrid flesh is associated in
[Eze 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#014.md). It was for this reason that
burning was commanded, as Philo (de vict. p. 842) and Maimonides (More
Neboch iii. 46) admit; though the former also associates with this the
purpose mentioned above, which we decidedly reject (cf. Outram l.c. p.
185 seq., and Bhr, ii. pp. 375-6).

[Leviticus 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 7:19</span></span>

In the same way all sacrificial flesh that had come into contact with
what was unclean, and been defiled in consequence, was to be burned and
not eaten. [Lev 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019.md), which is not
found in the Septuagint and Vulgate, reads thus: "and as for the flesh,
every clean person shall eat flesh," i.e., take part in the sacrificial
meal.

[Leviticus 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 7:22</span></span>

On the other hand, "the soul which eats flesh of the peace-offering, and
his uncleanness is upon him (for "whilst uncleanness is upon him;" the
suffix is to be understood as referring to נפשׁ construed as a
masculine, see [Lev 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001).md), "shall be
cut off" (see [Gen 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#014).md). This was to
be done, whether the uncleanness arose from contact with an unclean
object (any unclean thing), or from the uncleanness of man (cf. ch.
12-15), or from an unclean beast (see at [Lev
11:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004).md), or from any other unclean
abomination. שׁקץ, abomination, includes the unclean fishes, birds, and
smaller animals, to which this expression is applied in Lev 11:10-42
(cf. [Eze 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010.md) and [Isa
66:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#017).md). Moreover contact with animals
that were pronounced unclean so far as eating was concerned, did not
produce uncleanness so long as they were alive, or if they had been put
to death by man; but contact with animals that had died a natural death,
whether they belonged to the edible animals or not, that is to say, with
carrion (see at [Lev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#008).md).

There is appended to these regulations, as being substantially connected
with them, the prohibition of fat and blood as articles of food ([Lev
7:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#022).md). By "the fat of ox, or of
sheep, or of goat," i.e., the three kinds of animals used in sacrifice,
or "the fat of the beast of which men offer a firing to Jehovah" ([Lev
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#025).md), we are to understand only those
portions of fat which are mentioned in [Lev
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md), [Lev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009.md); not fat which grows in with the
flesh, nor the fat portions of other animals, which were clean but not
allowed as sacrifices, such as the stag, the antelope, and other kinds
of game.

[Leviticus 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 7:24</span></span>

The fat of cattle that had fallen (נבלה), or been torn to pieces (viz.,
by beasts of prey), was not to be eaten, because it was unclean and
defiled the eater ([Lev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015.md); [Lev
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#008).md); but it might be applied "to all
kinds of uses," i.e., to the common purposes of ordinary life. Knobel
observes on this, that "in the case of oxen, sheep, and goats slain in
the regular way, this was evidently not allowable. But the law does not
say what was to be done with the fat of these animals." Certainly it
does not disertis verbis; but indirectly it does so clearly enough.
According to [Lev 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003.md)., during the
journey through the desert any one who wanted to slaughter an ox, sheep,
or goat was to bring the animal to the tabernacle as a sacrificial gift,
that the blood might be sprinkled against the altar, and the fat burned
upon it. By this regulation every ordinary slaughtering was raised into
a sacrifice, and the law determined what was to be done with the fat.
Now if afterwards, when the people dwelt in Canaan, cattle were allowed
to be slaughtered in any place, and the only prohibition repeated was
that against eating blood ([Deu
12:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md), [Deu
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#021)..md), whilst the law against eating
fat was not renewed; it follows as a matter of course, that when the
custom of slaughtering at the tabernacle was restricted to actual
sacrifices, the prohibition against eating the fat portions came to an
end, so far as those animals were concerned with were slain for
consumption and not as sacrifices. The reason for prohibiting fat from
being eaten was simply this, that so long as every slaughtering was a
sacrifice, the fat portions, which were to be handed over to Jehovah and
burned upon the altar, were not to be devoted to earthly purposes,
because they were gifts sanctified to God. The eating of the fat,
therefore, was neither prohibited on sanitary or social grounds, viz.,
because fat was injurious to health, as Maimonides and other Rabbins
maintain, nor for the purpose of promoting the cultivation of olives, as
Michaelis supposes, nor to prevent its being put into the unclean mouth
of man, as Knobel imagines; but as being an illegal appropriation of
what was sanctified to God, a wicked invasion of the rights of Jehovah,
which was to be punished with extermination according to the analogy of
[Num 15:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md). The prohibition of
blood in [Lev 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#026.md), [Lev
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#027.md), extends to birds and cattle;
fishes not being mentioned, because the little blood which they possess
is not generally eaten. This prohibition Israel was to observe in all
its dwelling-places ([Exo 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#020.md), cf.
[Lev 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010).md), not only so long as all
the slaughterings had the character of sacrifices, but for all ages,
because the blood was regarded as the soul of the animal, which God had
sanctified as the medium of atonement for the soul of man ([Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011).md), whereby the blood acquired a
much higher degree of holiness than the fat.

[Leviticus 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 7:28</span></span>

Jehovah's share of the peace-offerings. - [Lev
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029.md). The offerer of the sacrifice was
to bring his gift (corban) to Jehovah, i.e., to bring to the altar the
portion which belonged to Jehovah.

[Leviticus 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 7:30</span></span>

His hands were to bring the firings of Jehovah, i.e., the portions to be
burned upon the altar ([Lev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009).md),
viz., "the fat (the fat portions, [Lev
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003).md) with the breast," - the former
to be burned upon the altar, the latter "to wave as a wave-offering
before Jehovah." חזה, τὸ στηθύνιον (lxx), i.e., according to Pollux, τῶν
στηθῶν τὸ μέσον, pectusculum or pectus (Vulg. cf. [Lev
9:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#020.md); [Lev
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#015).md), signifies the breast, the
breast-piece of the sacrificial animals,

(Note: The etymology of the word is obscure. According to Winer,
Gesenius, and others, it signifies adspectui patens; whilst Meier and
Knobel regard it as meaning literally the division, or middle-piece; and
Dietrich attributes to it the fundamental signification, "to be moved,"
viz., the breast, as being the part moved by the heart.)

the brisket, which consists for the most part of cartilaginous fat in
the case of oxen, sheep, and goats, and is one of the most savoury
parts; so that at the family festivities of the ancients, according to
Athen. Deipnos. ii. 70, ix. 10, στηθύνια παχέων ἀρνίων were dainty bits.
The breast-piece was presented to the Lord as a wave-offering
(tenuphah), and transferred by Him to Aaron and his sons (the priests).
תּנוּפה, from נוּף, הניף, to swing, to move to and fro (see [Exo
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022).md), is the name applied to a
ceremony peculiar to the peace-offerings and the consecration-offerings:
the priest laid the object to be waved upon the hands of the offerer,
and then placed his own hands underneath, and moved the hands of the
offerer backwards and forwards in a horizontal direction, to indicate by
the movement forwards, i.e., in the direction towards the altar, the
presentation of the sacrifice, or the symbolical transference of it to
God, and by the movement backwards, the reception of it back again, as a
present which God handed over to His servants the priests.

(Note: In the Talmud (cf. Gemar. Kiddush 36, 2, Gem. Succa 37, 2, and
Tosaphta Menach. 7, 17), which Maimonides and Rashi follow, tenuphah is
correctly interpreted ducebat et reducebat; but some of the later
Rabbins (vid., Outram ut sup.) make it out to have been a movement in
the direction of the four quarters of the heavens, and Witsius and
others find an allusion in this to the omnipresence of God-an allusion
which is quite out of character with the occasion.)

In the peace-offerings the waving was performed with the breast-piece,
which was called the "wave-breast" in consequence ([Lev
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034.md); [Lev
10:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014.md); [Num
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#020.md); [Num
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#018.md); [Exo
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027).md). At the consecration of the
priests it was performed with the fat portions, the right leg, and with
some cakes, as well as with the breast of the fill-offering ([Lev
8:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#025.md); [Exo
29:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#022).md). The ceremony of waving was
also carried out with the sheaf of first-fruits at the feast of
Passover; with the loaves of the first-fruits, and thank-offering lambs,
at the feast of Pentecost ([Lev 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011.md),
[Lev 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#020).md); with the shoulder and
meat-offering of the Nazarite ([Num
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#020).md); with the trespass-offering of
the leper ([Lev 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#012.md), [Lev
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#024).md); with the jealousy-offering
([Num 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#025).md); and lastly with the
Levites, at their consecration ([Num
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#011)..md). In the case of all these
sacrifices, the object waved, after it had been offered symbolically to
the Lord by means of the waving, became the property of the priests. But
of the lambs, which were waved at the feast of Pentecost before they
were slaughtered, and of the lamb which was brought as a
trespass-offering by the leper, the blood and fat were given up to the
altar-fire; of the jealousy-offering, only an azcarah; and of the
fill-offering, for special reasons, the fat portions and leg, as well as
the cakes. Even the Levites were given by Jehovah to the priests to be
their own ([Num 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019).md). The waving,
therefore, had nothing in common with the porricere of the Romans, as
the portions of the sacrifices which were called porriciae were
precisely those which were not only given up to the gods, but burned
upon the altars. In addition to the wave-breast, which the Lord gave up
to His servants as their share of the peace-offerings, the officiating
priest was also to receive for his portion the right leg as a terumah,
or heave-offering, or lifting off. שׁוק is the thigh in the case of a
man ([Isa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002.md); [Sol
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015).md), and therefore in the case of an
animal it is not the fore-leg, or shoulder (βραχηίων, armus), which is
called זרע, or the arm ([Num 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#019.md);
[Deu 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003).md), but the hind-leg, or
rather the upper part of it or ham, which is mentioned in [Sa1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024.md) as a peculiarly choice portion
(Knobel). As a portion lifted off from the sacrificial gifts, it is
often called "the heave-leg" (v. 34; [Lev
10:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014.md); [Num
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#020.md); [Exo
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027).md), because it was lifted or
heaved off from the sacrificial animal, as a gift of honour for the
officiating priest, but without being waved like the breast-piece-though
the more general phrase, "to wave a wave-offering before Jehovah" ([Lev
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#015).md), includes the offering of the
heave-leg (see my Archaeologie i. pp. 244-5).

[Leviticus 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 7:34</span></span>

The wave-breast and heave-leg Jehovah had taken of the children of
Israel, from off the sacrifices of their peace-offerings: i.e., had
imposed it upon them as tribute, and had given them to Aaron and his
sons, i.e., to the priests, "as a statute for ever," - in other words,
as a right which they could claim of the Israelites for all ages (cf.
[Exo 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021).md). - With [Lev
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035.md), [Lev
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#036.md), the instructions concerning the
peace-offerings are brought to a close. "This (the wave-breast and
heave-leg) is the share of Aaron and his sons from the firings of
Jehovah in the day (i.e., which Jehovah assigned to them in the day)
when He caused them to draw near to become priests to Jehovah," i.e.,
according to the explanation in [Lev
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#036.md), "in the day of their anointing."
The word משׁחה in [Lev 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035.md), like
משׁחה in [Num 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008.md), signifies not
"anointing," but share, portio, literally a measuring off, as in
Aramaean and Arabic, from משׁח to stroke the hand over anything, to
measure, or measure off.

The fulness with which every point in the sacrificial meal is laid down,
helps to confirm the significance of the peace-offerings, as already
implied in the name זבח sacrificial slaughtering, slain-offering, viz.,
as indicating that they were intended for, and culminated in a
liturgical meal. By placing his hand upon the head of the animal, which
had been brought to the altar of Jehovah for the purpose, the offerer
signified that with this gift, which served to nourish and strengthen
his own life, he gave up the substance of his life to the Lord, that he
might thereby be strengthened both body and soul for a holy walk and
conversation. To this end he slaughtered the victim and had the blood
sprinkled by the priest against the altar, and the fat portions burned
upon it, that in these altar-gifts his soul and his inner man might be
grounded afresh in the gracious fellowship of the Lord. He then handed
over the breast-piece by the process of waving, also the right leg, and
a sacrificial cake of each kind, as a heave-offering from the whole to
the Lord, who transferred these portions to the priests as His servants,
that they might take part as His representatives in the sacrificial
meal. In consequence of this participation of the priests, the feast,
which the offerer of the sacrifice prepared for himself and his family
from the rest of the flesh, became a holy covenant meal, a meal of love
and joy, which represented domestic fellowship with the Lord, and thus
shadowed forth, on the one hand, rejoicing before the Lord ([Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md), [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018).md), and on the other, the
blessedness of eating and drinking in the kingdom of God ([Luk
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#015.md); [Luk
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030).md). Through the fact that one
portion was given up to the Lord, the earthly food was sanctified as a
symbol of the true spiritual food, with which the Lord satisfies and
refreshes the citizens of His kingdom. This religious aspect of the
sacrificial meal will explain the instructions given, viz., that not
only the flesh itself, but those who took part in the meal, were all to
be clean, and that whatever remained of the flesh was to be burned, on
the second or third day respectively, that it might not pass into a
state of decomposition. The burning took place a day earlier in the case
of the praise-offering than in that of the vow and freewill-offerings,
of which the offerer was allowed a longer enjoyment, because they were
the products of his own spontaneity, which covered any defect that might
attach to the gift itself.

[Leviticus 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lev 7:37</span></span>

With [Lev 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#037.md) and [Lev
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#038.md) the whole of the sacrificial law
(ch. 1-7) is brought to a close. Among the sacrifices appointed, the
fill-offering (המּלּוּאים) is also mentioned here; though it is not
first instituted in these chapters, but in [Exo
29:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#019.md) ([Exo
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#022.md), [Exo
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#026.md), [Exo
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027.md), [Exo
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#031).md). The name may be explained from
the phrase to "fill the hand," which is not used in the sense of
installing a man, or giving him authority, like בּיד נתן "commit into
his hand" in [Isa 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#021) (Knobel.md), but
was applied primarily to the ceremony of consecrating the priests, as
described in [Lev 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#025.md)., and was
restricted to the idea of investiture with the priesthood (cf. [Lev
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033.md); [Lev
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#032.md); [Exo
28:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#041.md); [Exo
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#009.md), [Exo
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#029.md), [Exo
29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033.md), [Exo
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#035.md); [Num
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#003.md); [Jdg
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#005.md), [Jdg
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#012).md). This gave rise to the
expression "to fill the hand for Jehovah," i.e., to provide something to
offer to Jehovah ([Ch1 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#005.md); [Ch2
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#031.md), cf. [Exo
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#029).md). Hence מלּוּאים denotes the
filling of the hand with sacrificial gifts to be offered to Jehovah, and
as used primarily of the particular sacrifice through which the priests
were symbolically invested at their consecration with the gifts they
were to offer, and were empowered, by virtue of this investiture, to
officiate at the sacrifices; and secondly, in a less restricted sense,
of priestly consecration generally ([Lev
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033.md), "the days of your
consecration"). The allusion to the place in [Lev
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#038.md), viz., "in the wilderness of
Sinai," points on the one hand back to [Exo
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001.md), and on the other hand forward to
[Num 26:63-64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#063.md), and [Num
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#013.md), "in the plains of Moab" (cf.
[Num 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md), [Num
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#019), etc..md).

The sacrificial law, therefore, with the five species of sacrifices
which it enjoins, embraces every aspect in which Israel was to manifest
its true relation to the Lord its God. Whilst the sanctification of the
whole man in self-surrender to the Lord was shadowed forth in the
burnt-offerings, the fruits of this sanctification in the
meat-offerings, and the blessedness of the possession and enjoyment of
saving grace in the peace-offerings, the expiatory sacrifices furnished
the means of removing the barrier which sins and trespasses had set up
between the sinner and the holy God, and procured the forgiveness of sin
and guilt, so that the sinner could attain once more to the unrestricted
enjoyment of the covenant grace. For, provided only that the people of
God drew near to their God with sacrificial gifts, in obedience to His
commandments and in firm reliance upon His word, which had connected the
forgiveness of sin, strength for sanctification, and the peace of
fellowship with Him, with these manifestations of their piety, the
offerers would receive in truth the blessings promised them by the Lord.
Nevertheless these sacrifices could not make those who drew near to God
with them and in them "perfect as pertaining to the conscience" ([Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001).md), because the blood of bulls and
of goats could not possibly take away sin ([Heb
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004).md). The forgiveness of sin which
the atoning sacrifices procured, was only a πάρεσις of past sins through
the forbearance of God ([Rom 3:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md),
in anticipation of the true sacrifice of Christ, of which the animal
sacrifices were only a type, and by which the justice of God is
satisfied, and the way opened fore the full forgiveness of sin and
complete reconciliation with God. So also the sanctification and
fellowship set forth by the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, were
simply a sanctification of the fellowship already established by the
covenant of the law between Israel and its covenant God, which pointed
forward to the true sanctification and blessedness that grow out of the
righteousness of faith, and expand through the operation of the Holy
Spirit into the true righteousness and blessedness of the divine peace
of reconciliation. The effect of the sacrifices was in harmony with the
nature of the old covenant. The fellowship with God, established by this
covenant, was simply a faint copy of that true and living fellowship
with God, which consists in God's dwelling in our hearts through His
Spirit, transforming our spirit, soul, and body more and more into His
own image and His divine nature, and making us partakers of the glory
and blessedness of His divine life. However intimately the infinite and
holy God connected Himself with His people in the earthly sanctuary of
the tabernacle and the altar of burnt-offering, yet so long as this
sanctuary stood, the God who was enthroned in the most holy place was
separated by the veil from His people, who could only appear before Him
in the fore-court, as a proof that the sin which separates unholy man
from the holy God had not yet been taken out of the way. Just as the old
covenant generally was not intended to secure redemption from sin, but
the law was designed to produce the knowledge of sin; so the desire for
reconciliation with God was not to be truly satisfied by its sacrificial
ordinances, but a desire was to be awakened for that true sacrifice
which cleanses from all sins, and the way to be prepared for the
appearing of the Son of God, who would exalt the shadows of the Mosaic
sacrifices into a substantial reality by giving up His own life as a
propitiation for the sins of the whole world, and thus through the one
offering of His own holy body would perfect all the manifold sacrifices
of the Old Testament economy.
