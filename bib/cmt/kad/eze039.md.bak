### [Ezekiel Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 39:1</span></span>

Further Description of the Judgment to Fall upon Gog and his Hosts

[Eze 39:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md). General announcement of
his destruction. - [Eze 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md). And
thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with thee, Gog, thou prince of Rosh,
Meshech, and Tubal. [Eze 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#002.md). I will
mislead thee, and conduct thee, and cause thee to come up from the
uttermost north, and bring thee to the mountains of Israel; [Eze
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#003.md). And will smite thy bow from thy
left hand, and cause thine arrows to fall from thy right hand. [Eze
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#004.md). Upon the mountains of Israel
wilt thou fall, thou and all thy hosts, and the peoples which are with
thee: I give thee for food to the birds of prey of every plumage, and to
the beasts of the field. [Eze 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#005.md).
Upon the open field shalt thou fall, for I have spoken it, is the saying
of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#006.md). And I
will send fire in Magog, and among those who dwell in security upon the
islands, that they may know that I am Jehovah. [Eze
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#007.md). I will make known my holy name
in the midst of my people Israel, and will not let my holy name be
profaned any more, that the nations may know that I am Jehovah, holy in
Israel. [Eze 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#008.md). Behold, it comes
and happens, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah; this is the day of which
I spoke. - The further description of the judgment with which Gog and
his hosts are threatened in [Eze
38:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#021.md), commences with a repetition
of the command to the prophet to prophesy against Gog ([Eze
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md), cf. [Eze
38:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002).md). The principal contents of
[Eze 38:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#004.md) are then briefly summed
up in [Eze 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#002.md). שׁבבתּיך, as in [Eze
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#004.md), is strengthened by שׁשּׁתיך,
שׁשׁא, ἁπαχ λεγ.., is not connected with שׁשׁ in the sense of "I leave a
sixth part of thee remaining," or afflict thee with six punishments; but
in the Ethiopic it signifies to proceed, or to climb, and here,
accordingly, it is used in the sense of leading on (lxx καθοδηγήσω σε,
or, according to another reading, κατάξω; Vulg. educam). For [Eze
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#002.md), compare [Eze
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#015.md) and [Eze
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#008.md). In the land of Israel, God will
strike his weapons out of his hands, i.e., make him incapable of
fighting (for the fact itself, compare the similar figures in [Psa
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#015.md); [Psa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010).md), and give him up with all his
army as a prey to death. עיט, a beast of prey, is more precisely defined
by צפּור, and still further strengthened by the genitive כּל־כּנף: birds
of prey of every kind. The judgment will not be confined to the
destruction of the army of Gog, which has invaded the land of Israel,
but ([Eze 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#006).md) will also extend to
the land of Gog, and to all the heathen nations that are dwelling in
security. אשׁ, fire, primarily the fire of war; then, in a further
sense, a figure denoting destruction inflicted directly by God, as in
[Eze 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022.md), which is therefore
represented in [Rev 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009.md) as fire
falling from heaven. Magog is the population of the land of Magog ([Eze
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002).md). With this the inhabitants of
the distant coastlands of the west (the איּים) are associated, as
representatives of the remotest heathen nations. [Eze
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#007.md), [Eze
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#008.md). By this judgment the Lord will
make known His holy name in Israel, and show the heathen that He will
not let it be blasphemed by them any more. For the fact itself, compare
[Eze 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020.md). For [Eze
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#008.md), compare [Eze
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012.md), and for היּום, see [Eze
38:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#018.md).

[Ezekiel 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 39:9</span></span>

Total Destruction of Gog and his Hosts

[Eze 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#009.md). Then will the inhabitants
of the cities of Israel go forth, and burn and heat with armour and
shield and target, with bow and arrows and hand-staves and spears, and
will burn fire with them for seven years; [Eze
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#010.md). And will not fetch wood from
the field, nor cut wood out of the forests, but will burn fire with the
armour, and will spoil those who spoiled them, and plunder those who
plundered them, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011.md). And it will come to pass in
that day, that I will give Gog a place where his grave in Israel shall
be, the valley of the travellers, and there will they bury Gog and all
his multitude, and will call it the valley of Gog's multitude. [Eze
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#012.md). They of the house of Israel
will bury them, to purify the land for seven months. V.1 3. And all the
people of the land will bury, and it will be to them for a name on the
day when I glorify myself, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze
39:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#014.md). And they will set apart
constant men, such as rove about in the land, and such as bury with them
that rove about those who remain upon the surface of the ground, to
cleanse it, after the lapse of seven months will they search it through.
[Eze 39:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#015.md). And those who rove about
will pass through the land; and if one sees a man's bone, he will set up
a sign by it, till the buriers of the dead bury it in the valley of the
multitude of Gog. [Eze 39:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#016.md). The name
of a city shall also be called Hamonah (multitude). And thus will they
cleanse the land. [Eze 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017.md). And
thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Say to the birds of every
plumage, and to all the beasts of the field, Assemble yourselves, and
come, gather together from round about to my sacrifice, which I
slaughter for you, to a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel,
and eat flesh and drink blood. [Eze
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018.md). Flesh of heroes shall ye eat,
and drink blood of princes of the earth; rams, lambs, and he-goats,
bullocks, all fattened in Bashan. [Eze
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#009.md). And ye shall eat fat to satiety,
and drink blood to intoxication, of my sacrifice which I have
slaughtered for you. [Eze 39:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#020.md). And
ye shall satiate yourselves at my table with horses and riders, heroes
and all kinds of men of war, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - To
show how terrible the judgment upon Gog will be, Ezekiel depicts in
three special ways the total destruction of his powerful forces. In the
first place, the burning of all the weapons of the fallen foe will
furnish the inhabitants of the land of Israel with wood for firing for
seven years, so that there will be no necessity for them to fetch fuel
from the field or from the forest ([Eze
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#009.md) and [Eze
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#010).md). But Hvernick is wrong in
supposing that the reason for burning the weapons is that, according to
[Isa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md), weapons of war are
irreconcilable with the character of the Messianic times of peace. This
is not referred to here; but the motive is the complete annihilation of
the enemy, the removal of every trace of him. The prophet therefore
crowds the words together for the purpose of enumerating every kind of
weapon that was combustible, even to the hand-staves which men were
accustomed to carry (cf. [Num 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#027).md).
The quantity of the weapons will be so great, that they will supply the
Israelites with all the fuel they need for seven years. The number seven
in the seven years as well as in the seven months of burying ([Eze
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011).md) is symbolical, stamping the
overthrow as a punishment inflicted by God, the completion of a divine
judgment.

With the gathering of the weapons for burning there is associated the
plundering of the fallen foe ([Eze
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#010).md), by which the Israelites do to
the enemy what he intended to do to them ([Eze
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#012).md), and the people of God obtain
possession of the wealth of their foes (cf. [Jer
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#016).md). In the second place, God will
assign a large burying-place for the army of Gog in a valley of Israel,
which is to be named in consequence "the multitude of Gog;" just as a
city in that region will also be called Hamonah from this event. The
Israelites will bury the fallen of Gog there for seven months long, and
after the expiration of that time they will have the land explored by
men specially appointed for the purpose, and bones that may still have
been left unburied will be sought out, and they will have them interred
by buriers of the dead, that the land may be thoroughly cleansed ([Eze
39:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011).md). מקום שׁם, a place where
there was a grave in Israel, i.e., a spot in which he might be buried in
Israel. There are different opinions as to both the designation and the
situation of this place. There is no foundation for the supposition that
גּי העברים derives its name from the mountains of Abarim in [Num
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012.md) and [Deu
32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049) (Michaelis, Eichhorn.md), or that
it signifies valley of the haughty ones (Ewald), or that there is an
allusion to the valley mentioned in [Zac
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004) (Hitzig.md), or the valley of
Jehoshaphat (Kliefoth). The valley cannot even have derived its name
(העברים) from the עברים, who passed through the land to search out the
bones of the dead that still remained unburied, and have them interred
([Eze 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#014.md), [Eze
39:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#015).md). For העברים cannot have any
other meaning here than that which it has in the circumstantial clause
which follows, where those who explored the land cannot possibly be
intended, although even this clause is also obscure. The only other
passage in which חסם occurs is [Deu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004.md), where it signifies a muzzle, and
in the Arabic it means to obstruct, or cut off; and hence, in the
passage before us, probably, to stop the way. העברים are not the
Scythians (Hitzig), for the word עבר is never applied to their invasion
of the land, but generally the travellers who pass through the land, or
more especially those who cross from Peraea to Canaan. The valley of
העברים is no doubt the valley of the Jordan above the Dead Sea. The
definition indicates this, viz., קדמת, on the front of the sea; not to
the east of the sea, as it is generally rendered, for קדמת never has
this meaning (see the comm. on [Gen
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#014).md). By היּם we cannot understand
"the Mediterranean,"as the majority of the commentators have done, as
there would then be no meaning in the words, since the whole of the land
of Israel was situated to the east of the Mediterranean Sea. היּם is the
Dead Sea, generally called היּם הקּדמוני ([Eze
47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018).md); and קדמת, "on the front side
of the (Dead) Sea," as looked at from Jerusalem, the central point of
the land, is probably the valley of the Jordan, the principal crossing
place from Gilead into Canaan proper, and the broadest part of the
Jordan-valley, which was therefore well adapted to be the burial-place
for the multitude of slaughtered foes. But in consequence of the army of
Gog having there found its grave, this valley will in future block up
the way to the travellers who desire to pass to and fro. This appears to
be the meaning of the circumstantial clause.

From the fact that Gog's multitude is buried there, the valley itself
will receive the name of Hamon-Gog. The Israelites will occupy seven
months in burying them, so enormously great will be the number of the
dead to be buried ([Eze 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#012).md), and
this labour will be for a name, i.e., for renown, to the whole nation.
This does not mean, of course, "that it will be a source of honour to
them to assist in this work;" nor is the renown to be sought in the
fact, that as a privileged people, protected by God, they can possess
the grave of Gog in their land (Hitzig), - a thought which is altogether
remote, and perfectly foreign to Israelitish views; but the burying of
Gog's multitude of troops will be for a name to the people of Israel,
inasmuch as they thereby cleanse the land and manifest their zeal to
show themselves a holy people by sweeping all uncleanness away. יום is
an accusative of time: on the day when I glorify myself. - [Eze
39:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#014.md), [Eze
39:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#015.md). The effort made to cleanse the
land perfectly from the uncleanness arising from the bones of the dead
will be so great, that after the great mass of the slain have been
buried in seven months, there will be men specially appointed to bury
the bones of the dead that still lie scattered here and there about the
land. אנשׁי תּמיד are people who have a permanent duty to discharge. The
participles עברים and מקבּרים are co-ordinate, and are written together
asyndetos, men who go about the land, and men who bury with those who go
about. That the words are to be understood in this sense is evident from
[Eze 39:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#015.md), according to which those
who go about do not perform the task of burying, but simply search for
bones that have been left, and put up a sign for the buriers of the
dead. ראה, with the subject indefinite; if one sees a human bone, he
builds (erects) a ציּוּן, or stone, by the side of it (cf. [Kg2
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#017).md). - [Eze
39:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#016.md). A city shall also receive the
name of Hamonah, i.e., multitude or tumult. To שׁם־עיר we may easily
supply יהיה from the context, since this puts in the future the
statement, "the name of the city is," for which no verb was required in
Hebrew. In the last words, וטהרוּ הארץ, the main thought is finally
repeated and the picture brought to a close. - [Eze
39:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017.md). In the third place, God will
provide the birds of prey and beasts of prey with an abundant meal from
this slaughter. This cannot be understood as signifying that only what
remain of the corpses, and have not been cleared away in the manner
depicted in [Eze 39:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011.md), will become
the prey of wild beasts; but the beasts of prey will make their meal of
the corpses before it is possible to bury them, since the burying cannot
be effected immediately or all at once. - The several features in the
picture, of the manner in which the enemies are to be destroyed till the
last trace of them is gone, are not arranged in chronological order, but
according to the subject-matter; and the thought that the slaughtered
foes are to become the prey of wild beasts is mentioned last as being
the more striking, because it is in this that their ignominious
destruction culminates. To give due prominence to this thought, the
birds and beasts of prey are summoned by God to gather together to the
meal prepared for them. The picture given of it as a sacrificial meal is
based upon [Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md) and [Jer
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010.md). In harmony with this picture
the slaughtered foes are designated as fattened sacrificial beasts,
rams, lambs, he-goats, bullocks; on which Grotius has correctly
remarked, that "these names of animals, which were generally employed in
the sacrifices, are to be understood as signifying different orders of
men, chiefs, generals, soldiers, as the Chaldee also observes."

[Ezekiel 39:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 39:21</span></span>

The Result of this Judgment, and the Concluding Promise

[Eze 39:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#021.md). Then will I display my
glory among the nations, and all nations shall see my judgment which I
shall execute, and my hand which I shall lay upon them. [Eze
39:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#022.md). And the house of Israel shall
know that I am Jehovah their God from this day and forward. [Eze
39:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#023.md). And the nations shall know that
because of their wickedness the house of Israel went into captivity;
because they have been unfaithful toward me, I hid my face from them,
and gave them into the hand of their oppressors, so that they all fell
by the sword. [Eze 39:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#024.md). According to
their uncleanness, and according to their transgressions, I dealt with
them, and hid my face from them. [Eze
39:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#025.md). Therefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have pity
upon all the house of Israel, and be jealous for my holy name. [Eze
39:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#026.md). Then will they bear their
reproach and all their faithlessness which they have committed toward me
when they dwell in their land in security, and no one alarms them; [Eze
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#027.md). When I bring them back out of
the nations, and gather them out of the lands of their enemies, and
sanctify myself upon them before the eyes of the many nations. [Eze
39:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#028.md). And they will know that I,
Jehovah, am their God, when I have driven them out to the nations, and
then bring them together again into their land, and leave none of them
there any more. [Eze 39:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#029.md). And I will
not hide my face from them any more, because I have poured out my Spirit
upon the house of Israel, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - The
terrible judgment upon Gog will have this twofold effect as a revelation
of the glory of God - first, Israel will know that the Lord is, and will
always continue to be, its God ([Eze
39:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#022).md); secondly, the heathen will
know that He gave Israel into their power, and thrust it out of its own
land, not from weakness, but to punish it for its faithless apostasy
([Eze 39:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#023.md) and [Eze
39:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#024.md); compare [Eze
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017)..md). עשׂה אתם ([Eze
39:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#024).md), as in [Eze
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027.md), etc. But because this was the
purpose of the Lord with His judgments, He will now bring back the
captives of Israel, and have compassion upon all His people. This turn
of the prophecy in [Eze 39:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#025.md) serves
to introduce the promise to Israel with which the prophecy concerning
Gog and the whole series of prophecies, contained in [Eze
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md) onwards, are brought to a close
([Eze 39:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#025).md). This promise reverts
in 'עתּה אשׁיב וגו to the prophet's own time, to which Ezekiel had
already gone back by mentioning the carrying away of Israel in [Eze
39:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#023.md) and [Eze
39:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#024.md). The restoration of the captives
of Jacob commences with the liberation of Israel from the Babylonian
exile, but is not to be restricted to this. It embraces all the
deliverances which Israel will experience from the termination of the
Babylonian exile till its final gathering out of the nations on the
conversion of the remnant which is still hardened and scattered. לכן,
therefore, sc. because God will prove Himself to be holy in the sight of
the heathen nations by means of the judgment, and will make known to
them that He has punished Israel solely on account of its sins, and
therefore will He restore His people and renew it by His Spirit ([Eze
39:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#029).md). - In what the jealousy of God
for His holy name consists is evident from v.7, and still more plainly
from [Eze 36:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022.md), namely, in the
fact that by means of the judgment He manifests Himself as the holy God.
ונשׂוּ is not to be altered into ונשׁוּ, "they will forget," as Dathe
and Hitzig propose, but is a defective spelling for ונשׂאוּ (like מלוּ
for מלאוּ in [Eze 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#016).md): they will
bear their reproach. The thought is the same as in [Eze
16:54](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#054.md) and [Eze
16:61](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061.md), where the bearing of reproach
is explained as signifying their being ashamed of their sins and their
consequences, and feeling disgust thereat. They will feel this shame
when the Lord grants them lasting peace in their own land. Raschi has
correctly explained it thus: "When I shall have done them good, and not
rewarded them as their iniquity deserved, they will be filled with
shame, so that they will not dare to lift up their face." - [Eze
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#027.md) is only a further expansion of
[Eze 39:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#026.md). For the fact itself,
compare [Eze 36:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023.md); [Eze
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#041.md), etc. And not only will Israel
then be ashamed of its sins, but ([Eze
39:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#028.md), [Eze
39:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#029).md) it will also know that Jehovah
is its God from henceforth and for ever, as was affirmed in [Eze
39:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#022.md), when He shall fully restore to
their own land the people that was thrust into exile, and withdraw His
favour from it no more, because He has poured out His Spirit upon it,
and thereby perfectly sanctified it as His own people (cf. [Eze
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027).md).

The promise with which the prophecy concerning the destruction of Gog is
brought to a close, namely, that in this judgment all nations shall see
the glory of God, and all Israel shall know that henceforth Jehovah will
be their God, and will no more hide His face from them, serves to
confirm the substance of the threat of punishment; inasmuch as it also
teaches that, in the destruction of Gog and his gathering of peoples,
the last attack of the heathen world-power upon the kingdom of God will
be judged and overthrown, so that from that time forth the people of God
will no more have to fear a foe who can disturb its peace and its
blessedness in the everlasting possession of the inheritance given to it
by the Lord. Gog is not only depicted as the last foe, whom the Lord
Himself entices for the purpose of destroying him by miracles of His
almighty power ([Eze 38:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#003.md), [Eze
38:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#019).md), by the fact that his
appearance is assigned to the end of the times, when all Israel is
gathered out of the nations and brought back out of the lands, and
dwells in secure repose in the open and unfortified towns of its own
land ([Eze 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#008.md), [Eze
38:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#011).md); but this may also be
inferred from the fact that the gathering of peoples led by Gog against
Israel belongs to the heathen nations living on the borders of the known
world,since this points to a time when not only will the ancient foes of
the kingdom of God, whose destruction was predicted in Ezekiel 25-32,
have departed from the stage of history and perished, but the boundaries
of Israel will also stretch far beyond the limits of Palestine, to the
vicinity of these hordes of peoples at the remotest extremities on the
north, the east, and the south of the globe. - So much may be gathered
from the contents of our prophecy in relation to its historical
fulfilment. But in order to determine with greater precision what is the
heathen power thus rising up in Gog of Magog against the kingdom of God,
we mut take into consideration the passage in the Apocalypse ([Rev
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#008.md) and [Rev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009).md), where our prophecy is resumed.
Into this, however, we will not further enter till after the exposition
of Ezekiel 40-48, when we shall take up the question as to the
historical realization of the new temple and kingdom of God which
Ezekiel saw.
