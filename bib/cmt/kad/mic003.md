II\. Zion's Deepest Degradation and Highest Exaltation - Micah 3-5

The prophet's second address is of a predominantly Messianic character.
The announcement of the utter desolation of Zion on account of the
corruption of both the civil rulers and the spiritual leaders of the
nation, with which this address opens in [Mic
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md), serves to a certain extent
simply as a foil for the prophecy which follows in [Mic
4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md) and [Mic
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md) of the salvation with which the
remnant of Israel, that has been rescued throughout the judgment, will
be blessed in the future. This salvation is depicted first of all in all
its fulness ([Mic 4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001).md); then in its
gradual development, in the re-erection of the former dominion of the
daughter of Zion, by her redemption out of Babylon, and her victory over
the powers of the world ([Mic 4:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008).md);
and lastly, in its realization by the Ruler proceeding out of Bethlehem,
and by the power and blessing of His rule ([Mic
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001).md).

Sins of the Leaders of the Nation, and Destruction of Jerusalem - [Mic
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md)

The threatening of punishment contained in this chapter is specially
directed against the heads and leaders of Israel, and proclaims, in
three strophes of four verses each, (a) to the princes, who turn right
into wrong and flay the people ([Mic
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)), and (b.md) to the false prophets,
who lead the people astray and confirm them in their sin by lying
prophecies of peace ([Mic 3:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005).md),
retribution for their wicked conduct; and (c) to all three classes of
the divinely-appointed chiefs of the nation - the princes, the priests,
and the prophets - the destruction of Jerusalem, and the turning of Zion
and the temple mountain into a ploughed field and wooded heights on
account of their degeneracy ([Mic
3:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009).md).

[Micah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 3:1</span></span>

First strophe. - [Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md). "And I
said, Hear ye, O heads of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel: Is
it not for you to know the right? [Mic
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002.md). Ye who hate good, and love evil;
who draw off their skin from them, and their flesh from their bones.
[Mic 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003.md). And who have eaten the flesh
of my people, and stripped off their skin from them; and broken their
bones, and cut them in pieces, as if in the pot, and like flesh in the
midst of the caldron. [Mic 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004.md). Then
will they cry to Jehovah, and He will not hearken; and let Him hide His
face from them at the same time, as they have made their actions evil."
By the expression "And I said" (vâ'ōmar), the following address is
indicated as a continuation of the preceding one. The reproofs of this
chapter are also a still further expansion of the woe pronounced in [Mic
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md) upon the godless chiefs of the
nation. The heads of Jacob are addressed, that is to say, the princes of
the tribes and families of Israel, and the qetsı̄nı̄m, lit., deciders
(answering to the Arabic qâḍy, a judge) of the house of Israel, i.e.,
the heads of families and households, upon whom the administration of
justice devolved (cf. [Isa 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010.md); [Isa
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#003).md). הלוא לכן, is it not your duty
and your office to know justice? Da‛ath is practical knowledge, which
manifests itself in practice; mishpât, the public administration of
justice. Instead of this, they do the opposite. The description of this
conduct is appended by participles, in the form of apposition to the
heads and princes addressed in [Mic
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md). Hating good and loving evil refer
to the disposition, and indicate the radical corruption of these men.
רעה, generally misfortune, here evil; hence the Masoretes have altered
it into רע; but the very fact that it deviates from the ordinary rule
shows that it is the original word. Instead of administering justice to
the people, they take off their skin, and tear the flesh from the bones.
The suffixes attached to עורם and שׁארם point back to בּית־ישׂראל in
[Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md). The words answer to the
German expression, "to pull the skin over the ears." In [Mic
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003.md) the expression is still stronger;
but the address is continued in the form of a simple description, and
instead of the participles, אשׁר is used with the finite verb. They not
only flay the people, i.e., rob them of all their means of subsistence,
but even devour them - treat them like cattle, which men first of all
flay, then break their bones, but the flesh into pieces, and boil it in
the pot. In this figure, which is carried out into the most minute
details, we must not give any special meaning to the particular
features, such as that "the skin, and boiling portions, which are cut up
and put into the pot, are figures signifying the pledged clothing and
coveted fields ([Mic 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002.md), [Mic
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008).md)." The prophet paints in very
glaring colours, to make an impression upon the ungodly. Therefore, in
the time of judgment, God will not hear their crying to Him for help,
but will hide His face from them, i.e., withdraw His mercy from them. אז
and בּעה ההיא point back to the evil time announced in [Mic
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003.md). For [Mic
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004.md), compare [Pro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028.md). Veyastēr in [Mic
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004.md) is an optative. The prophet
continues the announcement of the punishment in the form of a desire.
כּאשׁר, as = according to the way in which, as in [Sa1
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#018.md); [Num
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md), etc., i.e., answering to their
evil doings.

[Micah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 3:5</span></span>

In the second strophe, Micah turns from the godless princes and judges
to the prophets who lead the people astray, with whom he contrasts the
true prophets and their ways. [Mic
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005.md). Thus saith Jehovah concerning the
prophets who lead my people astray, who bite with their teeth, and
preach peace; and whoever should put nothing into their mouths, against
him they sanctify war. [Mic 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006.md).
Therefore night to you because of the visions, and darkness to you
because of the soothsaying! and the sun will set over the prophets, and
the day blacken itself over them. [Mic
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007.md). And the seers will be ashamed,
and the soothsayers blush, and all cover their beard, because (there is)
no answer of God. [Mic 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008.md). But I, I
am filled with power, with the Spirit of Jehovah, and with judgment and
strength, to show to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin." As
the first strophe attaches itself to [Mic
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md), so does the second to [Mic
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md) and [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md), carrying out still further what
is there affirmed concerning the false prophets. Micah describes them as
people who predict peace and prosperity for a morsel of bread, and
thereby lead the people astray, setting before them prosperity and
salvation, instead of preaching repentance to them, by charging them
with their sins. Thus they became accomplices of the wicked rulers, with
whom they are therefore classed in [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md), together with the wicked
priests. המּתעים, leading astray (cf. [Isa
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012.md); [Isa
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#015).md) my people, namely, by failing to
charge them with their sins, and preach repentance, as the true prophets
do, and predicting prosperity for bread and payment. The words, "who
bite with their teeth," are to be connected closely with the next
clause, "and they preach peace," in the sense of "who preach peace if
they can bite with their teeth," i.e., if they receive something to bite
(or eat). This explanation, which has already been expressed by the
Chaldee, is necessarily required by the antithesis, "but whoever puts
nothing into their mouth," i.e., gives them nothing to eat,
notwithstanding the fact that in other passages nâshakh only signifies
to bite, in the sense of to wound, and is the word generally applied to
the bite of a snake ([Amo 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019.md); [Gen
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017.md); [Num
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006.md), [Num
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#008).md). If, however, we understand the
biting with the teeth as a figurative representation of the words of the
prophets who always preach prosperity, and of the injury they do to the
real welfare of the people (Ros., Casp., and others), the obvious
antithesis of the two double clauses of [Mic
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005.md) is totally destroyed. The harsh
expression, to "bite with the teeth," in the sense of "to eat," is
perfectly in harmony with the harsh words of [Mic
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002.md) and [Mic
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003.md). Qiddēsh milchâmâh, to sanctify
war, i.e., to preach a holy war (cf. [Joe
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009).md), or, in reality, to proclaim the
vengeance of God. For this shall night and darkness burst upon them.
Night and darkness denote primarily the calamity which would come upon
the false prophets (unto you) in connection with the judgment ([Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004).md). The sun which sets to them is
the sun of salvation or prosperity ([Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009.md); [Jer
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009).md); and the day which becomes black
over them is the day of judgment, which is darkness, and not light ([Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018).md). This calamity is heightened by
the fact that they will then stand ashamed, because their own former
prophecies are thereby proved to be lies, and fresh, true prophecies
fail them, because God gives no answer. "Convicted by the result, they
are thus utterly put to shame, because God does not help them out of
their trouble by any word of revelation" (Hitzig). Bōsh, to be ashamed,
when connected with châphēr (cf. [Jer
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009.md); [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026)., etc..md), signifies to become
pale with shame; châphēr, to blush, with min causae, to denote the thing
of which a man is ashamed. Qōsemı̄m (diviners) alternates with chōzı̄m
(seers), because these false prophets had no visions of God, but only
divinations out of their own hearts. ‛Atâh sâphâm: to cover the beard,
i.e., to cover the face up to the nose, is a sign of mourning ([Lev
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045).md), here of trouble and shame (cf.
[Eze 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017).md), and is really equivalent
to covering the head ([Jer 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#004.md); [Est
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#012).md). Ma‛ănēh, the construct state of
the substantive, but in the sense of the participle; some codd. have
indeed מענה. In [Mic 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008.md) Micah
contrasts himself and his own doings with these false prophets, as being
filled with power by the Spirit of Jehovah (i.e., through His
assistance) and with judgment. Mishpât, governed by מלא, is the divine
justice which the prophet has to proclaim, and gebhūrâh strength,
manliness, to hold up before the people their sins and the justice of
God. In this divine strength he can and must declare their
unrighteousness to all ranks of the people, and predict the punishment
of God ([Mic 3:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009).md).

[Micah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 3:9</span></span>

Third strophe. - [Mic 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009.md). "Hear this,
I pray, O he heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of
Israel, who abhor right, and bend all that is straight. [Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010.md). Building Zion with blood, and
Jerusalem with wickedness. [Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md).
Their heads, they judge for reward; and their priests, they teach for
hire; and their prophets, they divine for money, and lean upon Jehovah,
saying, Is not Jehovah among us? evil will not come upon us." With the
words "Hear this, I pray," the address returns to its starting-point in
[Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md), but only to announce to the
leaders of the people the threat of punishment for which the way has
been prepared by [Mic 3:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002.md). To this
end their God-forgetting conduct is briefly summed up once more in [Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010.md), [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md). The summons to hear is really
attached to the end of [Mic 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008.md). They
are to hear the sin of Jacob ([Mic
3:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009).md); but they are also to hear the
punishment for their sin, to which the word "this" points. The civil
rulers only are addressed in [Mic 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009.md),
- namely, those who were charged with the administration of justice and
of the affairs of the state, but who did the very opposite, who abhorred
justice, and made the straight crooked, because they passed sentence for
bribes ([Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).md). They thereby build
Zion with blood, etc., i.e., obtain the means of erecting splendid
buildings by cruel extortions, and partly also by actual judicial
murders, as Ahab (1 Kings 21 compared with [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016).md), and after him Jehoiakim, had
done ([Jer 22:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013).md). The Chaldeans
built with blood in a different sense ([Hab
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012)). The participle bōneh (building.md)
is also in apposition to râ'shē bēth (heads of the house, etc.), and the
singular without the article is to be taken collectively. They do not,
however, truly build the city by this, they simply labour for its
destruction ([Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012).md). But before
saying this, Micah once more sums up briefly all the sins of the leading
ranks. The teaching of the priests for reward refers to the fact that
they had to give instruction as to the ritual requirements of the law,
and were to do this gratuitously (cf. [Lev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011.md); [Deu
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#011.md); [Deu
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010).md), and that in disputed cases the
judges were to pronounce sentence accordingly. At the same time, these
men (not the prophets merely, but also the priests and the heads of the
nation as the administrators of justice) placed their reliance upon
Jehovah, upon the assurance that He was in the midst of them enthroned
in His temple at Jerusalem, and that He would protect the city and its
inhabitants from misfortune, without ever reflecting that Jehovah as the
Holy One demands sanctification of life, and exterminates the sinners
out of His people.

[Micah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 3:12</span></span>

"Therefore will Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem
become stone heaps, and the mountain of the house become forest
heights." Lâkhēn (therefore) applies primarily to [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md), directing the threat of
punishment by בּגללכם to all the sinners mentioned there; but it also
points back to [Mic 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009.md), [Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010.md), expressing what is there
indicated by "this." Zion is not "the site on which the city stood," or
Jerusalem, "the mass of houses in the city," as Maurer and Caspari
suppose; but Zion is that portion of the city which contained the royal
palace, and Jerusalem the rest of the city (cf. [Mic
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008).md). The mountain of the house, i.e.,
the temple hill, is also specially mentioned, for the purpose of
destroying all false trust in the temple (cf. [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004).md). The predicates are divided
rhetorically, and the thought is this: the royal palace, the city, and
the temple shall be so utterly destroyed, that of all the houses and
palaces only heaps of rubbish will remain, and the ground upon which the
city stood will be partly used as a ploughed field, and partly overgrown
with bushes (cf. [Isa 32:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013).md). On
sâdeh as an accusative of effect (as a field = becoming a field), see
Ewald, 281, e; and for the plural form עיּין, see Ewald, 177, a.
Habbayith (the house) is probably chosen intentionally instead of bēth
Yehōvâh (the house of Jehovah), because the temple ceased to be the
dwelling-place of Jehovah as soon as it was destroyed. Hence in Ezekiel
([Eze 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018.md)., [Eze
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#022)..md) the Schechinah departs before
the Babylonians destroy it. With regard to the fulfilment of this
threat, see the points discussed at [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md).
