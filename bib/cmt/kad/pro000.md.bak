The Book of Proverbs

Introduction

The Book of Proverbs bears the external title ספר משׁלי, which it
derives from the words with which it commences. It is one of the three
books which are distinguished from the other twenty-one by a peculiar
system of accentuation, the best exposition of which that has yet been
given is that by S. Baer,

(Note: Cf. Outlines of Hebrew Accentuation, Prose and Poetical, by Rev.
A. B. Davidson, D.D., Professor of Hebrew, Free Church College,
Edinburgh, 1861, based on Baer's Torath Emeth, Rdelheim 1872.)

as set forth in my larger Psalmen-commentar

(Note: Vol. ii., ed. of 1860, pp. 477-511).

The memorial word for these three books, viz., Job, Mishle (Proverbs),
and Tehillim (Psalms), is אמת, formed from the first letter of the first
word of each book, or, following the Talmudic and Masoretic arrangement
of the books, תאם.

Having in view the superscription משׁלי שׁלמת, with which the book
commences, the ancients regarded it as wholly the composition of
Solomon. The circumstance that it contains only 800 verses, while
according to [Kg1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#012.md) ([Kg1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032).md) Solomon spake 3000 proverbs, R.
Samuel bar-Nachmani explains by remarking that each separate verse may
be divided into two or three allegories or apothegms (e.g., [Pro
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#012).md), not to mention other more
arbitrary modes of reconciling the discrepancy.

(Note: Pesikta, ed. Buber (1868), 34b, 35a. Instead of 800, the Masora
reckons 915 verses in the Book of Proverbs.)

The opinion also of R. Jonathan, that Solomon first composed the
Canticles, then the Proverbs, and last of all Ecclesiastes, inasmuch as
the first corresponds

(Note: Schir-ha-Schirim Rabba, c. i.f. 4a.)

with the spring-time of youth, the second with the wisdom of manhood,
and the third with the disappointment of old age, is founded on the
supposition of the unity of the book and of its Solomonic authorship.

At the present day also there are some, such as Stier, who regard the
Book of Proverbs from first to last as the work of Solomon, just as
Klauss (1832) and Randegger (1841) have ventured to affirm that all the
Psalms without exception were composed by David. But since historical
criticism has been applied to Biblical subjects, that blind submission
to mistaken tradition appears as scarcely worthy of being mentioned. The
Book of Proverbs presents itself as composed of various parts, different
from each other in character and in the period to which they belong.
Under the hands of the critical analysis it resolves itself into a mixed
market of the most manifold intellectual productions of proverbial
poetry, belonging to at least three different epochs.

1\. The External Plan of the Book of Proverbs, and Its Own Testimony as
to Its Origin

The internal superscription of the book, which recommends it, after the
manner of later Oriental books, on account of its importance and the
general utility of its contents, extends from [Pro
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md) to [Pro
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md). Among the moderns this has been
acknowledged by Lwenstein and Maurer; for [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md), which Ewald, Bertheau, and Keil
have added to it, forms a new commencement to the beginning of the book
itself. The book is described as "The Proverbs of Solomon," and then
there is annexed the statement of its object. That object, as summarily
set forth in [Pro 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002.md), is practical,
and that in a twofold way: partly moral, and partly intellectual. The
former is described in [Pro 1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003.md). It
presents moral edification, moral sentiments for acceptance, not merely
to help the unwise to attain to wisdom, but also to assist the wise. The
latter object is set forth in [Pro
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md). It seeks by its contents to
strengthen and discipline the mind to the understanding of thoughtful
discourses generally. In other words, it seeks to gain the moral ends
which proverbial poetry aims at, and at the same time to make familiar
with it, so that the reader, in these proverbs of Solomon, or by means
of them as of a key, learns to understand such like apothegms in
general. Thus interpreted, the title of the book does not say that the
book contains proverbs of other wise men besides those of Solomon; if it
did so, it would contradict itself. It is possible that the book
contains proverbs other than those of Solomon, possible that the author
of the title of the book added such to it himself, but the title
presents to view only the Proverbs of Solomon. If [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md) begins the book, then after
reading the title we cannot think otherwise than that here begin the
Solomonic proverbs. If we read farther, the contents and the form of the
discourses which follow do not contradict this opinion; for both are
worthy of Solomon. So much the more astonished are we, therefore, when
at [Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md) we meet with a new
superscription, משׁלי שׁלמה, from which point on to [Pro
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016.md) there is a long succession of
proverbs of quite a different tone and form - short maxims, Mashals
proper - while in the preceding section of the book we find fewer
proverbs than monitory discourses. What now must be our opinion when we
look back from this second superscription to the part 1:7-9:18, which
immediately follows the title of the book? Are 1:7-9:18, in the sense of
the book, not the "Proverbs of Solomon"? From the title of the book,
which declares them to be so, we must judge that they are. Or are they
"Proverbs of Solomon"? In this case the new superscription ([Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001).md), "The Proverbs of Solomon,"
appears altogether incomprehensible. And yet only one of these two
things is possible: on the one side, therefore, there must be a false
appearance of contradiction, which on a closer investigation disappears.
But on which side is it? If it is supposed that the tenor of the title,
[Pro 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md), does not accord with that
of the section 10:1-22:6, but that it accords well with that of 1:7-9:18
(with the breadth of expression in 1:7-9:18, it has also several
favourite words not elsewhere occurring in the Book of Proverbs; among
these, ערמה, subtilty, and מזמּה, discretion, [Pro
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004).md), then Ewald's view is probable,
that chap. 1-9 is an original whole written at once, and that the author
had no other intention than to give it as an introduction to the larger
Solomonic Book of Proverbs beginning at [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md). But it is also possible that the
author of the title has adopted the style of the section Prov 1:7-9:18.
Bertheau, who has propounded this view, and at the same time has
rejected, in opposition to Ewald, the idea of the unity of the section,
adopts this conclusion, that in 1:8-9:18 there lies before us a
collection of the admonitions of different authors of proverbial poetry,
partly original introductions to larger collections of proverbs, which
the author of the title gathers together in order that he may give a
comprehensive introduction to the larger collection contained in
10:1-22:16. But such an origin of the section as Bertheau thus imagines
is by no means natural; it is more probable that the author, whose
object is, according to the title of the book, to give the proverbs of
Solomon, introduces these by a long introduction of his own, than that,
instead of beginning with Solomon's proverbs, he first presents long
extracts of a different kind from collections of proverbs. If the
author, as Bertheau thinks, expresses indeed, in the words of the title,
the intention of presenting, along with the "Proverbs of Solomon," also
the "words of the wise," then he could not have set about his work more
incorrectly and self-contradictorily than if he had begun the whole,
which bears the superscription "Proverbs of Solomon" (which must be
regarded as presenting the proverbs of Solomon as a key to the words of
the wise generally), with the "words of the wise." But besides the
opinion of Ewald, which in itself, apart from internal grounds, is more
natural and probable than that of Bertheau, there is yet the possibility
of another. Keil, following H. A. Hahn, is of opinion, that in the sense
of the author of the title, the section 1-9 is Solomonic as well as
10-22, but that he has repeated the superscription "Proverbs of Solomon"
before the latter section, because from that point onward proverbs
follow which bear in a special measure the characters of the Mashal
(Hvernick's Einl. iii. 428). The same phenomenon appears in the book of
Isaiah, where, after the general title, there follows an introductory
address, and then in [Isa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md) the
general title is repeated in a shorter form. That this analogy, however,
is here inapplicable, the further discussion of the subject will show.

The introductory section Prov 1:7-9:18, and the larger section
10:1-22:16, which contains uniform brief Solomonic apothegms, are
followed by a third section, 22:17-24:22. Hitzig, indeed, reckons
10:1-24:22 as the second section, but with [Pro
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md) there commences an altogether
different style, and a much freer manner in the form of the proverb; and
the introduction to this new collection of proverbs, which reminds us of
the general title, places it beyond a doubt that the collector does not
at all intend to set forth these proverbs as Solomonic. It may indeed be
possible that, as Keil (iii. 410) maintains, the collector, inasmuch as
he begins with the words, "Incline thine ear and hear words of the
wise," names his own proverbs generally as "words of the wise,"
especially since he adds, "and apply thine heart to my knowledge;" but
this supposition is contradicted by the superscription of a fourth
section, [Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md)., which follows.
This short section, an appendix to the third, bears the superscription,
"These things also are לחכמים." If Keil thinks here also to set aside
the idea that the following proverbs, in the sense of this
superscription, have as their authors "the wise," he does unnecessary
violence to himself. The ל is here that of authorship and if the
following proverbs are composed by the חכמים, "the wise," then they are
not the production of the one חכם, "wise man," Solomon, but they are
"the words of the wise" in contradistinction to "the Proverbs of
Solomon."

The Proverbs of Solomon begin again at [Pro
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md); and this second large section
(corresponding to the first, 10:1-22:16) extends to chap. 29. This fifth
portion of the book has a superscription, which, like that of the
preceding appendix, commences thus: "Also (גּם) these are proverbs of
Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah collected." The meaning
of the word העתּיקוּ is not doubtful. It signifies, like the
Arameo-Arabic נסח, to remove from their place, and denote that the men
of Hezekiah removed from the place where they found them the following
proverbs, and placed them together in a separate collection. The words
have thus been understood by the Greek translator. From the
supplementary words αἱ ἀδιάκριτοι (such as exclude all διάκρισις) it is
seen that the translator had a feeling of the important literary
historical significance of that superscription, which reminds us of the
labours of the poetical grammarians appointed by Pisitratus to edit
older works, such as those of Hesiod. The Jewish interpreters, simply
following the Talmud, suppose that the "also" (גּם) belongs to the whole
superscription, inclusive of the relative sentence, and that it thus
bears witness to the editing of the foregoing proverbs also by Hezekiah
and his companions;

(Note: Vid., B. Bathra, 15a. From the fact that Isaiah outlived Hezekiah
it is there concluded that the Hezekiah-collegium also continued after
Hezekiah's death. Cf. Frst on the Canon of the O.T. 1868, p. 78f.)

which is altogether improbable, for then, if such were the meaning of
the words, "which the men of Hezekiah," etc., they ought to have stood
after [Pro 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md). The superscription
[Pro 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md) thus much rather
distinguishes the following collection from that going before, as having
been made under Hezekiah. As two appendices followed the "Proverbs of
Solomon," 10:1-22:16, so also two appendices the Hezekiah-gleanings of
Solomonic proverbs. The former two appendices, however, originate in
general from the "wise," the latter more definitely name the authors:
the first, chap. 30, is by "Agur the son of Jakeh;" the second, [Pro
31:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md), by a "King Lemuel." In so far
the superscriptions are clear. The name of the authors, elsewhere
unknown, point to a foreign country; and to this corresponds the
peculiar complexion of these two series of proverbs. As a third appendix
to the Hezekiah-collection, [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md). follows, a complete
alphabetical proverbial poem which describes the praiseworthy qualities
of a virtuous woman.

We are thus led to the conclusion that the Book of Proverbs divides
itself into the following parts: - (1) The title of the book, [Pro
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md), by which the question is
raised, how far the book extends to which it originally belongs; (2) the
hortatory discourses, 1:7-9:18, in which it is a question whether the
Solomonic proverbs must be regarded as beginning with these, or whether
they are only the introduction thereto, composed by a different author,
perhaps the author of the title of the book; (3) the first great
collection of Solomonic proverbs, 10:1-22:16; (4) the first appendix to
this first collection, "The words of the wise," 22:17-24:22; (5) the
second appendix, supplement of the words of some wise men, [Pro
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023).; (6.md) the second great
collection of Solomonic proverbs, which the "men of Hezekiah" collected,
chap. 25-29; (7) the first appendix to this second collection, the words
of Agur the son of Makeh, chap. 30; (8) the second appendix, the words
of King Lemuel, [Pro 31:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001); (9.md) third
appendix, the acrostic ode, [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md). These nine parts are
comprehended under three groups: the introductory hortatory discourses
with the general title at their head, and the two great collections of
Solomonic proverbs with their two appendices. In prosecuting our further
investigations, we shall consider the several parts of the book first
from the point of view of the manifold forms of their proverbs, then of
their style, and thirdly of their type of doctrine. From each of these
three subjects of investigation we may expect elucidations regarding the
origin of these proverbs and of their collections.

2\. The Several Parts of the Book of Proverbs with Respect to the
Manifold Forms of the Proverbs

If the Book of Proverbs were a collection of popular sayings, we should
find in it a multitude of proverbs of one line each, as e.g.,
"Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked" ([Sa1
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#013).md); but we seek for such in vain.
At the first glance, [Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md)
appears to be a proverb of one line; but the line "To have respect of
persons in judgment is not good," is only the introductory line of a
proverb which consists of several lines, [Pro
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#024.md). Ewald is right in regarding as
inadmissible a comparison of the collections of Arabic proverbs by
Abu-Obeida, Meidani, and others, who gathered together and expounded the
current popular proverbs, with the Book of Proverbs. Ali's Hundred
Proverbs are, however, more worthy of being compared with it. Like
these, Solomon's proverbs are, as a whole, the production of his own
spirit, and only mediately of the popular spirit. To make the largeness
of the number of these proverbs a matter of doubt were inconsiderate.
Eichhorn maintained that even a godlike genius scarcely attains to so
great a number of pointed proverbs and ingenious thoughts. But if we
distribute Solomon's proverbs over his forty years' reign, then we have
scarcely twenty for each year; and one must agree with the conclusion,
that the composition of so many proverbs even of the highest ingenuity
is no impossible problem for a "godlike genius." When, accordingly, it
is related that Solomon wrote 3000 proverbs, Ewald, in his History of
Israel, does not find the number too great, and Bertheau does not regard
it as impossible that the collection of the "Proverbs of Solomon" has
the one man Solomon as their author. The number of the proverbs thus
cannot determine us to regard them as having for the most part
originated among the people, and the form in which they appear leads to
an opposite conclusion. It is, indeed, probable that popular proverbs
are partly wrought into these proverbs,

(Note: Isaac Euchel (1804), in his Commentary on the Proverbs, regards
[Pro 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004.md) and [Pro
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019) as such popular proverbs..md)

and many of their forms of expression are moulded after the popular
proverbs; but as they thus lie before us, they are, as a whole, the
production of the technical Mashal poetry.

The simplest form is, according to the fundamental peculiarity of the
Hebrew verse, the distich. The relation of the two lines to each other
is very manifold. The second line may repeat the thought of the first,
only in a somewhat altered form, in order to express this thought as
clearly and exhaustively as possible. We call such proverbs synonymous
distichs; as e.g., [Pro 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025.md) :

A soul of blessing is made fat,

And he that watereth others is himself watered.

Or the second line contains the other side of the contrast to the
statement of the first; the truth spoken in the first is explained in
the second by means of the presentation of its contrary. We call such
proverbs antithetic distichs; as e.g., [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md) :

A wise son maketh his father glad,

And a foolish son is his mother's grief.

Similar forms, [Pro 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#016.md); [Pro
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#005.md). Elsewhere, as [Pro
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#014.md); [Pro
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#024.md), the antithesis clothes itself
in the form of a question. sometimes it is two different truths that are
expressed in the two lines; and the authorization of their union lies
only in a certain relationship, and the ground of this union in the
circumstance that two lines are the minimum of the technical proverb -
synthetic distichs; e.g., [Pro 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#018.md) :

A cloak of hatred are lying lips,

And he that spreadeth slander is a fool.

Not at all infrequently one line does not suffice to bring out the
thought intended, the begun expression of which is only completed in the
second. These we call integral (eingedankige) distichs; as e.g., [Pro
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031.md) (cf. [Pe1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018).md):

The righteous shall be recompensed on the earth -

How much more the ungodly and the sinner!

To these distichs also belong all those in which the thought stated in
the first receives in the second, by a sentence presenting a reason, or
proof, or purpose, or consequence, a definition completing or perfecting
it; e.g., [Pro 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014.md); [Pro
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010.md); [Pro
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#020.md); [Pro
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028.md).

(Note: Such integral distichs are also [Pro
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003.md); [Pro
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007.md), [Pro
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010.md); [Pro

17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023.md); [Pro
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#027.md), the second line consists of one
sentence with ל and the infin.; in [Pro
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012.md), [Pro
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#026.md); [Pro

27:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md); [Pro
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#019.md), of one sentence with כּי; with
כּי אם, [Pro 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#002.md); [Pro
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#017.md). The two lines, as [Pro
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031.md); [Pro
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011.md); [Pro
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007.md); [Pro

19:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010.md), [Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md), form a conclusion a minori ad
majus, or the reverse. The former or the latter clauses stand in
grammatical relation in [Pro 23:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#001.md),
[Pro 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#015.md)., [Pro
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022.md); [Pro
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#021.md) (cf. [Pro

24:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#010.md); [Pro
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012.md); [Pro
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#020.md), with hypoth. perf., and [Pro
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#026) with hypoth. fut..md); in the
logical relation of reason and consequence, [Pro
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#014.md); [Pro
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002.md), [Pro
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004.md); in comparative relation, [Pro
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#009.md), etc. These examples show that
the two lines, not merely in the more recent, but also in the old
Solomonic Mashal, do not always consist of two parallel members.)

But there is also a fifth form, which corresponds most to the original
character of the Mashal: the proverb explaining its ethical object by a
resemblance from the region of the natural and every-day life, the
παραβολή proper. The form of this parabolic proverb is very manifold,
according as the poet himself expressly compares the two subjects, or
only places them near each other in order that the hearer or reader may
complete the comparison. The proverb is least poetic when the likeness
between the two subjects is expressed by a verb; as [Pro
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md) (to which, however, [Pro
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#016) belongs.md):

A continual dropping in a rainy day

And a contentious woman are alike.

The usual form of expression, neither unpoetic nor properly poetic, is
the introduction of the comparison by כּ \[as\], and of the similitude
in the second clause by כּן \[so\]; as [Pro
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md) :

As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,

So is the sluggard to them who give him a commission.

This complete verbal statement of the relation of likeness may also be
abbreviated by the omission of the כּן; as [Pro
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013.md); [Pro
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011.md) :

As a dog returning to his vomit -

A fool returning to his folly.

We call the parabolic proverbs of these three forms comparisons. The
last, the abbreviated form of the comparative proverb, which we will
call, in contradistinction to the comparative, the emblematic, in which
the contrast and its emblem are loosely placed together without any
nearer expression of the similitude; as e.g., [Pro
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#020.md); [Pro
27:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#017.md), [Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md). This takes place either by
means of the couplative Vav, ו, as [Pro
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025.md) -

Cold water to a thirsty soul,

And good news from a far country.

(Note: This so-called Vav adaequationis, which appears here for the
first time in the Proverbs as the connection between the figure and the
thing itself without a verbal predicate (cf. on the other hand, [Job
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007.md); [Job
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011.md); [Job
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#011)..md), is, like the Vav, ו, of
comparison, only a species of that Vav of association which is called in
Arab. Waw alajam'a, or Waw alam'ayat, or Waw al'asatsahab (vid., at [Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005).md); and since usage attributes to
it the verbal power of secum habere, it is construed with the accus.
Vid., examples in Freytag's Arabum Proverbia, among the recent proverbs
beginning with the Arabic letter k.)

Or without the Vav; in which case the second line is as the subscription
under the figure or double figure painted in the first; e.g., [Pro
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011.md)., [Pro
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022.md) :

A gold ring in a swine's snout -

A fair woman without understanding.

These ground-forms of two lines, can, however, expand into forms of
several lines. Since the distich is the peculiar and most appropriate
form of the technical proverb, so, when two lines are not sufficient for
expressing the thought intended, the multiplication to four, six, or
eight lines is most natural. In the tetrastich the relation of the last
two to the first two is as manifold as is the relation of the second
line to the first in the distich. There is, however, no suitable example
of four-lined stanzas in antithetic relation. But we meet with
synonymous tetrastichs, e.g., [Pro
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#015.md)., [Pro
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#003.md)., 28f.; synthetic, [Pro
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md).; integral, [Pro
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md)., especially of the form in
which the last two lines constitute a proof passage beginning with כּי,
[Pro 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md)., or פּן, [Pro
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024.md)., or without exponents, [Pro
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026.md).; comparative without expressing
the comparison, [Pro 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016.md). (cf. on
the other hand, [Pro 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#018.md)., where the
number of lines is questionable), and also the emblematical, [Pro
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#004.md).:

Take away the dross from the silver,

And there shall come forth a vessel for the goldsmith;

Take away the wicked from before the king,

And this throne shall be established in righteousness.

Proportionally the most frequently occurring are tetrastichs, the second
half of which forms a proof clause commencing with כּי or פּן. Among the
less frequent are the six-lined, presenting ([Pro
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#001.md); [Pro
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011)..md) one and the same thought in
manifold aspects, with proofs interspersed. Among all the rest which are
found in the collection, [Pro
23:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#012.md), [Pro
23:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#019.md), [Pro
23:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#026.md); [Pro
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md)., [Pro
30:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#029.md), the first two lines form a
prologue introductory to the substance of the proverb; as e.g., [Pro
23:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#012.md) :

O let instruction enter into thine heart,

And apply thine ears to the words of knowledge.

Withhold not correction from the child;

For if thou beatest him with the rod - he dies not.

Thou shalt beat him with the rod,

And deliver his soul from hell.

Similarly formed, yet more expanded, is the eight-lined stanza, [Pro
23:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#022.md) :

Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,

And despise not thy mother when she is old.

Buy the truth and sell it not:

Wisdom, and virtue, and understanding.

The father of a righteous man greatly rejoices,

And he that begetteth a wise child hath joy of him.

Thy father and thy mother shall be glad,

And she that bare thee shall rejoice.

The Mashal proverb here inclines to the Mashal ode; for this octastich
may be regarded as a short Mashal song, - like the alphabetical Mashal
Psalm 37, which consists of almost pure tetrastichs.

We have now seen how the distich form multiplies itself into forms
consisting of four, six, and eight lines; but it also unfolds itself, as
if in one-sided multiplication, into forms of three, five, and seven
lines. Tristichs arise when the thought of the first line is repeated
([Pro 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022).md) in the second according
to the synonymous scheme, or when the thought of the second line is
expressed by contrast in the third ([Pro
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029.md); [Pro
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#010).md) according to the antithetic
scheme, or when to the thought expressed in one or two lines ([Pro
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#008.md); [Pro
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#010).md) there is added its proof. The
parabolic scheme is here represented when the object described is
unfolded in two lines, as in the comparison [Pro
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013.md), or when its nature is portrayed
by two figures in two lines, as in the emblematic proverb [Pro
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020.md) :

To take off clothing in cold weather,

Vinegar upon nitre,

And he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.

In the few instances of pentastichs which are found, the last three
lines usually unfold the reason of the thought of the first two: [Pro
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#004.md)., [Pro
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006.md)., [Pro
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032.md).; to this [Pro
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#013.md) forms an exception, where the
כּן before the last three lines introduces the expansion of the figure
in the first two. As an instance we quote [Pro
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006.md).:

Seek not to display thyself in the presence of the king,

And stand not in the place of the great.

For better that it be said unto thee, "Come up hither,"

Than that they humble thee in the presence of the prince,

While thine eyes have raised themselves.

Of heptastichs I know of only one example in the collection, viz., [Pro
23:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006.md) :

Eat not the bread of the jealous,

And lust not after his dainties;

For he is like one who calculates with himself: -

"Eat and drink," saith he to thee,

And his heart is not with thee.

Thy morsel which thou hast eaten must thou vomit up,

And thou hast wasted thy pleasant words.

From this heptastich, which one will scarcely take for a brief Mashal
ode according to the compound strophe-scheme, we see that the proverb of
two lines can expand itself to the dimensions of seven and eight lines.
Beyond these limits the whole proverb ceases to be משׁל in the proper
sense; and after the manner of Ps 25; 34, and especially chap. 37, it
becomes a Mashal ode. Of this class of Mashal odes are, besides the
prologue, [Pro 22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md), that of the
drunkard, [Pro 23:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#029.md); that of the
slothful man, [Pro 24:30-34](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#030.md); the
exhortation to industry, [Pro
27:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md); the prayer for a moderate
portion between poverty and riches, [Pro
30:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007.md); the mirror for princes, [Pro
31:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#002.md); and the praise of the
excellent wife, [Pro 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md). It is
singular that this ode furnishes the only example of the alphabetical
acrostic in the whole collection. Even a single trace of original
alphabetical sequence afterwards broken up cannot be found. There cannot
also be discovered, in the Mashal songs referred to, anything like a
completed strophe-scheme; even in [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md). the distichs are broken by
tristichs intermingled with them.

In the whole of the first part, Prov 1:7-9:18, the prevailing form is
that of the extended flow of the Mashal song; but one in vain seeks for
strophes. There is not here so firm a grouping of the lines; on the
supposition of its belonging to the Solomonic era, this is indeed to be
expected. The rhetorical form here outweighs the purely poetical. This
first part of the Proverbs consists of the following fifteen Mashal
strains: (1) [Pro 1:7-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007), (2.md) [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020)., (3) chap. 2, (4) 3:1-18, (5.md)
[Pro 3:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019), (6.md) [Pro
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027)., (7) 4:1-5:6, (8.md) [Pro
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#007)., (9.md) [Pro
6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001), (10.md) [Pro
6:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006), (11.md) [Pro
6:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012), (12.md) [Pro
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020)., (13) chap. 7, (14.md) chap. 8,
(15) chap. 9. In chap. 3 and chap. 9 there are found a few Mashal odes
of two lines and of four lines which may be regarded as independent
Mashals, and may adapt themselves to the schemes employed; other brief
complete parts are only waves in the flow of the larger discourses, or
are altogether formless, or more than octastichs. The octastich [Pro
6:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md) makes the proportionally
greatest impression of an independent inwoven Mashal. It is the only
proverb in which symbolical numbers are used which occurs in the
collection from 1 to 29:

There are six things which Jahve hateth,

And seven are an abhorrence to His soul:

Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,

And hands that shed innocent blood;

An heart that deviseth the thoughts of evil,

Feet that hastily run to wickedness,

One that uttereth lies as a false witness,

And he who soweth strife between brethren.

Such numerical proverbs to which the name מדּה has been given by later
Jewish writers (see my Gesch. der Jd. Poesie, pp. 199, 202) are found in
chap. 30. With the exception of [Pro
30:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007.md), [Pro
30:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024) (cf. Sir. 25:1, 2.md), the
numerical proverb has this peculiarity, found also in most of the
numerical proverbs of Sirach (Sir. 23:16; 25:7; 26:5, 28), that the
number named in the first parallel line is in the second (cf. [Job
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#009).md) increased by one. On the other
hand, the form of the Priamel

(Note: From praeambulum, designating a peculiar kind of epigram found in
the German poetry of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.)

is used neither in the Book of Proverbs nor in that of Sirach. Proverbs
such as [Pro 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010.md) ("Diverse weights,
diverse measures - an abomination to Jahve are they both") and [Pro
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#012.md) ("The hearing ear, the seeing
eye - Jahve hath created them both"), to be distinguished from [Pro
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003.md); [Pro
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021.md), and the like, where the
necessary unity, and from [Pro 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#003.md),
where the necessary resemblance, of the predicate is wanting, are only a
weak approach to the Priamel - a stronger, [Pro
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003.md), where the three subjects form
the preamble ("The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the
heart of kings - are unsearchable"). Perhaps [Pro
30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#011.md) is a greater mutilated
Priamel. Here four subjects form the preamble, but there is wanting the
conclusion containing the common predicate. This, we believe, exhausts
the forms of the Mashal in the collection. It now only remains to make
mention of the Mashal chain, i.e., the ranging together in a series of
proverbs of a similar character, such as the chain of proverbs regarding
the fool, [Pro 26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001.md), the sluggard,
[Pro 26:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#013.md), the tale-bearer, [Pro
26:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#020.md), the malicious, [Pro
26:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#023.md) - but this form belongs more
to the technics of the Mashal collection than to that of the Mashal
poetry.

We now turn to the separate parts of the book, to examine more closely
the forms of their proverbs, and gather materials for a critical
judgment regarding the origin of the proverbs which they contain. Not to
anticipate, we take up in order the separate parts of the arrangement of
the collection. Since, then, it cannot be denied that in the
introductory paedagogic part, [Pro
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md), notwithstanding its rich and
deep contents, there is exceedingly little of the technical form of the
Mashal, as well as generally of technical form at all. This part, as
already shown, consist not of proper Mashals, but of fifteen Mashal
odes, or rather, perhaps, Mashal discourses, didactic poems of the
Mashal kind. In the flow of these discourses separate Mashals
intermingle, which may either be regarded as independent, or, as [Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032.md); [Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018.md)., can easily be so understood. In
the Mashal chains of chap. 4 and chap. 9 we meet with proverbs that are
synonymous ([Pro 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md), [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010).md), antithetic ([Pro
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035.md); [Pro
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008).md), integral, or of one thought
([Pro 3:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029).md), and synthetic ([Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md); [Pro
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#005.md), [Pro
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007).md), of two lines and of four lines
variously disposed ([Pro 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md)., 11f.,
31f., 33f.); but the parabolic scheme is not at all met with, separate
proverbs such as [Pro 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md). are
altogether without form, and keeping out of view the octastich numerical
proverb, [Pro 6:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md), the thoughts
which form the unity of separate groups are so widely expanded that the
measure of the Mashal proper is far exceeded. The character of this
whole part is not concentrating, but unfolding. Even the intermingling
proverbs of two lines possess the same character. They are for the most
part more like dissolved drops than gold coins with sharp outline and
firm impress; as e.g., [Pro 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md) :

He that correcteth the mocker getteth to himself shame;

And he that rebuketh the sinner his dishonour.

The few that consist of four lines are closer, more compact, more
finished, because they allow greater space for the expression; e.g.,
[Pro 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md).:

Honour Jahve with thy wealth,

And with the first-fruits of all thine income:

And thy barns shall be filled with plenty,

And thy vats shall overflow with must.

But beyond the four lines the author knows no limits of artistic
harmony; the discourse flows on till it has wholly or provisionally
exhausted the subject; it pauses not till it reaches the end of its
course, and then, taking breath, it starts anew. We cannot, moreover,
deny that there is beauty in this new springing forth of the stream of
the discourse with its fresh transparent waves; but it is a peculiar
beauty of the rhetorically decomposed, dissolved Mashal, going forth, as
it were, from its confinement, and breathing its fragrance far and wide.

The fifteen discourses, in which the Teacher appears twelve times and
Wisdom three times, are neither of a symmetrically chiselled form nor of
internally fashioned coherence, but yet are a garland of songs having
internal unity, with a well-arranged manifoldness of contents. It is
true that Bertheau recognises here neither unity of the contents nor
unity of the formal character; but there is no Old Testament portion of
like extent, and at the same time of more systematic internal unity, and
which bears throughout a like formal impress, than this. Bertheau thinks
that he has discovered in certain passages a greater art in the form;
and certainly there are several sections which consist of just ten
verses. But this is a mere accident; for the first Mashal ode consists
of groups of 1, 2, and 10 verses, the second of 8 and 6 verses, the
third of 10 and 12, the fourth of 10 and 8, the fifth of 2 and 6, etc. -
each group forming a complete sense. The 10 verses are met with six
times, and if [Pro 4:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001.md) from the
Peshito, and [Pro 4:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#020.md) from the
lxx, are included, eight times, without our regarding these decades as
strophes, and without our being able to draw any conclusion regarding a
particular author of these decade portions. In [Pro
1:20-33](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md), Bertheau finds indeed, along
with the regular structure of verses, an exact artistic formation of
strophes (3 times 4 verses with an echo of 2). But he counts instead of
the stichs the Masoretic verses, and these are not the true formal parts
of the strophe.

We now come to the second part of the collection, whose superscription
משׁלי שׁלמה can in no respect be strange to us, since the collection of
proverbs here commencing, compared with [Pro
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md), may with special right bear the
name Mishle. The 375 proverbs which are classed together in this part,
chap. 10-22:16, without any comprehensive plan, but only according to
their more or fewer conspicuous common characteristics (Bertheau, p.
xii), consist all and every one of distichs; for each Masoretic verse
falls naturally into two stichs, and nowhere (not even [Pro
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019).md) does such a distich proverb
stand in necessary connection with one that precedes or that follows;
each is in itself a small perfected and finished whole. The tristich
[Pro 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007.md) is only an apparent
exception. In reality it is a distich with the disfigured remains of a
distich that has been lost. The lxx has here two distichs which are
wanting in our text. The second is that which is found in our text, but
only in a mutilated form:

ὁ πολλὰ κακοποιῶν τελεσιουργεὶ κακίαν,

\[He that does much harm perfects mischief,\]

ὅς δέ ἐρεθίζει λόγους οὐ σωθήσεται.

\[And he that uses provoking words shall not escape.\]

Perhaps the false rendering of

מרע רבים ישׁלם־רע

מרדף אמרים לא ימלט׃

The friend of every one is rewarded with evil,

He who pursues after rumours does not escape.

But not only are all these proverbs distichs, they have also, not indeed
without exception, but in by far the greatest number, a common character
in that they are antithetic. Distichs of predominating antithetic
character stand here together. Along with these all other schemes are,
it is true, represented: the synonymous, [Pro

11:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022.md); besides which I know not what
other Bertheau could quote. We shall further see that in another portion
of the book the parabolic proverbs are just as closely placed together
as are the antithetic. Here almost universally the two members of the
proverbs stand together in technical parallelism as thesis and
antithesis; also in the synonymous proverbs the two members are the
parallel rays of one thought; in the synthetic two monostichs occur in
loose external connection to suffice for the parallelism as a
fundamental law of the technical proverb. But also in these proverbs in
which a proper parallelism is not found, both members being needed to
form a complete sentence, verse and members are so built up, according
to Bertheau's self-confirmatory opinion, that in regard to extent and
the number of words they are like verses with parallel members.

To this long course of distichs which profess to be the Mishle of
Solomon, there follows a course, Prov 22:17-24:22, of "words of the
wise," prefaced by the introduction [Pro
22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md), which undeniably is of the
same nature as the greater introduction, [Pro
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md), and of which we are reminded by
the form of address preserved throughout in these "words of the wise."
These "words of the wise" comprehend all the forms of the Mashal, from
those of two lines in [Pro 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028.md); [Pro
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#009.md); [Pro
24:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#007.md), to the Mashal song [Pro
23:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#029.md). Between these limits are the
tetrastichs, which are the most popular form, [Pro
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md)., [Pro
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024.md)., [Pro
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026.md)., [Pro
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#010.md)., [Pro
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#015.md)., [Pro
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#017.md)., [Pro
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#001.md)., [Pro

24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017.md)., [Pro
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#019.md)., [Pro
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#021.md). - pentastichs, [Pro
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#004.md)., [Pro
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#013.md)., and hexastichs, [Pro
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#001.md), [Pro
23:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#012.md), [Pro
23:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#019.md), [Pro
23:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#026.md); [Pro
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md).; - of tristichs, heptastichs,
and octastichs are at least found one specimen of each, [Pro
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029.md); [Pro
23:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006.md), [Pro
23:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#022.md). Bertheau maintains that
there is a difference between the structure of these proverbs and that
of the preceding, for he counts the number of the words which constitute
a verse in the case of the latter and of the former; but such a
proceeding is unwarrantable, for the remarkably long Masoretic verse
[Pro 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012.md) contains eighteen words;
and the poet is not to be made accountable for such an arrangement, for
in his mind [Pro 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md). forms a
hexastich, and indeed a very elegant one. Not the words of the Masoretic
verse, but the stichs are to be counted. Reckoning according to the
stichs, I can discover no difference between these proverbs and the
preceding. In the preceding ones also the number of the words in the
stichs extends from two to five, the number two being here, however,
proportionally more frequently found (e.g., [Pro
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#004.md), [Pro
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008.md), [Pro
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#010).md); a circumstance which has its
reason in this, that the symmetry of the members is often very much
disturbed, there being frequently no trace whatever of parallelism. To
the first appendix to the "Proverbs of Solomon" there follows a second,
[Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md)., with the superscription,
"These things also to the wise," which contains a hexastich, [Pro
24:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md), a distich, [Pro
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#026.md), a tristich, [Pro
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#027.md), a tetrastich, [Pro
24:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#028.md)., and a Mashal ode, [Pro
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#030.md)., on the sluggard - the last in
the form of an experience, of the poet like [Psa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md). The moral which he has drawn
from this recorded observation is expressed in two verses such as we
have already found at [Pro 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010.md). These
two appendices are, as is evident from their commencement as well as
from their conclusion, in closest relation to the introduction, [Pro
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md).

There now follows in chap. 25-29 the second great collection of
"Proverbs of Solomon," "copied out," as the superscription mentions, by
the direction of King Hezekiah. It falls, apparently, into two parts;
for as [Pro 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#030.md)., a Mashal hymn
stands at the end of the two appendices, so that the Mashal hymn [Pro
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md). must be regarded as forming the
division between the two halves of this collection. It is very sharply
distinguished from the collection beginning with chap. 10. The extent of
the stichs and the greater or less observance of the parallelism furnish
no distinguishing mark, but there are others worthy of notice. In the
first collection the proverbs are exclusively in the form of distichs;
here we have also some tristichs, [Pro
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#008.md), [Pro
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013.md), [Pro
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020.md); [Pro
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#010.md), [Pro
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022.md); [Pro
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#010.md), tetrastichs, [Pro
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#004.md)., [Pro
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#009.md)., [Pro
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021.md)., [Pro
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#018.md)., [Pro
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024.md)., [Pro
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md)., and pentastichs, [Pro
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006.md)., besides the Mashal hymn already
referred to. The kind of arrangement is not essentially different from
that in the first collection; it is equally devoid of plan, yet there
are here some chains or strings of related proverbs, [Pro
26:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001.md) -16, 20-22. A second essential
distinction between the two collections is this, that while in the first
the antithetic proverb forms the prevailing element, here is it the
parabolic, and especially the emblematic; in chap. 25-27 are sentences
almost wholly of this character. We say almost, for to place together
proverbs of this kind exclusively is not the plan of the collector.
There are also proverbs of the other schemes, fewer synonymous, etc.,
than antithetic, and the collection begins in very varied quodlibet:
[Pro 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002.md), an antithetic proverb; [Pro
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003.md), a priamel with three subjects;
[Pro 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#004.md)., an emblematic tetrastich;
[Pro 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006.md)., a pentastich; [Pro
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#008.md), a tristich; [Pro
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#009.md)., a tetrastich, with the negative
פן; [Pro 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011.md), an emblematic distich
("Golden apples in silver caskets - a word spoken in a fitting way").
The antithetic proverbs are found especially in chap. 28 and 29: the
first and the last proverb of the whole collection, [Pro
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002.md); [Pro
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#027.md), are antithetic; but between
these two the comparative and the figurative proverbs are so prevalent,
that this collection appears like a variegated picture-book with
explanatory notes written underneath. In extent it is much smaller than
the foregoing. I reckon 126 proverbs in 137 Masoretic verses.

The second collection of Solomon's proverbs has also several appendices,
the first of which, chap. 30, according to the inscription, is by an
otherwise unknown author, Agur the son of Jakeh. The first poem of this
appendix present in a thoughtful way the unsearchableness of God. This
is followed by certain peculiar pieces, such as a tetrastich regarding
the purity of God's word, [Pro 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005.md).;
a prayer for a moderate position between riches and poverty, [Pro
30:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007.md); a distich against slander,
[Pro 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010.md); a priamel without the
conclusion, [Pro 30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#011.md); the
insatiable four (a Midda), [Pro
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md).; a tetrastich regarding the
disobedient son, [Pro 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md), the
incomprehensible four, [Pro 30:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018.md);
the intolerable four, [Pro 30:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021.md);
the diminutive but prudent four, [Pro
30:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024.md); the excellent four, [Pro
30:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#029.md); a pentastich recommending
prudent silence, [Pro 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032.md). Two other
supplements form the conclusion of the whole book: the counsel of
Lemuel's mother to her royal son, [Pro
31:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#002.md), and the praise of the virtuous
woman in the form of an alphabetical acrostic, [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md).

After we have acquainted ourselves with the manifold forms of the
technical proverbs and their distribution in the several parts of the
collection, the question arises, What conclusions regarding the origin
of these several parts may be drawn from these forms found in them? We
connect with this the conception of Ewald, who sees represented in the
several parts of the collection the chief points of the history of
proverbial poetry. The "Proverbs of Solomon," Prov 10:1-22:16, appear to
him to be the oldest collection, which represents the simplest and the
most ancient kind of proverbial poetry. Their distinguishing
characteristics are the symmetrical two-membered verse, complete in
itself, containing in itself a fully intelligible meaning, and the quick
contrast of thesis and antithesis. The oldest form of the technical
proverb, according to Ewald, is, according to our terminology, the
antithetic distich, such as predominates in 10:1-22:16. Along with these
antithetic distichs we find here also others of a different kind. Ewald
so considers the contrast of the two members to be the original
fundamental law of the technical proverb, that to him these other kinds
of distichs represent the diminution of the inner force of the
two-membered verse, the already begun decay of the art in its oldest
limits and laws, and the transition to a new method. In the "Proverbs of
Solomon," chap. 25-29, of the later collection, that rigorous formation
of the verse appears already in full relaxation and dissolution: the
contrast of the sense of the members appears here only exceptionally;
the art turns from the crowded fulness and strength of the
representation more to the adorning of the thought by means of strong
and striking figures and forms of expression, to elegant painting of
certain moral conditions and forms of life; and the more the technical
proverb is deprived of the breath of a vigorous poetic spirit, so much
the nearer does it approach to the vulgar proverb; the full and complete
symmetry of the two members disappears, less by the abridgment of one of
them, than by the too great extension and amplification of the
two-membered proverb into longer admonitions to a moral life, and
descriptions relating thereto. So the proverbial poetry passes
essentially into a different form and manner. "While it loses in regard
to internal vigorous brevity and strength, it seeks to gain again by
means of connected instructive exposition, by copious description and
detailed representation; breaking up its boldly delineated, strong, and
yet simply beautiful form, it rises to oratorical display, to attractive
eloquence, in which, indeed, though the properly poetical and the
artistic gradually disappears, yet the warmth and easy comprehension are
increased." In chap. 1-9, the introduction of the older collection, and
[Pro 22:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md), of the first half of
the supplement to the older collection (chap. 25-29 is the second half),
supplied by a later writer, the great change is completed, the growth of
which the later collection of the "Proverbs of Solomon," particularly in
chap. 25-29, reveals. The symmetry of the two members of the verse is
here completely destroyed; the separate proverb appears almost only as
an exception; the proverbial poetry has passed into admonition and
discourse, and has become in many respects lighter, and more flexible,
and flowing, and comprehensible. "It is true that on the side of this
later form of proverbial poetry there is not mere loss. While it always
loses the excellent pointed brevity, the inner fulness and strength of
the old proverbs, it gains in warmth, impressiveness, intelligibility;
the wisdom which at first strives only to make its existence and its
contents in endless manifoldness known, reaches this point at last, that
having become clear and certain, it now also turns itself earnestly and
urgently to men." In the later additions, chap. 30-31, appended
altogether externally, the proverbial poetry has already disappeared,
and given place to elegant descriptions of separate moral truths. While
the creative passes into the background, the whole aim is now toward
surprising expansion and new artistic representation.

This view of the progressive development of the course of proverbial
poetry is one of the chief grounds for the determination of Ewald's
judgment regarding the parts that are Solomonic and those that are not
Solomonic in the collection. In Prov 10:1-22:16 he does not regard the
whole as Solomon's, as immediately and in their present form composed by
Solomon; but the breath of the Solomonic spirit enlivens and pervades
all that has been added by other and later poets. But most of the
proverbs of the later collection (chap. 25-29) are not much older than
the time of Hezekiah; yet there are in it some that are Solomonic, and
of the period next to Solomon. The collection stretches backward with
its arms, in part indeed, as the superscription, the "Proverbs of
Solomon," shows, to the time of Solomon. On the other hand, in the
introduction, chap. 1-9, and in the first half of the appendix ([Pro
22:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017).md), there is not found a single
proverb of the time of Solomon; both portions belong to two poets of the
seventh century b.c., a new era, in which the didactic poets added to
the older Solomonic collection longer pieces of their own composition.
The four small pieces, [Pro 30:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md),
15-33; [Pro 31:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md)., are of a still
later date; they cannot belong to an earlier period than the end of the
seventh or the beginning of the sixth century b.c.

We recognise the penetration, the sensibility, the depth of thought
indicated by this opinion of Ewald's regarding the origin of the book;
yet for the most part it is not supported by satisfactory proof. If we
grant that he has on the whole rightly construed the history of
proverbial poetry, nevertheless the conclusion that proverbs which bear
in themselves the marks of the oldest proverbial poetry belong to the
Solomonic era, and that the others belong to a period more nearly or
more remotely subsequent to it, is very fallacious. In this case much
that is found in Sirach's Book of Proverbs must be Solomonic; and the
משׁלי אסף of Isaac Satanow,

(Note: Isaac Ha-Levi was born at Satanow (whence his name), in Russian
Poland, 1732, died at Berlin 1802. Besides other works, he was the
author of several collections of gnomes and apothegms in imitation of
the Proverbs. Vid., Delitzsch Zur Gesch. der Jd. Poesie, p. 115.)

the contemporary of Moses Mendelssohn, as well as many other proverbs in
the collection מלין דרבנן, and in the poetical works of other Jewish
poets belonging to the middle ages or to later times, might be dated
back perhaps a thousand years. Along with the general course of
development the individuality of the poet is also to be taken into
account; an ancient poet can, along with the formally completed, produce
the imperfect, which appears to belong to a period of art that has
degenerated, and a modern poet can emulate antiquity with the greatest
accuracy. But Ewald's construction of the progress of the development of
proverbial poetry is also in part arbitrary. That the two-membered verse
is the oldest form of the technical proverb we shall not dispute, but
that it is the two-membered antithetic verse is a supposition that
cannot be proved; and that Solomon wrote only antithetic distichs is an
absurd assertion, to which Keil justly replies, that the adhering to
only one form and structure is a sign of poverty, of mental narrowness
and one-sidedness. There are also other kinds of parallelism, which are
not less beautiful and vigorous than the antithetic, and also other
forms of proverbs besides the distich in which the thought, which can in
no way be restrained within two lines, must necessarily divide itself
into the branches of a greater number of lines. Thus I must agree with
Keil in the opinion, that Ewald's assertion that in the
Hezekiah-collection the strong form of the technical proverb is in full
dissolution, contains an exaggeration. If the first collection, Prov
10:1-22:16, contains only two ([Pro
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md); [Pro
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022).md) figurative proverbs, while it
would be altogether foolish to deny that these two, because they were
figurative proverbs, were Solomonic, or to affirm that he was the author
of only these two, so it is self-evident that the Hezekiah-collection,
which is principally a collection of figurative proverbs, must contain
many proverbs in which a different kind of parallelism prevails, which
has the appearance of a looser connection. Is it not probable that
Solomon, who had an open penetrating eye for the greatest and the
smallest objects of nature, composed many such proverbs? And is e.g.,
the proverb [Pro 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#023.md),

Dross of silver spread over a potsherd -

Burning lips and a wicked heart,

less beautiful, and vigorous, and worthy of Solomon than any antithetic
distich? If Ewald imagines that the 3000 proverbs which Solomon wrote
were all constructed according to this one model, we are much rather
convinced that Solomon's proverbial poetry, which found the distich and
the tetrastich as forms of proverbs already in use, would not only
unfold within the limits of the distich the most varied manifoldness of
thought and form, but would also within the limits of the Mashal
generally, run through the whole scale from the distich up to octastichs
and more extensive forms. But while we cannot accept Ewald's criteria
which he applies to the two collections, Prov 10:1-22:16 and chap 25-29,
yet his delineation of the form and kind of proverbial poetry occurring
in chap. 1-9, [Pro 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md)., is
excellent, as is also his conclusion, that these portions belong to a
new and more recent period of proverbial poetry. Since in [Pro
22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md) manifestly a new course of
"Words of the Wise" by a poet later than Solomon is introduced, it is
possible, yea, not improbable, that he, or, as Ewald thinks, another
somewhat older poet, introduces in 1:7-9:18 the "Proverbs of Solomon"
following from [Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md) onward.

But if Solomon composed not only distichs, but also tristichs, etc., it
is strange that in the first collection, chap. 10-22:16, there are
exclusively distichs; and if he constructed not only contrasted
proverbs, but equally figurative proverbs, it is as strange that in the
first collection the figurative proverbs are almost entirely wanting,
while in the second collection, chap. 25-29, on the contrary, they
prevail. This remarkable phenomenon may be partly explained if we could
suppose that not merely the second collection but both of them, were
arranged by the "men of Hezekiah," and that the whole collection of the
Solomonic proverbs was divided by them into two collections according to
their form. But leaving out of view other objections, one would in that
case have expected in the first collection the proportionally great
number of the antithetic distichs which stand in the second. If we
regard both collections as originally one whole, then there can be no
rational ground for its being divided in this particular way either by
the original collector or by a later enlarger of the collection. We have
therefore to regard the two portions as the work of two different
authors. The second is by the "men of Hezekiah;" the first cannot be by
Solomon himself, since the number of proverbs composed, and probably
also written out by Solomon, amounted to 3000; besides, if Solomon was
the author of the collection, there would be visible on it the stamp of
his wisdom in its plan and order: it is thus the work of another author,
who is certainly different from the author of the introductory Mashal
poems, Prov 1:7-9:18. For if the author of the title of the book were
not at the same time the author of the introduction, he must have taken
it from some other place; thus it is inconceivable how he could give the
title "Proverbs of Solomon," etc., [Pro
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md), to poems which were not
composed by Solomon. If 1:7-9:18 is not by Solomon, then these Mashal
poems are explicable only as the work of the author of the title of the
book, and as an introduction to the "Proverbs of Solomon," beginning
[Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md). It must be one and the same
author who edited the "Proverbs of Solomon" 10:1-22:16, prefixed
1:7-9:18 as an introduction to them, and appended to them the "Words of
the Wise," 22:17-24:22; the second collector then appended to this book
a supplement of the "Words of the Wise," [Pro
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md)., and then the
Hezekiah-collection of Solomonic proverbs, chap. 25-29; perhaps also, in
order that the book might be brought to a close in the same form in
which it was commenced, he added

(Note: Zckler takes [Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md). as a
second appendix to the first principal collection. This is justifiable,
but the second superscription rather suggests two collectors.)

the non-Solomonic proverbial poem chap. 30 f. We do not, however,
maintain that the book has this origin, but only this, that on the
supposition of the non-Solomonic origin of 1:7-9:18 it cannot well have
any other origin. But the question arises again, and more emphatically,
How was it possible that the first collector left as gleanings to the
second so great a number of distichs, almost all parabolical, and
besides, all more than two-lined proverbs of Solomon? One can scarcely
find the reason of this singular phenomenon in anything else than in the
judgment of the author of the first collection as the determining motive
of his selection. For when we think also on the sources and origin of
the two collections, the second always presupposes the first, and that
which is singular in the author's thus restricting himself can only have
its ground in the freedom which he allowed to his subjectivity.

Before we more closely examine the style and the teaching of the book,
and the conclusions thence arising, another phenomenon claims our
attention, which perhaps throws light on the way in which the several
collections originated; but, at all events, it may not now any longer
remain out of view, when we are in the act of forming a judgment on this
point.

3\. The Repetitions in the Book of Proverbs

We find not only in the different parts of the collection, but also
within the limits of one and the same part, proverbs which wholly or in
part are repeated in the same or in similar words. Before we can come to
a judgment, we must take cognizance as closely as possible of this fact.
We begin with "The Proverbs of Solomon," chap. 10-22:16; for this
collection is in relation to chap. 25-29 certainly the earlier, and it
is especially with respect to the Solomonic proverbs that this fact
demands an explanation. In this earlier collection we find, (1) whole
proverbs repeated in exactly the same words: [Pro
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#012.md) = [Pro
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#025); - (2.md) proverbs slightly changed

19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025.md) with [Pro
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011.md). In comparing these proverbs,
one will perceive that for the most part the external or internal
resemblance of the surrounding has prompted the collector to place the
one proverb in this place and the other in that place (not always
indeed; for what reason e.g., could determine the position of [Pro
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#025.md) and [Pro
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005.md), [Pro
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009), I cannot say.md); then that the
proverb standing earlier is generally, to all appearance, also the
earlier formed, for the second of the pair is mostly a synonymous
distich, which generally further extends antithetically one line of the
first: cf. [Pro 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#011.md) with [Pro
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015.md); [Pro
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010.md), [Pro
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#023.md) with [Pro
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001.md); [Pro
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#019.md) with [Pro
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#013.md); [Pro
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#005.md) with [Pro
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#021.md); [Pro
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002.md) with [Pro
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012.md), also [Pro
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md) with [Pro
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031.md), where from an antithetic
proverb a synthetic one is formed; but here also there are exceptions,
as [Pro 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#002.md) compared with [Pro
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014.md), and [Pro
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033.md) with [Pro
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012.md), where the same line is in the
first case connected with a synonymous, and in the second with an
antithetic proverb; but here also the contrast is so loose, that the
earlier-occurring proverb has the appearance of priority.

We now direct our attention to the second collection, chap. 25-29. When
we compare the proverbs found here with one another, we see among them a
disproportionately smaller number of repetitions than in the other
collection; only a single entire proverb is repeated in almost similar
terms, but in an altered sense, [Pro
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#020.md) = [Pro
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012.md); but proverbs such as [Pro
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#012.md), [Pro
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#028.md); [Pro
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#002.md), notwithstanding the partial
resemblance, are equally original. On the other hand, in this second
collection we find numerous repetitions of proverbs and portions of
proverbs from the first: - (1) Whole proverbs perfectly identical
(leaving out of view insignificant variations): [Pro
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#024.md) = [Pro
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009.md); [Pro
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#022.md) = [Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md); [Pro
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#012.md) = [Pro
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003.md); [Pro
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#013.md) = [Pro
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016) - (2.md) proverbs identical in
meaning with somewhat changed expression: [Pro
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#013.md) = [Pro
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#013.md); [Pro
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#015.md) = [Pro
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#024.md); [Pro
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006.md) = [Pro
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001.md); [Pro
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#019.md) = [Pro
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#011.md); [Pro
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#013.md) = [Pro
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002) - (3.md) proverbs with one line the
same and one line different: [Pro
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021.md) = [Pro
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003.md); [Pro
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022.md) = [Pro
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#018.md); cf. also [Pro
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md) with [Pro
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013.md). when we compare these proverbs
with one another, we are uncertain as to many of them which has the
priority, as e.g., [Pro 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021.md) = [Pro
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003.md); [Pro
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022.md) = [Pro
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#018.md); but in the case of others there
is no doubt that the Hezekiah-collection contains the original form of
the proverb which is found in the other collection, as [Pro
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#013.md); [Pro
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006.md), [Pro
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#019.md); [Pro
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#013.md); [Pro
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md), in relation to their parallels.
In the other portions of this book also we find such repetitions as are
met with in these two collections of Solomonic proverbs. In Prov
1:7-9:18 we have [Pro 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md), a little
changed, repeated in [Pro 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#005.md), and
[Pro 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md) in [Pro
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#011.md); [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md) = [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md) is a case not worthy of being
mentioned, and it were inappropriate here to refer to [Pro
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md), [Pro
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016.md). In the first appendix of "the
Words of the Wise," 22:17 - 24:22, single lines often repeat themselves
in another connection; cf. [Pro 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#003.md)
and [Pro 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006.md), [Pro
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#010.md) and [Pro
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028.md); [Pro
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#017.md). and [Pro
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#013.md)., [Pro
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#023.md) and [Pro
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#011.md), [Pro
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#017.md) and [Pro
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#001.md). That in such cases the one
proverb is often the pattern of the other, is placed beyond a doubt by
the relation of [Pro 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#019.md) to [Psa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md); cf. also [Pro
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#020.md) with [Psa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#038.md). If here there are proverbs like
those of Solomon in their expression, the presumption is that the
priority belongs to the latter, as [Pro
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027.md) cf. [Pro
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014.md); [Pro
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#005.md). cf. [Pro
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014.md); [Pro
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#019.md). cf. [Pro
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009.md), in which latter case the justice
of the presumption is palpable. Within the second appendix of "the Words
of the Wise," [Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md)., no
repetitions are to be expected on account of its shortness; yet is [Pro
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md) repeated from the Solomonic
Mashal [Pro 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021.md), and as [Pro
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033.md). are literally the same as [Pro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010.md)., the priority is presumably on
the side of the author of 1:7-9:18, at least of the Mashal in the form
in which he communicates it. The supplements chap. 30 and 31 afford
nothing that is worth mention as bearing on our present inquiry,

(Note: Quite the same phenomenon, Fleischer remarks, presents itself in
the different collections of proverbs ascribed to the Caliph Ali, where
frequently one and the same thought in one collection is repeated in
manifold forms in a second, here in a shorter, there in a longer form.
As a general principle this is to be borne in mind, that the East
transmits unchanged, with scrupulous exactness, only religious writings
regarded as holy and divine, and therefore these Proverbs have been
transmitted unchanged only since they became a distinct part of the
canon; before that time it happened to them, as to all in the East that
is exposed to the arbitrariness of the changing spirit and the
intercourse of life, that one and the same original text has been
modified by one speaker and writer after another. Thus of the famous
poetical works of the East, such e.g., as Firdusi's Schah-Nahem (Book of
the Kings) and Sadi's Garden of Roses, not one MS copy agrees with
another.)

and we may therefore now turn to the question, What insight into the
origin of these proverbs and their collection do the observations made
afford? From the numerous repetitions of proverbs and portions of
proverbs of the first collection of the "Proverbs of Solomon" in the
Hezekiah-collection, as well as from another reason stated at the end of
the foregoing section of our inquiry, we conclude that the two
collections were by different authors; in other words, that they had not
both "the men of Hezekiah" for their authors. It is true that the
repetitions in themselves do not prove anything against the oneness of
their authorship for there are within the several collections, and even
within chap. 1-9 (cf. [Pro 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020.md) with
[Pro 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008.md); [Pro
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#010.md). with [Pro
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014)..md), repetitions, notwithstanding
the oneness of their authorship. But if two collections of proverbs are
in so many various ways different in their character, as 10:1-22:16 and
chap. 25-29, then the previous probability rises almost to a certainty
by such repetitions. From the form, for the most part anomalous, in
which the Hezekiah-collection presents the proverbs and portions of
proverbs which are found also in the first collection, and from their
being otherwise independent, we further conclude that "the men of
Hezekiah" did not borrow from the first collection, but formed it from
other sources. But since one does not understand why "the men of
Hezekiah" should have omitted so great a number of genuine Solomonic
proverbs which remain, after deducting the proportionally few that have
been repeated (for this omission is not to be explained by saying that
they selected those that were appropriate and wholesome for their time),
we are further justified in the conclusion that the other collection was
known to them as one current in their time. Their object was, indeed,
not to supplement this older collection; they rather regarded their
undertaking as a similar people's book, which they wished to place side
by side with that collection without making it superfluous. The
difference of the selection in the two collections has its whole
directing occasion in the difference of the intention. The first
collection begins ([Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001).md) with the
proverb -

A wise son maketh glad his father,

And a foolish son is the grief of his mother;

the second ([Pro 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002).md) with the
proverb -

It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,

And the glory of kings to search out a matter.

The one collection is a book for youth, to whom it is dedicated in the
extended introduction, Prov 1:7-9:18; the second is a people's book
suited to the time of Hezekiah ("Solomon's Wisdom in Hezekiah's days,"
as Stier has named it), and therefore it takes its start not, like the
first, from the duties of the child, but from those of the king. If in
the two collections everything does not stand in conscious relation to
these different objects, yet the collectors at least have, from the
commencement to the close (cf. [Pro
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015.md) with [Pro
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#026).md), these objects before their
eyes.

As to the time at which the first collection was made, the above
considerations also afford us some materials for forming a judgment.
Several pairs of proverbs which it contains present to us essentially
the same sayings in older and more recent forms. Keil regards the
proverbs also that appear less original as old-Solomonic, and remarks
that one and the same poet does not always give expression to the same
thoughts with the same pregnant brevity and excellence, and affirms that
changes and reproductions of separate proverbs may proceed even from
Solomon himself. This is possible; but if we consider that even Davidic
psalms have been imitated, and that in the "Words of the Wise" Solomonic
proverbs are imitated - moreover, that proverbs especially are subject
to changes, and invite to imitation and transformation - we shall find
it to be improbable. Rather we would suppose, that between the
publication of the 3000 proverbs of Solomon and the preparation of the
collection chap. 10-22:16 a considerable time elapsed, during which the
old-Solomonic Mashal had in the mouths of the people and of poets
acquired a multitude of accretions, and that the collector had without
hesitation gathered together such indirect Solomonic proverbs with those
that were directly Solomonic. But did not then the 3000 Solomonic
proverbs afford to him scope enough? We must answer this question in the
negative; for if that vast number of Solomonic proverbs was equal in
moral-religious worth to those that have been preserved to us, then
neither the many repetitions within the first collection nor the
proportional poverty of the second can be explained. The "men of
Hezekiah" made their collection of Solomonic proverbs nearly 300 years
after Solomon's time; but there is no reason to suppose that the old
book of the Proverbs of Solomon had disappeared at that time. Much
rather we may with probability conclude, from the subjects to which
several proverbs of these collections extend (husbandry, war, court
life, etc.), and from Solomon's love for the manifold forms of natural
and of social life, that his 3000 proverbs would not have afforded much
greater treasures than these before us. But if the first collection was
made at a time in which the old-Solomonic proverbs had been already
considerably multiplied by new combinations, accretions, and imitations,
then probably a more suitable time for their origination could not be
than that of Jehoshaphat, which was more related to the time of Solomon
than to that of David. The personality of Jehoshaphat, inclined toward
the promotion of the public worship of God, the edification of the
people, the administration of justice; the dominion of the house of
David recognised and venerated far and wide among neighbouring peoples;
the tendencies of that time towards intercourse with distant regions;
the deep peace which followed the subjugation of the confederated
nations - all these are features which stamped the time of Jehoshaphat
as a copy of that of Solomon. Hence we are to expect in it the fostering
care of the Chokma. If the author of the introduction and editor of the
older book of Proverbs lived after Solomon and before Hezekiah, then the
circumstances of the case most suitably determine his time as at the
beginning of the reign of Jehoshaphat, some seventy years after
Solomon's death. If in chap. 1-9 it is frequently said that wisdom was
seen openly in the streets and ways, this agrees with [Ch2
17:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007.md), where it is said that princes,
priests, and Levites, sent out by Jehoshaphat (compare the Carolingian
missi), went forth into the towns of Judah with the book of the law in
their hands as teachers of the people, and with [Ch2
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#004.md), where it is stated that
Jehoshaphat himself "went out through the people from Beer-sheba to
Mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the Lord God of their
fathers." We have an evidence of the fondness for allegorical forms of
address at that time in [Kg2 14:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008.md)
([Ch2 25:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#017).md), which is so far
favourable to the idea that the allegorizing author of chap. 1-9
belonged to that epoch of history.

This also agrees with the time of Jehoshaphat, that in the first
collection the kingdom appears in its bright side, adorned with
righteousness ([Pro 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#035.md); [Pro
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010.md), [Pro
16:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012.md); [Pro
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008).md), wisdom ([Pro
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026).md), grace and truth ([Pro
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#028).md), love to the good ([Pro
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#011).md), divine guidance ([Pro
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001).md), and in the height of power
([Pro 16:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#014.md); [Pro
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012).md); while in the second
collection, which immediately begins with a series of the king's
sayings, the kingdom is seen almost only (with exception of [Pro
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#014).md) on its dark side, and is
represented under the destructive dominion of tyranny ([Pro
28:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015.md); [Pro
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#002).md), of oppressive taxation ([Pro
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#004).md), of the Camarilla ([Pro
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#005.md); [Pro
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012).md), and of multiplied authorities
([Pro 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#002).md). Elster is right when he
remarks, that in chap. 10-22:16 the kingdom in its actual state
corresponds to its ideal, and the warning against the abuse of royal
power lies remote. If these proverbs more distinguishably than those in
chap. 25-29 bear the physiognomy of the time of David and Solomon, so,
on the other hand, the time of Jehoshaphat, the son and successor of
Asa, is favourable to their collection; while in the time of Hezekiah,
the son and successor of Ahaz, and father and predecessor of Manasseh,
in which, through the sin of Ahaz, negotiations with the world-kingdom
began, that cloudy aspect of the kingdom which is borne by the second
supplement, [Pro 24:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md), was brought
near.

Thus between Solomon and Hezekiah, and probably under Jehoshaphat, the
older Book of Proverbs contained in chap. 1-24:22 first appeared. The
"Proverbs of Solomon," Prov 10:1-22:16, which formed the principal part,
the very kernel of it, were enclosed on the one side, at their
commencement, by the lengthened introduction 1:7-9:18, in which the
collector announces himself as a highly gifted teacher and as the
instrument of the Spirit of revelation, and on the other side are shut
in at their close by "the Words of the Wise," 22:17-24:34. The author,
indeed, does not announce [Pro 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md)
such a supplement of "the Words of the Wise;" but after these words in
the title of the book, he leads us to expect it. The introduction to the
supplement [Pro 22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md) sounds like
an echo of the larger introduction, and corresponds to the smaller
compass of the supplement. The work bears on the whole the stamp of a
unity; for even in the last proverb with which it closes ([Pro
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#021.md)., "My son, fear thou Jahve and
the king," etc.), there still sounds the same key-note which the author
had struck at the commencement. A later collector, belonging to the time
subsequent to Hezekiah, enlarged the work by the addition of the
Hezekiah-portion, and by a short supplement of "the Words of the Wise,"
which he introduces, according to the law of analogy, after 22:17-24:22.
The harmony of the superscriptions [Pro
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md); [Pro
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md), favours at least the supposition
that these supplements are the work of one hand. The circumstance that
"the Words of the Wise," 22:17-24:22, in two of their maxims refer to
the older collection of Solomonic proverbs, but, on the contrary, that
"the Words of the Wise," [Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md).,
refer in [Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md) to the
Hezekiah-collection, and in [Pro
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033.md). to the introduction 1:7-9:18,
strengthens the supposition that with [Pro
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md) a second half of the book, added
by another hand, begins. There is no reason for not attributing the
appendix chap. 30-31 to this second collector; perhaps he seeks, as
already remarked above, to render by means of it the conclusion of the
extended Book of Proverbs uniform with that of the older book. Like the
older collection of "Proverbs of Solomon," so also now the
Hezekiah-collection has "Proverbs of the Wise" on the right and on the
left, and the king of proverbial poetry stands in the midst of a worthy
retinue. The second collector distinguishes himself from the first by
this, that he never professes himself to be a proverbial poet. It is
possible that the proverbial poem of the "virtuous woman," [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md)., may be his work, but there is
nothing to substantiate this opinion.

After this digression, into which we have been led by the repetitions
found in the book, we now return, conformably to our plan, to examine it
from the point of view of the forms of its language and of its doctrinal
contents, and to inquire whether the results hitherto attained are
confirmed, and perhaps more fully determined, by this further
investigation.

4\. The Book of the Proverbs on the Side of Its Manifoldness of Style
and Form of Instruction

We commence our inquiry with the relation in which chap. 10-22:16 and
chap. 25-29 stand to each other with reference to their forms of
language. If the primary stock of both of these sections belongs indeed
to the old time of Solomon, then they must bear essentially the same
verbal stamp upon them. Here we of course keep out of view the proverbs
that are wholly or partially identical. If the expression חדרי־בטן (the
chambers of the body) is in the first collection a favourite figure
([Pro 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md); [Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md), [Pro
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#030).md), coined perhaps by Solomon
himself, the fact that this figure is also found in [Pro
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#022.md) is not to be taken into account,
since in [Pro 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#022.md) the proverb [Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md) is repeated. Now it cannot at all
be denied, that in the first collection certain expressions are met with
which one might expect to meet again in the Hezekiah-collection, and
which, notwithstanding, are not to be found in it. Ewald gives a list of
such expressions, in order to show that the old-Solomonic dialect
occurs, with few exceptions, only in the first collection. But his
catalogue, when closely inspected, is unsatisfactory. That many of these
expressions occur also in the introduction Prov 1-9 proves, it is true,
nothing against him. But מרפּא (health), [Pro
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#018.md); [Pro
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017.md); [Pro
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030.md); [Pro
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004.md); [Pro
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024.md), occurs also in [Pro
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001); רדּף (he pursueth.md), [Pro
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#019.md); [Pro
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#011.md); [Pro
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#009.md); [Pro
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007.md), also in [Pro
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#019); נרגּן (a tattler.md), [Pro
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#028.md); [Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md), also in [Pro
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#020.md), [Pro
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#022); לא ינּקה (not go unpunished.md),
[Pro 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#021.md); [Pro
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#005.md); [Pro
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md), also in [Pro
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#020.md). These expressions thus supply
an argument for, not against, the linguistic oneness of the two
collections. The list of expressions common to the two collections might
be considerably increased, e.g.: נפרע (are unruly), [Pro
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018.md), Kal [Pro
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#018.md); [Pro
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#032); אץ (he that hastens.md), [Pro
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002.md); [Pro
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005.md); [Pro
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#020.md); [Pro
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#019); מדונים (of contentions.md), [Pro
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009.md) ([Pro
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#024).md), [Pro
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#019.md); [Pro
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#029.md); [Pro
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#021.md); [Pro
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#025.md). If it may be regarded as a
striking fact that the figures of speech מקור חיּים (a fountain of
life), [Pro 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011.md); [Pro
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014.md); [Pro
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027.md); [Pro
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#022), and עץ חיּים (a tree of life.md),
[Pro 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030.md); [Pro
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012.md); [Pro
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004.md), as also the expressions מחתּה
(destruction), [Pro 10:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014.md); [Pro
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003.md); [Pro
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#028.md); [Pro
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#007.md); [Pro
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#029.md); [Pro
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#015), יפיח (he uttereth.md), [Pro
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#017.md); [Pro
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005.md), [Pro
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025.md); [Pro
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005.md), [Pro
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009); סלּף (perverteth.md), [Pro
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#006.md); [Pro
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003.md); [Pro
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#012.md); [Pro
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#012), and סלף (perverseness.md), [Pro
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003.md); [Pro
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004.md), are only to be found in the
first collection, and not in that by the "men of Hezekiah," it is not a
decisive evidence against the oneness of the origin of the proverbs in
both collections. The fact also, properly brought forward by Ewald, that
proverbs which begin with ישׁ (there is) - e.g., [Pro
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024.md), "There is that scattereth, and
yet increaseth still," - are exclusively found in the first collection,
need not perplex us; it is one peculiar kind of proverbs which the
author of this collection has by preference gathered together, as he has
also omitted all parabolic proverbs except these two, [Pro
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md); [Pro
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022.md). If proverbs beginning with ישׁ
are found only in the first, so on the other hand the parabolic Vav and
the proverbial perfect, reporting as it were an experience (cf. in the
second collection, besides [Pro 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#013.md);
[Pro 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#012.md); [Pro
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#013.md), also [Pro
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001.md); [Pro
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#009).md), for which Dderlein

(Note: Reden u. Aufstze, ii. 316.)

has invented the expression aoristus gnomicus,

(Note: A similar thing is found among German proverbs, e.g.: Wer nicht
mitsass, auch nicht mitass (Whoso sat not, ate not).)

are common to both sentences. Another remark of Ewald's (Jahrb. xi. 28),
that extended proverbs with אישׁ are exclusively found in the
Hezekiah-collection ([Pro 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#009.md), [Pro
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003.md); [Pro
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#018.md), [Pro
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#028).md), is not fully established; in
[Pro 16:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#027.md) three proverbs with אישׁ
are found together, and in [Pro 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#006.md)
as well as in [Pro 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#009.md) אישׁ occurs
twice in one proverb. Rather it strikes us that the article, not merely
the punctatorially syncopated, but that expressed by ה, occurs only
twice in the first collection, in [Pro
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001.md); [Pro
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#031.md); oftener in the second, [Pro
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#014.md), [Pro
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#018.md); [Pro
27:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#019.md), [Pro
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022.md). Since, however, the first does
not wholly omit the article, this also cannot determine us to reject the
linguistic unity of the second collection with the first, at least
according to their primary stock.

But also what of the linguistic unity of Prov 1-9 with both of these,
maintained by Keil? It is true, and merits all consideration, that a
unity of language and of conception between chap. 1-9 and chap. 10-22:16
which far exceeds the degree of unity between chap. 10-22:16 and chap.
25-29 may be proved. The introduction is bound with the first collection
in the closest manner by the same use of such expressions as אגר

10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005.md); אישׁון (the middle, i.e., of the

points of contact between the two portions which an attentive reader
will meet with. This relation of Prov 1-9 to chap. 10-22:16 is a strong
proof of the internal unity of that portion, which Bertheau has called
in question. But are we therefore to conclude, with Keil, that the
introduction is not less of the old time of Solomon than chap. 10-22:16?
Such a conclusion lies near, but we do not yet reach it. For with these

8:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#013.md), [Pro
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031.md). This usage is, however, only a
feature in the characteristic style of this section altogether different
from that of 10:1-22:16, as well as from that of chap. 25-29, of its
disjointed diffuse form, delighting in repetitions, abounding in
synonymous parallelism, even to a repetition of the same words (cf.
e.g., [Pro 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#002).md), which, since the
linguistic and the poetic forms are here inseparable, we have already
spoken of in the second part of our introductory dissertation. This
fundamental diversity in the whole condition of the section,
notwithstanding those numerous points of resemblance, demands for chap.
1-9 an altogether different author from Solomon, and one who is more
recent. If we hold by this view, then these points of resemblance
between the sections find the most satisfactory explanation. The gifted
author of the introduction (Prov 1-9) has formed his style, without
being an altogether slavish imitator, on the Solomonic proverbs. And
why, then, are his parallels confined almost exclusively to the section
10:1-22:16, and do not extend to chap. 25-29? Because he edited the
former and not the latter, and took pleasure particularly in the
proverbs which he placed together, 10:1-22:16. Not only are expressions
of this section, formed by himself, echoed in his poetry, but the latter
are for the most part formed out of germs supplied by the former. One
may regard [Pro 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#027.md), cf. [Pro
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#011.md), as the germ of the admonitory
addresses to the son, and [Pro 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001.md) as
the occasion of the allegory of the wise and the foolish woman, chap. 9.
Generally, the poetry of this writer has its hidden roots in the older
writings. Who does not hear, to mention only one thing, in Prov 1:7-9:18
an echo of the old שׁמע (hear), [Deu
6:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004.md), cf. [Pro
11:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018.md)? The whole poetry of this
writer savours of the Book of Deuteronomy. The admonitory addresses Deut
1:7-9:18 are to the Book of Proverbs what Deuteronomy is to the
Pentateuch. As Deuteronomy seeks to bring home and seal upon the heart
of the people the תּורה of the Mosaic law, so do they the תּורה of the
Solomonic proverbs.

We now further inquire whether, in the style of the two supplements,
Prov 22:27-24:22 and [Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md)., it
is proved that the former concludes the Book of Proverbs edited by the
author of the general introduction, and that the latter was added by a
different author at the same time with the Hezekiah-collection. Bertheau
placed both supplements together, and attributes the introduction to
them, [Pro 22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md), to the author of
the general introduction, [Pro 1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md).
From the fact that in [Pro 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#019.md) of
this lesser introduction ("I have taught thee, אף־אתּה, even thee") the
pronoun is as emphatically repeated as in [Pro
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#015.md) (לבּי גם־אני, cf. [Pro
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#014.md), [Pro
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#019)), and that נעים (sweet.md), [Pro
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#018.md), also occurs in the following
proverbs, [Pro 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#008.md); [Pro
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#004.md), I see no ground for denying it
to the author of the larger general introduction, since, according to
Bertheau's own just observation, the linguistic form of the whole
collection of proverbs has an influence on the introduction of the
collector; with more justice from שׁלישׁים, [Pro
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#020.md) \[only in Keri\], as the title
of honour given to the collection of proverbs, compared with נגידים,
[Pro 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006.md), may we argue for the
identity of the authorship of both introductions. As little can the
contemporaneousness of the two supplements be shown from the use of the
pronoun, [Pro 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#032.md), the שׁית לב
(animum advertere, [Pro 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#032).md), and
ינעם (shall be delight) [Pro 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#025.md),
for these verbal points of contact, if they proved anything, would prove
too much: not only the contemporaneousness of the two supplements, but
also the identity of their authorship; but in this case one does not see
what the superscription גּם־אלּה לחכמים (these also of the wise men),
separating them, means. Moreover, [Pro
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033.md). are from [Pro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010.md)., and nearer than the comparison
of the first supplement lies the comparison of ינעם with [Pro
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md); [Pro
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#017.md), אדם חסר לב (a man lacking
understanding) with [Pro 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018.md),
יזעמוּהוּ with [Pro 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014.md) - points of
contact which, if an explanatory reason is needed, may be accounted for
from the circumstance that to the author or authors of the proverbs [Pro
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md). the Book of Prov 1:1-24:22 may
have been perfectly familiar. From imitation also the points of contact
of Prov 22:17-24:22 may easily be explained; for not merely the lesser
introduction, the proverbs themselves also in part strikingly agree with
the prevailing language of 1-9: cf. אשּׁר בּדּרך (go straight forward in
the way), [Pro 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#019.md), with [Pro
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#014); חכמות (wisdom.md), [Pro
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#007.md), with [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md); [Pro
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md); and several others. But if,
according to [Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md), we conceive of
the older Book of Proverbs as accompanied with, rather than as without
דּברי חכמים (words of wise men), then from the similarity of the two
superscriptions [Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md); [Pro
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md), it is probable that the more
recent half of the canonical book begins with [Pro
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md), and we cannot therefore
determine to regard [Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md). also
as a component part of the older Book of Proverbs; particularly since
[Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md) is like [Pro
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021.md), and the author of the
introduction can scarcely have twice taken into his book the two [Pro
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033.md)., which moreover seem to stand
in their original connection at [Pro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010.md).

The supplements to the Hezekiah-collection, chap. 30f., are of so
peculiar a form, that it will occur to no one (leaving out of view such
expressions as דּעת קדשׁים, knowledge of the Holy, [Pro
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#003.md), cf. [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010).md) to ascribe them to one of the
authors of the preceding proverbs. We content ourselves here with a
reference to Mhlau's work, De Proverbiorum quae dicuntur Aguri et
Lemuelis origine atque indole, 1869, where the Aramaic-Arabic colouring
of this in all probability foreign section is closely investigated.

Having thus abundantly proved that the two groups of proverbs bearing
the inscription משׁלי שׁלמה are, as to their primary stock, truly
old-Solomonic, though not without an admixture of imitations; that, on
the contrary, the introduction, Prov 1:7-9:18, as well as the דברי
חכמים, [Pro 22:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md) and 30f., are not
at all old-Solomonic, but belong to the editor of the older Book of
Proverbs, which reaches down to [Pro
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022.md), so that thus the present book
of the poetry of Solomon contains united with it the poems of the older
editor, and besides of other poets, partly unknown Israelites, and
partly two foreigners particularly named, Agur and Lemuel; we now turn
our attention to the Doctrinal Contents of the work, and ask whether a
manifoldness in the type of instruction is noticeable in it, and whether
there is perceptible in this manifoldness a progressive development. It
may be possible that the Proverbs of Solomon, the Words of the Wise, and
the Proverbial poetry of the editor, as they represent three eras, so
also represent three different stages in the development of proverbial
poetry. However, the Words of the Wise [Pro
22:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md) are so internally related to
the Proverbs of Solomon, that even the sharpest eye will discover in
them not more than the evening twilight of the vanishing Solomonic
Mashal. There thus remain on the one side only the Proverbs of Solomon
with their echo in the Words of the Wise, on the other the Proverbial
Poems of the editor; and these present themselves as monuments of two
sharply defined epochs in the progressive development of the Mashal.

The common fundamental character of the book in all its parts is rightly
defined when we call it a Book of Wisdom. Indeed, with the Church
Fathers not only the Book of Sirach and the Solomonic Apocrypha, but
also this Book of Proverbs bears this title, which seems also to have
been in use among the Jews, since Melito of Sardes adds to the title
"Proverbs of Solomon," ἡ καὶ Σοφὶα; since, moreover, Eusebius (H.E. iv.
22) affirms, that not only Hegesippus and Irenaeus, but the whole of the
ancients, called the Proverbs of Solomon Πανάρετος Σοφία.

(Note: This name meaning "wisdom, including all virtue", there are many
things to show, was common in Palestine. The Jerusalem Talmud, in a
passage quoted by Krochmal, Kerem Chemed, v. 79, divides the canon into
תורה, נבואה, and חכמה. Rashi, in Baba bathra, 14b, calls Mishle
(Proverbs) and Koheleth (Ecclesiastes) ספרי חכמה. The Book of Koheleth
is called (b. Megilla, 7a), according to its contents, חכמתו שׁל שׁלמה.
The Song bears in the Syriac version (the Peshito) the inscription
chekmetho dechekmotho.)

It is also worthy of observation that it is called by Dionysius of
Alexandria ἡ σοφὴ βίβλος, and by Gregory of Nazianzum ἡ παιδαγωγικὴ
σοφία. These names not only express praise of the book, but they also
denote at the same time the circle of human intellectual activity from
which it emanated. As the books of prophecy are a product of the נבוּאה,
so the Book of the Proverbs is a product of the חכמה, σοφία, the human
effort to apprehend the objective σοφία, and thus of φιλοσοφία, or the
studium sapientiae. It has emanated from the love of wisdom, to incite
to the love of wisdom, and to put into the possession of that which is
the object of love - for this end it was written. We need not hesitate,
in view of [Col 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md), to call the Book
of Proverbs a "philosophical" treatise, since the origin of the name
φιλοσοφία is altogether noble: it expresses the relativity of human
knowledge as over against the absoluteness of the divine knowledge, and
the possibility of an endlessly progressive advancement of the human
toward the divine. The characteristic ideas of a dialectic development
of thought and of the formation of a scientific system did not primarily
appertain to it - the occasion for this was not present to the
Israelitish people: it required fructification through the Japhetic
spirit to produce philosophers such as Philo, Maimonides, and Spinoza.
But philosophy is everywhere present when the natural, moral, positive,
is made the object of a meditation which seeks to apprehend its last
ground, its legitimate coherence, its true essence and aim. In the view
C. B. Michaelis, in his Adnotationes uberiores in Hagiographa, passes
from the exposition of the Psalms to that of the Proverbs with the
words, "From David's closet, consecrated to prayer, we now pass into
Solomon's school of wisdom, to admire the greatest of philosophers in
the son of the greatest of theologians."

(Note: "In hoc genere," says Lord Bacon, De Augmentis Scientiarum, viii.
2, "nihil invenitur, quod ullo modo comparandum sit cum aphorismis
illis, quos edidit rex Salomon, de quo testatur Scriptura, cor illi
fuisse instar arenae maris. Sicut enim arenae maris universas orbis oras
circumdant, ita et sapientia ejus omnia humana non minus quam divina
complexa est. In aphorismis vero illis praeter alia magis theologica
reperies liquido haud pauca praecepta et monita civilia praestantissima,
ex profundis quidem sapientiae penetralibus scaturientia atque in
amplissimum varietatis campum excurrentia." Accordingly, in the same
work Bacon calls the Proverbs of Solomon "insignes parabolas s.
aphorismos de divina atque morali philosophia.")

When we give the name φιλοσοφία to the tendency of mind to which the
Book of Proverbs belongs, we do not merely use a current scientific
word, but there is an actual internal relation of the Book of Proverbs
to that which is the essence of philosophy, which Scripture recognises
([Act 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027.md), cf. [Rom
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019)..md) as existing within the domain
of heathendom, and which stamps it as a natural produce of the human
spirit, which never can be wanting where a human being or a people rises
to higher self-consciousness and its operations in their changing
relation to the phenomena of the external world. The mysteries of the
world without him and of the world within him give man no rest, he must
seek to solve them; and whenever he does that, he philosophizes, i.e.,
he strives after a knowledge of the nature of things, and of the laws
which govern them in the world of phenomena and of events; on which
account also Josephus, referring to Solomon's knowledge of nature, says
(Ant. viii. 2. 5), οὐδεμίαν τούτων φύσιν ἠγνόησεν οὐδὲ παρῆλθεν
ἀνεξέταστον ἀλλ ̓ ἐν πάσαις ἐφιλοσόφησεν. Cf. Irenaeus, Cont. Her. iv.
27. 1: eam quae est in conditione (κτίσει) sapientiam Dei exponebat
physiologice.

The historical books show us how much the age of Solomon favoured
philosophical inquiries by its prosperity and peace, its active and
manifold commercial intercourse with foreign nations, its circle of
vision extending to Tarshish and Ophir, and also how Solomon himself
attained to an unequalled elevation in the extent of his human and
secular knowledge. We also read of some of the wise men in [Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011.md), cf. Ps 88-89, who adorned the
court of the wisest of kings; and the משׁל, which became, through his
influence, a special branch of Jewish literature, is the peculiar poetic
form of the חכמה. Therefore in the Book of Proverbs we find the name
חכמים דּברי (words of the wise) used for משׁלים (proverbs); and by a
careful consideration of all the proverbs in which mention is made of
the חכמים, one will convince himself that this name has not merely a
common ethical sense, but begins to be the name of those who made
wisdom, i.e., the knowledge of things in the depths of their essence,
their special lifework, and who connected themselves together in oneness
of sentiment and fellowship into a particular circle within the
community. To this conclusion we are conducted by such proverbs as [Pro
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020.md) -

He that walketh with wise men becomes wise,

And whoever has intercourse with fools is destroyed;

[Pro 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#012.md) -

The scorner loveth not that one reprove him:

To wise men he goeth not; -

and by the contrast, which prevails in the Book of Proverbs, between לץ
(mocker) and חכם (wise), in which we see that, at the same time with the
striving after wisdom, scepticism also, which we call free thought,
obtained a great ascendency in Israel. Mockery of religion, rejection of
God in principle and practice, a casting away of all fear of Jahve, and
in general of all δεισιδαιμονία, were in Israel phenomena which had
already marked the times of David. One may see from the Psalms that the
community of the Davidic era is to be by no means regarded as furnishing
a pattern of religious life: that there were in it גּוים (Gentile
nations) which were in no way externally inferior to them, and that it
did not want for rejecters of God. But it is natural to expect that in
the Solomonic era, which was more than any other exposed to the dangers
of sensuality and worldliness, and of religious indifference and
free-thinking latitudinarianism, the number of the לצים increased, and
that scepticism and mockery became more intensified. The Solomonic era
appears to have first coined the name of לץ for those men who despised
that which was holy, and in doing so laid claim to wisdom ([Pro
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006).md), who caused contention and
bitterness when they spake, and carefully avoided the society of the
חכמים, because they thought themselves above their admonitions ([Pro
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#012).md). For in the psalms of the
Davidic time the word נבל is commonly used for them (it occurs in the
Proverbs only in [Pro 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021.md), with the
general meaning of low fellow, Germ. Bube), and the name לץ is never met
with except once, in [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), which
belongs to the post-Davidic era. One of the Solomonic proverbs ([Pro
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024).md) furnishes a definite idea of
this newly formed word:

An inflated arrogant man they call a scorner (לץ),

One who acts in the superfluity of haughtiness.

By the self-sufficiency of his ungodly thoughts and actions he is
distinguished from the פּתי (simple), who is only misled, and may
therefore be reclaimed, [Pro 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025.md);
[Pro 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011.md); by his non-recognition of
the Holy in opposition to a better knowledge and better means and
opportunities, he is distinguished from the כּסיל (foolish, stupid),
[Pro 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016.md), the אויל (foolish,
wicked), [Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md); [Pro
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#022.md), and the חסר לב (the void of
understanding), [Pro 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#032.md), who despise
truth and instruction from want of understanding, narrowness, and
forgetfulness of God, but not from perverse principle. This name
specially coined, the definition of it given (cf. also the similarly
defining proverb [Pro 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008).md), and in
general the rich and fine technical proverbs in relation to the manifold
kinds of wisdom (בּינה, [Pro 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#016.md);
מוּסר, [Pro 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008.md); תּבוּנות, [Pro
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030.md); מזמּות, [Pro
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002.md); תּחבּוּלות, [Pro
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005.md); [Pro
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#005.md); the תּוּשׁיּה first coined by
the Chokma, etc.), of instruction in wisdom (לקח, [Pro
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005.md); תּורה, [Pro
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#002.md); [Pro
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023.md); רעה, to tend to a flock, to
instruct, [Pro 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md); חנך, [Pro
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006.md); הוכח, [Pro
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#012.md); לקח נפשׁות, to win souls, [Pro
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025.md); [Pro
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030).md), of the wise men themselves
(חכם, [Pro 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#015.md); נבון, [Pro
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013.md); מוכיח, a reprover, preacher of
repentance, [Pro 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#012), etc..md), and of
the different classes of men (among whom also אדם אחרי, one who steps
backwards \[retrograder\], [Pro 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#023).md)
- all this shows that חכמה was at that time not merely the designation
of an ethical quality, but also the designation of a science rooted in
the fear of God to which many noble men in Israel then addicted
themselves. Jeremiah places ([Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018).md) the חכם along with the כּהן
(priest) and נביא (prophet); and if [Eze
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026)) uses זקן (old man.md) instead of
חכם, yet by reference to [Job 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012.md)
this may be understood. In his "Dissertation on the popular and
intellectual freedom of Israel from the time of the great prophets to
the first destruction of Jerusalem" (Jahrbcher, i. 96f.), Ewald says,
"One can scarcely sufficiently conceive how high the attainment was
which was reached in the pursuit after wisdom (philosophy) in the first
centuries after David, and one too much overlooks the mighty influence
it exerted on the entire development of the national life of Israel. The
more closely those centuries are inquired into, the more are we
astonished at the vast power which wisdom so early exerted on all sides
as the common object of pursuit of many men among the people. It first
openly manifested itself in special circles of the people, while in the
age after Solomon, which was peculiarly favourable to it, eagerly
inquisitive scholars gathered around individual masters, until ever
increasing schools were formed. But its influence gradually penetrated
all the other pursuits of the people, and operated on the most diverse
departments of authorship." We are in entire sympathy with this
historical view first advanced by Ewald, although we must frequently
oppose the carrying of it out in details. The literature and the
national history of Israel are certainly not understood if one does not
take into consideration, along with the נבוּאה (prophecy), the
influential development of the חכמה as a special aim and subject of
intellectual activity in Israel.

And how was this Chokma conditioned - to what was it directed? To denote
its condition and aim in one word, it was universalistic, or humanistic.
Emanating from the fear or the religion of Jahve (דּרך ה, the way of the
Lord, [Pro 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#029).md), but seeking to
comprehend the spirit in the letter, the essence in the forms of the
national life, its effort was directed towards the general truth
affecting mankind as such. While prophecy, which is recognised by the
Chokma as a spiritual power indispensable to a healthful development of
a people (בּאין חזון יפּרע עם, [Job
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#018).md), is of service to the
historical process into which divine truth enters to work out its
results in Israel, and from thence outward among mankind, the Chokma
seeks to look into the very essence of this truth through the robe of
its historical and national manifestation, and then to comprehend those
general ideas in which could already be discovered the fitness of the
religion of Jahve for becoming the world-religion. From this aim towards
the ideal in the historical, towards the everlasting same amid changes,
the human (I intentionally use this word) in the Israelitish, the
universal religion in the Jahve-religion (Jahvetum), and the universal
morality in the Law, all the peculiarities of the Book of Proverbs are
explained, as well as of the long, broad stream of the literature of the
Chokma, beginning with Solomon, which, when the Palestinian Judaism
assumed the rugged, exclusive, proud national character of Pharisaism,
developed itself in Alexandrinism. Bertheau is amazed that in the
Proverbs there are no warnings given against the worship of idols, which
from the time of the kings gained more and more prevalence among the
Israelitish people. "How is it to be explained," he asks (Spr. p.
xlii.), "if the proverbs, in part at least, originated during the
centuries of conflict between idolatry and the religion of Jahve, and if
they were collected at a time in which this conflict reached its climax
and stirred all ranks of the people - this conflict against the
immorality of the Phoenician-Babylonian religion of nature, which must
often have led into the same region of the moral contemplation of the
world over which this book moves?!" The explanation lies in this, that
the Chokma took its stand-point in a height and depth in which it had
the mingling waves of international life and culture under it and above
it, without being internally moved thereby. It naturally did not approve
of heathenism, it rather looked upon the fear of Jahve as the beginning
of wisdom, and the seeking after Jahve as implying the possession of all
knowledge ([Pro 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#005.md), cf. [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020).md); but it passed over the struggle
of prophecy against heathendom, it confined itself to its own function,
viz., to raise the treasures of general religious-moral truth in the
Jahve-religion, and to use them for the ennobling of the Israelites as
men. In vain do we look for the name ישׂראל in the Proverbs, even the
name תּורה has a much more flexible idea attached to it than that of the
law written at Sinai (cf. [Pro 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#004.md);
[Pro 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018.md) with [Pro
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#007.md); [Pro
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014), and similar passages.md); prayer
and good works are placed above sacrifice, [Pro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md); [Pro
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003.md), [Pro
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027.md) - practical obedience to the
teaching if wisdom above all, [Pro
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009.md). The Proverbs refer with special
interest to Gen 1 and 2, the beginnings of the world and of the human
race before nations took their origin. On this primitive record in the
book of Genesis, to speak only of the משׁלי שׁלמה, the figure of the
tree of life (perhaps also of the fountain of life), found nowhere else
in the Old Testament, leans; on it leans also the contrast, deeply
pervading the Proverbs, between life (immortality, [Pro
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028).md) and death, or between that
which is above and that which is beneath ([Pro
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#024).md); on it also many other
expressions, such, e.g., as what is said in [Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md) of the "spirit of man." This
also, as Stier (Der Weise ein Knig, 1849, p. 240) has observed, accounts
for the fact that אדם occurs by far most frequently in the Book of Job
and in the Solomonic writings. All these phenomena are explained from
the general human universal aim of the Chokma.

When James ([Jam 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017).md) says that the
"wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy
to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and
without hypocrisy," his words most excellently designate the nature and
the contents of the discourse of wisdom in the Solomonic proverbs, and
one is almost inclined to think that the apostolic brother of the Lord,
when he delineates wisdom, has before his eyes the Book of the Proverbs,
which raises to purity by the most impressive admonitions. Next to its
admonitions to purity are those especially to peacefulness, to gentle
resignation ([Pro 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030).md), quietness of
mind ([Pro 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033).md) and humility ([Pro
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#002.md); [Pro
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033.md); [Pro
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#005.md), [Pro
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018).md), to mercy (even toward beasts,
[Pro 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010).md), to firmness and sincerity
of conviction, to the furtherance of one's neighbour by means of wise
discourse and kind help. What is done in the Book of Deuteronomy with
reference to he law is continued here. As in Deuteronomy, so here, love
is at the bottom of its admonitions, the love of God to men, and the
love of men to one another in their diverse relations ([Deu
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002.md); [Deu
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009).md); the conception of צדקה gives
way to that of charity, of almsgiving (δικαιοσύνη = ἐλεημοσύνη).
Forgiving, suffering love ([Pro
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012).md), love which does good even to
enemies ([Pro 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021)..md), rejoices not
over the misfortune that befalls an enemy ([Pro
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017)..md), retaliates not ([Pro
24:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#028)..md), but commits all to God ([Pro
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#022).md) - love in its manifold forms,
as that of husband and wife, of children, of friends - is here
recommended with New Testament distinctness and with deepest feeling.
Living in the fear of God ([Pro
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014).md), the Omniscient ([Pro
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003.md), [Pro
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011.md); [Pro
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002.md); [Pro
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002.md); [Pro
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011)..md), to whom as the final Cause
all is referred ([Pro 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#012.md), [Pro
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#024.md); [Pro
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031.md); [Pro
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002).md), and whose universal plan all
must subserve ([Pro 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004.md); [Pro
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021.md); [Pro
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030).md), and on the other side active
pure love to man - these are the hinges on which all the teachings of
wisdom in the Proverbs turn. Frederick Schlegel, in the fourteenth of
his Lectures on the History of Literature, distinguishes, not without
deep truth, between the historico-prophetic books of the Old Testament,
or books of the history of redemption, and the Book of Job, the Psalms,
and the Solomonic writings, as books of aspiration, corresponding to the
triple chord of faith, hope, charity as the three stages of the inner
spiritual life. The Book of Job is designed to support faith amid
trials; the Psalms breathe forth and exhibit hope amid the conflicts of
earth's longings; the Solomonic writings reveal to us the mystery of the
divine love, and the Proverbs that wisdom which grows out of and is
itself eternal love. When Schlegel in the same lecture says that the
books of the Old Covenant, for the most part, stand under the signature
of the lion as the element of the power of will and spirited conflict
glowing in divine fire, but that in the inmost hidden kernel and heart
of the sacred book the Christian figure of the lamb rises up out of the
veil of this lion strength, this may specially be said of the Book of
Proverbs, for here that same heavenly wisdom preaches, which, when
manifested in person, spake in the Sermon on the Mount, New Testament
love in the midst of the Old Testament.

It is said that in the times before Christ there was a tendency to
apocryphize not only the Song of Solomon and Ecclesiastes, but also the
Book of Proverbs, and that for the first time the men of the Great
Synagogue established their canonicity on the ground of their spiritual
import; they became perplexed about the Proverbs, according to b.
Sabbath, 30b, on account of such self-contradictory proverbs as [Pro
26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#004.md), and according to Aboth
de-Rabbi Nathan, c. 1, on account of such secular portions as that of
the wanton woman, chap. 7. But there is no need to allegorize this
woman, and that self-contradiction is easily explained. The theopneustic
character of the book and its claim to canonicity show themselves from
its integral relation to the Old Testament preparation for redemption;
but keeping out of view the book as a whole, it is self-evident that the
conception of a practical proverb such as [Pro
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004.md) and of a prophecy such as [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md) are very different phenomena of
the spiritual life, and that in general the operation of the Divine
Spirit in a proverb is different from that in a prophecy.

We have hitherto noted the character of the instruction set forth in the
Proverbs according to the marks common to them in all their parts, but
in such a way that we have taken our proofs only from the "Proverbs of
Solomon" and the "Words of the Wise," with the exclusion of the
introductory proverbial poems of the older editor. If we compare the two
together, it cannot be denied that in the type of the instruction
contained in the latter, the Chokma, of which the book is an emanation
and which it has as its aim (לדעת חכמה, [Pro
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002).md), stands before us in
proportionally much more distinctly defined comprehension and form; we
have the same relation before us whose adumbration is the relation of
the instruction of wisdom in the Avesta and in the later Minochired
(Spiegel, Parsi-Grammatik, p. 182ff.). The Chokma appears also in the
"Proverbs of Solomon" as a being existing in and for itself, which is
opposed to ambiguous subjective thought ([Pro
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#026).md); but here there is attributed
to it an objectivity even to an apparent personality: it goes forth
preaching, and places before all men life and death for an eternally
decisive choice, it distributes the spirit of those who do not resist
([Pro 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023).md), it receives and answers
prayer ([Pro 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028).md). The speculation
regarding the Chokma is here with reference to Job 28 (cf. [Pro
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#004.md); [Pro
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014.md)., [Pro
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#011.md), [Pro
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#019).md), and particularly to [Job
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#027.md), where a demiurgic function is
assigned to wisdom, carried back to its source in eternity: it is the
medium by which the world was created, [Pro
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019.md); it was before the creation of
the world with God as from everlasting, His son of royal dignity, [Pro
8:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md); it was with Him in His work
of creation, [Pro 8:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#027.md); after the
creation it remained as His delight, rejoicing always before Him, and
particularly on the earth among the sons of men, [Pro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030.md). Staudenmaier (Lehre von der
Idee, p. 37) is certainly not on the wrong course, when under this
rejoicing of wisdom before God he understands the development of the
ideas or life-thoughts intimately bound up in it - the world-idea. This
development is the delight of God, because it represents to the divine
contemplation of the contents of wisdom, or of the world-idea founded in
the divine understanding, in all its activities and inner harmonies; it
is a calm delight, because the divine idea unites with the fresh and
every young impulse of life, the purity, goodness, innocence, and
holiness of life, because its spirit is light, clear, simple, childlike,
in itself peaceful, harmonious, and happy; and this delight is
experienced especially on the earth among the sons of men, among whom
wisdom has its delight; for, as the divine idea, it is in all in so far
as it is the inmost life-thought, the soul of each being, but it is on
the earth of men in whom it comes to its self-conception, and
self-conscious comes forth into the light of the clear day. Staudenmaier
has done the great service of having worthily estimated the rich and
deep fulness of this biblical theologumenon of wisdom, and of having
pointed out in it the foundation-stone of a sacred metaphysics and a
means of protection against pantheism in all its forms. We see that in
the time of the editor of the older Book of Proverbs the wisdom of the
schools in its devotion to the chosen object of its pursuit, the divine
wisdom living and moving in all nature, and forming the background of
all things, rises to a height of speculation on which it has planted a
banner showing the right way to latest times. Ewald rightly points to
the statements in the introduction to the Proverbs regarding wisdom as a
distinct mark of the once great power of wisdom in Israel; for they show
us how this power learned to apprehend itself in its own purest height,
after it had become as perfect, and at the same time also as
self-conscious, as it could at all become in ancient Israel.

Many other appearances also mark the advanced type of instruction
contained in the introduction. Hitzig's view (Sprche, p. xvii.f.), that
Prov 1:6-9:18 are the part of the whole collection which was earliest
written, confutes itself on all sides; on the contrary, the views of
Bleek in his Introduction to the Old Testament, thrown out in a sketchy
manner and as if by a diviner, surprisingly agree with our own results,
which have been laboriously reached and are here amply established. The
advanced type of instruction in the introduction, chap. 1-9, appears
among other things in this, that we there find the allegory, which up to
this place occurs in Old Testament literature only in scattered little
pictures built up into independent poetic forms, particularly in chap.
9, where without any contradiction אושׁת כּסילוּת a simple woman, [Pro
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#013.md) is an allegorical person. The
technical language of the Chokma has extended itself on many sides and
been refined (we mention these synonyms: חכמה, דּעת, בּינה, ערמה, מזמּה,
מוּסר, תּוּשׁיּה); and the seven pillars in the house of wisdom, even
though it be inadmissible to think of them as the seven liberal arts,
yet point to a division into seven parts of which the poet was conscious
to himself. The common address, בּני \[my son\], which is not the
address of the father to the son, but of the teacher to the scholar,
countenances the supposition that there were at that time בּני חכמים,
i.e., scholars of the wise men, just as there were "sons of the
prophets" (נּבאים), and probably also schools of wisdom. "And when it is
described how wisdom spake aloud to the people in all the streets of
Jerusalem, in the high places of the city and in every favourable place,
does not one feel that such sublime descriptions could not be possible
unless at that time wisdom were regarded by the people as one of the
first powers, and the wise men truly displayed a great public activity?"
We must answer this question of Ewald's in the affirmative.

Bruch, in his Weisheitslehre der Hebraer, 1851, was the first to call
special attention to the Chokma or humanism as a peculiar intellectual
tendency in Israel; but he is mistaken in placing it in an indifferent
and even hostile relation to the national law and the national cultus,
which he compares to the relation of Christian philosophy to orthodox
theology. Oehler, in his Grundzge der alttestamentl. Weisheit, which
treats more especially of the doctrinal teachings of the Book of Job,
judges more correctly; cf. also his comprehensive article, Pdagogik des
A. T. in Schmid's Pdagogischer Encyclopdie, pp. 653-695 (partic.
677-683).

5\. The Alexandrian Translation of the Book of Proverbs

Of highest interest for the history of the Book of Proverbs is the
relation of the lxx to the Hebrew text. One half of the proverbs of Agur
(30 of the Hebrew text) are placed in it after [Pro
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022.md), and the other half after [Pro
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#034.md); and the proverbs of King Lemuel
([Pro 31:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001) of the Hebrew text.md) are
placed after the proverbs of Agur, while the acrostic proverbial poem of
the virtuous woman is in its place at the end of the book. That
transposition reminds us of the transpositions in Jeremiah, and rests in
the one place as well as in the other on a misunderstanding of the true
contents. The translator has set aside the new superscription, [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md), as unsuitable, and has not
marked the new beginning, [Pro 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md);
he has expunged the new superscription, [Pro
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md), and has done the same to the
superscription, "The words of Agur" ([Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001).md), in two awkward explanations
(λόγον φυλασσόμενος and τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους φοβήθητι), and the
superscription, "The words of Lemuel" ([Pro
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001).md), in one similar (οἱ ἐμοὶ λόγι
εἴρηνται ὑπὸ Θεοῦ), so that the proverbs of Agur and of Lemuel are
without hesitation joined with those of Solomon, whereby it yet remains
a mystery why the proverbs beginning with "The words of Agur" have been
divided into two parts. Hitzig explains it from a confounding of the
columns in which, two being on each page, the Hebrew MS which lay before
the translator was written, and in which the proverbs of Agur and of
Lemuel (names which tradition understood symbolically of Solomon) were
already ranked in order before chap. 25. But besides these, there are
also many other singular things connected with this Greek translation
interesting in themselves and of great critical worth. That it omits
[Pro 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md) may arise from this, that
this verse was not found in the original MS, and was introduced from
[Isa 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md); but there are wanting also
proverbs such as [Isa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#005.md), for which
no reason can be assigned. But the additions are disproportionately more
numerous. Frequently we find a line added to the distich, such as in
[Pro 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#018.md), or an entire distich added,
as [Pro 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md); or of two lines of the
Hebrew verse, each is formed into a separate distich, as [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md); [Pro
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#016.md); or we meet with longer
interpolations, extending far beyond this measure, as that added to [Pro
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027.md). Many of these proverbs are
easily re-translated into the Hebrew, as that added to [Pro
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027.md), consisting of four lines:

כי דרכי מימינים ידע יהוה

ועקשׁים דרכי משׂמאילים

הוא יפלם מעגלותיך

ארחותיך בשׂלום יצלית

But many of them also sound as if they had been originally Greek; e.g.,
the lines appended to [Pro 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md); [Pro
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015.md); the distich, [Pro
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011.md); the imperfect tristich, [Pro
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014.md); and the formless train, [Pro
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#010.md). The value of these enlargements
is very diverse; not a few of these proverbs are truly thoughtful, such
as the addition to [Pro 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013.md) -

He who is of mild countenance findeth mercy;

He who is litigious crushes souls

and singularly bold in imagery, as the addition to [Pro
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012.md) -

He who supports himself by lies hunts after (רעה) the wind,

He catches at fluttering birds;

For he forsakes the ways of his own vineyard,

And wanders away from the paths of his own field,

And roams through arid steppes and a thirsty land,

And gathers with his hand withered heath.

The Hebrew text lying before the Alexandrian translators had certainly
not all these additions, yet in many passages, such as [Pro
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#016.md), it is indeed a question whether
it is not to be improved from the lxx; and in other passages, where, if
one reads the Greek, the Hebrew words naturally take their place,
whether these are not at least old Hebrew marginal notes and
interpolations which the translation preserves. But this version itself
has had its gradual historical development. The text, the κοινή
(communis), proceeds from the Hexaplar text edited by Origen, which
received from him many and diverse revisions; and in the times before
Christ, perhaps (as Hitz. supposes), down to the second century after
Christ, the translation itself, not being regarded as complete, as in
the progress of growth, for not unfrequently two different translations
of one and the same proverb stand together, as [Pro
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#022.md); [Pro
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#025.md) (where also the Peshito follows
the lxx after which it translates), or also interpenetrate one another,
as [Pro 22:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008.md). These doubled
translations are of historical importance both in relation to the text
and to the interpretation of it. Along with the Books of Samuel and
Jeremiah, there is no book in regard to which the lxx can be of higher
significance than the Book of Proverbs; we shall seek in the course of
our exposition duly to estimate the text

(Note: Cf. also J. Gottlob Jger's Observationes in Proverbiorum
Salomonis Versionem Alexandrinam, 1788; de Lagarde's Anmerkungen zur
griech. Ueberstezung der Proverbien, 1863; M. Heidenheim's Zur
Textkritik der Proverbien, in his Quarterly Journal for German and
English Theological Criticism and Investigation, No. VIII (1865), and
IX, XI (1866). The text of the lxx (cf. Angelo Mari's Classici Auctores,
t. ix.) used by Procopius in his Ἡρμηνεία εἰς τὰς παροιμίας is peculiar,
and here and there comes near to the Hebrew original. The scholion of
Evagrius in the Σχόλια εἰς τὰς παροιμίας of Origen, edited by
Tischendorf in his Notitia, 1860, from a MS of Patmos, shows how soon
even the Hexaplar text became ambiguous.)

as adopted by Bertheau (1847) and Hitzig (1858) in their commentaries,
and by Ewald in his Jahrb. xi. (1861) and his commentary (2nd ed. 1867).
The historical importance of the Egyptian text-recension is heightened
by this circumstance, that the old Syrian translator of the Solomonic
writings had before him not only the original text, but also the lxx;
for the current opinion, that the Peshito, as distinguished from the
Syro-Hexaplar version, sprang solely from the original text with the
assistance of the Targum, is more and more shown to be erroneous. In the
Book of Proverbs the relation of the Peshito and Targum is even the
reverse; the Targum of the Proverbs, making use of the Peshito, restores
the Masoretic text - the points of contact with the lxx showing
themselves here and there, are brought about

(Note: Cf. Dathe, De ratione consensus Versionis Syriacae el Chaldaicae
Proverbiorum Salomonis (1764), edited by Rosenmller in his Opuscula.
Maybaum, in the Treatise on the Language of the Targum to the Proverbs
and its relation to the Syriac, in Merx's Archiv, ii. 66-93, labours in
vain to give the priority to that of the Targum: the Targum is written
from the Peshito, and here and there approaches the Hebrew text; the
language is, with few differences, the Syriac of the original.)

by the Peshito. But that Jerome, in his translation of the Vulgate
according to the Hebraea veritas, sometimes follows the lxx in
opposition to the original text, is to be explained with Hitzig from the
fact that he based his work on an existing Latin translation made from
the lxx. Hence it comes that the two distichs added in the lxx to [Pro
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027.md) remain in his work, and that
instead of the one distich, [Pro 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#006.md),
we have two: - In abundanti (after the phrase בּרב instead of בּית of
the Masoretic text) justitia virtus maxima est, cogitationes autem
impiroum eradicabuntur. Domus (בּית) justi plurima fortitudo, et in
fructibus impii conturbatio; for Jerome has adopted the two translations
of the lxx, correcting the second according to the original text.

(Note: The Ethiopic translation, also, is in particular points, as well
as on the whole, dependent on the lxx, for it divides the Book of
Proverbs into proverbs (παροιμίας), chap. 1-24, and instructions
(παιδεῖαι) of Solomon, chap. 25-31. Vid., Dillmann in Ewald's Jahrb. v.
147, 150.)

The fragments of the translations of Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion,
etc., contained in Greek and Syrian sources, have been recently
collected, more perfectly than could have been done by Montfaucon, by
Fried. Field, in his work Origenis Hexaplorum quae supersunt, etc.
(Oxonii, 1867, 4). Of special interest is the more recent translation of
the original text, existing only in a MS laid up in the Library of St.
Mark at Venice, executed in bold language, rich in rare and newly
invented words, by an unknown author, and belonging to an age which has
not yet been determined (Graecus Venetus): cf. d'Ansse de Villoison's
nova versio Graeca Proverbiorum, Ecclesiastis, Cantici Canticorum, etc.,
Argentorati, 1784; and also the Animadversiones thereto of Jo. Ge.
Dahler, 1786.
