### [Micah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 2:0</span></span>

Guilt and Punishment of Israel. Its Future Restoration - [Mic
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

After having prophesied generally in ch. 1 of the judgment that would
fall upon both kingdoms on account of their apostasy from the living
God, Micah proceeds in [Mic 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md) to
condemn, as the principal sins, the injustice and oppressions on the
part of the great ([Mic 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md), [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002).md), for which the nation was to be
driven away from its inheritance ([Mic
2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003).md). He then vindicates this
threat, as opposed to the prophecies of the false prophets, who
confirmed the nation in its ungodliness by the lies that they told ([Mic
2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006).md); and then closes with the
brief but definite promise, that the Lord would one day gather together
the remnant of His people, and would multiply it greatly, and make it
His kingdom ([Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md), [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013).md). As this promise applies to all
Israel of the twelve tribes, the reproof and threat of punishment are
also addressed to the house of Jacob as such ([Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007).md), and apply to both kingdoms.
There are no valid grounds for restricting them to Judah, even though
Micah may have had the citizens of that kingdom more particularly in his
mind.

[Micah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 2:1</span></span>

The violent acts of the great men would be punished by God with the
withdrawal of the inheritance of His people, or the loss of Canaan. [Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md). "Woe to those who devise
mischief, and prepare evil upon their beds! In the light of the morning
they carry it out, for their hand is their God. [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002.md). They covet fields and plunder;
them, and houses and take them; and oppress the man and his house, the
man and his inheritance." The woe applies to the great and mighty of the
nation, who by acts of injustice deprive the common people of the
inheritance conferred upon them by the Lord (cf. [Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008).md). The prophet describes them as
those who devise plans by night upon their beds for robbing the poor,
and carry them out as soon as the day dawns. חשׁב און denotes the
sketching out of plans (see [Psa
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005).md); and פּעל רע, to work evil, the
preparation of the ways and means for carrying out their wicked plans.
פּעל, the preparation, is distinguished from עשׁה, the execution, as in
[Isa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004.md), for which יצר and עשׂה are
also used (e.g., [Isa 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007).md). "Upon
their beds," i.e., by night, the time of quiet reflection ([Psa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005.md); cf. [Job
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013).md). "By the light of the morning,"
i.e., at daybreak, without delay. כּי ישׁ וגו, lit., "for their hand is
for a god," i.e., their power passes as a god to them; they know of no
higher power than their own arm; whatever they wish it is in their power
to do (cf. [Gen 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029.md); [Pro
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md); [Hab
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011.md); [Job
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006).md). Ewald and Rckert weaken the
thought by adopting the rendering, "because it stands free in their
hand;" and Hitzig's rendering, "if it stands in their hand," is
decidedly false. Kı̄ cannot be a conditional particle here, because the
thought would thereby be weakened in a manner quite irreconcilable with
the context. In [Mic 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002.md) the evil
which they plan by night, and carry out by day, is still more precisely
defined. By force and injustice they seize upon the property (fields,
houses) of the poor, the possessions which the Lord has given to His
people for their inheritance. Châmad points to the command against
coveting ([Exo 20:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#014.md); cf. [Deu
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#018).md). The second half of the verse
([Mic 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002).md) contains a conclusion drawn
from the first: "and so they practise violence upon the man and his
property." Bēth answers to bottı̄m, and nachălâh to the Sâdōth, as their
hereditary portion in the land - the portion of land which each family
received when Canaan was divided.

[Micah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 2:3</span></span>

"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I devise evil concerning this
family, from which ye shall not withdraw your necks, and not walk
loftily, for it is an evil time. [Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004.md). In that day will men raise
against you a proverb, and lament a lamentation. It has come to pass,
they say; we are waste, laid waste; the inheritance of my people he
exchanges: how does he withdraw it from me! To the rebellious one he
divides our field." The punishment introduced with lâkhēn (therefore)
will correspond to the sin. Because they reflect upon evil, to deprive
their fellow-men of their possessions, Jehovah will bring evil upon this
generation, lay a heavy yoke upon their neck, out of which they will not
be able to necks, and under which they will not be able to walk loftily,
or with extended neck. המּשׁפּחה הזּאת is not this godless family, but
the whole of the existing nation, whose corrupt members are to be
exterminated by the judgment (see [Isa
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020)..md). The yoke which the Lord will
bring upon them is subjugation to the hostile conqueror of the land and
the oppression of exile (see [Jer
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012).md). Hâlakh rōmâh, to walk on high,
i.e., with the head lifted up, which is a sign of pride and haughtiness.
Rōmâh is different from קוממיּוּת, an upright attitude, in [Lev
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#013.md). כּי עת רעה, as in [Amo
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013.md), but in a different sense, is not
used of moral depravity, but of the distress which will come upon Israel
through the laying on of the yoke. Then will the opponents raise
derisive songs concerning Israel, and Israel itself will bewail its
misery. The verbs yissâ', nâhâh, and 'âmar are used impersonally. Mâshâl
is not synonymous with nehı̄, a mournful song (Ros.), but signifies a
figurative saying, a proverb-song, as in [Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md); [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md). The subject to ישּׂא is the
opponents of Israel, hence עליכם; on the other hand, the subject to
nâhâh and 'âmar is the Israelites themselves, as נשׁדּנוּ teaches. נהיה
is not a feminine formation from נהי, a mournful song, lamentum lamenti,
i.e., a mournfully mournful song, as Rosenmller, Umbreit, and the
earlier commentators suppose; but the niphal of היה (cf. [Dan
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#027).md): actum est! it is all over! - an
exclamation of despair (Le de Dieu, Ewald, etc.); and it is written
after 'âmar, because נהיה as an exclamation is equivalent in meaning to
an object. The omission of the copula Vav precludes our taking 'âmar in
connection with what follows (Maurer). The following clauses are a still
further explanation of נהיה: we are quite laid waste. The form נשׁדּנוּ
for נשׁדּונוּ is probably chosen simply to imitate the tone of
lamentation better (Hitzig). The inheritance of my people, i.e., the
land of Canaan, He (Jehovah) changes, i.e., causes it to pass over to
another possessor, namely, to the heathen. The words receive their
explanation from the clauses which follow: How does He cause (sc., the
inheritance) to depart from me! Not how does He cause me to depart.
לשׁובב is not an infinitive, ad reddendum, or restituendum, which is
altogether unsuitable, but nomen verbale, the fallen or rebellious one,
like שׁובבה in [Jer 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#022.md); [Jer
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#004.md). This is the term applied by
mourning Israel to the heathenish foe, to whom Jehovah apportions the
fields of His people. The withdrawal of the land is the just punishment
for the way in which the wicked great men have robbed the people of
their inheritance.

[Micah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 2:5</span></span>

"Therefore wilt thou have none to cast a measure for the lot in the
congregation of Jehovah." With lâkhēn (therefore) the threat, commenced
with lâkhēn in [Mic 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003.md), is resumed
and applied to individual sinners. The whole nation is not addressed in
לך, still less the prophet, as Hitzig supposes, but every individual
among the tyrannical great men ([Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md), [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002).md). The singular is used instead of
the plural, to make the address more impressive, that no one may imagine
that he is excepted from the threatened judgment. For a similar
transition from the plural to the singular, see [Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010.md). The expression, to cast the
measure begōrâl, i.e., in the nature of a lot (equivalent to for a lot,
or as a lot), may be explained on the ground that the land was divided
to the Israelites by lot, and then the portion that fell to each tribe
was divided among the different families by measure. The words are not
to be taken, however, as referring purely to the future, as Caspari
supposes, i.e., to the time when the promised land would be divided
afresh among the people on their return. For even if the prophet does
proclaim in [Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md), [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md) the reassembling of Israel and
its restoration to its hereditary land, this thought cannot be
arbitrarily taken for granted here. We therefore regard the words as
containing a general threat, that the ungodly will henceforth receive no
further part in the inheritance of the Lord, but that they are to be
separated from the congregation of Jehovah.

[Micah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 2:6</span></span>

As such a prophecy as this met with violent contradiction, not only from
the corrupt great men, but also from the false prophets who flattered
the people, Micah indicates it by showing that the people are abusing
the long-suffering and mercy of the Lord; and that, by robbing the
peaceable poor, the widows, and the orphans, they are bringing about the
punishment of banishment out of the land. [Mic
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006). "Drip not (prophesy not.md), they
drip: if they drip not this, the shame will not depart. [Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md). Thou, called house of Jacob, is
the patience of Jehovah short, then? or is this His doing? Are not my
words good to him that walketh uprightly?" הטּיף, to drip, to cause
words to flow, used of prophesying, as in [Amo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016.md). The speakers in [Mic
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md) are not the Jews generally, or the
rich oppressors who have just been punished and threatened. The word
yattı̄phū does not agree with this, since it does not mean to chatter,
but to prophesy, as [Mic 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md) and also
the primary passage [Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md) show.
But Micah could not call the rich men's speaking prophesying. It is
rather false prophets who are speaking, - namely, those who in the word
'al-tattı̄phū (prophesy not) would prohibit the true prophets from
predicting the judgments of the Lord. The second hemistich is rendered
by most of the modern commentators, "they are not to chatter (preach) of
such things; the reproaches cease not," or "there is no end to
reproaching" (Ewald, Hitzig, Maurer, and Caspari). But this is open to
the following objections: (1) That הטּיף ל in [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md) means to prophesy to a person
(not concerning or of anything); (2) that sūg or nâsag means to depart,
not to cease; (3) that even the thought, "the reproaches to not cease,"
is apparently unsuitable, since Micah could not well call a prohibition
against prophesying an incessant reproach; and to this we may add, (4)
the grammatical harshness of taking לא יטּיפוּ as an imperative, and the
following לא יסּג as an indicative (a simple declaration). Still less
can the rendering, "they (the true prophets) will not chatter about
this, yet the reproach will not depart" (Ros., Rckert), be vindicated,
as such an antithesis as this would necessarily be indicated by a
particle. The only course that remains, therefore, is that adopted by C.
B. Michaelis and Hengstenberg, viz., to take the words as conditional:
if they (the true prophets) do not prophesy to these (the unrighteous
rich in [Mic 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md), [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002) : Hengstenberg.md), or on account of
these things (Michaelis), the shame will not depart, i.e., shameful
destruction will burst incessantly upon them. On the absence of the
conditional אם, see Ewald, p. 357, b. Such addresses as these do not
please the corrupt great men; but they imagine that such threats are
irreconcilable with the goodness of Jehovah. This is the connection of
[Mic 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md), in which the prophet meets
the reproach cast upon his threatening words with the remark, that God
is not wrathful, and has no love for punishing, but that He is stirred
up to wrath by the sins of the nation, and obliged to punish. האמוּר is
not an exclamation, "O, what is said! = O for such talk as this!"
(Ewald, Umbreit, Caspari); for it cannot be shown that the participle is
ever used in this way, and it cannot be supported from הפכּכם in [Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md), especially as here a second
vocative would follow. Nor is it a question: Num dicendum? Dare one say
this?" (Hitzig). For although he might be an interrogative particle (cf.
[Eze 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#009).md), the passive participle
cannot express the idea of daring, in support of which Hitzig is quite
wrong in appealing to [Lev 11:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#047.md) and
Psalm 22:32. האמוּר is not doubt a vocative, but it is to be taken in
connection with bēth-Ya‛aqōb: thou who art called house of Jacob. There
is very little force in the objection, that this would have required
האמוּר לך ב י, since אמר, when used in the sense of being called or
being named, is always construed with ל of the person bearing the name.
The part. pal of 'âmar only occurs here; and although the niphal, when
used in this sense, is generally construed with ל, the same rule may
apply to אמר as to קרא in the sense of naming, - namely, that in the
passive construction the ל may either be inserted or omitted (cf. [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md); [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md); [Deu
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013).md), and האמוּר may just as well be
used in the sense of dicta (domus) as הנּקראים in [Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md) in the sense of vocati = qui
appellantur. The whole nation is addressed, although the address points
especially to the unrighteous great men. Is Jehovah indeed wrathful?
i.e., has He not patience, does He not exercise long-suffering? Qātsar
rūăch must not be explained according to [Exo
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009.md), but according to [Pro
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027.md). Or are these ('ēlleh, the
punishments threatened) His deeds? i.e., is He accustomed, or does He
only like to punish? The answer to these questions, or speaking more
correctly, their refutation, follows in the next question, which is
introduced with the assuring הלוא, and in which Jehovah speaks: My words
deal kindly with him that walks uprightly. The Lord not only makes
promises to the upright, but He also grants His blessing. The words of
the Lord contain their fulfilment within themselves. In היּשׁר הולך, it
is for the sake of emphasis that yâshâr stands first, and the article
properly belongs to hōlēkh; but it is placed before yshr to bind
together the two words into one idea. The reason why the Lord threatens
by His prophets is therefore to be found in the unrighteousness of the
people.

[Micah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 2:8</span></span>

"But yesterday my people rises up as en enemy: off from the garment ye
draw the cloak from those who pass by carelessly, averted from war. [Mic
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009.md). The women of my people ye drive
away out of the house of their delights; from their children ye take my
ornament for ever." 'Ethmūl, yesterday, lately, not = long ago, but, as
yeqōmēm shows, denoting an action that is repeated, equivalent to
"again, recently." קומם is not used here in a causative sense, "to set
up," but as an intensified kal, to take a standing = to stand up or rise
up. The causative view, They set up my people as an enemy (Ewald),
yields no fitting sense; and if the meaning were, "My people causes me
to rise up as its enemy" (Caspari), the suffixes could not be omitted.
If this were the thought, it would be expressed as clearly as in [Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010.md). There is no valid ground for
altering the text, as Hitzig proposes. It is not stated against whom the
people rise up as an enemy, but according to the context it can only be
against Jehovah. This is done by robbing the peaceable travellers, as
well as the widows and orphans, whereby they act with hostility towards
Jehovah and excite His wrath ([Exo
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021.md).; [Deu
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#019).md). ממּוּל שׂלמה, from before,
i.e., right away from, the garment. Salmâh is the upper garment; אדר =
אדּרת the broad dress-cloak. They take this away from those who pass
carelessly by. שׁוּבי is an intransitive participle: averted from the
war, averse to conflict, i.e., peaceably disposed (see [Psa
120:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#007).md). We have not only to think of
open highway robbery, but also of their taking away the cloak in the
public street from their own poor debtors, when they are walking
peaceably along, suspecting nothing, for the purpose of repaying
themselves. The "wives of my people" are widows, whom they deprive of
house and home, and indeed widows of the people of Jehovah, in whose
person Jehovah is injured. These children are fatherless orphans (עלליה
with a singular suffix: the children of the widow). Hădârı̄, my ornament,
i.e., the ornament which I have given them. The reference, as מעל shows,
is to the garment or upper coat. The expression "for ever" may be
explained from the evident allusion to the Mosaic law in [Exo
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md), according to which the coat
taken from the poor as a pledge was to be returned before sunset,
whereas ungodly creditors retained it for ever.

[Micah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 2:10</span></span>

Such conduct as this must be followed by banishment from the land. [Mic
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010.md). "Rise up, and go; for this is
not the place of rest: because of the defilement which brings
destruction, and mighty destruction. [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md). If there were a man, walking
after wind, who would lie deceit, 'I will prophesy to thee of wine and
strong drink,' he would be a prophet of this people." The prophet having
overthrown in [Mic 2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md) the objection
to his threatening prophecies, by pointing to the sins of the people,
now repeats the announcement of punishment, and that in the form of a
summons to go out of the land into captivity, because the land cannot
bear the defilement consequent upon such abominations. The passage is
based upon the idea contained in [Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md), [Lev
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028.md), that the land is defiled by the
sins of its inhabitants, and will vomit them out because of this
defilement, in connection with such passages as [Deu
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009.md), where coming to Canaan is
described as coming to rest. זאת (this) refers to the land. This (the
land in which ye dwell) is not the place of rest (hammenūchâh, as in
[Zac 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md) and [Psa
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014).md). If "this" were to be taken as
referring to their sinful conduct, in the sense of "this does not bring
or cause rest," it would be difficult to connect it with what follows,
viz., "because of the defilement;" whereas no difficulty arises if we
take "this" as referring to the land, which the expression "rise up and
go" naturally suggests. טמאה = טמאה, defilement; תּחבּל is to be taken
in a relative sense, "which brings destruction," and is strengthened by
לחבל, with an explanatory ו: and indeed terrible destruction. חבל,
perditio; and נמרץ as in [Kg1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008.md). The
destruction consists in the fact that the land vomits out its
inhabitants ([Lev 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025).md). Such
prophecies are very unwelcome to the corrupt great men, because they do
not want to hear the truth, but simply what flatters their wicked heart.
They would like to have only prophets who prophesy lies to them. הולך
רוּח, walking after the wind; the construction is the same as הולך צדקות
in [Isa 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md), and rūăch is a figure
signifying what is vain or worthless, as in [Isa
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#018.md); [Isa
41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029.md), etc. The words אטּיף לך וגו are
the words of a false prophet: I prophesy to thee with regard to wine.
The meaning is not "that there will be an abundant supply of wine," or
"that the wine will turn out well" (Rosenmller and others); but wine and
strong drink (for shēkhâr, see Delitzsch on [Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011).md) are figures used to denote
earthly blessings and sensual enjoyments, and the words refer to such
promises as [Lev 26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004.md), [Lev
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#010.md), [Deu
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004.md), [Deu
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#011.md), [Joe
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#024.md); [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md)., which false prophets held out
to the people without any regard to their attitude towards God. "This
people," because the great men represent the nation. With this
explanation pointing back to [Mic 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md),
the threatening is brought to a close.

[Micah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 2:12</span></span>

In [Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md), [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md) there follows, altogether without
introduction, the promise of the future reassembling of the people from
their dispersion. [Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md). "I will
assemble, assemble thee all together, O Jacob; gather together, gather
together the remnant of Israel; I will bring him together like the sheep
of Bozrah, like a flock in the midst of their pasture: they will be
noisy with men. [Mic 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md). The breaker
through comes up before them; they break through, and pass along through
the gate, and go out by it; and their King goes before them, and Jehovah
at their head." Micah is indeed not a prophet, prophesying lies of wine
and strong drink; nevertheless he also has salvation to proclaim, only
not for the morally corrupt people of his own time. They will be
banished out of the land; but the captivity and dispersion are not at an
end. For the remnant of Israel, for the nation when sifted and refined
by the judgments, the time will come when the Lord will assemble them
again, miraculously multiply them, and redeem them as their King, and
lead them home. The sudden and abrupt transition from threatening to
promise, just as in [Hos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002.md); [Hos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md); [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md), has given rise to this mistaken
supposition, that [Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md), [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md) contain a prophecy uttered by the
lying prophets mentioned in [Mic 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010.md)
(Abenezra, Mich., Ewald, etc.). But this supposition founders not only
on the שׁארית ישׂראל, inasmuch as the gathering together of the remnant
of Israel presupposes the carrying away into exile, but also on the
entire contents of these verses. Micah could not possibly introduce a
false prophet as speaking in the name of Jehovah, and saying, "I will
gather;" such a man would at the most have said, "Jehovah will gather."
Nor could he have put a true prophecy like that contained in [Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md), [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md) into the mouth of such a man. For
this reason, not only Hengstenberg, Caspari, and Umbreit, but even
Maurer and Hitzig, have rejected this assumption; and the latter
observes, among other things, quite correctly, that "the idea expressed
here is one common to the true prophets (see [Hos
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002).md), which Micah himself also utters
in [Mic 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md)." The emphasis lies upon
the assembling, and hence אאסף and אקבּץ are strengthened by infinitive
absolutes. But the assembling together presuppose a dispersion among the
heathen, such as Micha has threatened in [Mic
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011.md), [Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016.md); [Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004.md). And the Lord will gather together
all Jacob, not merely a portion, and yet only the remnant of Israel.
This involves the thought, that the whole nation of the twelve tribes,
or of the two kingdoms, will be reduced to a remnant by the judgment.
Jacob and Israel are identical epithets applied to the whole nation, as
in [Mic 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005.md), and the two clauses of
the verse are synonymous, so that יעקב כּלּך coincides in actual fact
with שׁאתית ישׂראל. The further description rests upon the fact of the
leading of Israel out of Egypt, which is to be renewed in all that is
essential at a future time. The following clauses also predict the
miraculous multiplication of the remnant of Israel (see [Hos
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001.md); [Jer
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#010).md), as experienced by the people
in the olden time under the oppression of Egypt ([Exo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#012).md). The comparison to the flock of
Bozrah presupposes that Bozrah's wealth in flocks was well known. Now,
as the wealth of the Moabites in flocks of sheep is very evident from
[Kg2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md), many have understood by
בּצרה not the Edomitish Bozrah, but the Moabitish Bostra (e.g.,
Hengstenberg). Others, again, take botsrâh as an appellative noun in the
sense of hurdle or fold (see Hitzig, Caspari, and Dietrich in Ges. Lex.
after the Chaldee). But there is not sufficient ground for either. The
Bostra situated in the Hauran does not occur at all in the Old
Testament, not even in [Jer 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024.md), and
the appellative meaning of the word is simply postulated for this
particular passage. That the Edomites were also rich in flocks of sheep
is evident from [Isa 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#006.md), where the
massacre which Jehovah will inflict upon Edom and Bozrah is described as
a sacrificial slaughtering of lambs, he-goats, rams, and oxen; a
description which presupposes the wealth of Bozrah in natural flocks.
The comparison which follows, "like a flock in the midst of its
pasture," belongs to the last verse, and refers to the multiplication,
and to the noise made by a densely packed and numerous flock. The same
tumult will be made by the assembled Israelites on account of the
multitude of men. For the article in הדּברו, which is already determined
by the suffix, see at [Jos 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021.md). In
[Jos 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#013.md) the redemption of Israel out
of exile is depicted under the figure of liberation from captivity. Was
Egypt a slave-house ([Mic 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004.md); cf.
[Exo 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002).md); so is exile a prison with
walls and gates, which must be broken through. הפּריץ, the breaker
through, who goes before them, is not Jehovah, but, as the counterpart
of Moses the leader of Israel out of Egypt, the captain appointed by God
for His people, answering to the head which they are said to choose for
themselves in [Hos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002.md), a second
Moses, viz., Zerubbabel, and in the highest sense Christ, who opens the
prison-doors, and redeems the captives of Zion (vid., [Isa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007).md). Led by him, they break through
the walls, and march through the gate, and go out through it out of the
prison. "The three verbs, they break through, they march through, they
go out, describe in a pictorial manner progress which cannot be stopped
by any human power" (Hengstenberg). Their King Jehovah goes before them
at their head (the last two clauses of the verse are synonymous). Just
as Jehovah went before Israel as the angel of the Lord in the pillar of
cloud and fire at the exodus from Egypt ([Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021).md), so at the future redemption of
the people of God will Jehovah go before them as King, and lead the
procession (see [Isa 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012).md).

The fulfilment of this prophecy commenced with the gathering together of
Israel to its God and King by the preaching of the gospel, and will be
completed at some future time when the Lord shall redeem Israel, which
is now pining in dispersion, out of the fetters of its unbelief and life
of sin. We must not exclude all allusion to the deliverance of the
Jewish nation out of the earthly Babylon by Cyrus; at the same time, it
is only in its typical significance that this comes into consideration
at all, - namely, as a preliminary stage and pledge of the redemption to
be effected by Christ out of the spiritual Babylon of this world.
