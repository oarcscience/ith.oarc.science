War with the Philistines. Loss of the Ark.Death of Eli and His Sons - 1
Samuel 4

At Samuel's word, the Israelites attacked the Philistines, and were
beaten ([Sa1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001.md), [Sa1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#002).md). They then fetched the ark of the
covenant into the camp according to the advice of the elders, that they
might thereby make sure of the help of the almighty covenant God; but in
the engagement which followed they suffered a still greater defeat, in
which Eli's sons fell and the ark was taken by the Philistines ([Sa1
4:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003).md). The aged Eli, terrified at
such a loss, fell from his seat and broke his neck ([Sa1
4:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012).md); and his daughter-in-law was
taken in labour, and died after giving birth to a son ([Sa1
4:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#019).md). With these occurrences the
judgment began to burst upon the house of Eli. But the disastrous result
of the war was also to be a source of deep humiliation to all the
Israelites. Not only were the people to learn that the Lord had departed
from them, but Samuel also was to make the discovery that the
deliverance of Israel from the oppression and dominion of its foes was
absolutely impossible without its inward conversion to its God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 4:1</span></span>

The two clauses, "The word of Samuel came to all Israel," and "Israel
went out," etc., are to be logically connected together in the following
sense: "At the word or instigation of Samuel, Israel went out against
the Philistines to battle." The Philistines were ruling over Israel at
that time. This is evident, apart from our previous remarks concerning
the connection between the commencement of this book and the close of
the book of Judges, from the simple fact that the land of Israel was the
scene of the war, and that nothing is said about an invasion on the part
of the Philistines. The Israelites encamped at Ebenezer, and the
Philistines were encamped at Aphek. The name Ebenezer ("the stone of
help") was not given to the place so designated till a later period,
when Samuel set up a memorial stone there to commemorate a victory that
was gained over the Philistines upon the same chosen battle-field after
the lapse of twenty years ([Sa1 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012).md).
According to this passage, the stone was set up between Mizpeh and Shen.
The former was not the Mizpeh in the lowlands of Judah ([Jos
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#038).md), but the Mizpeh of Benjamin
([Jos 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026).md), i.e., according to
Robinson, the present Neby Samwil, two hours to the north-west of
Jerusalem, and half an hour to the south of Gibeon (see at [Jos
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026).md). The situation of Aphek has not
been discovered. It cannot have been far from Mizpeh and Ebenezer,
however, and was probably the same place as the Canaanitish capital
mentioned in [Jos 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018.md), and is
certainly different from the Aphekah upon the mountains of Judah ([Jos
15:53](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#053).md); for this was on the south or
south-west of Jerusalem, since, according to the book of Joshua, it
belonged to the towns that were situated in the district of Gibeon.

[Sa1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#002.md)

When the battle was fought, the Israelites were defeated by the
Philistines, and in battle-array four thousand men were smitten upon the
field. ערך, sc., מלחמה, as in [Jdg
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#020.md), [Jdg
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#022.md), etc. בּמּערכה, in battle-array,
i.e., upon the field of battle, not in flight. "In the field," i.e., the
open field where the battle was fought.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 4:3</span></span>

On the return of the people to the camp, the elders held a council of
war as to the cause of the defeat they had suffered. "Why hath Jehovah
smitten us to-day before the Philistines?" As they had entered upon the
war by the word and advice of Samuel, they were convinced that Jehovah
had smitten them. The question presupposes at the same time that the
Israelites felt strong enough to enter upon the war with their enemies,
and that the reason for their defeat could only be that the Lord, their
covenant God, had withdrawn His help. This was no doubt a correct
conclusion; but the means which they adopted to secure the help of their
God in continuing the war were altogether wrong. Instead of feeling
remorse and seeking the help of the Lord their God by a sincere
repentance and confession of their apostasy from Him, they resolved to
fetch the ark of the covenant out of the tabernacle at Shiloh into the
camp, with the delusive idea that God had so inseparably bound up His
gracious presence in the midst of His people with this holy ark, which
He had selected as the throne of His gracious appearance, that He would
of necessity come with it into the camp and smite the foe. In [Sa1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004.md), the ark is called "the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who is enthroned above the cherubim,"
partly to show the reason why the people had the ark fetched, and partly
to indicate the hope which they founded upon the presence of this sacred
object. (See the commentary on [Exo
25:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020).md). The remark introduced here,
"and the two sons of Eli were there with the ark of the covenant of
God," is not merely intended to show who the guardians of the ark were,
viz., priests who had hitherto disgraced the sanctuary, but also to
point forward at the very outset to the result of the measures adopted.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 4:5</span></span>

On the arrival of the ark in the camp, the people raised so great a
shout of joy that the earth rang again. This was probably the first time
since the settlement of Israel in Canaan, that the ark had been brought
into the camp, and therefore the people no doubt anticipated from its
presence a renewal of the marvellous victories gained by Israel under
Moses and Joshua, and for that reason raised such a shout when it
arrived.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 4:6</span></span>

When the Philistines heard the noise, and learned on inquiry that the
ark of Jehovah had come into the camp, they were thrown into alarm, for
"they thought (lit. said), God (Elohim) is come into the camp, and said,
'Woe unto us! For such a thing has not happened yesterday and the day
before (i.e., never till now). Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the
hand of these mighty gods? These are the very gods that smote Egypt with
all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.' " The Philistines spoke of the
God of Israel in the plural., האדּירים האלהים, as heathen who only knew
of gods, and not of one Almighty God. Just as all the heathen feared the
might of the gods of other nations in a certain degree, so the
Philistines also were alarmed at the might of the God of the Israelites,
and that all the more because the report of His deeds in the olden time
had reached their ears (see [Exo
15:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014).md). The expression "in the
wilderness" does not compel us to refer the words "smote with all the
plagues" exclusively to the destruction of Pharaoh and his army in the
Red Sea ([Exo 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#023)..md). "All the
plagues" include the rest of the plagues which God inflicted upon Egypt,
without there being any necessity to supply the copula ו before
בּמּדבּר, as in the lxx and Syriac. By this addition an antithesis is
introduced into the words, which, if it really were intended, would
require to be indicated by a previous בּארץ or בּארצם. According to the
notions of the Philistines, all the wonders of God for the deliverance
of Israel out of Egypt took place in the desert, because even when
Israel was in Goshen they dwelt on the border of the desert, and were
conducted thence to Canaan.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 4:9</span></span>

But instead of despairing, they encouraged one another, saying, "Show
yourselves strong, and be men, O Philistines, that we may not be obliged
to serve the Hebrews, as they have served you; be men, and fight!"

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 4:10</span></span>

Stimulated in this way, they fought and smote Israel, so that every one
fled home ("to his tent," see at [Jos
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#008).md), and 30,000 men of Israel fell.
The ark also was taken, and the two sons of Eli died, i.e., were slain
when the ark was taken, - a practical proof to the degenerate nation,
that Jehovah, who was enthroned above the cherubim, had departed from
them, i.e., had withdrawn His gracious presence.

(Note: "It is just the same now, when we take merely a historical Christ
outside us for our Redeemer. He must prove His help chiefly internally
by His Holy Spirit, to redeem us out of the hand of the Philistines;
though externally He must not be thrown into the shade, as accomplishing
our justification. If we had not Christ, we could never stand. For there
is no help in heaven and on earth beside Him. But if we have Him in no
other way than merely without us and under us, if we only preach about
Him, teach, hear, read, talk, discuss, and dispute about Him, take His
name into our mouth, but will not let Him work and show His power in us,
He will no more help us than the ark helped the Israelites." -
Berleburger Bible.)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 4:12</span></span>

The tidings of this calamity were brought by a Benjaminite, who came as
a messenger of evil tidings, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his
head - a sign of the deepest mourning (see [Jos
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#006).md), - to Shiloh, where the aged Eli
was sitting upon a seat by the side (יך is a copyist's error for יד) of
the way watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God, which had
been taken from the sanctuary into the camp without the command of God.
At these tidings the whole city cried out with terror, so that Eli heard
the sound of the cry, and asked the reason of this loud noise (or
tumult), whilst the messenger was hurrying towards him with the news.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 4:15</span></span>

Eli was ninety-eight years old, and "his eyes stood," i.e., were stiff,
so that he could no more see (vid., [Kg1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#004).md). This is a description of the
so-called black cataract (amaurosis), which generally occurs at a very
great age from paralysis of the optic nerves.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 4:16</span></span>

When the messenger informed him of the defeat of the Israelites, the
death of his sons, and the capture of the ark, at the last news Eli fell
back from his seat by the side of the gate, and broke his neck, and
died. The loss of the ark was to him the most dreadful of all - more
dreadful than the death of his two sons. Eli had judged Israel forty
years. The reading twenty in the Septuagint does not deserve the
slightest notice, if only because it is perfectly incredible that Eli
should have been appointed judge of the nation in his seventy-eight
year.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 4:19</span></span>

The judgment which fell upon Eli through this stroke extended still
further. His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child
(near) to be delivered. ללת, contracted from ללדת (from ילד: see Ges.
69, 3, note 1; Ewald, 238, c.). When she heard the tidings of the
capture (אל־הלּקח, "with regard to the being taken away") of the ark of
God, and the death of her father-in-law and husband, she fell upon her
knees and was delivered, for her pains had fallen upon her (lit. had
turned against her), and died in consequence. Her death, however, was
but a subordinate matter to the historian. He simply refers to it
casually in the words, "and about the time of her death," for the
purpose of giving her last words, in which she gave utterance to her
grief at the loss of the ark, as a matter of greater importance in
relation to his object. As she lay dying, the women who stood round
sought to comfort her, by telling her that she had brought forth a son;
but "she did not answer, and took no notice (לב שׁוּת = לב שׂוּם, animum
advertere; cf. [Psa 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011).md), but called
to the boy (i.e., named him), Ichabod (כבוד אי, no glory), saying, The
glory of Israel is departed," referring to the capture of the ark of
God, and also to her father-in-law and husband. She then said again,
"Gone (גּלה, wandered away, carried off) is the glory of Israel, for the
ark of God is taken." The repetition of these words shows how deeply the
wife of the godless Phinehas had taken to heart the carrying off of the
ark, and how in her estimation the glory of Israel had departed with it.
Israel could not be brought lower. With the surrender of the earthly
throne of His glory, the Lord appeared to have abolished His covenant of
grace with Israel; for the ark, with the tables of the law and the
capporeth, was the visible pledge of the covenant of grace which Jehovah
had made with Israel.
