### [Psalms Chapter 58](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 58:0</span></span>

Cry for Vengeance upon Those Who Pervert Justice

Their teeth, said [Psa 57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md), are
spear and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword; [Psa
58:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md) prays: crush their teeth in
their mouth. This prominent common thought has induced the collector to
append the one Michtam of David, to be sung altashcheth, to the other.
[Psa 58:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md), however, belongs to
another period, viz., to the time of Absalom. The incomparable boldness
of the language does not warrant us in denying it to David. In no one
Psalm do we meet with so many high-flown figures coming together within
the same narrow compass. But that it is David who speaks in this Psalm
is to a certain extent guaranteed by [Psa
64:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001.md) and [Psa
140:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md). These three Psalms, of which
the closing verses so closely resemble one another that they at once
invite comparison, show that the same David who writes elsewhere so
beautifully, tenderly, and clearly, is able among his manifold
transitions to rise to an elevation at which his words as it were roll
along like rumbling thunder through the gloomy darkness of the clouds,
and more especially where they supplicate ([Psa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007).md) or predict ([Psa
140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010).md) the judgment of God.

The cumulative use of כּמו in different applications is peculiar to this
Psalm. Its Michtam character becomes clearly defined in the closing
verse.

[Psalms 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 58:1</span></span>

The text of [Psa 58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002.md) runs: Do ye
really dictate the silence of righteousness? i.e., that before which
righteousness must become silent, as the collector (cf. [Psa
56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001).md) appears to have read it (אלם =
אלּוּם, B. Chullin 89a). But instead of אלם it is, with Houbigant, J. D.
Michaelis, Mendelssohn, and others, to be read אלם (= אלים, as in [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011).md), as an apostrophe of those who
discharge the godlike office of rulers and judges. Both the
interrogative האמנם (with ŭ as is always the case at the head of
interrogative clauses), num vere, which proceeds from doubt as to the
questionable matter of fact ([Num
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#037.md); [Kg1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md); [Ch2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#018).md), and the parallel member of the
verse, and also the historical circumstances out of which the Psalm
springs, demand this alteration. Absalom with his followers had made the
administration of justice the means of stealing from David the heart of
his people; he feigned to be the more impartial judge. Hence David asks:
Is it then really so, ye gods (אלים like אלהים, [Psa
82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md), and here, as there, not without
reference to their superhumanly proud and assumptive bearing), that ye
speak righteousness, that ye judge the children of men in accordance
with justice? Nay, on the contrary (אף, imo, introducing an answer that
goes beyond the first No), in heart (i.e., not merely outwardly allowing
yourselves to be carried away) ye prepare villanies (פּעל, as in [Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md); and עולת, as in [Psa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md), from עולה = עולה, Ps 92:16, [Job
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#016), with ô = a + w.md), in the land ye
weigh out the violence of your hands (so that consequently violence
fills the balances of your pretended justice). בּני אדם in [Psa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002.md) is the accusative of the object;
if it had been intended as a second vocative, it ought to have been
בּני־אישׁ ([Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003).md). The expression
is inverted in order to make it possible to use the heavy energetic
futures. בּארץ (mostly erroneously marked with Pazer) has Athnach, cf.
[Psa 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020.md); [Psa
76:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 58:3</span></span>

After this bold beginning the boldest figures follow one another
rapidly; and the first of these is that of the serpent, which is kept up
longer than any of the others. The verb זוּר (cogn. סוּר) is
intentionally written זור in this instance in a neuter, not an active
sense, plural זרוּ lar, like בּשׁוּ, טבוּ. Bakius recognises a
retrospective reference to this passage in [Isa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md). In such passages Scripture bears
witness to the fact, which is borne out by experience, that there are
men in whom evil from childhood onwards has a truly diabolical
character, i.e., a selfish character altogether incapable of love. For
although hereditary sinfulness and hereditary sin (guilt) are common to
all men, yet the former takes the most manifold combinations and forms;
and, in fact, the inheriting of sin and the complex influence of the
power of evil and of the power of grace on the propagation of the human
race require that it should be so. The Gospel of John more particularly
teaches such a dualism of the natures of men. חמת־למו (with Rebia, as in
[Joh 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018).md) is not the subject: the
poison belonging to them, etc., but a clause by itself: poison is to
them, they have poison; the construct state here, as in [Lam
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018.md); [Eze
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#027.md), does not express a relation of
actual union, but only a close connection. יאטּם (with the orthophonic
Dagesh which gives prominence to the Teth as the commencement of a
syllable) is an optative future form, which is also employed as an
indicative in the poetic style, e.g., [Psa
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md). The subject of this attributive
clause, continuing the adjective, is the deaf adder, such an one, viz.,
as makes itself deaf; and in this respect (as in their evil serpent
nature) it is a figure of the self-hardening evil-doer. Then with אשׁר
begins the more minute description of this adder. There is a difference
even among serpents. They belong to the worst among them that are
inaccessible to any kind of human influence. All the arts of sorcery are
lost upon them. מלחשׁים are the whisperers of magic formulae (cf. Arabic
naffathât, adjurations), and חובר חברים is one who works binding by
spells, exorcism, and tying fast by magic knots (cf. חבר, to bind = to
bewitch, cf. Arab. ‛qqd, ‛nn, Persic bend = κατάδεσμος, vid., Isaiah, i.
118, ii. 242). The most inventive affection and the most untiring
patience cannot change their mind. Nothing therefore remains to David
but to hope for their removal, and to pray for it.

[Psalms 58:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 58:6</span></span>

The verb הרס is used much in the same way in [Psa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007.md) as ἀράσσειν (e.g., Iliad, xiii.
577, ἀπὸ δὲ τρυφάλειαν ἄραξεν), which presents a similar onomatope. The
form ימּאסוּ is, as in [Job 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#005.md), =
ימּסּוּ. The Jewish expositors, less appropriately, compare צנאכם, [Num
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#024.md), and בּזאוּ = בּזזוּ, [Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md), [Isa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007.md); שׁאסיך, Chethb, [Jer
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#016.md), and ראמה, [Zac
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md), more nearly resemble it. The
treading (bending) of the bow is here, as in [Psa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004.md), transferred to the arrows (=
כּונן, [Psa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002).md): he bends and shoots
off his arrows, they shall be as though cut off in the front, i.e., as
inoperative as if they had no heads or points (כּמו as in [Isa
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#018).md). In [Psa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md) follow two figures to which the
apprecatory "let them become" is to be supplied. Or is it perhaps to be
rendered: As a snail, which Thou causest to melt away, i.e., squashest
with the foot (תּמס, as in [Psa 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#012.md),
fut. Hiph. of מסה = מסס), let him perish? The change of the number does
not favour this; and according to the usage of the language, which is
fond of construing הלך with gerunds and participles, and also with
abstract nouns, e.g., הלך תּם, הלך קרי, the words תּמס יהלך belong
together, and they are also accented accordingly: as a snail or slug
which goes along in dissolution, goes on and dissolves as it goes (תּמס
after the form תּבל form בּלל

(Note: In the Phoenician, the Cyprian copper mine Ταμασσός appears to
have taken its name from תמס, liquefactio (Levy, Phnizische Studien,
iii. 7).)).

The snail has received its name from this apparent dissolving into
slime. For שׁבּלוּל (with Dag. dirimens for שׁבלוּל) is the naked slimy
snail or slug (Targum, according to ancient conception, זחיל תּבללא "the
slimeworm"), from שׁבלל, to make wet, moist.

(Note: "God has created nothing without its use," says the Talmud, B.
Shabbath 77b; "He has created the snail (שׁבלול לכתית) to heal bruises
by laying it upon them:" cf. Genesis Rabba, ch. 51 init., where שׁבלול
is explained by לימצא, סיליי, כיליי, κογχύλη, σέσιλος, limax. Abraham b.
David of Fez, the contemporary of Saadia, has explained it in his
Arabico-Hebrew Lexicon by אלחלזון, the slug. Nevertheless this is
properly the name of the snail with a house (נרתיק), Talmudic חלּזון,
and even at the present day in Syria and Palestine Arab. ḥlzûn (which is
pronounced ḥalezôn); whereas שׁבלול, in conformity with the etymon and
with the figure, is the naked snail or slug. The ancient versions
perhaps failed to recognise this, because the slug is not very often to
be seen in hot eastern countries; but שׁבלול in this signification can
be looked upon as traditional. The rendering "a rain-brook or
mountain-torrent (Arabic seil sâbil) which running runs away," would, to
say nothing more, give us, as Rosenmller has already observed, a figure
that has been made use of already in [Psa
58:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#008)..md)

In the second figure, the only sense in which נפל אשׁת belong together
is "the untimely birth of a woman;" and rather than explain with the
Talmud (B. Med katan 6b) and Targum (contrary to the accents): as an
abortion, a mole,

(Note: The mole, which was thought to have no eyes, is actually called
in post-biblical Hebrew אשׁת, plur. אישׁות (vid., Keelim xxi. 3).)

one would alter אשׁת into אשׁה. But this is not necessary, since the
construct form אשׁת is found also in other instances ([Deu
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#011.md); [Sa1
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007).md) out of the genitival relation,
in connection with a close coordinate construction. So here, where
בּל־הזוּ שׁמשׁ, according to [Job
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#016.md); [Ecc
6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003.md), is an attributive clause to נפל
אשׁת (the falling away of a woman = abortions), which is used
collectively (Ew. 176, b). The accentuation also harmonizes here with
the syntactic relation of the words. In [Psa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md), אטד (plural in African, i.e.,
Punic, in Dioscorides atadi'n) is the rhamnus or buckthorn, which, like
רתם, the broom, not only makes a cheerful crackling fire, but also
produces an ash that retains the heat a long time, and is therefore very
useful in cooking. The alternative כּמו - כּמו signifies sive, sive,
whether the one or the other. חי is that which is living, fresh, viz.,
the fresh, raw meat still having the blood in it, the opposite of מבשּׁל
([Sa1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#015).md); חרון, a fierce heat or
fire, here a boiling heat. There is no need to understand חרון
metonymically, or perhaps as an adjective = charrôn, of boiled meat: it
is a statement of the condition. The suffix of ישׁערנּוּ, however,
refers, as being neuter, to the whole cooking apparatus, and more
especially to the contents of the pots. The rendering therefore is:
whether raw or in a state of heat, i.e., of being cooked through, He
(Jahve) carries it away as with a whirlwind. Hengstenberg rightly
remarks, "To the raw meat correspond the immature plots, and to the
cooked the mature ones." To us, who regard the Psalm as belonging to the
time of Absalom, and not, like Hengstenberg, to the time of Saul, the
meat in the pots is the new kingship of Absalom. The greater the
self-renunciation with which David at that time looked on at the
ripening revolt, disclaiming all action of his own, the stronger the
confidence with which he expected the righteous interposition of God
that did actually follow, but (as he here supposes possible) not until
the meat in the pot was almost done through; yet, on the other side, so
quickly, that the pots had scarcely felt the crackling heat which should
fully cook the meat.

[Psalms 58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 58:10</span></span>

Finally, we have a view of the results of the judicial interposition of
God. The expression made use of to describe the satisfaction which this
gives to the righteous is thoroughly Old Testament and warlike in its
tone (cf. [Psa 68:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#024).md). David is in
fact king, and perhaps no king ever remained so long quiet in the face
of the most barefaced rebellion, and checked the shedding of blood, as
David did at that time. If, however, blood must nevertheless flow in
streams, he knows full well that it is the blood of the partisans of his
deluded son; so that the men who were led the further astray in their
judgment concerning him, the more inactive he remained, will at last be
compelled to confess that it does really repay one to be just, and that
there is really one higher than the high ones ([Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007)\[8\]), a deity (אלהים.md) above the
gods (אלים( sdog) who, though not forthwith, will nevertheless assuredly
execute judgment in the earth. אך here, as in [Job
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#021.md); [Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014.md), retains its originally
affirmative signification, which it has in common with אכן. אלהים is
construed with the plural (Ges. 112, rem. 3), as is frequently the case,
e.g., [Sa2 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023.md) (where, however, the
chronicler, in [Ch1 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#021.md), has altered
the older text). This is not because the heathen are speaking (Baur),
but in order to set the infinite majesty and omnipotence of the heavenly
Judge in contrast with these puffed-up "gods."
