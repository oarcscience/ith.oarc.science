Spies Sent Out. Murmuring of the People, and Their Punishment - Numbers
13 and 14

When they had arrived at Kadesh, in the desert of Paran ([Num
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026).md), Moses sent out spies by the
command of God, and according to the wishes of the people, to explore
the way by which they could enter into Canaan, and also the nature of
the land, of its cities, and of its population (Num 13:1-20). The men
who were sent out passed through the land, from the south to the
northern frontier, and on their return reported that the land was no
doubt one of pre-eminent goodness, but that it was inhabited by a strong
people, who had giants among them, and were in possession of very large
fortified towns ([Num 13:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021).md);
whereupon Caleb declared that it was quite possible to conquer it,
whilst the others despaired of overcoming the Canaanites, and spread an
evil report among the people concerning the land ([Num
13:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030).md). The congregation then
raised a loud lamentation, and went so far in their murmuring against
Moses and Aaron, as to speak without reserve or secrecy of deposing
Moses, and returning to Egypt under another leader: they even wanted to
stone Joshua and Caleb, who tried to calm the excited multitude, and
urged them to trust in the Lord. But suddenly the glory of the Lord
interposed with a special manifestation of judgment ([Num
14:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001).md). Jehovah made known to Moses
His resolution to destroy the rebellious nation, but suffered Himself to
be moved by the intercession of Moses so far as to promise that He would
preserve the nation, though He would exclude the murmuring multitude
from the promised land ([Num
14:11-25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011).md). He then directed Moses and
Aaron to proclaim to the people the following punishment for their
repeated rebellion: that they should bear their iniquity for forty years
in the wilderness; that the whole nation that had come out of Egypt
should die there, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua; and that only
their children should enter the promised land ([Num
14:26-39](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#026).md). The people were shocked at
this announcement, and resolved to force a way into Canaan; but, as
Moses predicted, they were beaten by the Canaanites and Amalekites, and
driven back to Hormah ([Num 14:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#040).md).

These events form a grand turning-point in the history of Israel, in
which the whole of the future history of the covenant nation is
typically reflected. The constantly repeated unfaithfulness of the
nation could not destroy the faithfulness of God, or alter His purposes
of salvation. In wrath Jehovah remembered mercy; through judgment He
carried out His plan of salvation, that all the world might know that no
flesh was righteous before Him, and that the unbelief and unfaithfulness
of men could not overturn the truth of God.

(Note: According to Knobel, the account of these events arose from two
or three documents interwoven with one another in the following manner:
Num 13:1-17a, [Num 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md), [Num
13:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#025.md), [Num
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md), and [Num
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002.md), [Num
14:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005.md), [Num
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010.md), [Num
14:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#036.md), was written by the Elohist,
the remainder by the Jehovist, - [Num
13:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md), [Num
13:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md); [Num
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md), [Num
14:11-25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md), [Num
14:39-45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#039.md), being taken from his first
document, and [Num 13:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md); [Num
14:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#002.md), [Num
14:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#008.md), [Num
14:26-33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#026.md), [Num
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#035.md), from his second; whilst,
lastly, [Num 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md), and the
commencement of [Num 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md), were added
from his own resources, because it contains contradictory statements.
"According to the Elohist," says this critic, "the spies went through
the whole land ([Num 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md); [Num
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#007).md), and penetrated even to the
north of the country ([Num 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021).md):
they took forty days to this ([Num
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#025.md); [Num
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#034).md); they had among them Joshua,
whose name was altered at that time ([Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016).md), and who behaved as bravely as
Caleb ([Num 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#008.md); [Num
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006.md), [Num
14:38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#038).md). According to the Jehovistic
completion, the spies did not go through the whole land, but only
entered into it ([Num 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027).md), merely
going into the neighbourhood of Hebron, in the south country ([Num
13:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022).md); there they saw the gigantic
Anakites ([Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md), [Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028.md), [Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033).md), cut off the large bunch of
grapes in the valley of Eshcol ([Num
13:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023).md), and then came back to
Moses. Caleb was the only one who showed himself courageous, and Joshua
was not with them at all ([Num 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030.md);
[Num 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024).md)." But these discrepancies
do not exist in the biblical narrative; on the contrary, they have been
introduced by the critic himself, by the forcible separation of passages
from their context, and by arbitrary interpolations. The words of the
spies in [Num 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#027.md), "We came into the
land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and
honey," do not imply that they only came into the southern portion of
the land, any more than the fact that they brought a bunch of grapes
from the neighbourhood of Hebron is a proof that they did not go beyond
the valley of Eshcol. Moreover, it is not stated in [Num
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030.md) that Joshua was not found among
the tribes. Again, the circumstance that in [Num
14:11-25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md) and [Num
14:26-35](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#026.md) the same thing is said twice
over-the special instructions as to the survey of the land in [Num
13:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md), which were quite unnecessary
for intelligent leaders, - the swearing of God ([Num
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#016.md), [Num
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md), [Num
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023).md), - the forced explanation of
the name Eshcol, in [Num 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#024.md), and
other things of the same kind, - are said to furnish further proofs of
the interpolation of Jehovistic clauses into the Elohistic narrative;
and lastly, a number of the words employed are supposed to place this
beyond all doubt. Of these proofs, however, the first rests upon a
simple misinterpretation of the passage in question, and a disregard of
the peculiarities of Hebrew history; whilst the rest are either
subjective conclusions, dictated by the taste of vulgar rationalism, or
inferences and assumptions, of which the tenability and force need first
of all to be established.)

Numbers 13:1-17

Despatch of the Spies of Canaan. - [Num
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md). The command of Jehovah, to send
out men to spy out the land of Canaan, was occasioned, according to the
account given by Moses in [Deu 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#022.md).,
by a proposal of the congregation, which pleased Moses, so that he laid
the matter before the Lord, who then commanded him to send out for this
purpose, "of every tribe of their fathers a man, every one a ruler among
them, i.e., none but men who were princes in their tribes, who held the
prominent position of princes, i.e., distinguished persons of rank; or,
as it is stated in [Num 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#003.md), "heads
of the children of Israel," i.e., not the tribe-princes of the twelve
tribes, but those men, out of the total number of the heads of the
tribes and families of Israel, who were the most suitable for such a
mission, though the selection was to be made in such a manner that every
tribe should be represented by one of its own chiefs. That there were
none of the twelve tribe-princes among them is apparent from a
comparison of their names ([Num
13:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004)) with the (totally different.md)
names of the tribe-princes ([Num 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003.md).,
[Num 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#012)..md). Caleb and Joshua are the
only spies that are known. The order, in which the tribes are placed in
the list of the names in [Num 13:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004.md),
differs from that in [Num 1:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#005.md) only
in the fact that in [Num 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#010.md) Zebulun
is separated from the other sons of Leah, and in [Num
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#011.md) Manasseh is separated from
Ephraim. The expression "of the tribe of Joseph," in [Num
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#011.md), stands for "of the children of
Joseph," in [Num 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#010.md); [Num
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#023.md). At the close of the list it is
still further stated, that Moses called Hoshea (i.e., help), the son of
Nun, Jehoshua, contracted into Joshua (i.e., Jehovah-help, equivalent
to, whose help is Jehovah). This statement does not present any such
discrepancy, when compared with [Exo
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009.md), [Exo
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013.md); [Exo
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#013.md); [Exo
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#017.md); [Exo
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011.md), and [Num
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#028.md), where Joshua bears this name as
the servant of Moses at a still earlier period, as to point to any
diversity of authorship. As there is nothing of a genealogical character
in any of these passages, so as to warrant us in expecting to find the
family name of Joshua in them, the name Joshua, by which Hosea had
become best known in history, could be used proleptically in them all.
On the other hand, however, it is not distinctly stated in the verse
before us, that this was the occasion on which Moses gave Hosea the new
name of Joshua. As the Vav consec. frequently points out merely the
order of thought, the words may be understood without hesitation in the
following sense: These are the names borne by the heads of the tribes to
be sent out as spies, as they stand in the family registers according to
their descent; Hosea, however, was named Joshua by Moses; which would
not by any means imply that the alteration in the name had not been made
till then. It is very probable that Moses may have given him the new
name either before or after the defeat of the Amalekites ([Exo
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009)..md), or when he took him into his
service, though it has not been mentioned before; whilst here the
circumstances themselves required that it should be stated that Hosea,
as he was called in the list prepared and entered in the documentary
record according to the genealogical tables of the tribes, had received
from Moses the name of Joshua. In [Num
13:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md) Moses gives them the
necessary instructions, defining more clearly the motive which the
congregation had assigned for sending them out, namely, that they might
search out the way into the land and to its towns ([Deu
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#022).md). "Get you up there (זה in the
south country, and go up to the mountain." Negeb, i.e., south country,
lit., dryness, aridity, from נגב, to be dry or arid (in Syr., Chald, and
Samar.). Hence the dry, parched land, in contrast to the well-watered
country ([Jos 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#019.md); [Jdg
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#015).md), was the name given to the
southern district of Canaan, which forms the transition from the desert
to the strictly cultivated land, and bears for the most part the
character of a steppe, in which tracts of sand and heath are intermixed
with shrubs, grass, and vegetables, whilst here and there corn is also
cultivated; a district therefore which was better fitted for grazing
than for agriculture, though it contained a number of towns and villages
(see at [Jos 15:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021).md). "The mountain"
is the mountainous part of Palestine, which was inhabited by Hittites,
Jebusites, and Amorites ([Num 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029).md),
and was called the mountains of the Amorites, on account of their being
the strongest of the Canaanitish tribes ([Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md), [Deu
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019)..md). It is not to be restricted, as
Knobel supposes, to the limits of the so-called mountains of Judah ([Jos
15:48-62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048).md), but included the mountains
of Israel or Ephraim also ([Jos 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#021.md);
[Jos 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007).md), and formed, according to
[Deu 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md), the backbone of the whole
land of Canaan up to Lebanon.

[Num 13:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#018.md)

They were to see the land, "what it was," i.e., what was its character,
and the people that dwelt in it, whether they were strong, i.e.,
courageous and brave, or weak, i.e., spiritless and timid, and whether
they were little or great, i.e., numerically; ([Num
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#019).md) what the land was, whether good
or bad, sc., with regard to climate and cultivation, and whether the
towns were camps, i.e., open villages and hamlets, or fortified places;
also ([Num 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#020).md) whether the land was
fat or lean, i.e., whether it had a fertile soil or not, and whether
there were trees in it or not. All this they were to search out
courageously (התחזק, to show one's self courageous in any occupation),
and to fetch (some) of the fruits of the land, as it was the time of the
first-ripe grapes. In Palestine the first grapes ripen as early as
August, and sometimes even in July (vid., Robinson, ii. 100, ii. 611),
whilst the vintage takes place in September and October.

[Numbers 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 13:21</span></span>

Journey of the Spies; Their Return, and Report. - [Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md). In accordance with the
instructions they had received, the men who had been sent out passed
through the land, from the desert of Zin to Rehob, in the neighbourhood
of Hamath, i.e., in its entire extent from south to north. The "Desert
of Zin" (which occurs not only here, but in [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md); [Num
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md); [Num
33:36](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#036.md); [Num
34:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md); [Deu
32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051.md), and [Jos
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md), [Jos
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#003).md) was the name given to the
northern edge of the great desert of Paran, viz., the broad ravine of
Wady Murreh, which separates the lofty and precipitous northern border
of the table-land of the Azazimeh from the southern border of the Rakhma
plateau, i.e., of the southernmost plateau of the mountains of the
Amorites (or the mountains of Judah), and runs from Jebel Madarah
(Moddera) on the east, to the plain of Kadesh, which forms part of the
desert of Zin (cf. [Num 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md); [Num
33:36](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#036.md); [Deu
32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051).md), on the west. The south
frontier of Canaan passed through this from the southern end of the Dead
Sea, along the Wady el Murreh to the Wady el Arish ([Num
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003)). - "Rehob, to come (coming.md) to
Hamath," i.e., where you enter the province of Hamath, on the northern
boundary of Canaan, is hardly one of the two Rehobs in the tribe of
Asher ([Jos 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md) and [Jos
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030).md), but most likely Beth-rehob in
the tribe of Naphtali, which was in the neighbourhood of Dan Lais, the
modern Tell el Kadhy ([Jdg 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#028).md), and
which Robinson imagined that he had identified in the ruins of the
castle of Hunin or Honin, in the village of the same name, to the
south-west of Tell el Kadhy, on the range of mountains which bound the
plain towards the west above Lake Huleh (Bibl. Researches, p. 371). In
support of this conjecture, he laid the principal stress upon the fact
that the direct road to Hamath through the Wady et Teim and the Bekaa
commences here. The only circumstance which it is hard to reconcile with
this conjecture is, that Beth-rehob is never mentioned in the Old
Testament, with the exception of [Jdg
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#028.md), either among the fortified
towns of the Canaanites or in the wars of the Israelites with the
Syrians and Assyrians, and therefore does not appear to have been a
place of such importance as we should naturally be led to suppose from
the character of this castle, the very situation of which points to a
bold, commanding fortress (see Lynch's Expedition), and where there are
still remains of its original foundations built of large square stones,
hewn and grooved, and reminding one of the antique and ornamental
edifices of Solomon's times (cf. Ritter, Erdkunde, xv. pp. 242ff.). -
Hamath is Epiphania on the Orontes, now Hamah (see at [Gen
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018).md).

After the general statement, that the spies went through the whole land
from the southern to the northern frontier, two facts are mentioned in
[Num 13:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md), which occurred in
connection with their mission, and were of great importance to the whole
congregation. These single incidents are linked on, however, in a truly
Hebrew style, to what precedes, viz., by an imperfect with Vav consec.,
just in the same manner in which, in [Kg1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009.md), [Kg1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015.md), the detailed account of the
building of the temple is linked on to the previous statement, that
Solomon built the temple and finished it;

(Note: A comparison of 1 Kings 6, where we cannot possibly suppose that
two accounts have been linked together or interwoven, is specially
adapted to give us a clear view of the peculiar custom adopted by the
Hebrew historians, of placing the end and ultimate result of the events
they narrate as much as possible at the head of their narrative, and
then proceeding with a minute account of the more important of the
attendant circumstances, without paying any regard to the chronological
order of the different incidents, or being at all afraid of repetitions,
and so to prove how unwarrantable and false are the conclusions of those
critics who press such passages into the support of their hypotheses. We
have a similar passage in [Jos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#011.md).,
where, after relating that when all the people had gone through the
Jordan the priests also passed through with the ark of the covenant
([Jos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#011).md), the historian proceeds in
[Jos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#012.md), [Jos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013.md), to describe the crossing of the
two tribes and a half; and another in Judg 20, where, at the very
commencement ([Jdg 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035).md), the issue
of the whole is related, viz., the defeat of the Benjamites; and then
after that there is a minute description in [Jdg
20:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#036.md) of the manner in which it was
effected. This style of narrative is also common in the historical works
of the Arabs.)

so that the true rendering would be, "now they ascended in the south
country and came to Hebron (ויּבא is apparently an error in writing for
ויּבאוּ), and there were הענק ולידי, the children of Anak," three of
whom are mentioned by name. These three, who were afterwards expelled by
Caleb, when the land was divided and the city of Hebron was given to him
for an inheritance ([Jos 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014.md); [Jdg
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#020).md), were descendants of Arbah, the
lord of Hebron, from whom the city received its name of Kirjath-Arbah,
or city of Arbah, and who is described in [Jos
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md) as "the great (i.e., the
greatest) man among the Anakim," and in [Jos
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md) as the "father of Anak," i.e.,
the founder of the Anakite family there. For it is evident enough that
הענק (Anak) is not the proper name of a man in these passages, but the
name of a family or tribe, from the fact that in [Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md), where Anak's sons are spoken of
in a general and indefinite manner, ענק בּני has not the article; also
from the fact that the three Anakites who lived in Hebron are almost
always called הענק ולידי, Anak's born ([Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md), [Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028).md), and that הענק בּני (sons of
Anak), in [Jos 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014.md), is still further
defined by the phrase הענק ולידי (children of Anak); and lastly, from
the fact that in the place of "sons of Anak," we find "sons of the
Anakim" in [Deu 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028.md) and [Deu
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#002.md), and the "Anakim" in [Deu
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md); [Deu
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#021.md); [Jos
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012.md), etc. Anak is supposed to
signify long-necked; but this does not preclude the possibility of the
founder of the tribe having borne this name. The origin of the Anakites
is involved in obscurity. In [Deu
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md), they are classed with the
Emim and Rephaim on account of their gigantic stature, and probably
reckoned as belonging to the pre-Canaanitish inhabitants of the land, of
whom it is impossible to decide whether they were of Semitic origin or
descendants of Ham. It is also doubtful, whether the names found here in
[Num 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md), [Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028.md), and in [Jos
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014.md), are the names of individuals,
i.e., of chiefs of the Anakites, or the names of Anakite tribes. The
latter supposition is favoured by the circumstance, that the same names
occur even after the capture of Hebron by Caleb, or at least fifty years
after the event referred to here. With regard to Hebron, it is still
further observed in [Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md), that
it was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt. Zoan - the Tanis of the
Greeks and Romans, the San of the Arabs, which is called Jani, Jane in
Coptic writings - was situated upon the eastern side of the Tanitic arm
of the Nile, not far from its mouth (see Ges. Thes. p. 1177), and was
the residence of Pharaoh in the time of Moses. The date of its erection
is unknown; but Hebron was in existence as early as Abraham's time ([Gen
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#018.md); [Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002)..md).

The spies also came into the valley of Eshcol, where they gathered
pomegranates and figs, and also cut down a vine-branch with grapes upon
it, which two persons carried upon a pole, most likely on account of its
extraordinary size. Bunches of grapes are still met with in Palestine,
weighing as much as eight, ten, or twelve pounds, the grapes themselves
being as large as our smaller plums (cf. Tobler Denkbltter, pp. 111,
112). The grapes of Hebron are especially celebrated. To the north of
this city, on the way to Jerusalem, you pass through a valley with
vineyards on the hills on both sides, containing the largest and finest
grapes in the land, and with pomegranates, figs, and other fruits in
great profusion (Robinson, Palestine, i. 316, compared with i. 314 and
ii. 442). This valley is supposed, and not without good ground, to be
the Eshcol of this chapter, which received its name of Eshcol (cluster
of grapes), according to [Num 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#024.md),
from the bunch of grapes which was cut down there by the spies. This
statement, of course, applies to the Israelites, and would therefore
still hold good, even if the conjecture were a well-founded one, that
this valley received its name originally from the Eshcol mentioned in
[Gen 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013.md), [Gen
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024.md), as the terebinth grove did from
Mamre the brother of Eshcol.

In forty days the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh (see at [Num
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#006).md), and reported the great
fertility of the land ("it floweth with milk and honey," see at [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008).md), pointing, at the same time, to
the fruit they had brought with them; "nevertheless," they added (כּי
אפס, "only that"), "the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the
cities are fortified, very large: and, moreover, we saw the children of
Anak there." Amalekites dwelt in the south (see at [Gen
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012).md); Hittites, Jebusites, and
Amorites in the mountains (see at [Gen
10:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015).md); and Canaanites by the
(Mediterranean) Sea and on the side of the Jordan, i.e., in the Arabah
or Ghor (see at [Gen 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007.md) and [Gen
10:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015).md).

[Numbers 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 13:30</span></span>

As these tidings respecting the towns and inhabitants of Canaan were of
a character to excite the people, Caleb calmed them before Moses by
saying, "We will go up and take it; for we shall overcome it." The fact
that Caleb only is mentioned, though, according to [Num
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006.md), Joshua also stood by his side,
may be explained on the simple ground, that at first Caleb was the only
one to speak and maintain the possibility of conquering Canaan.

[Numbers 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 13:31</span></span>

But his companions were of an opposite opinion, and declared that the
people in Canaan were stronger than the Israelites, and therefore it was
impossible to go up to it.

[Numbers 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 13:32</span></span>

Thus they spread an evil report of the land among the Israelites, by
exaggerating the difficulties of the conquest in their unbelieving
despair, and describing Canaan as a land which "ate up its inhabitants."
Their meaning certainly was not "that the wretched inhabitants were worn
out by the laborious task of cultivating it, or that the land was
pestilential on account of the inclemency of the weather, or that the
cultivation of the land was difficult, and attended with many evils," as
Calvin maintains. Their only wish was to lay stress upon the
difficulties and dangers connected with the conquest and maintenance of
the land, on account of the tribes inhabiting and surrounding it: the
land was an apple of discord, because of its fruitfulness and situation;
and as the different nations strove for its possession, its inhabitants
wasted away (Cler., Ros., O. v. Gerlach). The people, they added, are
מדּות אנשׁי, "men of measures," i.e., of tall stature (cf. [Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014).md), "and there we saw the
Nephilim, i.e., primeval tyrants (see at [Gen
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004).md), Anak's sons, giants of Nephilim,
and we seemed to ourselves and to them as small as grasshoppers."
