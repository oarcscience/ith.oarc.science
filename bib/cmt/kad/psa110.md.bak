### [Psalms Chapter 110](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 110:0</span></span>

To the Priest-King at the Right Hand of God

While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them: What think
ye of Christ? Whose Son is He? They say unto Him: David's. He saith unto
them: How then doth David in the spirit call Him Lord, saying: "The Lord
hath said unto my Lord: Sit Thou on My right hand until I make Thine
enemies the stool of Thy feet?" If David then calls Him Lord, how is He
his Son? And no man was able to answer Him a word, neither durst any one
from that day forth question Him further.

So we read in [Mat 22:41-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041.md); [Mar
12:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#035.md); [Luk
20:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041.md). The inference which it is
left for the Pharisees to draw rests upon the two premises, which are
granted, that [Psa 110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) is Davidic,
and that it is prophetico-Messianic, i.e., that in it the future Messiah
stands objectively before the mind of David. For if those who were
interrogated had been able to reply that David does not there speak of
the future Messiah, but puts into the mouth of the people words
concerning himself, or, as Hofmann has now modified the view he formerly
held (Schriftbeweis, ii. 1, 496-500), concerning the Davidic king in a
general way,

(Note: Vid., the refutation of this modified view in Kurtz, Zur
Theologie der Psalmen, in the Dorpater Zeitschrift for the year 1861, S.
516.

Supplementary Note. - Von Hofmann now interprets [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) as prophetico-Messianic. We
are glad to be able to give it in his own words.

"As the utterance of a prophet who speaks the word of God to the person
addressed, the Psalm begins, and this it is then all through, even where
it does not, as in [Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md),
expressly make known to the person addressed what God swears to him. God
intends to finally subdue his foes to him. Until then, until his day of
victory is come, he shall have a dominion in the midst of them, the
sceptre of which shall be mighty through the succour of God. His final
triumph is, however, pledged to him by the word of God, which appoints
him, as another Melchizedek, to an eternal priesthood, that excludes the
priesthood of Aaron, and by the victory which God has already given him
in the day of His wrath.

"This is a picture of a king on Zion who still looks forward to that
which in [Psa 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md). has already taken
place, - of a victorious, mighty king, who however is still ruling in
the midst of foes, - therefore of a king such as Jesus now is, to whom
God has given the victory over heathen Rome, and to whom He will subdue
all his enemies when he shall again reveal himself in the world;
meanwhile he is the kingly priest and the priestly king of the people of
God. The prophet who utters this is David, He whom he addresses as Lord
is the king who is appointed to become spoken according to [Sa2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#003.md). David beholds him in a moment of
his ruling to which the moment in his own ruling in which we find him in
[Sa2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001) is typically parallel.".md)

then the question would lack the background of cogency as an argument.
Since, however, the prophetico-Messianic character of the Psalm was
acknowledged at that time (even as the later synagogue, in spite of the
dilemma into which this Psalm brought it in opposition to the church,
has never been able entirely to avoid this confession), the conclusion
to be drawn from this Psalm must have been felt by the Pharisees
themselves, that the Messiah, because the Son of David and Lord at the
same time, was of human and at the same time of superhuman nature; that
it was therefore in accordance with Scripture if this Jesus, who
represented Himself to be the predicted Christ, should as such profess
to be the Son of God and of divine nature.

The New Testament also assumes elsewhere that David in this Psalm speaks
not of himself, but directly of Him, in whom the Davidic kingship should
finally and for ever fulfil that of which the promise speaks. For [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) is regarded elsewhere too as a
prophecy of the exaltation of Christ at the right hand of the Father,
and of His final victory over all His enemies: [Act
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#034.md)., [Co1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md); [Heb
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md); [Heb
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013.md); and the Epistle to the Hebrews
([Heb 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006.md); [Heb
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#017.md), [Heb
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021).md) bases its demonstration of the
abrogation of the Levitical priesthood by the Melchizedek priesthood of
Jesus Christ upon [Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md). But if
even David, who raised the Levitical priesthood to the pinnacle of
splendour that had never existed before, was a priest after the manner
of Melchizedek, it is not intelligible how the priesthood of Jesus
Christ after the manner of Melchizedek is meant to be a proof in favour
of the termination of the Levitical priesthood, and to absolutely
preclude its continuance.

We will not therefore deceive ourselves concerning the apprehension of
the Psalm which is presented to us in the New Testament Scriptures.
According to the New Testament Scriptures, David speaks in [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) not merely of Christ in so far
as the Spirit of God has directed him to speak of the Anointed of Jahve
in a typical form, but directly and objectively in a prophetical
representation of the Future One. And would this be impossible?
Certainly there is no other Psalm in which David distinguishes between
himself and the Messiah, and has the latter before him: the other
Messianic Psalms of David are reflections of his radical, ideal
contemplation of himself, reflected images of his own typical history;
they contain prophetic elements, because David there too speaks ἐν
πνεύματι, but elements that are not solved by the person of David.
Nevertheless the last words of David in [Sa2
23:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md) prove to us that we need not be
surprised to find even a directly Messianic Psalm coming from his lips.
After the splendour of all that pertained to David individually had
almost entirely expired in his own eyes and in the eyes of those about
him, he must have been still more strongly conscious of the distance
between what had been realized in himself and the idea of the Anointed
of God, as he lay on his death-bed, as his sun was going down. Since,
however, all the glory with which God has favoured him comes up once
more before his soul, he feels himself, to the glory of God, to be "the
man raised up on high, the anointed of God of Jacob, the sweet singer of
Israel," and the instrument of the Spirit of Jahve. This he has been,
and he, who as such contemplated himself as the immortal one, must now
die: then in dying he seizes the pillars of the divine promise, he lets
go the ground of his own present, and looks as a prophet into the future
of his seed: The God of Israel hath said, to me hath the Rock of Israel
spoken: "A ruler of men, a just one, a ruler in the fear of God; and as
the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, a cloudless morning, when
after sunshine, after rain it becomes green out of the earth." For not
little (לא־כן to be explained according to [Job
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#035.md), cf. [Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md); [Isa
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006).md) is my house with God, but an
everlasting covenant hath He made with me, one ordered in all things and
sure, for all my salvation and all my favour - ought He not to cause it
to sprout? The idea of the Messiah shall notwithstanding be realized, in
accordance with the promise, within his own house. The vision of the
future which passes before his soul is none other than the picture of
the Messiah detached from its subjectivity. And if so there, why may it
not also have been so even in [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)?

The fact that [Psa 110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) has points
of connection with contemporaneous history is notwithstanding the less
to be denied, as its position in the Fifth Book leads one to suppose
that it is taken out of its contemporary annalistic connection. The
first of these connecting links is the bringing of the Ark home to Zion.
Girded with the linen ephod of the priest, David had accompanied the Ark
up to Zion with signs of rejoicing. There upon Zion Jahve, whose earthly
throne is the Ark, now took His place at the side of David; but,
spiritually considered, the matter stood properly thus, that Jahve, when
He established Himself upon Zion, granted to David to sit henceforth
enthroned at His side. The second connecting link is the victorious
termination of the Syro-Ammonitish war, and also of the Edomitish war
that came in between. The war with the Ammonites and their allies, the
greatest, longest, and most glorious of David's wars, ended in the
second year, when David himself joined the army, with the conquest of
Rabbah. These two contemporary connecting links are to be recognised,
but they only furnish the Psalm with the typical ground-colour for its
prophetical contents.

In this Psalm David looks forth from the height upon which Jahve has
raised him by the victory over Ammon into the future of his seed, and
there He who carries forward the work begun by him to the highest pitch
is his Lord. Over against this King of the future, David is not king,
but subject. He calls him, as one out of the people, "my Lord." This is
the situation of the prophetico-kingly poet. He has received new
revelations concerning the future of his seed. He has come down from his
throne and the height of his power, and looks up to the Future One. He
too sits enthroned on Zion. He too is victorious from thence. But His
fellowship with God is the most intimate imaginable, and the last enemy
is also laid at His feet. And He is not merely king, who as a priest
provides for the salvation of His people, He is an eternal Priest by
virtue of a sworn promise. The Psalm therefore relates to the history of
the future upon a typical ground-work. It is also explicable why the
triumph in the case of Ammon and the Messianic image have been thus to
David's mind disconnected from himself. In the midst of that war comes
the sin of David, which cast a shadow of sorrow over the whole of his
future life and reduced its typical glory to ashes. Out of these ashes
the phoenix of Messianic prophecy here arises. The type, come back to
the conscious of himself, here lays down his crown at the feet of the
Antitype.

[Psa 110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) consists of three sevens,
a tetrastich together with a tristich following three times upon one
another. The Rebia magnum in [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md) is a security for this stichic
division, and in like manner the Olewejored by חילך in [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md), and in general the
interpunction required by the sense. And [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) and [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md) show decisively that it is to be
thus divided into 4 + 3 lines; for [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) with its rhyming inflexions
makes itself known as a tetrastich, and to take it together with [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md) as a heptastich is opposed by
the new turn which the Psalm takes in [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md). It is also just the same with
[Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md) in relation to [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md) : these seven stichs stand in
just the same organic relation to the second divine utterance as the
preceding seven to the first utterance. And since [Psa
110:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) give twice 4 + 3 lines, [Psa
110:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md) also will be organized
accordingly. There are really seven lines, of which the fifth, contrary
to the Masoretic division of the verse, forms with [Psa
110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md) the final tristich.

The Psalm therefore bears the threefold impress of the number seven,
which is the number of an oath and of a covenant. Its impress, then, is
thoroughly prophetic. Two divine utterances are introduced, and that not
such as are familiar to us from the history of David and only reproduced
here in a poetic form, as with Ps 89 and 132, but utterances of which
nothing is known from the history of David, and such as we hear for the
first time here. The divine name Jahve occurs three times. God is
designedly called Adonaj the fourth time. The Psalm is consequently
prophetic; and in order to bring the inviolable and mysterious nature
even of its contents into comparison with the contemplation of its
outward character, it has been organized as a threefold septiad, which
is sealed with the thrice recurring tetragamma.

[Psalms 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 110:1</span></span>

In [Psa 20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md) and [Psa
21:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md) we see at once in the openings
that what we have before us is the language of the people concerning
their king. Here לאדני in [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)
does not favour this, and נאם is decidedly against it. The former does
not favour it, for it is indeed correct that the subject calls his king
"my lord," e.g., [Sa1 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#012.md), although
the more exact form of address is "my lord the king," e.g., [Sa1
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#009.md); but if the people are speaking
here, what is the object of the title of honour being expressed as if
coming from the mouth of an individual, and why not rather, as in Ps
20-21, למלך or למשׁיחו? נאם is, however, decisive against the
supposition that it is an Israelite who here expresses himself
concerning the relation of his king to Jahve. For it is absurd to
suppose that an Israelite speaking in the name of the people would begin
in the manner of the prophets with נאם, more particularly since this נאם
ה placed thus at the head of the discourse is without any perfectly
analogous example ([Sa1 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#030.md); [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024) are only similar.md) elsewhere, and
is therefore extremely important. In general this opening position of
נאם, even in cases where other genitives that יהוה follow, is very rare;
נאם [Num 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md)., [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md), of David in [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md), of Agur in [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md), and always (even in [Psa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002).md) in an oracular signification.
Moreover, if one from among the people were speaking, the declaration
ought to be a retrospective glance at a past utterance of God. But,
first, the history knows nothing of any such divine utterance; and
secondly, נאם ה always introduces God as actually speaking, to which
even the passage cited by Hofmann to the contrary, [Num
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028.md), forms no exception. Thus it
will consequently not be a past utterance of God to which the poet
glances back here, but one which David has just now heard ἐν πνεύματι
([Mat 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#043).md), and is therefore not a
declaration of the people concerning David, but of David concerning
Christ. The unique character of the declaration confirms this. Of the
king of Israel it is said that he sits on the throne of Jahve ([Ch1
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#023).md), viz., as visible
representative of the invisible King ([Ch1
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#005).md); Jahve, however, commands the
person here addressed to take his place at His right hand. The right
hand of a king is the highest place of honour, [Kg1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#019.md).

(Note: Cf. the custom of the old Arabian kings to have their viceroy
(ridf) sitting at their right hand, Monumenta antiquiss. hist. Arabum,
ed. Eichhorn, p. 220.)

Here the sitting at the right hand signifies not merely an idle honour,
but reception into the fellowship of God as regards dignity and
dominion, exaltation to a participation in God's reigning (βασιλεύειν,
[Co1 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025).md). Just as Jahve sits
enthroned in the heavens and laughs at the rebels here below, so shall
he who is exalted henceforth share this blessed calm with Him, until He
subdues all enemies to him, and therefore makes him the unlimited,
universally acknowledged ruler. עד as in [Hos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md), for עד־כּי or עד־אשׁר, does not
exclude the time that lies beyond, but as in [Psa
112:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#008.md), [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), includes it, and in fact so
that it at any rate marks the final subjugation of the enemies as a
turning-point with which something else comes about (vid., [Act
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021.md); [Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028).md). הדם is an accusative of the
predicate. The enemies shall come to lie under his feet ([Kg1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#017).md), his feet tread upon the necks
of the vanquished ([Jos 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024).md), so
that the resistance that is overcome becomes as it were the dark ground
upon which the glory of his victorious rule arises. For the history of
time ends with the triumph of good over evil, - not, however, with the
annihilation of evil, but with its subjugation. This is the issue,
inasmuch as absolute omnipotence is effectual on behalf of and through
the exalted Christ. In [Psa 110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md),
springing from the utterance of Jahve, follow words expressing a
prophetic prospect. Zion is the imperial abode of the great future King
([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md). מטּה עזּך (cf. [Jer
48:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#017.md); [Eze
19:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#011).md) signifies "the sceptre (as
insignia and the medium of exercise) of the authority delegated to thee"
([Sa1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md), [Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003).md). Jahve will stretch this sceptre
far forth from Zion: no goal is mentioned up to which it shall extend,
but passages like [Zac 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010.md) show how
the prophets understand such Psalms. In [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md) follow the words with which
Jahve accompanies this extension of the dominion of the exalted One.
Jahve will lay all his enemies at his feet, but not in such a manner
that he himself remains idle in the matter. Thus, then, having come into
the midst of the sphere (בּקרב) of his enemies, shall he reign, forcing
them to submission and holding them down. We read this רדה in a
Messianic connection in [Psa 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md). So
even in the prophecy of Balaam ([Num
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#019).md), where the sceptre ([Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017).md) is an emblem of the Messiah
Himself.

[Psalms 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 110:3</span></span>

In order that he may rule thus victoriously, it is necessary that there
should be a people and an army. In accordance with this union of the
thoughts which [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md) anticipates,
בּיום חילך signifies in the day of thy arriere ban, i.e., when thou
callest up thy "power of an army" ([Ch2
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#013).md) to muster and go forth to
battle. In this day are the people of the king willingnesses (נדבת),
i.e., entirely cheerful readiness; ready for any sacrifices, they bring
themselves with all that they are and have to meet him. There is no need
of any compulsory, lengthy proclamation calling them out: it is no army
of mercenaries, but willingly and quickly they present themselves from
inward impulse (מתנדּב, [Jdg 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#002.md), [Jdg
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#009).md). The punctuation, which makes the
principal caesura at חילך with Olewejored, makes the parallelism of חילך
and ילדוּתך distinctly prominent. Just as the former does not signify
roboris tui, so now too the latter does not, according to [Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md), signify παιδιότητός σου
(Aquila), and not, as Hofmann interprets, the dew-like freshness of
youthful vigour, which the morning of the great day sheds over the king.
Just as גּלוּת signifies both exile and the exiled ones, so ילדוּת, like
νεότης, juventus, juventa, signifies both the time and age of youth,
youthfulness, and youthful, young men (the youth). Moreover one does
not, after [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md), look for any
further declaration concerning the nature of the king, but of his people
who place themselves at his service. The young men are likened to dew
which gently descends upon the king out of the womb (uterus) of the
morning-red.

(Note: The lxx renders it: ἐν ταῖς λαμπρότησι τῶν ἁγίων σου (belonging
to the preceding clause), ἐκ γαστρὸς πρὸ ἑωσφόρου ἐγέννησά σε (Psalt.
Veron. exegennesa se; Bamberg. gegennica se). The Vulgate, following the
Italic closely: in splendoribus sanctorum; ex utero ante luciferum genui
te. The Fathers in some cases interpret it of the birth of the Lord at
Christmas, but most of them of His antemundane birth, and accordingly
Apollinaris paraphrases: γαστρὸς καρπὸς ἐμῆς πρὸ ἑωσφόρου αὐτὸς ἐτύχθης.
In his own independent translation Jerome reads בהררי (as in [Psa
87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001).md), in montibus sanctis quasi de
vulva orietur tibi ros adolescentiae tuae, as Symmachus ἐν ὄρεσιν
ἁγίοις, - elsewhere, however, ἐν δόξῃ ἁγίων. The substitution is not
unmeaning, since the ideas of dew and of mountains ([Psa
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003).md) are easily united; but it was
more important to give prominence to the holiness of the equipment than
to that of the place of meeting.)

משׁחר is related to שׁחר just as מחשׁך is to חשׁך; the notion of שׁחר
and חשׁך appears to be more sharply defined, and as it were apprehended
more massively, in משׁחר and מחשׁך. The host of young men is likened to
the dew both on account of its vigorousness and its multitude, which are
like the freshness of the mountain dew and the immense number of its
drops, [Sa2 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#012.md) (cf. [Num
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010).md), and on account of the silent
concealment out of which it wondrously and suddenly comes to light, [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md). After not having understood "thy
youth" of the youthfulness of the king, we shall now also not, with
Hofmann, refer בּהדרי־קדשׁ to the king, the holy attire of his armour.
הדרת קדשׁ is the vestment of the priest for performing divine service:
the Levite singers went forth before the army in "holy attire" in [Ch2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021.md); here, however, the people
without distinction wear holy festive garments. Thus they surround the
divine king as dew that is born out of the womb of the morning-red. It
is a priestly people which he leads forth to holy battle, just as in
[Rev 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014.md) heavenly armies follow the
Logos of God upon white horses, ἐνδεδυμένοι βύσσινον λευκὸν καθαρόν - a
new generation, wonderful as if born out of heavenly light, numerous,
fresh, and vigorous like the dew-drops, the offspring of the dawn. The
thought that it is a priestly people leads over to [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md). The king who leads this
priestly people is, as we hear in [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004), himself a priest (cohen.md). As
has been shown by Hupfeld and Fleischer, the priest is so called as one
who stands (from כּחן = כּוּן in an intransitive signification), viz.,
before God ([Deu 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008.md), cf. [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md); [Heb
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011).md), like נביא the spokesman, viz.,
of God.

(Note: The Arabic lexicographers explain Arab. kâhin by mn yqûm b-'mr
'l-rjl w-ys‛â fı̂ ḥâjth, "he who stands and does any one's business and
managest his affair." That Arab. qâm, קום, and Arab. mṯl, משׁל, side by
side with עמד are synonyms of בהן in this sense of standing ready for
service and in an official capacity.)

To stand before God is the same as to serve Him, viz., as priest. The
ruler whom the Psalm celebrates is a priest who intervenes in the
reciprocal dealings between God and His people within the province of
divine worship the priestly character of the people who suffer
themselves to be led forth to battle and victory by him, stands in
causal connection with the priestly character of this their king. He is
a priest by virtue of the promise of God confirmed by an oath. The oath
is not merely a pledge of the fulfilment of the promise, but also a seal
of the high significance of its purport. God the absolutely truthful One
([Num 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#019).md) swears - this is the
highest enhancement of the נאם ה of which prophecy is capable ([Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008).md).

He appoints the person addressed as a priest for ever "after the manner
of Melchizedek" in this most solemn manner. The i of דברתי is the same
ancient connecting vowel as in the מלכי of the name Melchizedek; and it
has the tone, which it loses when, as in [Lam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md), a tone-syllable follows. The
wide-meaning על־דּברת, "in respect to, on account of," [Ecc
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md); [Ecc
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014.md); [Ecc
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md), is here specialized to the
signification "after the manner, measure of," lxx κατὰ τὴν τάξιν. The
priesthood is to be united with the kingship in him who rules out of
Zion, just as it was in Melchizedek, king of Salem, and that for ever.
According to De Wette, Ewald, and Hofmann, it is not any special
priesthood that is meant here, but that which was bestowed directly with
the kingship, consisting in the fact that the king of Israel, by reason
of his office, commended his people in prayer to God and blessed them in
the name of God, and also had the ordering of Jahve's sanctuary and
service. Now it is true all Israel is a "kingdom of priests" ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md), cf. [Num
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#003.md); [Isa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006).md), and the kingly vocation in
Israel must therefore also be regarded as in its way a priestly
vocation. Btu this spiritual priesthood, and, if one will, this princely
oversight of sacred things, needed not to come to David first of all by
solemn promise; and that of Melchizedek, after which the relationship is
here defined, is incongruous to him; for the king of Salem was,
according to Canaanitish custom, which admitted of the union of the
kingship and priesthood, really a high priest, and therefore, regarded
from an Israelitish point of view, united in his own person the offices
of David and of Aaron. How could David be called a priest after the
manner of Melchizedek, he who had no claim upon the tithes of priests
like Melchizedek, and to whom was denied the authority to offer
sacrifice

(Note: G. Enjedin the Socinian (died 1597) accordingly, in referring
this Psalm to David, started from the assumption that priestly functions
have been granted exceptionally by God to this king as to no other,
vid., the literature of the controversy to which this gave rise in
Serpilius, Personalia Davidis, S. 268-274.)

inseparable from the idea of the priesthood in the Old Testament? (cf.
[Ch2 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#020).md). If David were the person
addressed, the declaration would stand in antagonism with the right of
Melchizedek as priest recorded in Gen. 14, which, according to the
indisputable representation of the Epistle to the Hebrews, was equal in
compass to the Levitico-Aaronic right, and, since "after the manner of"
requires a coincident reciprocal relation, in antagonism to itself also.

(Note: Just so Kurtz, Zur Theologie der Psalmen, loc. cit. S. 523.)

One might get on more easily with [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md) by referring the Psalm to one of
the Maccabaean priest-princes (Hitzig, von Lengerke, and Olshausen); and
we should then prefer to the reference to Jonathan who put on the holy
stola, 1 Macc. 10:21 (so Hitzig formerly), or Alexander Jannaeus who
actually bore the title king (so Hitzig now), the reference to Simon,
whom the people appointed to "be their governor and high priest for
ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet" (1 Macc. 14:41),
after the death of Jonathan his brother - a union of the two offices
which, although an irregularity, was not one, however, that was
absolutely illegal. But he priesthood, which the Maccabaeans, however,
possessed originally as being priests born, is promised to the person
addressed here in [Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md); and even
supposing that in [Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md) the
emphasis lay not on a union of the priesthood with the kingship, but of
the kingship with the priesthood, then the retrospective reference to it
in Zechariah forbids our removing the Psalm to a so much later period.
Why should we not rather be guided in our understanding of this divine
utterance, which is unique in the Old Testament, by this prophet, whose
prophecy in [Zac 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012.md). is the key to
it? Zechariah removes the fulfilment of the Psalm out of the Old
Testament present, with its blunt separation between the monarchical and
hierarchical dignity, into the domain of the future, and refers it to
Jahve's Branch (צמח) that is to come. He, who will build the true temple
of God, satisfactorily unites in his one person the priestly with the
kingly office, which were at that time assigned to Joshua the high
priest and Zerubbabel the prince. Thus this Psalm was understood by the
later prophecy; and in what other sense could the post-Davidic church
have appropriated it as a prayer and hymn, than in the eschatological
Messianic sense? but this sense is also verified as the original. David
here hears that the king of the future exalted at the right hand of God,
and whom he calls his Lord, is at the same time an eternal priest. And
because he is both these his battle itself is a priestly royal work, and
just on this account his people fighting with him also wear priestly
garments.

[Psalms 110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 110:5</span></span>

Just as in [Psa 110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md) after [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), so now here too after the
divine utterance, the poet continues in a reflective strain. The Lord,
says [Psa 110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md), dashes in pieces
kings at the right hand of this priest-king, in the day when His wrath
is kindled ([Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md), cf. [Psa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010).md). אדני is rightly accented as
subject. The fact that the victorious work of the person addressed is
not his own work, but the work of Jahve on his behalf and through him,
harmonizes with [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md). The
sitting of the exalted one at the right hand of Jahve denotes his
uniform participation in His high dignity and dominion. But in the fact
that the Lord, standing at his right hand (cf. the counterpart in [Psa
109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006).md), helps him to victory, that
unchangeable relationship is shown in its historical working. The right
hand of the exalted one is at the same time not inactive (see [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md), cf. [Num
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008).md), and the Lord does not fail him
when he is obliged to use his arm against his foes. The subject to ידין
and to the two מחץ is the Lord as acting through him. "He shall judge
among the peoples" is an eschatological hope, [Psa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md); [Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md); [Psa
96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md), cf. [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md). What the result of this judgment
of the peoples is, is stated by the neutrally used verb מלא with its
accusative גויּות (cf. on the construction [Psa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010.md); [Deu
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#009).md): it there becomes full of
corpses, there is there a multitude of corpses covering everything. This
is the same thought as in [Isa 66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md),
and wrought out in closely related connection in [Rev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md); [Rev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md). Like the first מחץ, the second
([Psa 110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006).md) is also a perfect of the
idea past. Accordingly ארץ רבּה seems to signify the earth or a country
(cf. ארץ רחבה, [Exo 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md); [Neh
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#035).md) broad and wide, like תּהום רבּה
the great far-stretching deep. But it might also be understood the "land
of Rabbah," as they say the "land of Jazer" ([Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001).md), the "country of Goshen" ([Jos
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#041).md), and the like; therefore the
land of the Ammonites, whose chief city is Rabbah. It is also
questionable whether ראשׁ על־ארץ רבּה is to be taken like κεφαλὴν ὑπὲρ
πάντα, [Eph 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022) (Hormann.md), or whether
על־ארץ רבה belongs to מחץ as a designation of the battle-field. The
parallels as to the word and the thing itself, [Psa
68:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022.md); [Hab
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013.md)., speak for ראשׁ signifying not
the chief, but the head; not, however, in a collective sense (lxx,
Targum), but the head of the רשׁע κατ ̓ ἐξοχήν (vid., [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004).md). If this is the case, and the
construction ראשׁ על is accordingly to be given up, neither is it now to
be rendered: He breaks in pieces a head upon the land of Rabbah, but
upon a great (broad) land; in connection with which, however, this
designation of the place of battle takes its rise from the fact that the
head of the ruler over this great territory is intended, and the choice
of the word may have been determined by an allusion to David's
Ammonitish war. The subject of [Psa
110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md) is now not that arch-fiend, as
he who in the course of history renews his youth, that shall rise up
again (as we explained it formerly), but he whom the Psalm, which is
thus rounded off with unity of plan, celebrates. [Psa
110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md) expresses the toil of his
battle, and [Psa 110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md) the reward of
undertaking the toil. על־כּן is therefore equivalent to ἀντὶ τούτου.
בּדּרך, however, although it might belong to מגּחל (of the brook by the
wayside, [Psa 83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010.md); [Psa
106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007).md), is correctly drawn to ישׁתּה
by the accentuation: he shall on his arduous way, the way of his mission
(cf. [Psa 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024).md), be satisfied with a
drink from the brook. He will stand still only for a short time to
refresh himself, and in order then to fight afresh; he will unceasingly
pursue his work of victory without giving himself any time for rest and
sojourn, and therefore (as the reward for it) it shall come to pass that
he may lift his head on high as victor; and this, understood in a
christological sense, harmonizes essentially with [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md)., [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md), [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md).
