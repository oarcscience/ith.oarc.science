### [Amos Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 5:0</span></span>

The Overthrow of the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes - Amos 5 and [Amo
6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md)

The elegy, which the prophet commences in [Amo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002.md), upon the fall of the daughter of
Israel, forms the theme of the admonitory addresses in these two
chapters. These addresses, which are divided into four parts by the
admonitions, "Seek Jehovah, and live," in [Amo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md) and [Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006.md), "Seek good" in [Amo
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014), and the two woes (hōi.md) in [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md) and [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md), have no other purpose than this,
to impress upon the people of God the impossibility of averting the
threatened destruction, and to take away from the self-secure sinners
the false foundations of their trust, by setting the demands of God
before them once more. In every one of these sections, therefore, the
proclamation of the judgment returns again, and that in a form of
greater and greater intensity, till it reaches to the banishment of the
whole nation, and the overthrow of Samaria and the kingdom ([Amo
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027.md); [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008)..md).

[Amos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 5:1</span></span>

The Elegy. - [Amo 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md). "Hear ye this
word, which I raise over you; a lamentation, O house of Israel. [Amo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002.md). The virgin Israel is fallen; she
does not rise up again; cast down upon her soil; no one sets her up.
[Amo 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003.md). For thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, The city that goes out by a thousand will retain a hundred, and
that which goes out by a hundred will retain ten, for the house of
Israel." הדּבר הזּה is still further defined in the relative clause אשׁר
וגו as קינה, a mournful song, lit., a lamentation or dirge for one who
is dead (cf. [Sa2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#017.md); [Ch2
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025).md). אשׁר is a relative pronoun,
not a conjunction (for); and qı̄nâh is an explanatory apposition: which I
raise or commence as (or "namely") a lamentation. "House of Israel" is
synonymous with "house of Joseph" ([Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006).md), hence Israel of the ten tribes.
The lamentation follows in [Amo 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002.md),
showing itself to be a song by the rhythm and by its poetical form. נפל,
to fall, denotes a violent death ([Sa2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#019.md), [Sa2
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#025).md), and is here a figure used to
denote the overthrow or destruction of the kingdom. The expression
virgin Israel (an epexegetical genitive, not "of Israel") rests upon a
poetical personification of the population of a city or of a kingdom, as
a daughter, and wherever the further idea of being unconquered is added,
as a virgin (see at [Isa 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012).md). Here,
too, the term "virgin" is used to indicate the contrast between the
overthrow predicted and the original destination of Israel, as the
people of God, to be unconquered by any heathen nation whatever. The
second clause of the verse strengthens the first. נטּשׁ, to be stretched
out or cast down, describes the fall as a violent overthrow. The third
verse does not form part of the lamentation, but gives a brief, cursory
vindication of it by the announcement that Israel will perish in war,
even to a very small remnant. יצא refers to their marching out to war,
and אלף, מאה is subordinated to it, as a more precise definition of the
manner in which they marched out (cf. Ewald, 279, b).

[Amos 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 5:4</span></span>

The short, cursory explanation of the reason for the lamentation opened
here, is followed in [Amo 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md). by the
more elaborate proof, that Israel has deserved to be destroyed, because
it has done the very opposite of what God demands of His people. God
requires that they should seek Him, and forsake idolatry, in order to
live ([Amo 5:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004).md); but Israel on the
contrary, turns right into unrighteousness, without fearing the almighty
God and His judgment ([Amo 5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007).md).
This unrighteousness God must punish ([Amo
5:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010).md). [Amo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md). "For thus saith Jehovah to the
house of Israel, Seek ye me, and live. [Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md). And seek not Bethel, and come not
to Gilgal, and go not over to Beersheba: for Gilgal repays it with
captivity, and Bethel comes to nought. [Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006.md). Seek Jehovah, and live; that He
fall not upon the house of Joseph like fire, and it devour, and there be
none to quench it for Bethel." The kı̄ in [Amo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md) is co-ordinate to that in [Amo
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003.md), "Seek me, and live," for "Seek
me, so shall ye live." For this meaning of two imperatives, following
directly the one upon the other, see Gesenius, 130, 2, and Ewald, 347,
b. חיה, not merely to remain alive, not to perish, but to obtain
possession of true life. God can only be sought, however, in His
revelation, or in the manner in which He wishes to be sought and
worshipped. This explains the antithesis, "Seek not Bethel," etc. In
addition to Bethel and Gilgal (see at [Amo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004).md), Beersheba, which was in the
southern part of Judah, is also mentioned here, being the place where
Abraham had called upon the Lord ([Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033).md), and where the Lord had
appeared to Isaac and Jacob ([Gen
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024.md) and [Gen
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md); see also at [Gen
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031).md). These sacred reminiscences
from the olden time had caused Beersheba to be made into a place of
idolatrous worship, to which the Israelites went on pilgrimage beyond
the border of their own kingdom (עבר). But visiting these idolatrous
places of worship did no good, for the places themselves would be given
up to destruction. Gilgal would wander into captivity (an expression
used here on account of the similarity in the ring of גּלגּל and גּלה
יגלה). Bethel would become 'âven, that is to say, not "an idol" here,
but "nothingness," though there is an allusion to the change of Beth-el
(God's house) into Beth-'âven (an idol-house; see at [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md). The Judaean Beersheba is passed
over in the threat, because the primary intention of Amos is simply to
predict the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes. After this
warning the prophet repeats the exhortation to seek Jehovah, and adds
this threatening, "that Jehovah come not like fire upon the house of
Joseph" (tsâlach, generally construed with ‛al or 'el, cf. [Jdg
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019.md); [Jdg
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#014.md); [Sa1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#006.md); here with an accusative, to fall
upon a person), "and it (the fire) devour, without there being any to
extinguish it for Bethel." Bethel, as the chief place of worship in
Israel, is mentioned here for the kingdom itself, which is called the
"house of Joseph," from Joseph the father of Ephraim, the most powerful
tribe in that kingdom.

To add force to this warning, Amos ([Amo
5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007).md) exhibits the moral corruption
of the Israelites, in contrast with the omnipotence of Jehovah as it
manifests itself in terrible judgments. [Amo
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md). "They that change right into
wormwood, and bring righteousness down to the earth. [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md). He that maketh the seven stars
and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into morning, and darkeneth
day to night: that calleth to the waters of the sea, and poureth them
over the surface of the earth; Jehovah is His name. [Amo
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#009.md). Who causeth desolation to flash
upon the strong, and desolation cometh upon the fortress." The sentences
in [Amo 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md) and [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md) are written without any connecting
link. The participle in [Amo 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md)
cannot be taken as an address, for it is carried on in the third person
(hinnı̄chū), not in the second. And hahōphekhı̄m (who turn) cannot be in
apposition to Beth-el, since the latter refers not to the inhabitants,
but to the houses. As Amos is generally fond of a participial
construction (cf. [Amo 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007.md); [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013).md), so in a spirited address he
likes to utter the thoughts one after another without any logical link
of connection. As a matter of fact, hahōphekhı̄m is connected with
bēth-yōsēph (the house of Joseph), "Seek the Lord, ye of the house of
Joseph, who turn right into wrong;" but instead of this connection, he
proceeds with a simple description, They are turning," etc. La‛ănâh,
wormwood, a bitter plant, is a figurative term denoting bitter wrong
(cf. [Amo 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012).md), the actions of men
being regarded, according to [Deu
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#017.md), as the fruits of their state of
mind. Laying righteousness on the ground (hinnı̄ăch from nūăch) answers
to our "trampling under feet." Hitzig has correctly explained the train
of thought in [Amo 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md) and [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md) : "They do this, whereas Jehovah
is the Almighty, and can bring destruction suddenly upon them." To show
this antithesis, the article which takes the place of the relative is
omitted from the participles ‛ōsēh and hōphēkh. The description of the
divine omnipotence commences with the creation of the brightly shining
stars; then follow manifestations of this omnipotence, which are
repeated in the government of the world. Kı̄mâh, lit., the crowd, is the
group of seven stars, the constellation of the Pleiades. Kesı̄l, the
gate, according to the ancient versions the giant, is the constellation
of Orion. The two are mentioned together in [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md) and [Job
38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031) (see Delitzsch on the latter.md).
And He also turns the darkest night into morning, and darkens the day
into night again. These words refer to the regular interchange of day
and night; for tsalmâveth, the shadow of death, i.e., thick darkness,
never denotes the regularly recurring gloominess of night, but the
appalling gloom of night ([Job 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017).md),
more especially of the night of death ([Job
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#005.md); [Job
10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md); [Job
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017.md); [Psa
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020).md), the unlighted depth of the
heart of the earth ([Job 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003).md), the
darkness of the prison ([Psa 107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md),
[Psa 107:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#014).md), also of wickedness ([Job
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#022.md); [Job
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022).md), of sufferings ([Job
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md); [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016.md); [Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004).md), and of spiritual misery ([Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001).md). Consequently the words point to
the judicial rule of the Almighty in the world. As the Almighty turns
the darkness of death into light, and the deepest misery into prosperity
and health,

(Note: Theodoret has given a correct explanation, though he does not
quite exhaust the force of the words: "It is easy for Him to turn even
the greatest dangers into happiness; for by the shadow of death he means
great dangers. And it is also easy to bring calamity upon those who are
in prosperity.")

so He darkens the bright day of prosperity into the dark night of
adversity, and calls to the waters of the sea to pour themselves over
the earth like the flood, and to destroy the ungodly. The idea that by
the waters of the sea, which pour themselves out at the call of God over
the surface of the earth, we are to understand the moisture which rises
from the sea and then falls upon the earth as rain, no more answers to
the words themselves, than the idea expressed by Hitzig, that they refer
to the water of the rivers and brooks, which flow out of the sea as well
as into it ([Ecc 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#007).md). The words
suggest the thought of terrible inundations of the earth by the swelling
of the sea, and the allusion to the judgment of the flood can hardly be
overlooked. This judicial act of the Almighty, no strong man and no
fortress can defy. With the swiftness of lightning He causes desolation
to smite the strong man. Bâlag, lit., micare, used in the Arabic to
denote the lighting up of the rays of the dawn, hiphil to cause to light
up, is applied here to motion with the swiftness of lightning; it is
also employed in a purely metaphorical sense for the lighting up of the
countenance (Ps. 39:14; [Job 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#027.md);
[Job 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020).md). In [Amo
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#009.md) the address is continued in a
descriptive form; יבוא has not a causative meaning. The two clauses of
this verse point to the fate which awaits the Israelites who trust in
their strength and their fortifications ([Amo
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013).md). And yet they persist in
unrighteousness.

[Amos 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 5:10</span></span>

"They hate the monitor in the gate, and abhor him that speaketh
uprightly. [Amo 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md). Therefore,
because ye tread upon the poor, and take the distribution of corn from
him, ye have built houses of square stones, and will not dwell therein;
planted pleasant vineyards, and will not drink their wine. [Amo
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012.md). For I know how many are your
transgressions, and how great your sins; oppressing the righteous,
taking atonement money; and ye bow down the poor in the gate." However
natural it may seem to take מוכיח and דּבר תּמים in [Amo
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md) as referring to prophets, who
charge the ungodly with their acts of unrighteousness, as Jerome does,
this explanation is precluded not only by bassha‛ar (in the gate), since
the gate was not the meeting-place of the people where the prophets were
accustomed to stand, but the place where courts of judgment were held,
and all the public affairs of the community discussed (see at [Deu
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#019).md); but also by the first half of
[Amo 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md), which presupposes judicial
proceedings. Mōkhı̄ăch is not merely the judge who puts down unjust
accusers, but any one who lifts up his voice in a court of justice
against acts of injustice (as in [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021).md). דּבר תּמים, he who says what
is blameless, i.e., what is right and true: this is to be taken
generally, and not to be restricted to the accused who seeks to defend
his innocence. תּעב is a stronger expression than שׂנא. The punishment
for this unjust oppression of the poor will be the withdrawal of their
possessions. The ἁπ. λεγ. bōshēs is a dialectically different form for
בוסס, from בוּס, to trample down (Rashi, Kimchi), analogous to the
interchange of שׁריון and סריון, a coat of mail, although as a rule שׁ
passes into ס, and not ס into שׁ. For the derivation from בושׁ,
according to which בושׁס would stand for בושׁשׁ (Hitzig and Tuch on
Genesis p. 85), is opposed both to the construction with על, and also to
the circumstance that בּושׁשׁ means to delay ([Exo
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md); [Jdg
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#028).md); and the derivation suggested by
Hitzig from an Arabic verb, signifying to carry one's self haughtily
towards others, is a mere loophole. Taking a gift of corn from the poor
refers to unjust extortion on the part of the judge, who will only do
justice to a poor man when he is paid for it. The main clause, which was
introduced with lâkhēn, is continued with בּתּי גזית: "thus have ye
built houses of square stones, and shall not dwell therein;" for "ye
shall not dwell in the houses of square stones which ye have built." The
threat is taken from [Deu 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030.md), [Deu
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#039.md), and sets before them the
plundering of the land and the banishment of the people. Houses built of
square stones are splendid buildings (see [Isa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#009).md). The reason for this threat is
given in [Amo 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012.md), where reference is
made to the multitude and magnitude of the sins, of which injustice in
the administration of justice is again held up as the chief sin. The
participles צררי and לקחי are attached to the suffixes of פּשׁעיכם and
חטּאתיכם: your sins, who oppress the righteous, attack him, and take
atonement money, contrary to the express command of the law in [Num
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031.md), to take no kōpher for the soul
of a murderer. The judges allowed the rich murderer to purchase
exemption from capital punishment by the payment of atonement money,
whilst they bowed down the right of the poor. Observe the transition
from the participle to the third person fem., by which the prophet turns
away with disgust from these ungodly judges. Bowing down the poor is a
concise expression for bowing down the right of the poor: compare [Amo
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007.md) and the warnings against this sin
([Exo 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006.md); [Deu
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#019).md).

[Amos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 5:13</span></span>

With the new turn that all talking is useless, Amos repeats the
admonition to seek good and hate evil, if they would live and obtain
favour with God \_([Amo 5:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013).md); and
then appends the threat that deep mourning will arise on every hand,
since God is drawing near to judgment. [Amo
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013.md). "Therefore, whoever has prudence
at this time is silent, for it is an evil time." As lâkhēn (therefore)
always introduces the threatening of divine punishment after the
exposure of the sins (cf. [Amo 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md),
[Amo 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md); [Amo
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#007.md); [Amo
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#012.md); [Amo
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#011).md), we might be disposed to connect
[Amo 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013.md) with the preceding verse;
but the contents of the verse require that it should be taken in
connection with what follows, so that lâkhēn simply denote the close
connection of the two turns of speech, i.e., indicates that the new
command in [Amo 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014.md), [Amo
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#015.md) is a consequence of the previous
warnings. Hammaskı̄l, the prudent man, he who acts wisely, is silent.
בּעת ההיא, at a time such as this is, because it is an evil time, not
however "a dangerous time to speak, on account of the malignity of those
in power," but a time of moral corruption, in which all speaking and
warning are of no avail. It is opposed to the context to refer בעת ההיא
to the future, i.e., to the time when God will come to punish, in which
case the silence would be equivalent to not murmuring against God (Rashi
and others). At the same time, love to his people, and zeal for their
deliverance, impel the prophet to repeat his call to them to return.

[Amos 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 5:14</span></span>

"Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah the God of
hosts may be with you, as ye say. [Amo
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#015.md). Hate evil, and love good, and
set up justice in the gate; perhaps Jehovah the God of hosts will show
favour to the remnant of Joseph." The command to seek and love good is
practically the same as that to seek the Lord in [Amo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md), [Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006.md); and therefore the promise is the
same, "that ye may live." But it is only in fellowship with God that man
has life. This truth the Israelites laid hold of in a perfectly outward
sense, fancying that they stood in fellowship with God by virtue of
their outward connection with the covenant nation as sons of Israel or
Abraham (cf. [Joh 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039).md), and that the
threatened judgment could not reach them, but that God would deliver
them in every time of oppression by the heathen (cf. [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md); [Jer
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010).md). Amos meets this delusion with
the remark, "that Jehovah may be so with you as ye say." כּן neither
means "in case ye do so" (Rashi, Baur), nor "in like manner as, i.e., if
ye strive after good" (Hitzig). Neither of these meanings can be
established, and here they are untenable, for the simple reason that כּן
unmistakeably corresponds with the following כּאשׁר. It means nothing
more than "so as ye say." The thought is the following: "Seek good, and
not evil: then will Jehovah the God of the heavenly hosts be with you as
a helper in distress, so as ye say." This implied that in their present
condition, so long as they sought good, they ought not to comfort
themselves with the certainty of Jehovah's help. Seeking good is
explained in v. 15 as loving good, and this is still further defined as
setting up justice in the gate, i.e., maintaining a righteous
administration of justice at the place of judgment; and to this the
hope, so humiliating to carnal security, is attached: perhaps God will
then show favour to the remnant of the people. The emphasis in these
words is laid as much upon perhaps as upon the remnant of Joseph. The
expression "perhaps He will show favour" indicates that the measure of
Israel's sins was full, and no deliverance could be hoped for if God
were to proceed to act according to His righteousness. The "remnant of
Joseph" does not refer to "the existing condition of the ten tribes"
(Ros., Hitzig). For although Hazael and Benhadad had conquered the whole
of the land of Gilead in the times of Jehu and Jehoahaz, and had
annihilated the Israelitish army with the exception of a very small
remnant ([Kg2 10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md); [Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md), [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007).md), Joash and Jeroboam II had
recovered from the Syrians all the conquered territory, and restored the
kingdom to its original bounds ([Kg2
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#023.md)., [Kg2
14:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026).md). Consequently Amos could not
possibly describe the state of the kingdom of the ten tribes in the time
of Jeroboam II as "the remnant of Joseph." As the Syrians had not
attempted any deportation, the nation of the ten tribes during the reign
of Jeroboam was still, or was once more, all Israel. If, therefore, Amos
merely holds out the possibility of the favouring of the remnant of
Joseph, he thereby gives distinctly to understand, that in the
approaching judgment Israel will perish with the exception of a remnant,
which may possibly be preserved after the great chastisement (cf. [Amo
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003).md), just as Joel ([Joe
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#005).md) and Isaiah ([Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md); [Isa
10:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021).md) promise only the salvation
of a remnant to the kingdom of Judah.

[Amos 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">amo 5:16</span></span>

This judgment is announced in [Amo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md), [Amo
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#017.md). [Amo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md). "Therefore thus saith Jehovah
the God of hosts, the Lord: In all roads lamentation! and in all streets
will men say, Alas! alas! and they call the husbandman to mourning, and
lamentation to those skilled in lamenting. [Amo
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#017.md). And in all vineyards
lamentation, because I go through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah."
Lâkhēn (therefore) is not connected with the admonitions in [Amo
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014.md), [Amo
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#015.md), nor can it point back to the
reproaches in [Amo 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md), [Amo
5:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md), since they are too far off:
it rather links on to the substance of [Amo
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013.md), which involves the thought that
all admonition to return is fruitless, and the ungodly still persist in
their unrighteousness, - a thought which also forms the background of
[Amo 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014.md), [Amo
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#015.md). The meaning of [Amo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md), [Amo
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#017.md) is, that mourning and lamentation
for the dead will fill both city and land. On every hand will there be
dead to weep for, because Jehovah will go judging through the land. The
roads and streets are not merely those of the capital, although these
are primarily to be thought of, but those of all the towns in the
kingdom. Mispēd is the death-wail. This is evident from the parallel
'âmar hō hō, saying, Alas, alas! i.e., striking up the death-wail (cf.
[Jer 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018).md). And this death-wail will
not be heard in all the streets of the towns only, but the husbandman
will also be called from the field to mourn, i.e., to seep for one who
has died in his house. The verb קראוּ, they call, belongs to מספּד אל י,
they call lamentation to those skilled in mourning: for they call out
the word mispēd to the professional mourners; in other words, they send
for them to strike up their wailing for the dead. ידעי נהי (those
skilled in mourning) are the public wailing women, who were hired when a
death occurred to sing mourning songs (compare [Jer
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016.md); [Mat
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023.md), and my Bibl. Archologie, ii. p.
105). Even in all the vineyards, the places where rejoicing is generally
looked for ([Amo 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md); [Isa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010).md), the death-wail will be heard.
[Amo 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#017.md) mentions the event which
occasions the lamentation everywhere. כּי, for (not "if") I go through
the midst of thee. These words are easily explained from [Exo
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012.md), from which Amos has taken them.
Jehovah there says to Moses, "I pass through the land of Egypt, and
smite all the first-born." And just as the Lord once passed through
Egypt, so will He now pass judicially through Israel, and slay the
ungodly. For Israel is no longer the nation of the covenant, which He
passes over and spares ([Amo 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#008.md); [Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002).md), but has become an Egypt, which
He will pass through as a judge to punish it. This threat is carried out
still further in the next two sections, commencing with hōi.

[Amos 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">amo 5:18</span></span>

The first turn. - [Amo 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md). "Woe to
those who desire the day of Jehovah! What good is the day of Jehovah to
you? It is darkness, and not light. [Amo
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019.md). As if a man fleeth before the
lion, and the bear meets him; and he comes into the house, and rests his
hand upon the wall, and the snake bites him. [Amo
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#020.md). Alas! is not the day of Jehovah
darkness, and not light; and gloom, and no brightness in it?" As the
Israelites rested their hope of deliverance from every kind of hostile
oppression upon their outward connection with the covenant nation ([Amo
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014).md); many wished the day to come, on
which Jehovah would judge all the heathen, and redeem Israel out of all
distress, and exalt it to might and dominion above all nations, and
bless it with honour and glory, applying the prophecy of Joel in ch. 3
without the least reserve to Israel as the nation of Jehovah, and
without considering that, according to [Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032.md), those only would be saved on the
day of Jehovah who called upon the name of the Lord, and were called by
the Lord, i.e., were acknowledged by the Lord as His own. These
infatuated hopes, which confirmed the nation in the security of its life
of sin, are met by Amos with an exclamation of woe upon those who long
for the day of Jehovah to come, and with the declaration explanatory of
the woe, that that day is darkness and not light, and will bring them
nothing but harm and destruction, and not prosperity and salvation. He
explains this in [Amo 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019.md) by a figure
taken from life. To those who wish the day of Jehovah to come, the same
thing will happen as to a man who, when fleeing from a lion, meets a
bear, etc. The meaning is perfectly clear: whoever would escape one
danger, falls into a second; and whoever escapes this, falls into a
third, and perishes therein. The serpent's bite in the hand is fatal.
"In that day every place is full of danger and death; neither in-doors
nor out-of-doors is any one safe: for out-of-doors lions and bears prowl
about, and in-doors snakes lie hidden, even in the holes of the walls"
(C. a. Lap.). After this figurative indication of the sufferings and
calamities which the day of the Lord will bring, Amos once more repeats
in v. 20, in a still more emphatic manner (הלא, nonne = assuredly), that
it will be no day of salvation, sc. to those who seek evil and not good,
and trample justice and righteousness under foot ([Amo
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014.md), [Amo
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#015).md).

[Amos 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">amo 5:21</span></span>

This threatening judgment will not be averted by the Israelites, even by
their feasts and sacrifices ([Amo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021.md), [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022).md). The Lord has no pleasure in the
feasts which they celebrate. Their outward, heartless worship, does not
make them into the people of God, who can count upon His grace. [Amo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021.md). "I hate, I despise your feasts,
and do not like to smell your holy days. [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022.md). For if ye offer me
burnt-offerings, and your meat-offerings, I have no pleasure therein;
and the thank-offering of your fatted calves I do not regard. [Amo
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023.md). Put away from me the noise of
thy songs; and I do not like to hear the playing of thy harps. [Amo
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024.md). And let judgment roll like
water, and righteousness like an inexhaustible stream." By the rejection
of the opus operatum of the feasts and sacrifices, the roots are cut
away from the false reliance of the Israelites upon their connection
with the people of God. The combination of the words שׂנאתי מאסתּי
expresses in the strongest terms the dislike of God to the feasts of
those who were at enmity with Him. Chaggı̄m are the great annual feasts;
‛ătsârōth, the meetings for worship at those feasts, inasmuch as a holy
meeting took place at the ‛ătsereth of the feast of Passover and feast
of Tabernacles (see at [Lev 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036).md).
Rı̄ăch, to smell, is an expression of satisfaction, with an allusion to
the ריח ניחוח, which ascended to God from the burning sacrifice (see
[Lev 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031).md). Kı̄, in [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022.md), is explanatory: "for," not
"yea." The observance of the feast culminated in the sacrificers. God
did not like the feasts, because He had no pleasure in the sacrifices.
In [Amo 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023.md) the two kinds of
sacrifice, ‛ōlâh and minchâh, are divided between the protasis and
apodosis, which gives rise to a certain incongruity. The sentences, if
written fully, would read thus: When ye offer me burnt-offerings and
meat-offerings, I have no pleasure in your burnt-offerings and
meat-offerings. To these two kinds the shelem, the health-offering or
peace-offering, is added as a third class in [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022.md). מריאים, fattened things,
generally mentioned along with bâqâr as one particular species, for
fattened calves (see [Isa 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011).md). In
הסר ([Amo 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023).md) Israel is addressed as
a whole. המון שׁריך, the noise of thy songs, answers to the strong
expression הסר. The singing of their psalms is nothing more to God than
a wearisome noise, which is to be brought to an end. Singing and playing
upon harps formed part of the temple worship (vid., [Ch1
16:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#040.md); [Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md), and [Ch1
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#025).md). Isaiah ([Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011)..md) also refuses the heartless
sacrifice and worship of the people, who have fallen away from God in
their hearts. It is very clear from the sentence which Amos pronounces
here, that the worship at Bethel was an imitation of the temple service
at Jerusalem. If, therefore, with [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md) in view, where the careless upon
Mount Zion and in Samaria are addressed, we are warranted in assuming
that here also the prophet has the worship in Judah in his mind as well;
the words apply primarily and chiefly to the worship of the kingdom of
the ten tribes, and therefore even in that case they prove that, with
regard to ritual, it was based upon the model of the temple service at
Jerusalem. Because the Lord has no pleasure in this hypocritical
worship, the judgment shall pour like a flood over the land. The meaning
of [Amo 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024.md) is not, "Let justice and
righteousness take the place of your sacrifices." Mishpât is not the
justice to be practised by men; for "although Jehovah might promise that
He would create righteousness in the nation, so that it would fill the
land as it were like a flood ([Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009).md), He only demands righteousness
generally, and not actually in floods" (Hitzig). Still less can mishpât
ūtsedâqâh be understood as relating to the righteousness of the gospel
which Christ has revealed. This thought is a very far-fetched one here,
and is only founded upon the rendering given to ויגּל, et revelabitur
(Targ., Jerome, = ויגּל), whereas יגּל comes from גּלל, to roll, to roll
along. The verse is to be explained according to [Isa
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md), and threatens the flooding of
the land with judgment and the punitive righteousness of God (Theod.
Mops., Theodoret, Cyr., Kimchi, and others).

[Amos 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">amo 5:25</span></span>

Their heartless worship would not arrest the flood of divine judgments,
since Israel had from time immemorial been addicted to idolatry. [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md). "Have ye offered me sacrifices
and gifts in the desert forty years, O house of Israel? [Amo
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md). But have ye borne the booth of
your king and the pedestal of your images, the star of your gods, which
ye made for yourselves? [Amo 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027.md).
Then I will carry you beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah; God of hosts is
His name." The connection between these verses and what precedes is
explained by Hengstenberg thus: "All this (the acts of worship
enumerated in [Amo 5:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021).md) can no
more be called a true worship, than the open idolatry in the wilderness.
Therefore ([Amo 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#017).md) as in that
instance the outwardly idolatrous people did not tread the holy land, so
now will the inwardly idolatrous people be driven out of the holy land"
(Dissertations on the Pentateuch, vol. i. p. 157 transl.). But if this
were the train of thought, the prophet would not have omitted all
reference to the punishment of the idolatrous people in the wilderness.
And as there is no such allusion here, it is more natural to take [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md) and [Amo
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md), as Calvin does, and regard the
reference to the idolatry of the people, which was practised even in the
wilderness, as assigning a further reason for their exposure to
punishment.

(Note: "In this place," says Calvin, "the prophet proves more clearly,
that he is not merely reproving hypocrisy among the Israelites, or the
fact that they only obtruded their external pomps upon the notice of
God, without any true piety of heart, but he also condemns their
departure from the precepts of the law. And he shows that this was not a
new disease among the Israelitish people, since their fathers had mixed
up such leaven as this with the worship of God from the very beginning,
and had thereby corrupted that worship. He therefore shows that the
Israelites had always been addicted to superstitions, and could not be
kept in any way whatever to the true and innate worship of God.")

The question, "Have ye offered me sacrifices?" is equivalent to a
denial, and the words apply to the nation as a whole, or the great mass
of the people, individual exceptions being passed by. The forty years
are used as a round number, to denote the time during which the people
were sentenced to die in the wilderness after the rebellion at Kadesh,
just as in [Num 14:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033.md), and [Jos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#006.md), where this time, which actually
amounted to only thirty-eight years, is given, as it is here, as forty
years. And "the prophet could speak all the more naturally of forty
years, since the germ of apostasy already existed in the great mass of
the people, even when they still continued outwardly to maintain their
fidelity to the God of Israel" (Hengstenberg). During that time even the
circumcision of the children born in the thirty-eight years was
suspended (see at [Jos 5:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#005).md), and the
sacrificial worship prescribed by the law fell more and more into
disuse, so that the generation that was sentenced to die out offered no
more sacrifices. Zebhâchı̄m (slain-offerings) and minchâh
(meat-offerings), i.e., bleeding and bloodless sacrifices, are mentioned
here as the two principal kinds, to denote sacrifices of all kinds. We
cannot infer from this that the daily sacrificial worship was entirely
suspended: in [Num 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#011.md), indeed, the
altar-fire is actually mentioned, and the daily sacrifice assumed to be
still in existence; at the same time, the event there referred to
belonged to the time immediately succeeding the passing of the sentence
upon the people. Amos mentions the omission of the sacrifices, however,
not as an evidence that the blessings which the Lord had conferred upon
the people were not to be attributed to the sacrifices they had offered
to Him, As Ephraem Syrus supposes, nor to support the assertion that God
does not need or wish for their worship, for which Hitzig appeals to
[Jer 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md); but as a proof that from
time immemorial Israel has acted faithlessly towards its God, in
adducing which he comprehends all the different generations of the
people in the unity of the house of Israel, because the existing
generation resembled the contemporaries of Moses in character and
conduct.

[Amo 5:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md)

[Amo 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md) is attached in an
adversative sense: "To me (Jehovah) ye have offered no sacrifices, but
ye have borne," etc. The opposition between the Jehovah-worship which
they suspended, and the idol-worship which they carried on, is so
clearly expressed in the verbs הגּשׁתּם and נשׂאתם, which correspond to
one another, that the idea is precluded at once as altogether untenable,
that "[Amo 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md) refers to either the
present or future in the form of an inference drawn from the preceding
verse: therefore do ye (or shall ye) carry the hut of your king," etc.
Moreover, the idea of the idols being carried into captivity, which
would be the meaning of נשׂא in that case, is utterly foreign to the
prophetical range of thought. It is not those who go into captivity who
carry their gods away with them; but the gods of a vanquished nation are
carried away by the conquerors ([Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001).md). To give a correct
interpretation to this difficult verse, which has been explained in
various ways from the very earliest times, it is necessary, above all
things, to bear in mind the parallelism of the clauses. Whereas in the
first half of the verse the two objects are connected together by the
copula ו (ואת), the omission of both את and the copula ו before כּוכב
indicates most obviously that כּוכב אלהיכם does not introduce a third
object in addition to the two preceding ones, but rather that the
intention is to define those objects more precisely; from which it
follows still further, that סכּוּת מלכּכם and כּיּוּן צלמיכם do not
denote two different kinds of idolatry, but simply two different forms
of the very same idolatry. The two ἁπ. λεγ. sikkūth and kiyyūn are
undoubtedly appellatives, notwithstanding the fact that the ancient
versions have taken kiyyūn as the proper name of a deity. This is
required by the parallelism of the members; for צלמיכם stands in the
same relation to כיון as מלככם to סכות. The plural צלמיכם, however,
cannot be in apposition to the singular כיון (kiyyūn, your images), but
must be a genitive governed by it: "the kiyyūn of your images." And in
the same way מלככם is the genitive after סכות: "the sikkūth of your
king." Sikkūth has been taken in an appellative sense by all the ancient
translators. The lxx and Symm. render it τὴν σκηνήν; the Peshito,
Jerome, and the Ar. tentorium. The Chaldee has retained sikkūth. The
rendering adopted by Aquila, συσκιασμός, is etymologically the more
exact; for sikkūth, from סכך, to shade, signifies a shade or shelter,
hence a covering, a booth, and is not to be explained either from
sâkhath, to be silent, from which Hitzig deduces the meaning "block," or
from the Syriac and Chaldee word סכתא, a nail or stake, as Rosenmller
and Ewald suppose. כּיּוּן, from כּוּן, is related to כּן, basis ([Exo
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018).md), and מכונה, and signifies a
pedestal or framework. The correctness of the Masoretic pointing of the
word is attested by the kiyyūn of the Chaldee, and also by צלמיכם,
inasmuch as the reading כּיון, which is given in the lxx and Syr.,
requires the singular צלמכם, which is also given in the Syriac. צלמים
are images of gods, as in [Num 33:52](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052.md);
[Kg2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md). The words כּוכב אל which
follow are indeed also governed by נשׂאתם; but, as the omission of ואת
clearly shows, the connection is only a loose one, so that it is rather
to be regarded as in apposition to the preceding objects in the sense of
"namely, the star of your god;" and there is no necessity to alter the
pointing, as Hitzig proposes, and read כּוכב, "a star was your god,"
although this rendering expresses the sense quite correctly. כּוכב
אלהיכם is equivalent to the star, which is your god, which ye worship as
your god (for this use of the construct state, see Ges. 116, 5). By the
star we have to picture to ourselves not a star formed by human hand as
a representation of the god, nor an image of a god with the figure of a
star upon its head, like those found upon the Ninevite sculptures (see
Layard). For if this had been what Amos meant, he would have repeated
the particle ואת before כּוכב. The thought is therefore the following:
the king whose booth, and the images whose stand they carried, were a
star which they had made their god, i.e., a star-deity (אשׁר refers to
אלהיכם, not to כּוכב). This star-god, which they worshipped as their
king, they had embodied in tselâmı̄m. The booth and the stand were the
things used for protecting and carrying the images of the star-god.

Sikkūth was no doubt a portable shrine, in which the image of the deity
was kept. Such shrines (ναΐ́σκοι) were used by the Egyptians, according
to Herodotus (ii. 63) and Diodorus Sic. (i. 97): they were "small
chapels, generally gilded and ornamented with flowers and in other ways,
intended to hold a small idol when processions were made, and to be
carried or driven about with it" (Drumann, On the Rosetta Inscription,
p. 211). The stand on which the chapel was placed during these
processions was called παστοφόριον (Drumann, p. 212); the bearers were
called ἱεραφόροι or παστοφόροι (D. p. 226). This Egyptian custom
explains the prophet's words: "the hut of your king, and the stand of
your images," as Hengstenberg has shown in his Dissertations on the
Pentateuch, vol. i. p. 161), and points to Egypt as the source of the
idolatry condemned by Amos. This is also favoured by the fact, that the
golden calf which the Israelites worshipped at Sinai was an imitation of
the idolatry of Egypt; also by the testimony of the prophet Ezekiel
([Eze 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#007)..md), to the effect that the
Israelites did not desist even in the wilderness from the abominations
of their eyes, namely the idols of Egypt; and lastly, by the
circumstance that the idea of there being any allusion in the words to
the worship of Moloch or Saturn is altogether irreconcilable with the
Hebrew text, and cannot be historically sustained,

(Note: This explanation of the words is simply founded upon the
rendering of the lxx: καὶ ἀνελάβετε τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ Μολόχ καὶ τὸ ἄστρον
τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν Ῥαιφάν, τοὺς τύπους οὓς ἐποιήσατε ἑαυτοῖς. These
translators, therefore, have not only rendered מלכּכם erroneously as
Μολόχ, but have arbitrarily twisted the other words of the Hebrew text.
For the Hebrew reading מלככם is proved to be the original one, not only
by the τοῦ βασιλέως ὑμῶν of Symm. and Theod., but also by the Μαλχόμ of
Aquila and the malkūm of the Peshito; and all the other ancient
translators enter a protest against the displacing of the other words.
The name Ῥαιφάν (Ῥηφαν), or Ῥεμφάν ([Act
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043).md), however, owes its origin simply
to the false reading of the unpointed כיון as ריפן, inasmuch as in the
old Hebrew writings not only is כ similar to ר, but ו is also similar to
פ; and in [Sa2 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#012.md), where חשׁרת־מים
is rendered σκοτός (i.e., חשׁכת) ὑδάτων, we have an example of the
interchange of כ and ר. There was no god Rephan or Rempha; for the name
never occurs apart from the lxx. The statement made in the
Arabico-Coptic list of planets, edited by Ath. Kircher, that Suhhel (the
Arabic name of Saturn) is the same as Ῥηφάν, and the remark found in a
Coptic MS on the Acts of the Apostles, "Rephan deus temporis," prove
nothing more than that Coptic Christians supposed the Rephan or Remphan,
whose name occurred in their version of the Bible which was founded upon
the lxx, to be the star Saturn as the god of time; but they by no means
prove that the ancient Egyptians called Saturn Rephan, or were
acquainted with any deity of that name, since the occurrence of the
Greek names Υλια and Σελινη for sun and moon are a sufficient proof of
the very recent origin of the list referred to. It is true that the
Peshito has also rendered כּיּוּן by ke'wām (כּיון), by which the
Syrians understood Saturn, as we may see from a passage of Ephraem
Syrus, quoted by Gesenius in his Comm. on Isaiah (ii. p. 344), where
this father, in his Sermones adv. haer. s. 8, when ridiculing the
star-worshippers, refers to the Kevan, who devoured his own children.
But no further evidence can be adduced in support of the correctness of
this explanation of כּיון. The corresponding use of the Arabic Kaivan
for Saturn, to which appeal has also been made, does not occur in any of
the earlier Arabic writings, but has simply passed into the Arabic from
the Persian; so that the name and its interpretation originated with the
Syrian church, passing thence to the Persians, and eventually reaching
the Arabs through them. Consequently the interpretation of Kevan by
Saturn has no higher worth than that of an exegetical conjecture, which
is not elevated into a truth by the fact that כיון is mentioned in the
Cod. Nazar. i. p. 54, ed. Norb., in connection with Nebo, Bel, and Nerig
(= Nergal). With the exception of these passages, and the gloss of a
recent Arabian grammarian cited by Bochart, viz., "Keivan signifies
Suhhel," not a single historical trace can be found of Kevan having been
an ancient oriental name of Saturn; so that the latest supporter of this
hypothesis, namely Movers (Phnizier, i. p. 290), has endeavoured to prop
up the arguments already mentioned in his own peculiar and uncritical
manner, by recalling the Phoenician and Babylonian names, San-Choniâth,
Kyn-el-Adan, and others. Not even the Graeco-Syrian fathers make any
reference to this interpretation. Theodoret cannot say anything more
about Μολόχ καὶ Ῥεφάν, than that they were εἰδώλων ὀνόματα; and Theod.
Mops. has this observation on Ῥεμφάν: φασὶ δὲ τὸν ἑωσφόρον οὕτω κατὰ τὴν
Ἑβραίων γλῶτταν. It is still very doubtful, therefore, whether the
Alexandrian and Syrian translators of Amos really supposed Ῥαιφάν and
כּיון to signify Saturn; and this interpretation, whether it originated
with the translators named, or was first started by later commentators
upon these versions, arose in all probability simply from a combination
of the Greek legend concerning Saturn, who swallowed his own children,
and the Moloch who was worshipped with the sacrifice of children, and
therefore might also be said to devour children; that is to say, it was
merely an inference drawn from the rendering of מלככם as Μολόχ. But we
are precluded from thinking of Moloch-worship, or regarding מלככם, "your
king," as referring to Moloch, by the simple circumstance that כּוכב
אלהיכם unquestionably points to the Sabaean (sidereal) character of the
worship condemned by Amos, whereas nothing is known of the sidereal
nature of Moloch; and even if the sun is to be regarded as the physical
basis of their deity, as Mnter, Creuzer, and others conjecture, it is
impossible to discover the slightest trace in the Old Testament of any
such basis as this.

The Alexandrian translation of this passage, which we have thus shown to
rest upon a misinterpretation of the Hebrew text, has acquired a greater
importance than it would otherwise possess, from the fact that the
proto-martyr Stephen, in his address ([Act
7:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042).md), has quoted the words of the
prophet according to that version, simply because the departure of the
Greek translation from the original text was of no consequence, so far
as his object was concerned, viz., to prove to the Jews that they had
always resisted the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as the Alex. rendering also
contains the thought, that their fathers worshipped the στρατιᾶ τοῦ
οὐρανοῦ.)

whereas star-worship, or at any rate the worship of the sun, was widely
spread in Egypt from the very earliest times. According to the more
recent investigations into the mythology of the ancient Egyptians which
have been made by Lepsius (Transactions of the Academy of Science at
Berlin, 1851, p. 157ff.), "the worship of the sun was the oldest kernel
and most general principle of the religious belief of Egypt;" and this
"was regarded even down to the very latest times as the outward
culminating point of the whole system of religion" (Lepsius, p. 193).
The first group of deities of Upper and Lower Egypt consists of none but
sun-gods (p. 188).

(Note: It is true, that in the first divine sphere Ra occupies the
second place according to the Memphitic doctrine, namely, after Phtha
(Hephaestos), and according to the Theban doctrine, Amen (Ἄμων). Mentu
and Atmu stand at the head (Leps. p. 186); but the two deities, Mentu,
i.e., the rising sun, and Atmu, i.e., the setting sun, are simply a
splitting up of Ra; and both Hephaestos and Amon (Amon-Ra) were placed
at the head of the gods at a later period (Leps. pp. 187, 189).)

Ra, i.e., Helios, is the prototype of the kings, the highest potency and
prototype of nearly all the gods, the king of the gods, and he is
identified with Osiris (p. 194). But from the time of Menes, Osiris has
been worshipped in This and Abydos; whilst in Memphis the bull Apis was
regarded as the living copy of Osiris (p. 191). According to Herodotus
(ii. 42), Osiris and Isis were the only gods worshipped by the ancient
Egyptians; and, according to Diodorus Sic. (i. 11), the Egyptians were
said to have had originally only two gods, Helios and Selene, and to
have worshipped the former in Osiris, the latter in Isis. The Pan of
Mendes appears to have also been a peculiar form of Osiris (cf. Diod.
Sic. i. 25, and Leps. p. 175). Herodotus (ii. 145) speaks of this as of
primeval antiquity, and reckons it among the eight so-called first gods;
and Diodorus Sic. (i. 18) describes it as διαφερόντως ὑπὸ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων
τιμώμενον. It was no doubt to these Egyptian sun-gods that the star-god
which the Israelites carried about with them in the wilderness belonged.
This is all that can at present be determined concerning it. There is
not sufficient evidence to support Hengstenberg's opinion, that the
Egyptian Pan as the sun-god was the king worshipped by them. It is also
impossible to establish the identity of the king mentioned by Amos with
the שׂעירים in [Lev 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md), since these
שׂעירים, even if they are connected with the goat-worship of Mendes, are
not exhausted by this goat-deity.

The prophet therefore affirms that, during the forty years' journey
through the wilderness, Israel did not offer sacrifices to its true King
Jehovah, but carried about with it a star made into a god as the king of
heaven. If, then, as has already been observed, we understand this
assertion as referring to the great mass of the people, like the similar
passage in [Isa 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023.md), it agrees with
the intimations in the Pentateuch as to the attitude of Israel. For,
beside the several grosser outbreaks of rebellion against the Lord,
which are the only ones recorded at all circumstantially there, and
which show clearly enough that it was not devoted to its God with all
its heart, we also find traces of open idolatry. Among these are the
command in Leviticus 17, that every one who slaughtered a sacrificial
animal was to bring it to the tabernacle, when taken in connection with
the reason assigned, namely, that they were not to offer their
sacrifices any more to the Se‛ı̄rı̄m, after which they went a whoring
([Amo 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007).md), and the warning in [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md), against worshipping the sun,
moon, and stars, even all the host of heaven, from which we may infer
that Moses had a reason for this, founded upon existing circumstances.
After this further proof of the apostasy of Israel from its God, the
judgment already indicated in [Amo
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024.md) is still further defined in [Amo
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027.md) as the banishment of the people
far beyond the borders of the land given to it by the Lord, where higlâh
evidently points back to yiggal in [Amo
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024.md). מהלאה ל, lit., "from afar with
regard to," i.e., so that when looked at from Damascus, the place showed
itself afar off, i.e., according to one mode of viewing it, "far beyond
Damascus."
