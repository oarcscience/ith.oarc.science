[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 4:1</span></span>

1a Lo, thou art fair, my friend! yes, thou art fair!

Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil.

The Gr. Venet. translates, after Kimchi, "looking out from behind, thy
hair flowing down from thy head like a mane." Thus also Schultens,
capillus plexus; and Hengst., who compares πλέγμα, [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md), and ἐμπλοκὴ τριχῶν, [Pe1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003.md), passages which do not accord with
the case of Shulamith; but neither צמם, Arab. ṣmm, nor ṭmm signifies to
plait; the latter is used of the hair when it is too abundant, and ready
for the shears. To understand the hair as denoted here, is, moreover,
inadmissible, inasmuch as מבעד cannot be used of the eyes in relation to
the braids of hair hanging before them. Symm. rightly translates צמה by
κάλυμμα veil (in the Song the lxx erroneously renders by σιωπήσεως
behind thy silence), [Isa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002.md). The
verb צמם, (Arab.) ṣmam, a stopper, and (Arab.) alṣamma, a plaid in which
one veils himself, when he wraps it around him.

(Note: Regarding this verbal stem and its derivatives, see The's
Schlafgemach der Phantasie, pp. 102-105.)

The veil is so called, as that which closely hides the face. In the
Aram. צמם, Palp. צמצם, means directly to veil, as e.g., Bereshith rabba
c. 45, extr., of a matron whom the king lets pass before him it is said,
פניה צימצמה. Shulamith is thus veiled. As the Roman bride wore the velum
flammeum, so also the Jewish bride was deeply veiled; cf. [Gen
24:65](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#065.md), where Rebecca veiled herself
(Lat. nubit) before her betrothed. בּעד, constr. בּעד, a segolate noun,
which denotes separation, is a prep. in the sense of pone, as in Arab.
in that of post. Ewald, sec. 217m, supposes, contrary to the Arab., the
fundamental idea of covering (cogn. בגד); but that which surrounds is
thought of as separating, and at the same time as covering, the thing
which it encompasses. From behind her veil, which covered her face
(vid., Bachmann, under [Jdg 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#023).md), her
eyes gleam out, which, without needing to be supplemented by \`עיני, are
compared, as to their colour, motion, and lustre, to a pair of doves.

From the eyes the praise passes to the hair.

1b Thy hair is like a flock of goats

Which repose downwards on Mount Gilead.

The hair of the bride's head was uncovered. We know from later times
that she wore in it a wreath of myrtles and roses, or also a "golden
city" (עיר שׁל זהב), i.e., an ornament which emblematically represented
Jerusalem. To see that this comparison is not incongruous, we must know
that sheep in Syria and Palestine are for the most part white; but
goats, for the most part, black, or at least dark coloured, as e.g., the
brown gedi Mamri.

(Note: Burns, the Scottish poet, thinking that goats are white,
transfers the comparison from the hair to the teeth:

"Her teeth are like a flock of sheep,

With fleeces newly washen clean,

That slowly mount the rising steep;

And she's twa glancin', sparklin' een.")

The verb גּלשׁ is the Arab. jls, which signifies, to rest upon; and is
distinguished from the synon. q'd in this, that the former is used of
him who has previously lain down; the latter, of one who first stands
and then sits down.

(Note: Ḳ'ad cannot be used of one who sits on the bed farash; in jalas
lies the direction from beneath to above; in ḳ'ad (properly, to heap
together, to cower down), from above to beneath.)

The nejd bears also the name jals, as the high land raising itself, and
like a dome sitting above the rest of the land. One has to think of the
goats as having lain down, and thus with the upper parts of their bodies
as raised up. מן in מהר is used almost as in מדּלי מר, [Isa
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#015.md). A flock of goats encamped on a
mountain (rising up, to one looking from a distance, as in a steep
slope, and almost perpendicularly), and as if hanging down lengthwise on
its sides, presents a lovely view adorning the landscape. Solomon likens
to this the appearance of the locks of his beloved, which hang down over
her shoulders. She was till now a shepherdess, therefore a second rural
image follows:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 4:2</span></span>

2 Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep

Which comes up from the washing

All bearing twins,

And a bereaved one is not among them.

The verb קצב is, as the Arab. shows, in the sense of tondere oves, the
synon. of גּזז. With shorn (not to be shorn) sheep, the teeth in regard
to their smoothness, and with washed sheep in regard to their whiteness,
are compared - as a rule the sheep of Palestine are white; in respect of
their full number, in which in pairs they correspond to one another, the
one above to the one below, like twin births in which there is no break.
The parallel passage, [Sol 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#006.md), omits
the point of comparison of the smoothness. That some days after the
shearing the sheep were bathed, is evident from Columella 7:4. Regarding
the incorrect exchange of mas. with fem. forms, vid., under [Sol
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007.md). The part. Hiph. מתאימות (cf.
διδυματόκος, Theocr. i. 25) refers to the mothers, none of which has
lost a twin of the pair she had borne. In "which come up from the
washing," there is perhaps thought of, at the same time with the
whiteness, the saliva dentium. The moisture of the saliva, which
heightens the glance of the teeth, is frequently mentioned in the
love-songs of Mutenebbi, Hariri, and Deschami. And that the saliva of a
clean and sound man is not offensive, is seen from this, that the Lord
healed a blind man by means of His spittle.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 4:3</span></span>

The mouth is next praised:

3a Like a thread of crimson thy lips,

And thy mouth is lovely,

As distinguished from red-purple, ארגּמן, שׁני (properly, shining,
glistening; for this form has an active signification, like נקי, as well
as a passive, like עני) - fully, שׁני תּולעת - signifies the kermes or
worm-colour; the karmese, the red juice of the cochineal. מדבּרך
(מדבּריך) is translated by the lxx "thy speech;" Jerome, eloquium; and
the Venet. "thy dialogue;" but that would be expressed, though by a ἁπ.
λεγ., by מדבּר דבּוּרך is here the name of the mouth, the naming of
which one expects; the preform. is the mem instrumenti: the mouth, as
the instrument of speech, as the organ by which the soul expresses
itself in word and in manner of speech. The poet needed for פּיך a
fuller, more select word; just as in Syria the nose is not called anf,
but minchâr (from nachara, to blow, to breathe hard).

Praise of her temples.

3b Like a piece of pomegranate thy temples

Behind thy veil.

רקּה is the thin piece of the skull on both sides of the eyes; Lat.,
mostly in the plur., tempora; German, schlfe, from schlaff, loose,
slack, i.e., weak = רק. The figure points to that soft mixing of colours
which makes the colouring of the so-called carnation one of the most
difficult accomplishments in the art of painting. The half of a cut
pomegranate (Jer. fragmen mali punici) is not meant after its outer
side, as Zckler supposes, for he gives to the noun rǎkkā, contrary to
[Jdg 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md); [Jdg
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#026.md), the meaning of cheek, a meaning
which it has not, but after its inner side, which presents

(Note: The interior of a pomegranate is divided by tough, leather-like
white or yellow skins, and the divisions are filled with little berries,
in form and size like those of the grape, in the juicy inside of which
little, properly, seed-corns, are found. The berries are dark red, or
also pale red. The above comparison points to the mixing of these two
colours.)

a red mixed and tempered with the ruby colour, - a figure so much the
more appropriate, since the ground-colour of Shulamith's countenance is
a subdued white.

(Note: The Moslem erotic poets compare the division of the lips to the
dividing cleft into a pomegranate.)

Up to this point the figures are borrowed from the circle of vision of a
shepherdess. Now the king derives them from the sphere of his own
experience as the ruler of a kingdom. She who has eyes like doves is in
form like a born queen.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 4:4</span></span>

4 Like the tower of David thy neck,

Built in terraces;

Thereon a thousand shields hang,

All the armour of heroes.

The tower of David, is, as it appears, "the tower of the flock," [Mic
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004.md), from which David surveyed the
flock of his people. In [Neh 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#025.md). it
is called the "tower which lieth out from the king's high house," i.e.,
not the palace, but a government house built on Zion, which served as a
court of justice. But what is the meaning of the ἁπ. λεγ. תּלפּיּות?
Grtz translates: for a prospect; but the Greek τηλωπός, of which he
regards תל as the Heb. abstr., is a word so rare that its introduction
into the Semitic language is on that account improbable. Hengst.
translates: built for hanging swords; and he sees in the word a compound
of תּל (from תּלה, with which forms such as יד = jadj, שׁד = shadj, שׁל,
[Sa2 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#007), are compared.md) and פּיּות;
but this latter word signifies, not swords, but edges of the
(double-edged) sword; wherefore Kimchi (interpreting תּל as the constr.
of תל, as אל, in בּצלאל, is of צל) explains: an erection of
sharp-cornered stones; and, moreover, the Heb. language knows no such
nmm. comp. appellativa: the names of the frog, צפרדּע, and the bat,
עטלּף (cf. the Beth in \[Arab.\] sa'lab, fox, with the added Pe), are
not such; and also tsalmāveth, the shadow of death, is at a later
period, for the first time, restamped

(Note: Cf. regarding such double words belonging to the more modern
Semitic language, Jesurun, pp. 232-236.)

as such from the original tsalmuth (cf. Arab. zalumat = tenebrae).
Gesen. obtains the same meanings; for he explains לתל by exitialibus
(sc.,, armis), from an adj. תּלפּי, from תּלף = Arab. talifa, to perish,
the inf. of which, talaf, is at the present day a word synon. with halak
(to perish); (Arab.) matlaf (place of going down) is, like ישׁמון, a
poetic name of the wilderness. The explanation is acceptable but
hazardous, since neither the Heb. nor the Aram. shows a trace of this
verb; and it is thus to be given up, if תלף can be referred to a verbal
stem to be found in the Heb. and Aram. This is done in Ewald's
explanation, to which also Bttcher and Rdig. give the preference: built
for close (crowded) troops (so, viz., that many hundreds or thousands
find room therein); the (Arab.) verb aff, to wrap together (opp. nashar,
to unfold), is used of the packing together of multitudes of troops
(liff, plur. lufuf), and also of warlike hand-to-hand conflicts; תלף
would be traced to a verb לפה synon. therewith, after the form תּאניּה.
But if תלף were meant of troops, then they would be denoted as the
garrison found therein, and it would not be merely said that the tower
was built for such; for the point of comparison would then be, the
imposing look of the neck, overpowering by the force of the impression
proceeding from within. But now, in the Aram., and relatively in the
Talm. Heb., not only לפף and לוּף occur, but also לפי (Af. אלפי), and
that in the sense of enclosure, i.e., of joining together, the one
working into the other, - e.g., in the Targ.: of the curtain of the
tabernacle (בּית לופי, place of the joining together = חברת or מחבּרת of
the Heb. text); and in the Talm.: of the roofs of two houses (Bathra 6a,
לוּפתּא, the joining)

(Note: The Arab. lafa, vi., proceeding from the same root-idea,
signifies to bring in something again, to bring in again, to seek to
make good again.).

Accordingly לתלף, if we interpret the Lamed not of the definition, but
of the norm, may signify, "in ranks together." The Lamed has already
been thus rendered by Dderl.: "in turns" (cf. לפת, to turn, to wind);
and by Meier, Mr.: "in gradation;" and Aq. and Jerome also suppose that
תלף refers to component parts of the building itself, for they
understand

(Note: Vid., also Lagarde's Onomastica, p. 202: Θαλπιὼθ ἐπάλξη (read
εἰς) ἤ ὑψηλά.)

pinnacles or parapets (ἐπάλξεις, propugnacula); as also the Venet.: εἰς
ἐπάλξεις χιλίας. But the name for pinnacles is פּנּהּ, and their points,
שׁמשׁות; while, on the contrary, תלף is the more appropriate name for
terraces which, connected together, rise the one above the other. Thus
to build towers like terraces, and to place the one, as it were, above
the other, was a Babylonian custom.

(Note: Vid., Oppert's Grundzge der Assyr. Kunst (1872), p. 11.)

The comparison lies in this, that Shulamith's neck was surrounded with
ornaments so that it did not appear as a uniform whole, but as composed
of terraces. That the neck is represented as hung round with ornaments,
the remaining portion of the description shows.

מגן signifies a shield, as that which protects, like clupeus (clypeus),
perhaps connected with καλύπτειν and שׁלט, from שׁלט = (Arab.) shalita,
as a hard impenetrable armour. The latter is here the more common word,
which comprehends, with מגן, the round shield; also צנּה, the oval
shield, which covers the whole body; and other forms of shields. המּגן
אלף, "the thousand shields," has the indicative, if not (vid., under
[Sol 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#011).md) the generic article. The
appositional כּל שׁלטי הגּ is not intended to mean: all shields of (von)
heroes, which it would if the article were prefixed to col and omitted
before gibborim, or if כּלם, [Sol 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#008.md),
were used; but it means: all the shields of heroes, as the accentuation
also indicates. The article is also here significant. Solomon made,
according to [Kg1 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md)., 200 golden
targets and 300 golden shields, which he put in the house of the forest
of Lebanon. These golden shields Pharaoh Shishak took away with him, and
Rehoboam replaced them by "shields of brass," which the guards bore when
they accompanied the king on his going into the temple ([Kg1
14:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026.md); cf. [Ch2
12:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#009).md); these "shields of David,"
i.e., shields belonging to the king's house, were given to the captains
of the guard on the occasion of the raising of Joash to the throne, [Kg2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#010.md); cf. [Ch2
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#009.md). Of these brazen shields, as well
as of those of gold, it is expressly said how and where they were kept,
nowhere that they were hung up outside on a tower, the tower of David.
Such a display of the golden shields is also very improbable. We will
perhaps have to suppose that 4b describes the tower of David, not as it
actually was, but as one has to represent it to himself, that it might
be a figure of Shulamith's neck. This is compared to the terraced tower
of David, if one thinks of it as hung round by a thousand shields which
the heroes bore, those heroes, namely, who formed the king's body-guard.
Thus it is not strange that to the 200 + 300 golden shields are here
added yet 500 more; the body-guard, reckoned in companies of 100 each,
[Kg2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004.md), is estimated as consisting
of 1000 men. The description, moreover, corresponds with ancient custom.
The words are עליו תּלוּי, not בּו תּלוּי; the outer wall of the tower
is thought of as decorated with shields hung upon it. That shields were
thus hung round on tower-walls, Ezekiel shows in his prophecy regarding
Tyre, [Eze 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#011.md); cf. 1 Macc. 4:57,
and supra foris Capitolinae aedis, Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxxv. 3; and
although we express the presumption that Solomon's imagination
represented David's tower as more gorgeous than it actually was, yet we
must confess that we are not sufficiently acquainted with Solomon's
buildings to be able to pass judgment on this. These manifold
inexplicable references of the Song to the unfolded splendour of
Solomon's reign, are favourable to the Solomonic authorship of the book.
This grandiose picture of the distinguished beauty of the neck, and the
heightening of this beauty by the ornament of chains, is now followed by
a beautiful figure, which again goes back to the use of the language of
shepherds, and terminates the description:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 4:5</span></span>

5 Thy two breasts are like two fawns,

Twins of a gazelle,

Which feed among lilies.

The dual, originating in the inner differ. of the plur., which denotes
in Heb. not two things of any sort, but two paired by nature or by art,
exists only in the principal form; שׁדים, as soon as inflected, is
unrecognisable, therefore here, where the pair as such is praised, the
word שׁני is used. The breasts are compared to a twin pair of young
gazelles in respect of their equality and youthful freshness, and the
bosom on which they raise themselves is compared to a meadow covered
with lilies, on which the twin-pair of young gazelles feed. With this
tender lovely image the praise of the attractions of the chosen one is
interrupted.

If one counts the lips and the mouth as a part of the body, which they
surely are, there are seven things here praised, as Hengst. rightly
counts (the eyes, the hair, teeth, mouth, temples, neck, breasts); and
Hahn speaks with right of the sevenfold beauty of the bride.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 4:6</span></span>

Shulamith replies to these words of praise:

6 Until the day cools and the shadows flee,

I will go forth to the mountain of myrrh

And to the hill of frankincense.

All those interpreters who suppose these to be a continuation of
Solomon's words, lose themselves in absurdities. Most of them understand
the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense of Shulamith's
attractions, praised in [Sol 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005.md), or
of her beauty as a whole; but the figures would be grotesque (cf. on the
other hand [Sol 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#013).md), and אל לי אלך
prosaic, wherefore it comes that the idea of betaking oneself away
connects itself with לו הלך ([Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md); [Exo
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#027).md), or that it yet preponderates
therein ([Gen 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md); [Jer
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005).md), and that, for לי אלך in the
passage before us in reference to [Sol
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010.md), the supposition holds that it
will correspond with the French j m'en irai. With right Louis de Leon
sees in the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense names of
shady and fragrant places; but he supposes that Solomon says he wishes
to go thither to enjoy a siesta, and that he invites Shulamith thither.
But we read nothing of this invitation; and that a bridegroom should
sleep a part of his marriage-day is yet more unnatural than that, e.g.,
Wilh. Budus, the French philologist, spent a part of the same at work in
his study. That not Solomon but Shulamith speaks here is manifest in the
beginning, "until the day," etc., which at [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md) are also Shulamith's words. Anton
(1773) rightly remarks, "Shulamith says this to set herself free." But
why does she seek to make herself free? It is answered, that she longs
to be forth from Solomon's too ardent eulogies; she says that, as soon
as it is dark, she will escape to the blooming aromatic fields of her
native home, where she hopes to meet with her beloved shepherd. Thus,
e.g., Ginsburg (1868). But do myrrh and frankincense grow in North
Palestine? Ginsburg rests on Florus' Epitome Rerum Rom. iii. 6, where
Pompey the Great is said to have passed over Lebanon and by Damascus
"per nemora illa odorata, per thuris et balsami sylvas." But by these
thuris et balsami sylvae could be meant only the gardens of Damascus;
for neither myrrh nor frankincense is indigenous to North Palestine, or
generally to any part of Palestine. Friedrich (1866) therefore places
Shulamith's home at Engedi, and supposes that she here once more looks
from the window and dotes on the mountain of myrrh and the hill of
frankincense, "where, at the approach of twilight, she was wont to look
out for her betrothed shepherd." But Shulamith, as her name already
denotes, is not from the south, but is a Galilean, and her betrothed
shepherd is from Utopia! That myrrh and frankincense were planted in the
gardens of Engedi is possible, although ([Sol
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014).md) mention is made only of the
Al-henna there. But here places in the neighbourhood of the royal palace
must be meant; for the myrrh tree, the gum of which, prized as an aroma,
is the Arab. Balsamodendron Myrrha, and the frankincense tree, the resin
of which is used for incense, is, like the myrrh tree, an Arab. amyrid.
The Boswellia serrata,

(Note: Lassen's Ind. Alterthumskunde, I 334.)

indigenous to the East Indies, furnishes the best frankincense; the
Israelites bought it from Sheba ([Isa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006.md); [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020).md). The myrrh tree as well as the
frankincense tree were thus exotics in Palestine, as they are in our own
country; but Solomon, who had intercourse with Arabia and India by his
own mercantile fleet, procured them for his own garden ([Ecc
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005).md). The modest Shulamith shuns the
loving words of praise; for she requests that she may be permitted to
betake herself to the lonely places planted with myrrh and frankincense
near the king's palace, where she thinks to tarry in a frame of mind
befitting this day till the approaching darkness calls her back to the
king. It is the importance of the day which suggests to her this לי אלך,
a day in which she enters into the covenant of her God with Solomon
([Pro 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017).md). Without wishing to
allegorize, we may yet not omit to observe, that the mountain of myrrh
and the hill of frankincense put us in mind of the temple, where
incense, composed of myrrh, frankincense, and other spices, ascended up
before God every morning and evening ([Exo
30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034)..md). המּור הר is perhaps a not
unintentional accord to הר המּוריּה ([Ch2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001).md), the mountain where God appeared;
at all events, "mountain of myrrh" and "hill of frankincense" are
appropriate names for places of devout meditation, where one holds
fellowship with God.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 4:7</span></span>

This childlike modest disposition makes her yet more lovely in the eyes
of the king. He breaks out in these words:

7 Thou art altogether fair, my love,

And no blemish in thee.

Certainly he means, no blemish either of soul or body. In [Sol
4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md) he has praised her external
beauty; but in [Sol 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006.md) her soul has
disclosed itself: the fame of her spotless beauty is there extended to
her would no less than to her external appearance. And as to her longing
after freedom from the tumult and bustle of court life, he thus promises
to her:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 4:8</span></span>

8 With me from Lebanon, my bride,

With me from Lebanon shalt thou come;

Shalt look from the top of Amana,

From the top of Shenir and Hermon,

From dens of lions,

From mountains of leopards.

Zckl. interprets אתּי in the sense of אלי, and תּשׁוּרי in the sense of
journeying to this definite place: "he announces to her in overflowing
fulness of expression that from this time forth, instead of the lonely
mountainous regions, and the dangerous caves and dens, she shall inhabit
with him the royal palace." Thus also Kingsbury. But the interpretation,
however plausible, cannot be supported. For (1) such an idea ought to be
expressed either by תב אלי or by תשׁבי ואתּי תב, instead of אתּי תּב;
(2) Shulamith is not from Lebanon, nor from the Anti-Libanus, which
looks toward Damascus; (3) this would be no answer to Shulamith's
longing for lonely quietness. We therefore hold by our explanation given
in 1851. He seeks her to go with him up the steep heights of Lebanon,
and to descend with him from thence; for while ascending the mountain
one has no view before him, but when descending he has the whole
panorama of the surrounding region lying at his feet. Thus תשׁ is not to
be understood as at [Isa 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009.md), where
it has the meaning of migrabas, but, as at [Num
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md), it means spectabis. With מר the
idea of prospect lies nearer than that of descending; besides, the
meaning spectare is secondary, for שׁוּר signifies first "to go,
proceed, journey," and then "going to view, to go in order to view." Sêr
in Arab. means "the scene," and sêr etmek in Turkish, "to contemplate"
(cf. Arab. tamashy, to walk, then, to contemplate). Lebanon is the name
of the Alpine range which lies in the N.-W. of the Holy Land, and
stretches above 20 (German) miles from the Leontes (Nahr el-Kasme)
northwards to the Eleutheros (Nahr el-Kebr). The other three names here
found refer to the Anti-Libanus separated from the Lebanon by the
Coelo-Syrian valley, and stretching from the Banis northwards to the
plain of Hamth.

Amana denotes that range of the Anti-Libanus from which the springs of
the river Amana issue, one of the two rivers which the Syrian captain
([Kg2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012).md) named as better than all
the waters of Israel. These are the Amana and Pharpar, i.e., the Barad
and A'wadsh; to the union of the Barad (called by the Greeks
Chrysorrhoas, i.e., "golden stream") with the Feidshe, the environs of
Damascus owe their ghuwdat, their paradisaical beauty.

Hermon (from חרם, to cut of; cf. Arab. kharom and makhrim, the steep
projection of a mountain) is the most southern peak of the Anti-Libanus
chain, the lofty mountains (about 10, 000 feet above the level of the
sea) which form the north-eastern border of Palestine, and from which
the springs of the Jordan take their rise.

Another section of the Anti-Libanus range is called Senir, not Shenir.
The name, in all the three places where it occurs ([Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009.md); [Ch1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023).md), is, in accordance with
tradition, to be written with Sin. The Onkelos Targum writes סריון; the
Jerusalem paraphrases, טורא דמסרי פירוי (the mountain whose fruits
become putrid, viz., on account of their superabundance); the Midrash
explains otherwise: שהוא שובא הניר (the mountain which resists being
broken up by the plough), - everywhere the writing of the word with the
letter Sin is supposed. According to [Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009.md), this was the Amorite name of
Hermon. The expression then denotes that the Amorites called Hermon -
i.e., the Anti-Libanus range, for they gave the name of a part to the
whole range - by the name Senr; Abulfeda uses Arab. snîr as the name of
the part to the north of Damascus, with which the statement of Schwarz
(Das h. Land, p. 33) agrees, that the Hermon (Anti-Libanus) to the
north-west of Damascus is called Senr.

נמרים, panthers, to the present day inhabit the clefts and defiles of
the Lebanon, and of the Anti-Libanus running parallel to it; whereas
lions have now altogether disappeared from the countries of the
Mediterranean. In Solomon's time they were to be met with in the
lurking-places of the Jordan valley, and yet more frequently in the
remote districts of the northern Alpine chains. From the heights of
these Alps Solomon says Shulamith shall alone with him look down from
where the lions and panthers dwell. Near these beasts of prey, and yet
inaccessible by them, shall she enjoy the prospect of the extensive
pleasant land which was subject to the sceptre of him who held her safe
on these cliffs, and accompanied her over these giddy heights. If
"mountain of myrrh," so also "the top of Amana" is not without
subordinate reference. Amana, proceeding from the primary idea of
firmness and verification, signifies fidelity and the faithful covenant
as it is established between God and the congregation, for He betrothes
it to Himself b'mwnh ("in faithfulness"), [Hos
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#022.md) \[20\]; the congregation of which
the apostle ([Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027).md) says the same
as is here said by Solomon of Shulamith. Here for the first time he
calls her כלה, not כּלּתי; for that, according to the usus loq., would
mean "my daughter-in-law." Accordingly, it appears that the idea of
"daughter-in-law" is the primary, and that of "bride" the secondary one.
כּלה, which is = כּלוּלה, as חלּה, a cake, is = חלוּלה, that which is
pierced through (cf. כּלוּלות, being espoused; [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002).md), appears to mean

(Note: L. Geiger's Ursprung d. Sprach. p. 227; cf. 88.)

(cf. what was said regarding חתן under [Sol
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011).md) her who is comprehended with the
family into which, leaving her parents' house, she enters; not her who
is embraced = crowned with a garland (cf. Arab. qkll, to be garlanded;
tēklîl, garlanding; iklil, Syr. kelilo, a wreath), or her who is brought
to completion (cf. the verb, [Eze
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#004.md), [Eze
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#011).md), i.e., has reached the goal of
her womanly calling. Besides, כּלה, like "Braut" in the older German
(e.g., Gudrun), means not only her who is betrothed, but also her who
has been lately married.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 4:9</span></span>

All that the king calls his, she now can call hers; for she has won his
heart, and with his heart himself and all that is his.

9 Thou hast taken my heart, my sister-bride;

Thou hast taken my heart with one of thy glances,

With a little chain of thy necklace.

The Piel לבּב may mean to make courageous, and it actually has this
meaning in the Aram., wherefore the Syr. retains the word; Symm. renders
it by ἐθάρσυνάς με. But is it becoming in a man who is no coward,
especially in a king, to say that the love he cherishes gives him heart,
i.e., courage? It might be becoming, perhaps, in a warrior who is
inspired by the thought of his beloved, whose respect and admiration he
seeks to gain, to dare the uttermost. But Solomon is no Antar, no
wandering knight.

(Note: A specimen of Bttcher's interpretation: "What is more natural
than to suppose that the keeper of a vineyard showed herself with half
of her head and neck exposed at the half-opened window to her shepherd
on his first attempt to set her free, when he cried, 'my dove in the
clefts of the rocks,' etc., and animated him thereby to this present
bold deliverance of her from the midst of robbers?" We pity the
Shulamitess, that she put her trust in this moonshiny coward.)

Besides, the first effect of love is different: it influences those whom
it governs, not as encouraging, in the first instance, but as disarming
them; love responded to encourages, but love in its beginning, which is
the subject here, overpowers. We would thus more naturally render: "thou
hast unhearted me;" but "to unheart," according to the Semitic and
generally the ancient conception of the heart (Psychol. p. 254), does
not so much mean to captivate the heart, as rather to deprive of
understanding or of judgment (cf. [Hos
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011).md). Such denomin. Pi. of names of
corporeal members signify not merely taking away, but also wounding, and
generally any violent affection of it, as זנּב, גּרם, Ewald, 120c;
accordingly the lxx, Venet., and Jerome: ἐκαρδίωσάς με, vulnerasti cor
meum. The meaning is the same for "thou hast wounded my heart" = "thou
hast subdued my heart" (cf. [Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006).md). With one of her glances, with a
little chain of her necklace, she has overcome him as with a powerful
charm: veni, visa sum, vici. The Kerı̂ changes באחד into בּאחת; certainly
עין is mostly fem. (e.g., [Jdg 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028).md),
but not only the non-bibl. usus loq., which e.g., prefers רעה or רע עין,
of a malignant bewitching look, but also the bibl. (vid., [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md); [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010).md) treats the word as of double
gender. ענק and צוּרנים are related to each other as a part is to the
whole. With the subst. ending n, the designation of an ornament designed
for the neck is formed from צוּאר, the neck; cf. שׂהרון, the "round
tires like the moon" of the women's toilet, [Isa
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018.md). ענק (connected with אחד ענק,
cervix) is a separate chain (Aram. עוּנקתא) of this necklace. In the
words ענק אחד, אחד is used instead of אחד, occurring also out of genit.
connection ([Gen 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022.md); [Sa2
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#022).md), and the arrangement (vid.,
under [Psa 89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051).md) follows the analogy
of the pure numerals as נשׁים שׁלשׁ; it appears to be transferred from
the vulgar language to that used in books, where, besides the passage
before us, it occurs only in [Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md). That a glance of the eye may
pierce the heart, experience shows; but how can a little chain of a
necklace do this? That also is intelligible. As beauty becomes unlike
itself when the attire shows want of taste, so by means of tasteful
clothing, which does not need to be splendid, but may even be of the
simplest kind, it becomes mighty. Hence the charming attractive power of
the impression one makes communicates itself to all that he wears, as,
e.g., the woman with the issue of blood touched with joyful hope the hem
of Jesus' garment; for he who loves feels the soul of that which is
loved in all that stands connected therewith, all that is, as it were,
consecrated and charmed by the beloved object, and operates so much the
more powerfully if it adorns it, because as an ornament of that which is
beautiful, it appears so much the more beautiful. In the preceding
verse, Solomon has for the first time addressed Shulamith by the title
"bride." Here with heightened cordiality he calls her "sister-bride." In
this change in the address the progress of the story is mirrored. Why he
does not say כּלּתי (my bride), has already been explained, under [Sol
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008.md), from the derivation of the word.
Solomon's mother might call Shulamith callathi, but he gives to the
relation of affinity into which Shulamith has entered a reference to
himself individually, for he says ahhothi callaa (my sister-bride): she
who as callaa of his mother is to her a kind of daughter, is as callaa
in relation to himself, as it were, his sister.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 4:10</span></span>

He proceeds still further to praise her attractions.

10 How fair is thy love, my sister-bride!

How much better thy love than wine!

And the fragrance of thy unguents than all spices!

11 Thy lips drop honey, my bride;

Honey and milk are under thy tongue;

And the fragrance of thy garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.

Regarding the connection of the pluralet. דּודים with the plur. of the
pred., vid., at [Sol 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md). The pred.
יפוּ praises her love in its manifestations according to its impression
on the sight; טבוּ, according to its experience on nearer intercourse.
As in [Sol 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009.md) the same power of
impression is attributed to the eyes and to the necklace, so here is
intermingled praise of the beauty of her person with praise of the
fragrance, the odour of the clothing of the bride; for her soul speaks
out not only by her lips, she breathes forth odours also for him in her
spices, which he deems more fragrant than all other odours, because he
inhales, as it were, her soul along with them. נפת, from נפת, ebullire
(vid., under [Pro 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md), also
Schultens), is virgin honey, ἄκοιτον (acetum, Pliny, xi. 15), i.e., that
which of itself flows from the combs (צוּפים). Honey drops from the lips
which he kisses; milk and honey are under the tongue which whispers to
him words of pure and inward joy; cf. the contrary, [Psa
140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md). The last line is an echo of
[Gen 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027.md). שׂלמה is שׂמלה (from שׂמל,
complicare, complecti) transposed (cf. עלנה from עולה, כּשׂבּה from
כּבשׂה). As Jacob's raiment had for his old father the fragrance of a
field which God had blessed, so for Solomon the garments of the
faultless and pure one, fresh from the woods and mountains of the north,
gave forth a heart-strengthening savour like the fragrance of Lebanon
([Hos 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007).md), viz., of its fragrant
herbs and trees, chiefly of the balsamic odour of the apples of the
cedar.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 4:12</span></span>

The praise is sensuous, but it has a moral consecration.

12 A garden locked is my sister-bride;

A spring locked, a fountain sealed.

גּן (according to rule masc. Bttch. 658) denotes the garden from its
enclosure; גּ (elsewhere נּלּה ere), the fountain (synon. מבּוּע), the
waves bubbling forth (cf. [Amo 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024).md);
and מעין, the place, as it were an eye of the earth, from which a
fountain gushes forth. Luther distinguishes rightly between gan and gal;
on the contrary, all the old translators (even the Venet.) render as if
the word in both cases were gan. The Pasek between gan and nā'ul, and
between gal and nā'ul, is designed to separate the two Nuns, as e.g., at
[Ch2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#009.md); [Neh
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#002.md), the two Mems; it is the
orthophonic Pasek, already described under [Sol
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007.md), which secures the independence of
two similar or organically related sounds. Whether the sealed fountain
(fons signatus) alludes to a definite fountain which Solomon had built
for the upper city and the temple place,

(Note: Vid., Zschocke in the Tbinger Quartalschrift, 1867, 3.)

we do not now inquire. To a locked garden and spring no one has access
but the rightful owner, and a sealed fountain is shut against all
impurity. Thus she is closed against the world, and inaccessible to all
that would disturb her pure heart, or desecrate her pure person.

(Note: Seal, חותם, pers. muhr, is used directly in the sense of
maiden-like behaviour; vid., Perles' etymol. Studien (1871), p. 67.)

All the more beautiful and the greater is the fulness of the flowers and
fruits which bloom and ripen in the garden of this life, closed against
the world and its lust.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 4:13</span></span>

13 What sprouts forth for thee is a park of pomegranates,

With most excellent fruits;

Cypress flowers with nards;

14 Nard and crocus; calamus and cinnamon,

With all kinds of incense trees;

Myrrh and aloes,

With all the chief aromatics.

The common subject to all down to [Sol
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#015.md) inclusive is שׁלחיך ("what
sprouts for thee" = "thy plants"), as a figurative designation, borrowed
from plants, of all the "phenomena and life utterances" (Bttch.) of her
personality. "If I only knew here," says Rocke, "how to disclose the
meaning, certainly all these flowers and fruits, in the figurative
language of the Orient, in the flower-language of love, had their
beautiful interpretation." In the old German poetry, also, the phrase
bluomen brechen to break flowers was equivalent to: to enjoy love; the
flowers and fruits named are figures of all that the amata offers to the
amator. Most of the plants here named are exotics; פּרדּס (heaping
around, circumvallation, enclosing) is a garden or park, especially with
foreign ornamental and fragrant plants - an old Persian word, the
explanation of which, after Spiegel, first given in our exposition of
the Song, 1851 (from pairi = περί, and dêz, R. diz, a heap), has now
become common property (Justi's Handb. der Zendsprache, p. 180). מגדים
פּרי (from מגד, which corresponds to The Arab. mejd, praise, honour,
excellence; vid., Volck under [Deu
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013).md) are fructus laudum, or
lautitiarum, excellent precious fruits, which in the more modern
language are simply called מגדים (Shabbath 127b, מיני מגדים, all kinds
of fine fruits); cf. Syr. magdo, dried fruit. Regarding כּפר, vid.,
under [Sol 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md); regarding מר, under
[Sol 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md); also regarding נרדּ, under
[Sol 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012.md). The long vowel of נרדּ
corresponds to the Pers. form nârd, but near to which is also nard,
Indian nalada (fragrance-giving); the ē is thus only the long accent,
and can therefore disappear in the plur. For נרדים, Grtz reads ירדים,
roses, because the poet would not have named nard twice. The conjecture
is beautiful, but for us, who believe the poem to be Solomonic, is
inconsistent with the history of roses (vid., under [Sol
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001).md), and also unnecessary. The
description moves forward by steps rhythmically.

כּרוכם is the crocus stativus, the genuine Indian safran, the dried
flower-eyes of which yield the safran used as a colour, as an aromatic,
and also as medicine; safran is an Arab. word, and means yellow root and
yellow colouring matter. The name כּרוכם, Pers. karkam, Arab. karkum, is
radically Indian, Sanscr. kunkuma. קנה, a reed (from קנה, R. qn, to rise
up, viewed intrans.),

(Note: In this general sense of "reed" (Syn. arundo) the word is also
found in the Gr. and Lat.: κάνναι (κάναι), reed-mats, κάνεον κάναστρον,
a wicker basket, canna, canistrum, without any reference to an
Indo-Germ. verbal stem, and without acquiring the specific signification
of an aromatic plant.)

viz., sweet reed, acorus calamus, which with us now grows wild in
marshes, but is indigenous to the Orient.

קנּמנן is the laurus cinnamomum, a tree indigenous to the east coast of
Africa and Ceylon, and found later also on the Antilles. It is of the
family of the laurineae, the inner bark of which, peeled off and rolled
together, is the cinnamon-bark (cannella, French cannelle); Aram.
קוּנמא, as also the Greek κιννάμοομον and κίνναμον, Lat. (e.g., in the
12th book of Pliny) cinnamomum and cinnamum, are interchanged, from קנם,
probably a secondary formation from קנה (like בּם, whence בּמה, from
בּא), to which also Syr. qenûmā', ὑπόστασις, and the Talm.-Targ. קנּוּם
קונם, an oath (cf. קים), go back, so that thus the name which was
brought to the west by the Phoenicians denoted not the tree, but the
reed-like form of the rolled dried bark. As "nards" refer to varieties
of the nard, perhaps to the Indian and the Jamanic spoken of by Strabo
and others, so "all kinds of incense trees" refers definitely to
Indo-Arab. varieties of the incense tree and its fragrant resin; it has
its name fro the white and transparent seeds of this its resin (cf.
Arab. lubân, incense and benzoin, the resin of the storax tree, לבנה);
the Greek λίβανος, λιβανωτός (Lat. thus, frankincense, from θύω), is a
word derived from the Pheonicians.

אהלות or אהלים (which already in a remarkable way was used by Balaam,
[Num 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#006.md), elsewhere only since the
time of Solomon) is the Semitized old Indian name of the aloe, agaru or
aguru; that which is aromatic is the wood of the aloe-tree (aloxylon
agallochum), particularly its dried root (agallochum or lignum alos,
ξυλαλόη, according to which the Targ. here: אלואין אכסיל, after the
phrase in Aruch) mouldered in the earth, which chiefly came from farther
India.

(Note: Vid., Lassen's Ind. Alterthumsk. I 334f. Furrer, in Schenkel's
Bib. Lex., understands אהלות of the liliaceae, indigenous to Palestine
as to Arabia, which is also called alo. But the drastic purgative which
the succulent leaves of this plant yield is not aromatic, and the verb
אחל "to glisten," whence he seeks to derive the name of this aloe, is
not proved. Cf. besides, the Petersburg Lex. under aguru ("not
difficult"), according to which is this name of the amyris agallocha,
and the aquilaria agallocha, but of no liliaceae. The name Adlerholz
("eagle-wood") rests on a misunderstanding of the name of the Agila
tree. It is called "Paradiesholz," because it must have been one of the
paradise trees (vid., Bereshith rabba under [Gen
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008).md). Dioskorides says of this wood:
θυμιᾶται ἀντὶ λιβανωτοῦ; the Song therefore places it along with myrrh
and frankincense. That which is common to the lily-aloe and the
wood-aloe, is the bitter taste of the juice of the former and of the
resinous wood of the latter. The Arab. name of the aloe, ṣabir, is also
given to the lily-aloe. The proverbs: amarru min eṣ-ṣabir, bitterer than
the aloe, and es-sabr sabir, patience is the aloe, refer to the
aloe-juice.)

עם, as everywhere, connects things contained together or in any way
united ([Sol 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md); cf. [Sol
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#011.md), as [Psa
87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md); cf. [Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012).md). The concluding phrase וגו
כּל־ר, cum praestantissimis quibusque aromatibus, is a poet. et cetera.
ראשׁ, with the gen. of the object whose value is estimated, denotes what
is of meilleure qualit; or, as the Talm. says, what is אלפא, ἄλφα, i.e.,
number one. Ezek; [Eze 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#022.md), in a
similar sense, says, "with chief (ראשׁ) of all spices."

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sol 4:15</span></span>

The panegyric returns now once more to the figure of a fountain.

15 A garden-fountain, a well of living water,

And torrents from Lebanon.

The tertium compar. in [Sol 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012.md) was
the collecting and sealing up; here, it is the inner life and its
outward activity. A fountain in gardens (גּנּים, categ. pl.) is put to
service for the benefit of the beds of plants round about, and it has in
these gardens, as it were, its proper sphere of influence. A well of
living water is one in which that which is distributes springs up from
within, so that it is indeed given to it, but not without at the same
time being its own true property. נזל is related, according to the
Semitic usus loq., to אזל, as "niedergehen" (to go down) to "weggehen"
(to go away) (vid., [Pro 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015).md);
similarly related are (Arab.) sar, to go, and sal (in which the letter
ra is exchanged for lam, to express the softness of the liquid), to
flow, whence syl (sêl), impetuous stream, rushing water, kindred in
meaning to נזלים. Streams which come from Lebanon have a rapid descent,
and (so far as they do not arise in the snow region) the water is not
only fresh, but clear as crystal. All these figures understood
sensuously would be insipid; but understood ethically, they are
exceedingly appropriate, and are easily interpreted, so that the
conjecture is natural, that on the supposition of the spiritual
interpretation of the Song, Jesus has this saying in His mind when He
says that streams of living water shall flow "out of the belly" of the
believer, [Joh 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 4:16</span></span>

The king's praise is for Shulamith proof of his love, which seeks a
response. But as she is, she thinks herself yet unworthy of him; her
modesty says to her that she needs preparation for him, preparation by
that blowing which is the breath of God in the natural and in the
spiritual world.

16 Awake, thou North (wind), and come, thou South!

Blow through my garden, cause its spices to flow -

Let my beloved come into his garden,

And eat the fruits which are precious to him.

The names of the north and south, denoting not only the regions of the
heavens, but also the winds blowing from these regions, are of the fem.
gender, [Isa 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006.md). The east wind,
קדים, is purposely not mentioned; the idea of that which is destructive
and adverse is connected with it (vid., under [Job
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021).md). The north wind brings cold
till ice is formed, Sir. 43:20; and if the south wind blow, it is hot,
[Luk 12:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#055.md). If cold and heat, coolness
and sultriness, interchange at the proper time, then growth is promoted.
And if the wind blow through a garden at one time from this direction
and at another from that, - not so violently as when it shakes the trees
of the forest, but softly and yet as powerfully as a garden can bear it,
- then all the fragrance of the garden rises in waves, and it becomes
like a sea of incense. The garden itself then blows, i.e., emits odours;
for (פּח = the Arab. fakh, fah, cf. fawh, pl. afwâh, sweet odours,
fragrant plants) as in היּום רוּח, [Gen
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#008.md), the idea underlies the

the precious fruit belonging to him. With words of such gentle
tenderness, childlike purity, she gives herself to her beloved.
