### [Hosea Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 7:1</span></span>

In the first strophe ([Hos 7:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001).md) the
exposure of the moral depravity of Israel is continued. [Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md). "When I heal Israel, the iniquity
of Ephraim, reveals itself, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they
practise deceit; and the thief cometh, the troop of robbers plundereth
without. [Hos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#002.md). And they say not in
their heart, I should remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds
have surrounded them, they have occurred before my face. [Hos
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#003.md). They delight the king with their
wickedness, and princes with their lies." As the dangerous nature of a
wound is often first brought out by the attempt to heal it, so was the
corruption of Israel only brought truly to light by the effort to stem
it. The first hemistich of [Hos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md) is
not to be referred to the future, nor is the healing to be understood as
signifying punishment, as Hitzig supposes; but the allusion is to the
attempts made by God to put a stop to the corruption, partly by the
preaching of repentance and the reproofs of the prophets, and partly by
chastisements designed to promote reformation. The words contain no
threatening of punishment, but a picture of the moral corruption that
had become incurable. Here again Ephraim is not the particular tribe,
but is synonymous with Israel, the people or kingdom of the ten tribes;
and Samaria is especially mentioned in connection with it, as the
capital and principal seat of the corruption of morals, just as Judah
and Jerusalem are frequently classed together by the prophets. The
lamentation concerning the incurability of the kingdom is followed by an
explanatory notice of the sins and crimes that are openly committed.
Sheqer, lying, i.e., deception both in word and deed towards God and
man, theft and highway robbery and not fear of the vengeance of God.
"Accedit ad haec facinora securitas eorum ineffabilis" (Marck). They do
not consider that God will remember their evil deeds, and punish them;
they are surrounded by them on all sides, and perform them without shame
or fear before the face of God Himself. These sins delight both king and
prince. To such a depth have even the rulers of the nation, who ought to
practise justice and righteousness, fallen, that they not only fail to
punish the sins, but take pleasure in their being committed.

[Hosea 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 7:4</span></span>

To this there is added the passion with which the people make themselves
slave to idolatry, and their rulers give themselves up to debauchery
([Hos 7:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004).md). [Hos
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004.md). "They are all adulterers, like an
oven heated by the baker, who leaves off stirring from the kneading of
the dough until its leavening. [Hos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md). In the day of our king the
princes are made sick with the heat of wine: he has stretched out his
hand with the scorners. [Hos 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#006.md). For
they have brought their heart into their ambush, as into the oven; the
whole night their baker sleeps; in the morning it burns like flaming
fire. [Hos 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#007.md). They are all red-hot
like the oven, and consume their judges: all their kings have fallen;
none among them calls to me." "All" (kullâm: [Hos
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004).md) does not refer to the king and
princes, but to the whole nation. נאף is spiritual adultery, apostasy
from the Lord; and literal adultery is only so far to be thought of,
that the worship of Baal promoted licentiousness. In this passionate
career the nation resembles a furnace which a baker heats in the
evening, and leaves burning all night while the dough is leavening, and
then causes to turn with a still brighter flame in the morning, when the
dough is ready for baking. בּערה מאפה, burning from the baker, i.e.,
heated by the baker. בּערה is accentuated as milel, either because the
Masoretes took offence at תּנּוּר being construed as a feminine (Ges.
Lehrgeb. p. 546; Ewald, Gramm. p. 449, note 1), or because tiphchah
could not occupy any other place in the short space between zakeph and
athnach (Hitzig). העיר, excitare, here in the sense of stirring. On the
use of the participle in the place of the infinitive, with verbs of
beginning and ending, see Ewald, 298, b.

[Hos 7:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md)

Both king and princes are addicted to debauchery ([Hos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005).md). "The day of our king" is either
the king's birthday, or the day when he ascended the throne, on either
of which he probably gave a feast to his nobles. יום is taken most
simply as an adverbial accus. loci. On this particular day the princes
drink to such an extent, that they become ill with the heat of the wine.
החלוּ, generally to make ill, here to make one's self ill. Hitzig
follows the ancient versions, in deriving it from חלל, and taking it as
equivalent to החלּוּ ot , "they begin," which gives a very insipid
meaning. The difficult expression משׁך ידו את־ל, "he draws his hand with
the scoffers," can hardly be understood in any other way than that
suggested by Gesenius (Lex.), "the king goes about with scoffers," i.e.,
makes himself familiar with them, so that we may compare שׁוּת ידו עם
([Exo 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001).md). The scoffers are
drunkards, just as in [Pro 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001.md) wine
is directly called a scoffer. In [Hos
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#006.md), [Hos
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#007.md), the thought of the fourth verse
is carried out still further. כּי introduces the explanation and ground
of the simile of the furnace; for [Hos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md) is subordinate to the main
thought, and to be taken as a parenthetical remark. The words from כּי
קרבוּ to בּארבּם ot כּי קרבוּ form one sentence. קרב is construed with ב
loci, as in [Jdg 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#013.md); [Psa
91:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#010.md) : they have brought their heart
near, brought them into their craftiness. "Like a furnace" (כּתנּוּר)
contains an abridged simile. But it is not their heart itself which is
here compared to a furnace (their heart = themselves), in the sense of
"burning like a flaming furnace with base desires," as Gesenius
supposes; for the idea of bringing a furnace into an 'ōrebh would be
unsuitable and unintelligible. "The furnace is rather 'orbâm (their
ambush), that which they have in common, that which keeps them together;
whilst the fuel is libbâm, their own disposition" (Hitzig). Their baker
is the machinator doli, who kindles the fire in them, i.e., in actual
fact, not some person or other who instigates a conspiracy, but the
passion of idolatry. This sleeps through the night, i.e., it only rests
till the opportunity and time have arrived for carrying out the evil
thoughts of their heart, or until the evil thoughts of the heart have
become ripe for execution. This time is described in harmony with the
figure, as the morning, in which the furnace burns up into bright flames
(הוּא points to the more remote tannūr as the subject). In [Hos
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#007.md) the figure is carried back to the
literal fact. With the words, "they are all hot as a furnace," the
expression in [Hos 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004.md), "adulterous
like a furnace," is resumed; and now the fruit of this conduct is
mentioned, viz., "they devour their judges, cast down their kings." By
the judges we are not to understand the sârı̄m of [Hos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md), who are mentioned along with the
king as the supreme guardians of the law; but the kings themselves are
intended, as the administrators of justice, as in [Hos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010.md), where shōphetı̄m is also used as
synonymous with מלך, and embraces both king and princes. The clause,
"all their kings are fallen," adds no new feature to what precedes, and
does not affirm that kings have also fallen in addition to or along with
the judges; but it sums up what has been stated already, for the purpose
of linking on the remark, that no one calls to the Lord concerning the
fall of the kings. The suffix בּהם does not refer to the fallen kings,
but to the nation in its entirety, i.e., to those who have devoured
their judges. The thought is this: in the passion with which all are
inflamed for idolatry, and with which the princes revel with the kings,
they give no such heed to the inevitable consequences of their ungodly
conduct, as that any one reflects upon the fall of the kings, or
perceives that Israel has forsaken the way which leads to salvation, and
is plunging headlong into the abyss of destruction, so as to return to
the Lord, who alone can help and save. The prophet has here the times
after Jeroboam II in his mind, when Zechariah was overthrown by Shallum,
Shallum by Menahem, and Menahem the son of Pekahiah by Pekah, and that
in the most rapid succession ([Kg2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010.md), [Kg2
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#014.md), [Kg2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025).md), together with the eleven
years' anarchy between Zechariah and Shallum (see at [Kg2
15:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008).md). At the same time, the
expression, "all their kings have fallen," shows clearly, not only that
the words are not to be limited to these events, but embrace all the
earlier revolutions, but also and still more clearly, that there is no
foundation whatever for the widespread historical interpretation of
these verses, as relating to a conspiracy against the then reigning king
Zechariah, or Shallum, or Pakahiah, according to which the baker is
either Menahem (Hitzig) or Pekah (Schmidt).

[Hosea 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 7:8</span></span>

In the next strophe ([Hos 7:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#008).md) the
prophecy passes from the internal corruption of the kingdom of the ten
tribes to its worthless foreign policy, and the injurious attitude which
it had assumed towards the heathen nations, and unfolds the disastrous
consequences of such connections. [Hos
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#008.md). "Ephraim, it mixes itself among
the nations; Ephraim has become a cake not turned. [Hos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009.md). Strangers have devoured his
strength, and he knoweth it not; grey hair is also sprinkled upon him,
and he knoweth it not." יתבּולל, from בּלל, to mix or commingle, is not
a future in the sense of "it will be dispersed among the Gentiles;" for,
according to the context, the reference is not to the punishment of the
dispersion of Israel among the nations, but to the state in which Israel
then was. The Lord had separated Israel from the nations, that it might
be holy to Him ([Lev 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024.md), [Lev
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026).md). As Balaam said of it, it was
to be a people dwelling alone ([Num
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009).md). But in opposition to this
object of its divine calling, the ten tribes had mingled with the
nations, i.e., with the heathen, learned their works, and served their
idols (cf. [Psa 106:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#035).md). The
mingling with the nations consisted in the adoption of heathen ways, not
in the penetration of the heathen into Israelitish possessions (Hitzig),
nor merely in the alliances which it formed with heathen nations. For
these were simply the consequence of inward apostasy from its God, of
that inward mixing with the nature of heathenism which had already taken
place. Israel had thereby become a cake not turned. עגּה, a cake baked
upon hot ashes or red-hot stones, which, if it be not turned, is burned
at the bottom, and not baked at all above. The meaning of this figure is
explained by [Hos 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009.md). As the fire
will burn an ash-cake when it is left unturned, so have foreigners
consumed the strength of Israel, partly by devastating wars, and partly
by the heathenish nature which has penetrated into Israel in their
train. "Greyness is also sprinkled upon it;" i.e., the body politic,
represented as one person, is already covered with traces of hoary old
age, and is ripening for destruction. The object to לא ידע may easily be
supplied from the previous clauses, namely, that strangers devour its
strength, and it is growing old. The rendering non sapit is precluded by
the emphatic והוּא, and he knoweth it not, i.e., does not perceive the
decay of his strength.

[Hosea 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 7:10</span></span>

"And the pride of Israel beareth witness to his face, and they are not
converted to Jehovah their God, and for all this they seek Him not." The
first clause is repeated from [Hos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md). The testimony which the pride of
Israel, i.e., Jehovah, bore to its face, consisted in the weakening and
wasting away of the kingdom as described in [Hos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009.md). But with all this, they do not
turn to the Lord who could save them, but seek help from their natural
foes.

[Hosea 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 7:11</span></span>

"And Ephraim has become like a simple dove without understanding; they
have called Egypt, they are gone to Asshur. [Hos
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#012.md). As they go, I spread my net over
them; I bring them down like fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them,
according to the tidings to their assembly." The perfects in [Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md) describe the conduct of Israel as
an accomplished fact, and this is represented by ויהי as the necessary
consequence of its obstinate impenitence. The point of comparison
between Israel and the simple dove, is not that the dove misses its
proper dwelling and resting-place, and therefore goes fluttering about
(Ewald); nor that, in trying to escape from the hawk, it flies into the
net of the bird-catcher (Hitzig); but that when flying about in search
of food, it does not observe the net that is spread for it (Rosenmller).
אין לב is to be taken as a predicate to Ephraim in spite of the accents,
and not to yōnâh phōthâh (a simple dove), since phōthâh does not require
either strengthening or explaining. Thus does Ephraim seek help from
Egypt and Assyria. These words do not refer to the fact that there were
two parties in the nation - an Assyrian and an Egyptian. Nor do they
mean that the whole nation applied at one time to Egypt to get rid of
Asshur, and at another time to Asshur to escape from Egypt. "The
situation is rather this: the people being sorely pressed by Asshur, at
one time seek help from Egypt against Asshur; whilst at another they try
to secure the friendship of the latter" (Hengstenberg, Christology, i.
p. 164 transl.). For what threatened Israel was the burden of the "king
of princes" ([Hos 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010).md), i.e., the
king of Asshur. And this they tried to avert partly by their coquettish
arts ([Hos 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009).md), and partly by
appealing to the help of Egypt; and while doing so, they did not observe
that they had fallen into the net of destruction, viz., the power of
Assyria. In this net will the Lord entangle them as a punishment. As
they go thither, God will spread His net over them like a bird-catcher,
and bring them down to the earth like flying birds, i.e., bring them
down from the open air, that is to say, from freedom, into the net of
captivity, or exile. איסירם, a rare hiphil formation with Yod mobile, as
in [Pro 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#025) (see Ewald, 131, c.md).
"According to the tidings (announcement) to their assembly:" i.e., in
accordance with the threatening already contained in the law ([Lev
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014.md).; [Deu
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015)..md), and repeatedly uttered to the
congregation by the prophets, of the judgments that should fall upon the
rebellious, which threatening would now be fulfilled upon Ephraim.

[Hosea 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 7:13</span></span>

"Woe to them! for they have flown from me; devastation to them! for they
have fallen away from me. I would redeem them, but they speak lies
concerning me. [Hos 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014.md). They did not
cry to me in their heart, but howl upon their beds; they crowd together
for corn and new wine, and depart against me." The Lord, thinking of the
chastisement, exclaims, Woe to them, because they have fled from Him!
Nâdad, which is applied to the flying of birds, points back to the
figures employed in [Hos 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md), [Hos
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#012.md). Shōd, used as an exclamation,
gives the literal explanation of 'ōi (woe). The imperfect 'ephdēm cannot
be taken as referring to the redemption out of Egypt, because it does
not stand for the preterite. It is rather voluntative or optative. "I
would (should like to) redeem them (still); but they say I cannot and
will not do it." These are the lies which they utter concerning Jehovah,
partly with their mouths and partly by their actions, namely, in the
fact that they do not seek help from Him, as is explained in [Hos
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014.md). They cry to the Lord; yet it
does not come from the heart, but (כּי after לא) they howl (יילילוּ, cf.
Ges. 70, 2, note) upon their beds, in unbelieving despair at the
distress that has come upon them. What follows points to this.
Hithgōrēr, to assemble, to crowd together ([Psa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md); [Psa
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#004.md); [Isa
54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015).md); here to gather in troops or
crowd together for corn and new wine, because their only desire is to
fill their belly. Thus they depart from God. The construction of סוּר
with ב, instead of with מן or מאחרי, is a pregnant one: to depart and
turn against God.

[Hosea 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 7:15</span></span>

Yet Jehovah has done still more for Israel. [Hos
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#015.md). "And I have instructed, have
strengthened their arms, and they think evil against me. [Hos
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016.md). They turn, but not upwards: they
have become like a false bow. Their princes will fall by the sword, for
the defiance of their tongue: this is their derision in the land of
Egypt." יסּר here is not to chastise, but to instruct, so that זרועתם
(their arms) is to be taken as the object to both verbs. Instructing the
arms, according to the analogy of [Psa
18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035.md), is equivalent to showing where
and how strength is to be acquired. And the Lord has not contented
Himself with merely instructing. He has also strengthened their arms,
and given them power to fight, and victory over their foes (cf. [Kg2
14:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md). And yet they think evil of
Him; not by speaking lies ([Hos 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#013).md),
but by falling away from Him, by their idolatrous calf-worship, by which
they rob the Lord of the glory due to Him alone, practically denying His
true divinity. This attitude towards the Lord is summed up in two
allegorical sentences in [Hos 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016.md),
and the ruin of their princes is foretold. They turn, or turn round, but
not upwards (על, an adverb, or a substantive signifying height, as in
[Hos 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md); [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md), not "the Most High," i.e., God,
although turning upwards is actually turning to God). From the fact that
with all their turning about they do not turn upwards, they have become
like a treacherous bow, the string of which has lost its elasticity, so
that the arrows do not hit the mark (cf. [Psa
78:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#057).md). And thus Israel also fails to
reach its destination. Therefore its princes shall fall. The princes are
mentioned as the originators of the enmity against God, and all the
misery into which they have plunged the people and kingdom. זעם, fury,
here defiance or rage. Defiance of tongue the princes showed in the lies
which they uttered concerning Jehovah ([Hos
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#013).md), and with which they blasphemed
in a daring manner the omnipotence and faithfulness of the Lord. זו
stands, according to a dialectical difference in the mode of
pronunciation, for זה, not for זאת (Ewald, 183, a). This, namely their
falling by the sword, will be for a derision to them in the land of
Egypt: not because they will fall in Egypt, or perish by the sword of
the Egyptians; but because they put their trust in Egypt, the derision
of Egypt will come upon them when they are overthrown (cf. [Isa
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#003.md), [Isa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#005).md).
