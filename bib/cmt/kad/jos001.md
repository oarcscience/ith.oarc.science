### [Joshua Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

The Preamble - [Jos 1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

After the death of Moses the Lord summoned Joshua, the servant of Moses,
whom He had appointed as the leader of Israel into Canaan, to go with
all the people across the Jordan, and take the land which had been
promised to the fathers on oath, assuring him at the same time of His
powerful aid, on condition that he observed the law of Moses faithfully.
This summons and promise of God form the preamble to the whole book,
which is linked on to the conclusion of the Pentateuch by the
introductory words, "And it came to pass after the death of Moses, the
servant of the Lord," though it is not so closely connected as to
warrant the conclusion that the two works have been written by the same
author.

[Joshua 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 1:1</span></span>

The imperfect with vav consec., the standing mode of expressing a
continued action or train of thought, "simply attaches itself by the
conjunction 'and' to a completed action, which has either been mentioned
before, or is supposed to be well known" (Ewald, 231, b.). "After the
death of Moses," i.e., after the expiration of the thirty days of
general mourning for him (vid., [Deu
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#008)). "Servant of Jehovah" is a
standing epithet applied to Moses as an honourable title, and founded
upon [Num 12:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007) (vid., [Deu
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#005); [Kg1
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#056); [Kg2
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#012); [Psa
105:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#026), etc.). On "Joshua, Moses'
minister," see at [Exo 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009) and [Num
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016). Minister (meshareth), as in
[Exo 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#013), etc. Although Joshua had
already been called by the mouth of the Lord to be the successor of
Moses in the task of leading the people into Canaan ([Num
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#015).), and had not only been
presented to the people in this capacity, but had been instituted in
this office by the Lord, with the promise of His help ([Deu
31:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#003) and [Deu
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#023)), the word of the Lord came to
him a second time after the death of Moses, with the command to enter
upon the office to which he had been called, and with the promise that
He would help him to fulfil its duties, as he had already helped His
servant Moses. "Because even some of the bravest men, although fully
prepared beforehand, either stand still or hesitate when the thing has
to be done: this exhortation to Joshua, to gird himself at once for the
expedition, was by no means superfluous; though his call was ratified
again not only for his own sake, but in order that the people might not
hesitate to follow him with their minds collected and calm, when they
saw that he took no step without the guidance of God" (Calvin). - Joshua
received this word of the Lord by a direct address from God, and not
through the intervention of the Urim and Thummim of the high priest; for
this appointed medium for the revelation of the will of God, to which he
had been referred on the occasion of his first call ([Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021)), whenever difficulties should
arise in connection with his office, was not sufficient for the renewal
and confirmation of his divine calling, since the thing required here
was not merely that the will of God should be made known to him, but
that he should be inspired with courage and strength for the fulfilment
of it, i.e., for discharging the duties of his office, just as he
afterwards was then in front of the fortified town of Jericho which he
was directed to take, where the angel of the Lord appeared to him and
assured him of its fall ([Jos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013)).
Moreover, the conquest of Canaan formed part of the work which the Lord
entrusted to His servant Moses, and in which therefore Joshua was now
Moses' successor. Consequently the Lord would be with him as He had been
with Moses ([Jos 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)); and for this
reason He revealed His will directly to him, as He had done to Moses,
though without talking with him mouth to mouth ([Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008)).

[Joshua 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 1:2</span></span>

As Moses had died without having brought the Israelites to Canaan,
Joshua was to arise and go with all the nation over this Jordan (i.e.,
the river then before him) into the land which the Lord would give them.

[Joshua 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 1:3</span></span>

"Namely, every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon," i.e.,
I have given you the whole land, not excepting a single foot's breadth.
The perfect, "I have given," refers to the counsel of God as having been
formed long before, and being now about to be carried into execution.
These words, which are connected with [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024), so far as the form is
concerned, rest upon the promise of God in [Exo
23:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#030), to which the words "as I
said unto Moses" refer.

[Joshua 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 1:4</span></span>

The boundaries of the land are given as in [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024), with the simple difference in
form, that the boundary line from the desert (of Arabia) and Lebanon,
i.e., from the southern and northern extremity, is drawn first of all
towards the east to the great river, the Euphrates, and then towards the
west to "the great sea, toward the going down of the sun," i.e., the
Mediterranean; and then between these two termini ad quem the more
precise definition is inserted, "all the land of the Hittites;" whereas
in Deuteronomy the southern, northern, and eastern boundaries are placed
in antithesis to the western boundary, and the more precise definition
of the country to be taken is given by an enumeration of the different
tribes that were to be destroyed by the Israelites ([Deu
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#023)). On the oratorical character of
these descriptions, see at [Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018).
The demonstrative pronoun "this," in connection with Lebanon, may be
explained from the fact that Lebanon, or at all events Anti-libanus, was
visible from the Israelitish camp. The expression "the Hittites" (see at
[Gen 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015)) is used here in a broader
sense for Canaanites in general, as in [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029); [Kg2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006); [Eze
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003). The promise in [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005) is adopted from [Deu
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#025), where it was made to the whole
nation, and specially transferred to Joshua; and [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005) is repeated from [Deu
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#008), as compared with [Jos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#006).

[Joshua 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 1:6</span></span>

The promise is followed by the condition upon which the Lord would
fulfil His word. Joshua was to be firm and strong, i.e., well-assured,
courageous, not alarmed (vid., [Deu
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006)). In the first place ([Jos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#006)), he was to rely firmly upon the
Lord and His promise, as Moses and the Lord had already told him ([Deu
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#007) and [Deu
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#023)), and as is again repeated here,
whilst at the same time the expression, "thou shalt divide for an
inheritance," recalls to mind [Deu
1:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#038); [Deu
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#028); and in the second place ([Jos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#007), [Jos
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008)), he was to strive to attain and
preserve this firmness by a careful observance of the law. "Observe to
do," etc., as Moses had already impressed upon the hearts of all the
people ([Deu 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#029), cf. [Deu
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#014) and [Deu
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#027)). The suffix in ממּנּוּ is to be
explained on the supposition that the speaker had the book of the law in
his mind. The further expansion, in [Jos
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008), is not only attached to the
exhortations, with which Moses urges upon all the people in [Deu
6:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006), and [Deu
11:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018), an uninterrupted study and
laying to heart of the commandments of God, but even more closely to the
directions to the king, to read every day in the law ([Deu
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#019)). "Not to depart out of the
mouth," is to be constantly in the mouth. The law is in our mouth, not
only when we are incessantly preaching it, but when we are reading it
intelligently for ourselves, or conversing about it with others. To this
there was to be added meditation, or reflection upon it both day and
night (vid., [Psa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002)). הגה does not
mean theoretical speculation about the law, such as the Pharisees
indulged in, but a practical study of the law, for the purpose of
observing it in thought and action, or carrying it out with the heart,
the mouth, and the hand. Such a mode of employing it would be sure to be
followed by blessings. "Then shalt thou make they way prosperous," i.e.,
succeed in all thine undertakings (vid., [Deu
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029)), "and act wisely" (as in [Deu
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#008)).

[Joshua 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 1:9</span></span>

In conclusion, the Lord not only repeats His exhortation to firmness,
but the promise that He gave in [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005) and [Jos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#006). "Have I not" (nonne) is a
rhetorical mode of saying, "Behold, I have," the assurance being clothed
in the form of an affirmative question. On the words "be not afraid,"
etc., see [Deu 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006) and [Deu
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#008).

[Joshua 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 1:10</span></span>

[Jos 1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010)

Preparations for Crossing the Jordan. - [Jos
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010). For the purpose of carrying
out the commands of the Lord, Joshua first of all directed the officers
of the people (shoterim: see at Ex 5-6), whose duty it was, as the
keepers of the family registers, to attend not only to the levying of
the men who were bound to serve in the army, but also to the circulation
of the commands of the general, to issue orders to the people in the
camp to provide themselves with food, so that they might cross the
Jordan within three days, and take the land that was promised them by
God. By zedah, provision for a journey ([Gen
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#025), etc.), we are not to understand
manna, for that had already ceased (see at [Jos
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#012)), but simply the natural produce
of the inhabited country. The expression "in three days," i.e., as we
may see from comparing [Gen 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#013),
[Gen 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#019), with [Gen
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#020), on the third day from the
publication of the command, "will ye go over the Jordan," is not to be
regarded as a prediction of the time when the crossing actually took
place, but to be taken as the latest time that could be allowed to the
people to prepare for crossing: viz., in this sense, "Prepare you
victuals for crossing over the Jordan within three days," i.e., that you
may be able to leave Shittim within that time, to cross over the Jordan,
and commence the conquest of Canaan. If we understand the words in this
way, they are in perfect harmony with Josh 2 and 3. According to Josh 2,
Joshua sent out spies from Shittim to Jericho, who were obliged to hide
themselves for three days in the mountains after their flight from that
city ([Jos 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#022)), before they could
return to the Israelitish camp; so that they were absent three or four
days at any rate, and came back at the earliest in the evening or night
of the fourth day after they had been sent out. It was not till the
morning after this that the Israelites left Shittim and proceeded to the
Jordan, where they halted again. Then, three days afterwards, they went
across the river ([Jos 3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001)), so that
at least 4 + 1 + 3, i.e., eight whole days must have intervened between
the day when the spies were sent out and the day on which the people
crossed the river. Joshua no doubt intended to proceed to the Jordan and
cross it within three days after despatching the spies; he therefore
sent the spies to Jericho on the same day on which he issued the command
to the people to prepare for crossing within three days, so that he
might reasonably hope that they would fulfil their commission and return
in two or three days. But as they were compelled to hide themselves for
three days in the mountains, in consequence of the unexpected discovery
of their arrival in Jericho, and the despatch of men in pursuit of them,
Joshua could not remove with the people from Shittim and proceed to the
Jordan till the day after their return; and even then he could not cross
the river at once, but waited three days after reaching the bank of the
river before he crossed to the other side (vid., [Jos
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001).).

(Note: In this way the different statements in the three chapters
harmonize perfectly well. But the majority of commentators have arranged
the order of succession differently and in a very arbitrary way,
starting with the unwarrantable assumption that the time referred to in
this verse, "within three days," is identical with that in [Jos
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002), "it came to pass after three
days." Upon the strength of this groundless assumption, Knobel maintains
that there is great confusion in the order of succession of the events
described in Josh 1-3, that [Jos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011)
is irreconcilable with [Jos 3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001), and
that accounts written by three different authors have been mixed up
together in these chapters. (For the different attempts to reconcile the
accounts, see Keil's Commentary on Joshua, pp. 72-75, note, Eng. trans.
Clark, 1857.))

[Jos 1:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#012)

Joshua's appeal to the two tribes and a half, to remember the condition
on which Moses gave them the land on the east of the Jordan for an
inheritance, and to fulfil it, met with a ready response; to that these
tribes not only promised to obey his commandments in every respect, but
threatened every one with death who should refuse obedience. In
recalling this condition to the recollection of the tribes referred to,
Joshua follows the expressions in [Deu
3:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#018), where Moses himself
recapitulates his former command, rather than the original passage in
Num 32. The expression "this land" shows that the speaker was still on
the other side of the Jordan. חמשׁים, with the loins girded, i.e.,
prepared for war, synonymous with חלצים in [Deu
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#018) and [Num
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#032) (see at [Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018)). חיל כּל־גּבּורי, all the
mighty men of valour, i.e., the grave warriors (as in [Jos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#002); [Jos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003); [Jos
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#007), and very frequently in the later
books), is not common to this book and Deuteronomy, as Knobel maintains,
but is altogether strange to the Pentateuch. The word "all" (v. 14, like
[Num 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#021), [Num
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#027)) must not be pressed. According
to [Jos 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013), there were only about
40,000 men belonging to the two tribes and a half who crossed the Jordan
to take part in the war; whereas, according to [Num
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#007), [Num
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#018), [Num
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#034), there were 110,000 men in these
tribes who were capable of bearing arms, so that 70,000 must have
remained behind for the protection of the women and children and of the
flocks and herds, and to defend the land of which they had taken
possession. On [Jos 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#015) see [Deu
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#018); and on the more minute
definition of "on this side (lit. beyond) Jordan" by "toward the
sun-rising," compare the remarks on [Num
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#019). The answer of the two tribes
and a half, in which they not only most cheerfully promise their help in
the conquest of Canaan, but also express the wish that Joshua may have
the help of the Lord ([Jos 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#017)
compared with [Jos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004)), and after
threatening all who refuse obedience with death, close with the divine
admonition, "only be strong and of a good courage" ([Jos
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#018), cf. [Jos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#006)), furnishes a proof of the wish
that inspired them to help their brethren, that all the tribes might
speedily enter into the peaceable possession of the promised
inheritance. The expression "rebel against the commandment" is used in
[Deu 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#026), [Deu
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#043); [Deu
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#023); [Sa1
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#014), to denote resistance to the
commandments of the Lord; here it denotes opposition to His
representative, the commander chosen by the Lord, which was to be
punished with death, according to the law in [Deu
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012).
