3\. Israel's Apostasy and God's Fidelity - Hosea 12-14

For the purpose of proving that the predicted destruction of the kingdom
is just and inevitable, the prophet now shows, in this last division,
first that Israel has not kept the ways of its father Jacob, but has
fallen into the ungodly practice of Canaan ([Hos
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md); and secondly, that in spite
of all the manifestations of love, and all the chastisements received
from its God, it has continued its apostasy and idolatry, and therefore
perfectly deserves the threatened judgment. Nevertheless the compassion
of God will not permit it to be utterly destroyed, but will redeem it
even from death and hell (ch. 13-14:1). To this there is appended,
lastly, in [Hos 14:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md), a call to
conversion, and a promise from God of the forgiveness and abundant
blessing of those who turn to the Lord. With this the book closes ([Hos
14:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001) :10.md). Thus we find again, that
the contents of this last division fall very evidently into three parts
([Hos 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#013.md), [Hos
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#014.md), and [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002) -10.md), each of which is still
further divisible into two strophes.

Israel's Degeneracy into Canaanitish Ways - [Hos
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001) (Eng. V. 11:12-12:14.md).

The faithlessness of Israel and Judah's resistance to God bring
righteous punishment upon the entire posterity of Jacob (11:12-12:2);
whereas the example of their forefather ought to have led them to
faithful attachment to their God ([Hos
12:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003).md). But Israel has become Canaan,
and seeks its advantage in deception and injustice, without hearkening
to its God or to the voice of its prophets, and will be punished for its
idolatry ([Hos 12:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007).md). Whereas Jacob
was obliged to flee, and to serve for a wife in Aram, Jehovah led Israel
out of Egypt, and guarded it by prophets. Nevertheless this nation has
excited His wrath, and will have to bear its guilt (vv.12-14). The two
strophes of this chapter are 11:12-12:6 and 7-14.

[Hosea 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 12:1</span></span>

(Heb. Bib. Hosea 12:1). "Ephraim has surrounded me with lying, and the
house of Israel with deceit: and Judah is moreover unbridled against
God, and against the faithful Holy One. [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001) (Heb. Bib. 2.md). Ephraim grazeth
wind, and hunteth after the east: all the day it multiplies lying and
desolation, and they make a covenant with Asshur, and oil is carried to
Egypt. [Hos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md). And Jehovah has a
controversy with Judah, and to perform a visitation upon Jacob,
according to his ways: according to his works will He repay him." In the
name of Jehovah, the prophet raises a charge against Israel once more.
Lying and deceit are the terms which he applies, not so much to the
idolatry which they preferred to the worship of Jehovah (ψευδῆ καὶ
λατρείαν, Theod.), as to the hypocrisy with which Israel, in spite of
its idolatry, claimed to be still the people of Jehovah, pretended to
worship Jehovah under the image of a calf, and turned right into wrong.

(Note: Calvin explains סבבני correctly thus: "that He (i.e., God) had
experienced the manifold faithlessness of the Israelites in all kinds of
ways." He interprets the whole sentence as follows: "The Israelites had
acted unfaithfully towards God, and resorted to deceits, and that not in
one way only, or of only one kind; but just as a man might surround his
enemy with a great army, so had they gathered together innumerable
frauds, with which they attacked God on every side.")

Bēth Yisrâ'ēl (the house of Israel) is the nation of the ten tribes, and
is synonymous with Ephraim. The statement concerning Judah has been
interpreted in different ways, because the meaning of רד is open to
dispute. Luther's rendering, "but Judah still holds fast to its God," is
based upon the rabbinical interpretation of רוּד, in the sense of רדה,
to rule, which is decidedly false. According to the Arabic râd, the
meaning of rūd is to ramble about (used of cattle that have broken
loose, or have not yet been fastened up, as in [Jer
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031).md); hiphil, to cause to ramble
about ([Gen 27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040.md); [Psa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#003).md). Construed as it is here with
עם, it means to ramble about in relation to God, i.e., to be unbridled
or unruly towards God. עם, as in many other cases where reciprocal
actions are referred to, standing towards or with a person: see Ewald,
217, h. קדושׁים נאמן, the faithful, holy God. Qedōshı̄m is used of God,
as in [Pro 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md) (cf. [Jos
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#019).md), as an intensive pluralis
majestatis, construed with a singular adjective (cf. [Isa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md); [Kg2
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004).md). נאמן, firm, faithful,
trustworthy; the opposite of râd. Judah is unbridled towards the
powerful God ('El), towards the Holy One, who, as the Faithful One, also
proves Himself to be holy in relation to His people, both by the
sanctification of those who embrace His salvation, and also by the
judgment and destruction of those who obstinately resist the leadings of
His grace. In [Pro 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md) the lying and
deceit of Israel are more fully described. רעה רוּח is not to entertain
one's self on wind, i.e., to take delight in vain things; but רעה means
to eat or graze spiritually; and rūăch, the wind, is equivalent to
emptiness. The meaning therefore is, to strive eagerly after what is
empty or vain; synonymous with râdaph, to pursue. קדים, the east wind,
in Palestine a fierce tempestuous wind, which comes with burning heat
from the desert of Arabia, and is very destructive to seeds and plants
(compare [Job 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021.md), and Wetzstein's
Appendix to Delitzsch's Commentary on Job). It is used, therefore, as a
figurative representation, not of vain hopes and ideals, that cannot
possibly be reached, but of that destruction which Israel is bringing
upon itself. "All the day," i.e., continually, it multiplies lying and
violence, through the sins enumerated in [Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md), by which the kingdom is being
internally broken up. Added to this, there is the seeking for alliances
with the powers of the world, viz., Assyria and Egypt, by which it hopes
to secure their help ([Hos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013).md), but
only brings about its own destruction. Oil is taken to Egypt from the
land abounding in olives ([Deu 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008).md),
not as tribute, but as a present, for the purpose of securing an ally in
Egypt. This actually took place during the reign of Hoshea, who
endeavoured to liberate himself from the oppression of Assyria by means
of a treaty with Egypt ([Kg2 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004).md).

(Note: Manger has given the meaning correctly thus: "He is looking back
to the ambassadors sent by king Hoshea with splendid presents to the
king of Egypt, to bring him over to his side, and induce him to send him
assistance against the king of Assyria, although he had bound himself by
a sacred treaty to submit to the sovereignty of the latter." Compare
also Hengstenberg's Christology, vol. i. p. 164 transl., where he
refutes the current opinion, that the words refer to two different
parties in the nation, viz., an Assyrian and an Egyptian party, and
correctly describes the circumstances thus: "The people being severely
oppressed by Asshur, sometimes apply to Egypt for help against Asshur,
and at other times endeavour to awaken friendly feelings in the
latter.")

The Lord will repay both kingdoms for such conduct as this. But just as
the attitude of Judah towards God is described more mildly than the
guilt of Israel in [Hos 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012.md), so the
punishment of the two is differently described in [Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md). Jehovah has a trial with Judah,
i.e., He has to reprove and punish its sins and transgressions ([Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001).md). Upon Jacob, or Israel of the ten
tribes (as in [Hos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011).md), He has to
perform a visitation, i.e., to punish it according to its ways and its
deeds (cf. [Hos 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009).md). לפקד, it is to
be visited, i.e., He must visit.

[Hosea 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 12:3</span></span>

"He held his brother's heel in the womb, and in his man's strength he
fought with God. [Hos 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md). He fought
against the angel, and overcame; wept, and prayed to Him: at Bethel he
found Him, and there He talked with us. [Hos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005.md). And Jehovah, God of hosts,
Jehovah is His remembrance." The name Jacob, which refers to the
patriarch himself in [Hos 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md), forms
the link between [Hos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md) and [Hos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md). The Israelites, as descendants
of Jacob, were to strive to imitate the example of their forefather. His
striving hard for the birthright, and his wrestling with God, in which
he conquered by prayer and supplication, are types and pledges of
salvation to the tribes of Israel which bear his name.

(Note: "He shows what good Jacob received, and the son is named in the
father: he calls to remembrance the ancient history, that they may see
both the mercy of God towards Jacob, and his resolute firmness towards
the Lord." - Jerome.)

עקב, a denom. from עקב, "to hold the heel" = אחז בּעקב in [Gen
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026.md), which the prophet has in his
mind, not "to overreach," as in [Gen
27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036.md) and [Jer
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003.md). For the wrestling with God,
mentioned in the second clause of the verse, proves most indisputably
that Jacob's conduct is not held up before the people for a warning, as
marked by cunning or deceit, as Umbreit and Hitzig suppose, but is set
before them for their imitation, as an eager attempt to secure the
birthright and the blessing connected with it. This shows at the same
time, that the holding of the heel in the mother's womb is not quoted as
a proof of the divine election of grace, and, in fact, that there is no
reference at all to the circumstance, that "even when Jacob was still in
his mother's womb, he did this not by his own strength, but by the mercy
of God, who knows and loves those whom He has predestinated" (Jerome).
בּאונו, is his manly strength (cf. [Gen
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003).md) he wrestled with God ([Gen
32:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#025).md). This conflict (for the
significance of which in relation to Jacob's spiritual life, see the
discussion at Genesis l.c.) is more fully described in [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md), for the Israelites to imitate.
מלאך is the angel of Jehovah, the revealer of the invisible God (see the
Commentary on the Pentateuch, pp. 118ff. transl.). ויּכל is from [Gen
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#029.md). The explanatory clause, "he
wept, and made supplication to Him" (after [Gen
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#027).md), gives the nature of the
conflict. It was a contest with the weapons of prayer; and with these he
conquered. These weapons are also at the command of the Israelites, if
they will only use them. The fruit of the victory was, that he (Jacob)
found Him (God) at Bethel. This does not refer to the appearance of God
to Jacob on his flight to Mesopotamia ([Gen
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#011).md), but to that recorded in [Gen
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#009.md)., when God confirmed his name of
Israel, and renewed the promises of His blessing. And there, continues
the prophet, He (God) spake with us; i.e., not there He speaks with us
still, condemning by His prophets the idolatry at Bethel ([Amo
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004).md), as Kimchi supposes; but, as
the imperfect ידבּר corresponds to ימצאנּוּ, "there did He speak to us
through Jacob," i.e., what He there said to Jacob applies to us.

(Note: "Let it be carefully observed, that God is said to have talked at
Bethel not with Jacob only, but with all his posterity. That is to say,
the things which are here said to have been done by Jacob, and to have
happened to him, had not regard to himself only, but to all the race
that sprang from him, and were signs of the good fortune which they
either would, or certainly might enjoy" (Lackemacher in Rosenmller's
Scholia).)

The explanation of this is given in [Hos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005.md), where the name is recalled in
which God revealed Himself to Moses, when He first called him ([Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015).md), i.e., in which He made known to
him His true nature. Yehōvâh zikhrō is taken literally from זה זכרי לדר
דּר; but there the name Jehovah is still further defined by "the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," here by "the God of hosts." This difference
needs consideration. The Israelites in the time of Moses could only put
full confidence in the divine call of Moses to be their deliverer out of
the bondage of Egypt, on the ground that He who called him was the God
who had manifested Himself to the patriarchs as the God of salvation;
but for the Israelites of Hosea's time, the strength of their confidence
in Jehovah arose from the fact that Jehovah was the God of hosts, i.e.,
the God who, because He commands the forces of heaven, both visible and
invisible, rules with unrestricted omnipotence on earth as well as in
heaven (see at [Sa1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003).md).

[Hosea 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 12:6</span></span>

To this God Israel is now to return. [Hos
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006.md). "And thou, to thy God shalt thou
turn: keep love and right, and hope continually in thy God." שׁוּב with
ב is a pregnant expression, as in [Isa
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md) : "so to turn as to enter into
vital fellowship with God;" i.e., to be truly converted. The next two
clauses, as the omission of the copula before chesed and the change in
the tense clearly show, are to be taken as explanatory of תּשׁוּב. The
conversion is to show itself in the perception of love and right towards
their brethren, and in constant trust in God. But Israel is far removed
from this now. This thought leads the way to the next strophe ([Hos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008) -15.md), which commences afresh with
a disclosure of the apostasy of the people.

[Hosea 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 12:7</span></span>

"Canaan, in his hand is the scale of cheating: he loves to oppress. [Hos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md). And Ephraim says, Yet I have
become rich, have acquired property: all my exertions bring me no wrong,
which would be sin." Israel is not a Jacob who wrestles with God; but it
has become Canaan, seeking its advantage in deceit and wrong. Israel is
called Canaan here, not so much on account of its attachment to
Canaanitish idolatry (cf. [Eze 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003).md),
as according to the appellative meaning of the word Kena‛an, which is
borrowed from the commercial habits of the Canaanites (Phoenicians),
viz., merchant or trader ([Isa 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md);
Job 40:30), because, like a fraudulent merchant, it strove to become
great by oppression and cheating; not "because it acted towards God like
a fraudulent merchant, offering Him false show for true reverence," as
Schmieder supposes. For however thoroughly this may apply to the worship
of the Israelites, it is not to this that the prophet refers, but to
fraudulent weights, and the love of oppression or violence. And this
points not to their attitude towards God, but to their conduct towards
their fellow-men, which is the very opposite of what, according to the
previous verse, the Lord requires (chesed ūmishpât), and the very thing
which He has forbidden in the law, in [Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036.md); [Deu
24:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013.md), and also in the case of
‛âshaq, violence, in [Lev 6:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#002.md); [Deu
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014.md). Ephraim prides itself upon this
unrighteousness, in the idea that it has thereby acquired wealth and
riches, and with the still greater self-deception, that with all its
acquisition of property it has committed no wrong that was sin, i.e.,
that would be followed by punishment. און does not mean "might" here,
but wealth, opes, although as a matter of fact, since Ephraim says this
as a nation, the riches and power of the state are intended. כּל־יגיעי
is not written at the head absolutely, in the sense of "so far as what I
have acquired is concerned, men find no injustice in this;" for it that
were the case, בּי would stand for לי; but it is really the subject, and
יצמצאוּ is to be taken in the sense of acquiring = bringing in (cf. [Lev
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007.md); [Lev
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#008), etc..md).

[Hosea 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 12:9</span></span>

"Yet am I Jehovah thy God, from the land of Egypt hither: I will still
cause thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the feast. [Hos
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010.md). I have spoken to the prophets;
and I, I have multiplied visions, and spoken similitudes through the
prophets. [Hos 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011). If Gilead (is.md)
worthlessness, they have only come to nothing: in Gilgal they offered
bullocks: even their altars are like stone-heaps in the furrows of the
field." The Lord meets the delusion of the people, that they had become
great and powerful through their own exertion, by reminding them that He
(ואנכי is adversative, yet I) has been Israel's God from Egypt hither,
and that to Him they owe all prosperity and good in both past and
present (cf. [Hos 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004).md). Because they
do not recognise this, and because they put their trust in
unrighteousness rather than in Him, He will now cause them to dwell in
tents again, as in the days of the feast of Tabernacles, i.e., will
repeat the leading through the wilderness. It is evident from the
context that mō‛ēd (the feast) is here the feast of Tabernacles. מועד
(the days of the feast) are the seven days of this festival, during
which Israel was to dwell in booths, in remembrance of the fact that
when God led them out of Egypt He had caused them to dwell in booths
(tabernacles, [Lev 23:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042).md). אד
אושׁיבך stands in antithesis to הושׁבתּי ot si in [Lev
23:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#043.md). "The preterite is changed into
a future through the ingratitude of the nation" (Hengstenberg). The
simile, "as in the days of the feast," shows that the repetition of the
leading through the desert is not thought of here merely as a time of
punishment, such as the prolongation of the sojourn of the Israelites in
the wilderness for forty years really was ([Num
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033).md). For their dwelling in tents,
or rather in booths (sukkōth), on the feast of Tabernacles, was intended
not so much to remind the people of the privations of their unsettled
wandering life in the desert, as to call to their remembrance the
shielding and sheltering care and protection of God in their wandering
through the great and terrible wilderness (see at [Lev
23:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042).md). We must combine the two
allusions, therefore: so that whilst the people are threatened indeed
with being driven out of the good and glorious land, with its large and
beautiful cities and houses full of all that is good ([Deu
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#010)..md), into a dry and barren desert,
they have also set before them the repetition of the divine guidance
through the desert; so that they are not threatened with utter rejection
on the part of God, but only with temporary banishment into the desert.
In [Hos 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010.md) and [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md) the two thoughts of [Hos
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md) are still further expanded. In
[Hos 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010.md) they are reminded how the
Lord had proved Himself to be the God of Israel from Egypt onwards, by
sending prophets and multiplying prophecy, to make known His will and
gracious counsel to the people, and to promote their salvation. דּבּר
with על, to speak to, not because the word is something imposed upon a
person, but because the inspiration of God came down to the prophets
from above. אדמּה, not "I destroy," for it is only the kal that occurs
in this sense, and not the piel, but "to compare," i.e., speak in
similes; as, for example, in [Hos
1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md) and [Hos
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md), [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)., Ezekiel 16 etc.: "I have left no
means of admonishing them untried" (Rosenmller). Israel, however, has
not allowed itself to be admonished and warned, but has given itself up
to sin and idolatry, the punishment of which cannot be delayed. Gilead
and Gilgal represent the two halves of the kingdom of the ten tribes;
Gilead the land to the east of the Jordan, and Gilgal the territory to
the west. As Gilead is called "a city (i.e., a rendezvous) of
evil-doers" (פּעלי און) in [Hos 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md),
so is it here called distinctly און, worthlessness, wickedness; and
therefore it is to be utterly brought to nought. און and שׁוא are
synonymous, denoting moral and physical nonentity (compare [Job
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031).md). Here the two notions are so
distributed, that the former denotes the moral decay, the latter the
physical. Worthlessness brings nothingness after it as a punishment. אך,
only = nothing, but equivalent to utterly. The perfect היוּ is used for
the certain future. Gilgal, which is mentioned in [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md), as the seat of one form of
idolatrous worship, is spoken of here as a place of sacrifice, to
indicate with a play upon the name the turning of the altars into heaps
of stones (Gallim). The desolation or destruction of the altars involves
not only the cessation of the idolatrous worship, but the dissolution of
the kingdom and the banishment of the people out of the land. שׁורים,
which only occurs in the plural here, cannot of course be the dative (to
sacrifice to oxen), but only the accusative. The sacrifice of oxen was
reckoned as a sin on the part of the people, not on account of the
animals offers, but on account of the unlawful place of sacrifice. The
suffix to mizbechōthâm (their sacrifices) refers to Israel, the subject
implied in zibbēchū.

[Hosea 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 12:12</span></span>

This punishment Israel well deserved. [Hos
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md). "And Jacob fled to the fields
of Aram; and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife did he keep guard.
[Hos 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#013.md). And through a prophet
Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt, and through a prophet was he
guarded. [Hos 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#014.md). Ephraim has
stirred up bitter wrath; and his Lord will leave his blood upon him, and
turn back his shame upon him." In order to show the people still more
impressively what great things the Lord had done for them, the prophet
recals the flight of Jacob, the tribe-father, to Mesopotamia, and how he
was obliged to serve many years there for a wife, and to guard cattle;
whereas God had redeemed Israel out of the Egyptian bondage, and had
faithfully guarded it through a prophet. The flight of Jacob to Aramaea,
and his servitude there, are mentioned not "to give prominence to his
zeal for the blessing of the birthright, and his obedience to the
commandment of God and his parents" (Cyr., Theod., Th. v. Mops.); nor
"to bring out the double servitude of Israel - the first the one which
the people had to endure in their forefather, the second the one which
they had to endure themselves in Egypt" (Umbreit); nor "to lay stress
upon the manifestation of the divine care towards Jacob as well as
towards the people of Israel" (Ewald); for there is nothing at all about
this in [Hos 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md). The words point
simply to the distress and affliction which Jacob had to endure,
according to Genesis 29-31, as Calvin has correctly interpreted them.
"Their father Jacob," he says, "who was he? what was his condition?...
He was a fugitive from his country. Even if he had always lived at home,
his father was only a stranger in the land. But he was compelled to flee
into Syria. And how splendidly did he live there? He was with his uncle,
no doubt, but he was treated quite as meanly as any common slave: he
served for a wife. And how did he serve? He was the man who tended the
cattle." Shâmar, the tending of cattle, was one of the hardest and
lowest descriptions of servitude (cf. [Gen
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#031.md); [Gen
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#040.md); [Sa1
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020).md). Sedēh 'ărâm (the field of
Aram) is no doubt simply the Hebrew rendering of the Aramaean
Paddan-'ărâm ([Gen 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#002.md); [Gen
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#018.md) : see at [Gen
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020).md). Jacob's flight to Aramaea,
where he had to serve, is contrasted in sv. 10 with the leading of
Israel, the people sprung from Jacob, out of Egypt by a prophet, i.e.,
by Moses (cf. [Deu 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018).md); and the
guarding of cattle by Jacob is placed in contrast with the guarding of
Israel on the part of God through the prophet Moses, when he led them
through the wilderness to Canaan. The object of this is to call to the
nation's remembrance that elevation from the lowest condition, which
they were to acknowledge with humility every year, according to [Deu
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005.md)., when the first-fruits were
presented before the Lord. For Ephraim had quite forgotten this. Instead
of thanking the Lord for it by love and faithful devotedness to Him, it
had provoked Him in the bitterest manner by its sins (הכעיס, to excite
wrath, to provoke to anger: tamrūrı̄m, an adverbial accusative =
bitterly). For this should its blood-guiltiness remain upon it.
According to [Lev 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009.md)., dâmı̄m denotes
grave crimes that are punishable by death. Nâtash, to let a thing alone,
as in [Exo 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011.md); or to leave behind,
as in [Sa1 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020.md), [Sa1
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#028.md). Leaving blood-guiltiness upon a
person, is the opposite of taking away (נשׂא) or forgiving the sin, and
therefore inevitably brings the punishment after it. Cherpâthō (its
reproach or dishonour) is the dishonour which Ephraim had done to the
Lord by sin and idolatry (cf. [Isa
65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007).md). And this would be repaid to it
by its Lord, i.e., by Jehovah.
