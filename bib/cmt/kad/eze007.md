### [Ezekiel Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 7:0</span></span>

The Overthrow of Israel

The second "word of God," contained in this chapter, completes the
announcement of judgment upon Jerusalem and Judah, by expanding the
thought, that the end will come both quickly and inevitably upon the
land and people. This word is divided into two unequal sections, by the
repetition of the phrase, "Thus saith Adonai Jehovah" ([Eze
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002.md) and [Eze
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#005).md). In the first of these sections
the theme is given in short, expressive, and monotonous clauses; namely,
the end is drawing nigh, for God will judge Israel without mercy
according to its abominations. The second section (vv. 5-27) is arranged
in four strophes, and contains, in a form resembling the lamentation in
[Eze 19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md), a more minute
description of the end predicted.

[Ezekiel 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 7:1</span></span>

The End Cometh

[Eze 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001.md). And the word of Jehovah came
to me thus: [Eze 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002.md). And thou, son of
man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An end to the land of Israel! the end
cometh upon the four borders of the land. [Eze
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#003). Now (cometh.md) the end upon thee,
and I shall send my wrath upon thee, and judge thee according to thy
ways, and bring upon thee all thine abominations. [Eze
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#004.md). And my eye shall not look with
pity upon thee, and I shall not spare, but bring thy ways upon thee; and
thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee, that ye may know that I
am Jehovah. - ואתּה - .havoheJ ma I, with the copula, connects this word
of God with the preceding one, and shows it to be a continuation. It
commences with an emphatic utterance of the thought, that the end is
coming to the land of Israel, i.e., to the kingdom of Judah, with its
capital Jerusalem. Desecrated as it has been by the abominations of its
inhabitants, it will cease to be the land of God's people Israel. 'לאדמת
ישׂ (to the land of Israel) is not to be taken with כּה אמר (thus saith
the Lord) in opposition to the accents, but is connected with qeets קץ
(an end), as in the Targ. and Vulgate, and is placed first for the sake
of greater emphasis. In the construction, compare [Job
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014.md). ארבּעת כּנפות הארץ is limited by
the parallelism to the four extremities of the land of Israel. It is
used elsewhere for the whole earth ([Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012).md). The Chetib ארבּעת is placed,
in opposition to the ordinary rule, before a noun in the feminine
gender. The Keri gives the regular construction (vid., Ewald, 267c). In
[Eze 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#003.md) the end is explained to be a
wrathful judgment. "Give (נתן) thine abominations upon thee;" i.e., send
the consequences, inflict punishment for them. The same thought is
expressed in the phrase, "thine abominations shall be in the midst of
thee;" in other words, they would discern them in the punishments which
the abominations would bring in their train. For [Eze
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#004.md) compare [Eze
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011.md).

[Ezekiel 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 7:5</span></span>

The execution of the judgment announced in [Eze
7:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002.md), arranged in four strophes: [Eze
7:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#005.md), [Eze
7:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#010.md), [Eze
7:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#015.md), [Eze
7:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023.md). - The first strophe depicts
the end as a terrible calamity, and as near at hand. [Eze
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#003.md) and [Eze
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#004.md) are repeated as a refrain in [Eze
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#008.md) and [Eze
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#009.md), with slight modifications. [Eze
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#005.md). Thus saith the Lord Jehovah:
Misfortune, a singular misfortune, behold, it cometh. [Eze
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#006.md). End cometh: there cometh the end;
it waketh upon thee; behold, it cometh. [Eze
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#007.md). The fate cometh upon thee,
inhabitants of the land: the time cometh, the day is near; tumult and
not joy upon the mountains. [Eze 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#008.md).
Now speedily will I pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine
anger on thee; and judge thee according to thy ways, and bring upon thee
all thine abominations. [Eze 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#009.md). My
eye shall not look with pity upon thee, and I shall not spare; according
to thy ways will I bring it upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in
the midst of thee, that ye may know that I, Jehovah, am smiting. -
Misfortune of a singular kind shall come. רעה is made more emphatic by
אחת רעה, in which אחת is placed first for the sake of emphasis, in the
sense of unicus, singularis; a calamity singular (unique) of its kind,
such as never had occurred before (cf. [Eze
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#009).md). In [Eze
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#006) the poetical הקיץ, it (the end.md)
waketh upon thee, is suggested by the paronomasia with הקּץ. The force
of the words is weakened by supplying Jehovah as the subject to הקיץ, in
opposition to the context. And it will not do to supply רעה (evil) from
[Eze 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#005.md) as the subject to הנּה באה
(behold, it cometh). באה is construed impersonally: It cometh, namely,
every dreadful thing which the end brings with it. The meaning of
tzephirâh is doubtful. The only other passage in which it occurs is [Isa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005.md), where it is used in the sense of
diadem or crown, which is altogether unsuitable here. Raschi has
therefore had recourse to the Syriac and Chaldee צפרא, aurora, tempus
matutinum, and Hvernick has explained it accordingly, "the dawn of an
evil day." But the dawn is never used as a symbol or omen of misfortune,
not even in [Joe 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md), but solely as
the sign of the bursting forth of light or of salvation. Abarbanel was
on the right track when he started from the radical meaning of צפר, to
twist, and taking tzephirâh in the sense of orbis, ordo, or periodical
return, understood it as probably denoting rerum fatique vicissitudinem
in orbem redeuntem (Ges. Thes. p. 1188). But it has been justly
observed, that the rendering succession, or periodical return, can only
give a forced sense in [Eze 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#010.md).
Winer has given a better rendering, viz., fatum, malum fatale, fate or
destiny, for which he refers to the Arabic tsabramun, intortum, then
fatum haud mutandum inevitabile. Different explanations have also been
given of הד הרים. But the opinion that it is synonymous with הידד, the
joyous vintage cry ([Jer 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md); [Isa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010).md), is a more probable one than
that it is an unusual form of הוד, splendor, gloria. So much at any rate
is obvious from the context, that the hapax legomenon dh̀ is the
antithesis of מהוּמה, tumult, or the noise of war. The shouting of the
mountains, is shouting, a rejoicing upon the mountains. מקּרוב, from the
immediate vicinity, in a temporal not a local sense, as in [Deu
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017) (= immediately.md). For כּלּה , see
[Eze 6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md);12. The remainder of the
strophe ([Eze 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#008.md) and [Eze
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#009).md) is a repetition of [Eze
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#003.md) and [Eze
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#004.md); but מכּה is added in the last
clause. They shall learn that it is Jehovah who smites. This thought is
expanded in the following strophe.

[Ezekiel 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 7:10</span></span>

Second Strophe

[Eze 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#010.md). Behold the day, behold, it
cometh; the fate springeth up; the rod sprouteth; the pride blossometh.
[Eze 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#011.md). The violence riseth up as
the rod of evil: nothing of them, nothing of their multitude, nothing of
their crowd, and nothing glorious upon them. [Eze
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#012.md). The time cometh, the day
approacheth: let not the buyer rejoice, and let not the seller trouble
himself; for wrath cometh upon the whole multitude thereof. [Eze
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#013.md). For the seller will not return
to that which was sold, even though his life were still among the
living: for the prophecy against its whole multitude will not turn back;
and no one will strengthen himself as to his life through his iniquity.
[Eze 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#014.md). They blow the trumpet and
make everything ready; but no one goeth into the battle: for my wrath
cometh upon all their multitude. - The rod is already prepared; nothing
will be left of the ungodly. This is the leading thought of the strophe.
The three clauses of [Eze 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#010.md) are
synonymous; but there is a gradation in the thought. The approaching
fate springs up out of the earth (יצא, applied to the springing up of
plants, as in [Kg1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013.md); [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001), etc..md); it sprouts as a rod, and
flowers as pride. Matteh, the rod as an instrument of chastisement ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md). This rod is then called
za=dho4n, pride, inasmuch as God makes use of a proud and violent
people, namely the Chaldeans ([Hab
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006.md).; [Jer
50:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#031) seq..md), to inflict the
punishment. Sprouting and blossoming, which are generally used as
figurative representations of fresh and joyous prosperity, denote here
the vigorous growth of that power which is destined to inflict the
punishment. Both châmâs (violence) and zâdhōn (pride) refer to the enemy
who is to chastise Israel. The violence which he employs rises up into
the chastening rod of "evil," i.e., of ungodly Israel. In [Eze
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#011.md) the effect of the blow is
described in short, broken sentences. The emotion apparent in the
frequent repetition of לא is intensified by the omission of the verb,
which gives to the several clauses the character of exclamations. So far
as the meaning is concerned, we have to insert יהיה in thought, and to
take מן ekat o in a partitive sense: there will not be anything of them,
i.e., nothing will be left of them (the Israelites, or the inhabitants
of the land). מהם (of them) is explained by the nouns which follow. המון
and the ἁπ. λεγ. לחולםÅ¡, plural of הם or המה, both derivatives of המה,
are so combined that המון signifies the tumultuous multitude of people,
המה the multitude of possessions (like המון, [Isa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002.md); [Psa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016), etc..md). The meaning which
Hvernick assigns to hâmeh, viz., anxiety or trouble, is unsupported and
inappropriate. The ἁπ λεγ. נהּ is not to be derived from נהה, to lament,
as the Rabbins affirm; or interpreted, as Kimchi - who adopts this
derivation - maintains, on the ground of [Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004.md)., as signifying that, on account
of the multitude of the dying, there will be no more lamentation for the
dead. This leaves the Mappik in ה unexplained. נהּ is a derivative of a
root נוהּ; in Arabic, na=ha, elata fuit res, eminuit, magnificus fuit;
hence ,נהּres magnifica. When everything disappears in such a way as
this, the joy occasioned by the acquisition of property, and the sorrow
caused by its loss, will also pass away ([Eze
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#012).md). The buyer will not rejoice in
the property he has bought, for he will not be able to enjoy it; and the
seller will not mourn that he has been obliged to part with his
possession, for he would have lost it in any case.

(Note: "It is a natural thing to rejoice in the purchase of property,
and to mourn over its sale. But when slavery and captivity stare you in
the face, rejoicing and mourning are equally absurd." - Jerome.)

The wrath of God is kindled against their whole multitude; that is to
say, the judgment falls equally upon them all. The suffix in המונהּ
refers, as Jerome has correctly shown, to the "land of Israel" (admath,
Yisrâeel) in [Eze 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002.md), i.e., to the
inhabitants of the land. The words, "the seller will not return to what
he has sold," are to be explained from the legal regulations concerning
the year of Jubilee in Lev 25, according to which all landed property
that had been sold was to revert to its original owner (or his heir),
without compensation, in the year of jubilee; so that he would then
return to his mimkâr ([Lev 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#014.md), [Lev
25:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#027).md). Henceforth, however, this
will take place no more, even if היּתם, their (the sellers') life,
should be still alive (sc., at the time when the return to his property
would take place, according to the regulations of the year of jubilee),
because Israel will be banished from the land. The clause 'ועוד בּחיּים
ה is a conditional circumstantial clause. The seller will not return (לא
ישׁוּב) to his possession, because the prophecy concerning the whole
multitude of the people will not return (לא), i.e., will not turn back
(for this meaning of שׁוּב, compare [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md); [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011).md). As לא ישׁוּב corresponds to
the previous לא ישׁוּב, so does חזון את־כּל המונהּ to חרון אל־כּל־המונהּ
in [Eze 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#012.md). In the last clause of
[Eze 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#013.md), חיּתו is not to be taken
with בּעונו in the sense of "in the iniquity of his life," which makes
the suffix in בּעונו superfluous, but with יתחזּקוּ, the Hithpael being
construed with the accusative, "strengthen himself in his life." Whether
these words also refer to the year of jubilee, as Hvernick supposes,
inasmuch as the regulation that every one was to recover his property
was founded upon the idea of the restitution and re-creation of the
theocracy, we may leave undecided; since the thought is evidently simply
this: ungodly Israel shall be deprived of its possession, because the
wicked shall not obtain the strengthening of his life through his sin.
This thought leads on to [Eze 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#014.md), in
which we have a description of the utter inability to offer any
successful resistance to the enemy employed in executing the judgment.
There is some difficulty connected with the word בּתּקוע, since the
infin. absolute, which the form תּקוע seems to indicate, cannot be
construed with either a preposition or the article. Even if the
expression ּבתּקוע תּקעוּ in [Jer 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md)
was floating before the mind of Ezekiel, and led to his employing the
bold phrase ּבתּקוע, this would not justify the use of the infinitive
absolute with a preposition and the article. תּקוע must be a substantive
form, and denote not clangour, but the instrument used to sound an
alarm, viz., the shōphâr ([Eze 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#003).md).
הכין, an unusual form of the inf. abs. (see [Jos
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#007).md), used in the place of the finite
tense, and signifying to equip for war, as in [Nah
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#004.md). הכּל, everything requisite for
waging war. And no one goes into the battle, because the wrath of God
turns against them ([Lev 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#017).md), and
smites them with despair ([Deu 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030).md).

[Ezekiel 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 7:15</span></span>

Third strophe

Thus will they fall into irresistible destruction; even their silver and
gold they will not rescue, but will cast it away as useless, and leave
it for the enemy. - [Eze 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#015.md). The
sword without, and pestilence and famine within: he who is in the field
will die by the sword; and famine and pestilence will devour him that is
in the city. [Eze 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016.md). And if their
escaped ones escape, they will be upon the mountains like the doves of
the valleys, all moaning, every one for his iniquity. [Eze
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#017.md). All hands will become feeble,
and all knees flow with water. [Eze
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#018.md). They will gird themselves with
sackcloth, and terrors will cover them; on all faces there will be
shame, and baldness on all their heads. [Eze
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019.md). They will throw their silver
into the streets, and their gold will be as filth to them. Their silver
and their gold will not be able to rescue them in the day of Jehovah's
wrath; they will not satisfy their souls therewith, nor fill their
stomachs thereby, for it was to them a stumbling-block to guilt. [Eze
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#020.md). And His beautiful ornament, they
used it for pride; and their abominable images, their abominations they
made thereof: therefore I make it filth to them. [Eze
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#021.md). And I shall give it into the
hand of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil,
that they may defile it. [Eze 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#022.md). I
shall turn my face from them, that they defile my treasure; and
oppressors shall come upon it and defile it. - The chastisement of God
penetrates everywhere ([Eze 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#015.md)
compare with [Eze 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012).md); even flight
to the mountains, that are inaccessible to the foe (compare 1 Macc.
2:28; [Mat 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016).md), will only bring
misery. Those who have fled to the mountains will coo - i.e., mourn,
moan - like the doves of the valleys, which (as Bochart has correctly
interpreted the simile in his Hieroz. II. p. 546, ed. Ros.), "when
alarmed by the bird-catcher or the hawk, are obliged to forsake their
natural abode, and fly elsewhere to save their lives. The mountain doves
are contrasted with those of the valleys, as wild with tame." In כּלּם
המות the figure and the fact are fused together. The words actually
relate to the men who have fled; whereas the gender of המות is made to
agree with that of כּיוני. The cooing of doves was regarded by the
ancients as a moan (hâgâh), a mournful note (for proofs, see Gesen. on
[Isa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014).md); for which Ezekiel uses
the still stronger expression hâmâh fremere, to howl or growl (cf. [Isa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011).md). The low moaning has reference
to their iniquity, the punishment of which they are enduring. When the
judgment bursts upon them, they will all (not merely those who have
escaped, but the whole nation) be overwhelmed with terror, shame, and
suffering. The words, "all knees flow with water" (for hâlak in this
sense, compare Joel 4:18), are a hyperbolical expression used to denote
the entire loss of the strength of the knees (here, [Eze
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#017.md) and [Eze
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012).md), like the heart melting and
turning to water in [Jos 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#005.md). With
this utter despair there are associated grief and horror at the calamity
that has fallen upon them, and shame and pain at the thought of the sins
that have plunged them into such distress. For כּסּתה פלּצוּת, compare
[Psa 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006.md); for אל־כּל־פנים בּוּשׁה,
[Mic 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md); [Jer
51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051.md); and for קרחה 'בּכל־ראשׁ, [Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002.md); [Amo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010.md). On the custom of shaving the
head bald on account of great suffering or deep sorrow, see the comm. on
[Mic 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016.md).

In this state of anguish they will throw all their treasures away as
sinful trash ([Eze 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019)..md). By the
silver and gold which they will throw away ([Eze
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019).md), we are not to understand
idolatrous images particularly - these are first spoken of in [Eze
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#020.md) - but the treasures of precious
metals on which they had hitherto set their hearts. They will not merely
throw these away as worthless, but look upon them as niddâh, filth, an
object of disgust, inasmuch as they have been the servants of their evil
lust. The next clause, "silver and gold cannot rescue them," are a
reminiscence from [Zep 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#018.md). But
Ezekiel gives greater force to the thought by adding, "they will not
appease their hunger therewith," - that is to say, they will not be able
to protect their lives thereby, either from the sword of the enemy (see
the comm. on [Zep 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#018).md) or from death
by starvation, because there will be no more food to purchase within the
besieged city. The clause 'כּי assigns the reason for that which forms
the leading thought of the verse, namely, the throwing away of the
silver and gold as filth; מכשׁול עונם, a stumbling-block through which
one falls into guilt and punishment; צבי עדיו, the beauty of his
ornament, i.e., his beautiful ornament. The allusion is to the silver
and gold; and the singular suffix is to be explained from the fact that
the prophet fixed his mind upon the people as a whole, and used the
singular in a general and indefinite sense. The words are written
absolutely at the commencement of the sentence; hence the suffix
attached to שׂמהוּ, Jerome has given the true meaning of the words:
"what I (God) gave for an ornament of the possessors and for their
wealth, they turned into pride." And not merely to ostentatious show (in
the manner depicted in [Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016)..md),
but to abominable images, i.e., idols, did they apply the costly gifts
of God (cf. [Hos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md); [Hos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002).md). עשׂה, to make of (gold and
silver); ב denoting the material with which one works and of which
anything is made (as in [Exo 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#004.md);
[Exo 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008).md). God punishes this abuse by
making it (gold and silver) into niddâh to them, i.e., according to v.
19, by placing them in such circumstances that they cast it away as
filth, and (v. 21) by giving it as booty to the foe. The enemy is
described as "the wicked of the earth" (cf. [Psa
75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009).md), i.e., godless men, who not only
seize upon the possession of Israel, but in the most wicked manner lay
hands upon all that is holy, and defile it. The Chetib חלּלוּה is to be
retained, notwithstanding the fact that it was preceded by a masculine
suffix. What is threatened will take place, because the Lord will turn
away His face from His people (מהם, from the Israelites), i.e., will
withdraw His gracious protection from them, so that the enemy will be
able to defile His treasure. Tsâphuun, that which is hidden, the
treasure ([Job 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026.md); [Oba
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#006).md). Tsephuunii is generally supposed
to refer to the temple, or the Most Holy Place in the temple. Jerome
renders it arcanum meum, and gives this explanation: "signifying the
Holy of Holies, which no one except the priests and the high priest
dared to enter." This interpretation was so commonly adopted by the
Fathers, that even Theodoret explains the rendering given in the
Septuagint, τὴν ἐπισκοπήν μου, as signifying the Most Holy Place in the
temple. On the other hand, the Chaldee has ארעא בּית שׁכינתי, "the land
of the house of my majesty;" and Calvin understands it as signifying
"the land which was safe under His (i.e., God's) protection." But it is
difficult to reconcile either explanation with the use of the word
tsâphuun. The verb tsâphan signifies to hide, shelter, lay up in safety.
These meanings do not befit either the Holy of Holies in the temple or
the land of Israel. It is true that the Holy of Holies was
unapproachable by the laity, and even by the ordinary priests, but it
was not a secret, a hidden place; and still less was this the case with
the land of Canaan.We therefore adhere to the meaning, which is so
thoroughly sustained by [Job 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026.md) and
[Oba 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#006.md) - namely, "treasure," by
which, no doubt, the temple-treasure is primarily intended. This
rendering suits the context, as only treasures have been referred to
before; and it may be made to harmonize with בּאוּ בהּ which follows.
בּוא ב signifies not merely intrare in locum, but also venire in (e.g.,
[Kg2 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#023.md); possibly [Eze
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004).md), and may therefore be very
properly rendered, "to get possession of," since it is only possible to
obtain possession of a treasure by penetrating into the place where it
is laid up or concealed. There is nothing at variance with this in the
word חלּל, profanare, since it has already occurred in [Eze
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#021.md) in connection with the defiling
of treasures and jewels. Moreover, as Calvin has correctly observed, the
word is employed here to denote "an indiscriminate abuse, when, instead
of considering to what purpose things have been entrusted to us, we
squander them rashly and without selection, in contempt and even in
scorn."

[Ezekiel 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023.md)

Fourth Strophe

Still worse is coming, namely, the captivity of the people, and
overthrow of the kingdom. - [Eze 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023.md).
Make the chain, for the land is full of capital crime, and the city full
of outrage. [Eze 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#024.md). I shall bring
evil ones of the nations, that they may take possession of their houses;
and I shall put an end to the pride of the strong, that their
sanctuaries may be defiled. [Eze 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#025.md).
Ruin has come; they seek salvation, but there is none. [Eze
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026.md). Destruction upon destruction
cometh, and report upon report ariseth; they seek visions from prophets,
but the law will vanish away from the priest, and counsel from the
elders. [Eze 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027.md). The king will
mourn, and the prince will clothe himself in horror, and the hands of
the common people will tremble. I will deal with them according to their
way, and according to their judgments will I judge them, that they may
learn that I am Jehovah. - Those who have escaped death by sword or
famine at the conquest of Jerusalem have captivity and exile awaiting
them. This is the meaning of the command to make the chain, i.e., the
fetters needed to lead the people into exile. This punishment is
necessary, because the land is full of mishpat dâmim, judgment of blood.
This cannot mean, there is a judgment upon the shedding of blood, i.e.,
upon murder, which is conducted by Jehovah, as Hvernick supposes. Such a
thought is irreconcilable with מלאה, and with the parallel מלאה חמס.
משׁפּט דּמים is to be explained after the same manner as משׁפּט מות (a
matter for sentence of death, a capital crime) in [Deu
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#006.md), [Deu
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#021.md) -22, as signifying a matter for
sentence of bloodshed, i.e., a crime of blood, or capital crime, as the
Chaldee has already rendered it. Because the land is filled with capital
crime, the city (Jerusalem) with violence, the Lord will bring רעי, evil
ones of the heathen, i.e., the worst of the heathen, to put an end to
the pride of the Israelites. גּאון עזּים is not "pride of the
insolents;" for עזּים does not stand for עזּי פנים ([Deu
28:50](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#050), etc..md). The expression is rather
to be explained from גּאון עז, pride of strength, in [Eze
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021.md); [Eze
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006.md), [Eze
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018.md) (cf. [Lev
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019).md), and embraces everything on
which a man (or a nation) bases his power and rests his confidence. The
Israelites are called עזּים, because they thought themselves strong, or,
according to [Eze 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021.md), based their
strength upon the possession of the temple and the holy land. This is
indicated by ונחלוּ which follows. נחל, Niphal of חלל and מקדשׁיהם, not
a participle Piel, from מקדּשׁ, with the Dagesh dropped, but an unusual
form, from מקדּשׁ for מקדּשׁיהם (vid., Ew. 215a). - The ἁπ λεγ. חהצנצט;,
with the tone drawn back on account of the tone-syllable which follows
(cf. Ges. 29, 3. 6), signifies excidium, destruction (according to the
Rabbins), from קפד, to shrink or roll up ([Isa
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012).md). בּא is a prophetic perfect. In
[Eze 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#025.md) the ruin of the kingdom is
declared to be certain, and in [Eze
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026.md) and [Eze
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027.md) the occurrence of it is more
minutely depicted. Stroke upon stroke does the ruin come; and it is
intensified by reports, alarming accounts, which crowd together and
increase the terror, and also by the desperation of the spiritual and
temporal leaders of the nation - the prophets, priests, and elders -
whom God deprives of revelation, knowledge, and counsel; so that all
ranks (king and princes and the common people) sink into mourning,
alarm, and horror. That it is to no purpose that visions or prophecies
are sought from the prophets ([Eze
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026).md), is evident from the
antithetical statement concerning the priests and elders which
immediately follows. The three statements serve as complements of one
another. They seek for predictions from prophets, but the prophets
receive no vision, no revelation. They seek instruction from priests,
but instruction is withdrawn from the priests; and so forth. T̄ōrâh
signifies instruction out of the law, which the priests were to give to
the people ([Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md). In [Eze
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027.md), the three classes into which the
people were divided are mentioned - viz. king, prince (i.e.,
tribe-princes and heads of families), and, in contradistinction to both,
עם הארץ, the common people, the people of the land, in distinction from
the civil rulers, as in [Kg2 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#024.md);
[Kg2 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md). מדּרכּם, literally from
their way, their mode of action, will I do to them: i.e., my action will
be derived from theirs, and regulated accordingly. אותם for אתּם, as in
[Eze 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md), etc. (See the comm. on [Eze
16:59](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#059)..md)
