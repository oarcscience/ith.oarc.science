### [Ezekiel Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

Resurrection of Israel and Reunion as One Nation

This chapter contains two revelations from God ([Eze
37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md) and [Eze
37:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015).md). In the first, the prophet
is shown in a vision the resurrection of Israel to a new life. In the
second, he is commanded to exhibit, by means of a symbolical act, the
reunion of the divided kingdoms into a single nation under one king.
Both of these he is to announce to the children of Israel. The
substantial connection between these two prophecies will be seen from
the exposition. [Eze 37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md).
Resurrection of Israel to New Life

[Ezekiel 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 37:1</span></span>

[Eze 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md). There came upon me the hand
of Jehovah, and Jehovah led me out in the spirit, and set me down in the
midst of the valley; this was full of bones. [Eze
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#002.md). And He led me past them round
about; and, behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley,
and, behold, they were very dry. [Eze
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#003.md). And He said to me, Son of man,
will these bones come to life? and I said, Lord, Jehovah, thou knowest.
[Eze 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#004.md). Then He said to me,
Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, Ye dry bones, hear ye the
word of Jehovah. [Eze 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#005.md). Thus saith
the Lord Jehovah to these bones, Behold, I bring breath into you, that
ye may come to life. [Eze 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#006.md). I will
create sinews upon you, and cause flesh to grow upon you, and cover you
with skin, and bring breath into you, so that ye shall live and know
that I am Jehovah. [Eze 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#007.md). And I
prophesied as I was commanded; and there was a noise as I prophesied,
and behold a rumbling, and the bones came together, bone to bone. [Eze
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#008.md). And I saw, and behold sinews
came over them, and flesh grew, and skin drew over it above; but there
was no breath in them. [Eze 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009.md). Then
He said to me, Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to
the breath, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Come from the four winds, thou
breath, and blow upon these slain, that they may come to life. [Eze
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#010.md). And I prophesied as I was
commanded; then the breath came into them, and they came to life, and
stood upon their feet, a very, very great army. [Eze
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md). And He said to me, Son of man,
these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say, our bones
are dried, and our hope has perished; we are destroyed! [Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md). Therefore prophesy, and say to
them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will open you graves, and
cause you to come out of your graves, my people, and bring you into the
land of Israel. [Eze 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#013.md). And ye
shall know that I am Jehovah, when I open your graves, and cause you to
come out of your graves, my people. [Eze
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#014.md). And I will put my Spirit into
you, and will place you in your land, and ye shall know that I, Jehovah,
have spoken and do it, is the saying of Jehovah. - This revelation
divides itself into two sections. [Eze
37:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md) contain the vision, and [Eze
37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md) give the interpretation.
There are no particular difficulties in the description of the vision,
so far as the meaning of the words is concerned. By a supernatural
intervention on the part of God, Ezekiel is taken from his own home in a
state of spiritual ecstasy into a valley which was full of dead men's
bones. For the expression 'היתה עלי יד יי, see the comm. on [Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003.md). In the second clause of [Eze
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md) יהוה is the subject, and is not
to be taken as a genitive in connection with בּרוּח, as it has been by
the Vulgate and Hitzig in opposition to the accents. בּרוּח stands for
בּרוּח אלהים ([Eze 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#024).md), and אלהים
is omitted simply because יהוה follows immediately afterwards. הניח, to
set down, here and [Eze 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002.md); whereas
in other cases the form הנּיח is usually employed in this sense. The
article prefixed to הבּקעה appears to point back to [Eze
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md), to the valley where Ezekiel
received the first revelation concerning the fate of Jerusalem and its
inhabitants. That עצמים are dead men's bones is evident from what
follows. העבירני עליהם, not "He led me over them round about," but past
them, in order that Ezekiel might have a clear view of them, and see
whether it were possible for them to come to life again. They were lying
upon the surface of the valley, i.e., not under, but upon the ground,
and not piled up in a heap, but scattered over the valley, and they were
very dry. The question asked by God, whether these bones could live, or
come to life again, prepares the way for the miracle; and Ezekiel's
answer, "Lord, Thou knowest" (cf. [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014).md), implies that, according to
human judgment, it was inconceivable that they could come to life any
more, and nothing but the omnipotence of God could effect this.

After this introduction there follows in [Eze
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#004.md). the miracle of the raising to
life of these very dry bones, accomplished through the medium of the
word of God, which the prophet addresses to them, to show to the people
that the power to realize itself is inherent in the word of Jehovah
proclaimed by Ezekiel; in other words, that Jehovah possesses the power
to accomplish whatever He promises to His people. The word in [Eze
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#005.md), "Behold, I bring breath into
you, that ye may come to life," announces in general terms the raising
of them to life, whilst the process itself is more minutely described in
[Eze 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#006.md). God will put on them
(clothe them with) sinews, flesh, and skin, and then put רוּח in them.
רוּח is the animating spirit or breath = רוּח היּים ([Gen
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#017.md); [Gen
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#017).md). ,קרםἁπ. λεγ. in Syriac
incrustare, obducere. When Ezekiel prophesied there arose or followed a
sound (קול), and then a shaking (רעשׁ), and the bones approached one
another, every bone to its own bone. Different explanations have been
given of the words קול and רעשׁ. קול signifies a sound or voice, and
רעשׁ a trembling, and earthquake, and also a rumbling or a loud noise
(compare [Eze 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012.md) and [Isa
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004).md). The relation between the two
words as they stand here is certainly not that the sound (קול) passes at
once into a loud noise, or is continued in that form; whilst רעשׁ
denotes the rattling or rustling of bones in motion. The fact that the
moving of the bones toward one another is represented by ותּקרבוּ (with
Vav consec.), as the sequel to רעשׁ, is decisive against this. Yet we
cannot agree with Kliefoth, that by קול we are to understand the
trumpet-blast, or voice of God, that wakes the dead from their graves,
according to those passages of the New Testament which treat of the
resurrection, and by רעשׁ the earthquake which opens the graves. This
explanation is precluded, not only by the philological difficulty that
קול without any further definition does not signify either the blast of
a trumpet or the voice of God, but also by the circumstance that the קול
is the result of the prophesying of Ezekiel; and we cannot suppose that
God would make His almighty call dependent upon a prophet's prophesying.
And even in the case of רעשׁ, the reference to [Eze
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#019.md) does not prove that the word
must mean earthquake in this passage also, since Ezekiel uses the word
in a different sense in [Eze 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#018.md) and
[Eze 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012.md). We therefore take קול in
the general sense of a loud noise, and רעשׁ in the sense of shaking
(sc., of the bones), which was occasioned by the loud noise, and
produced, or was followed by, the movement of the bones to approach one
another.

The coming together of the bones was followed by their being clothed
with sinews, flesh, and skin; but there was not yet any breath in them
([Eze 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#008).md). To give them this the
prophet is to prophesy again, and that to the breath, that it come from
the four winds or quarters of the world and breathe into these slain
([Eze 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009).md). Then, when he prophesied,
the breath came into them, so that they received life, and stood upright
upon their feet. In [Eze 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009.md) and [Eze
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#010.md) רוּח is rendered by some "wind,"
by others "spirit;" but neither of these is in conformity with what
precedes it. רוּח does not mean anything else than the breath of life,
which has indeed a substratum in the wind, perceptible to the senses,
but it not identical with it. The wind itself brings no life into dead
bodies. If, therefore, the dead bodies become living, receive life
through the blowing of the רוּח into them, what enters into them by the
blowing cannot be a symbol of the breath of life, but must be the breath
of life itself - namely, that divine breath of life which pervades all
nature, giving and sustaining the life of all creatures (cf. [Psa
104:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029).md). The expression פּחי
בּהרוּגים points back to [Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md). The
representation of the bringing of the dead bones to life in two acts may
also be explained from the fact that it is based upon the history of the
creation of man in Gen 2, as Theodoret

(Note: "For as the body of our forefather Adam was first moulded, and
then the soul was thus breathed into it; so here also both combined in
fitting harmony." - Theodoret.)

has observed, and serves plainly to depict the creative revivification
here, like the first creation there, as a work of the almighty God. For
a correct understanding of the vision, it is also necessary to observe
that in [Eze 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009.md) the dead bones,
clothed with sinews, flesh, and skin, are called הרוּגים, slain, killed,
and not merely dead. It is apparent at once from this that our vision is
not intended to symbolize the resurrection of all the dead, but simply
the raising up of the nation of Israel, which has been slain. This is
borne out by the explanation of the vision which God gives to the
prophet in [Eze 37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md), and directs
him to repeat to the people. The dead bones are the "whole house of
Israel" that has been given up to death; in other words, Judah and
Ephraim. "These bones" in [Eze 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md)
are the same as in [Eze 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#003.md) and [Eze
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#005.md), and not the bodies brought to
life in [Eze 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#010.md); though Hitzig
maintains that they are the latter, and then draws the erroneous
conclusion that [Eze 37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md) do not
interpret the vision of the first ten verses, but that the bones in the
valley are simply explained in these verses as signifying the dead of
Israel. It is true that the further explanation in [Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md). of what is described in [Eze
37:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#005.md) as happening to the dead bones
is not given in the form of an exposition of the separate details of
that occurrence, but is summed up in the announcement that God will open
their graves, bring them out of their graves, and transport them to
their own land. But it does not follow from this that the announcement
is merely an application of the vision to the restoration of Israel to
new life, and therefore that something different is represented from
what is announced in [Eze 37:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md).
Such a view is at variance with the words, "these bones are the whole
house of Israel." Even if these words are not to be taken so literally
as that we are to understand that the prophet was shown in the vision of
the bones of the slain and deceased Israelites, but simply mean: these
dead bones represent the house of Israel, depict the nation of Israel in
its state of death, - they express so much in the clearest terms
concerning the relation in which the explanation in [Eze
37:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md) stands to the visionary
occurrence in [Eze 37:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#004.md), namely,
that God has shown to Ezekiel in the vision what He commands him to
announce concerning Israel in [Eze
37:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md); in other words, that the
bringing of the dead bones to life shown to him in the vision was
intended to place visibly before him the raising of the whole nation of
Israel to new life out of the death into which it had fallen. This is
obvious enough from the words: these bones are the whole house of
Israel. כּל־בּית ישׂראל points forward to the reunion of the tribes of
Israel that are severed into two nations, as foretold in [Eze
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015.md). It is they who speak in [Eze
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md). The subject to אמרים is neither
the bones nor the dead of Israel (Hitzig), but the כּל־בּית ישׂראל
already named, which is also addressed in [Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md). All Israel says: our bones are
dried, i.e., our vital force is gone. The bones are the seat of the
vital force, as in [Psa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md); and
יבשׁ, to dry up, applied to the marrow, or vital sap of the bones, is
substantially the same as בּלה in the psalm (l.c.). Our hope has
perished (cf. [Eze 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005).md). תּקוה is
here the hope of rising into a nation once more. נגזרנוּ לנוּ .:
literally, we are cut off for ourselves, sc. from the sphere of the
living (cf. [Lam 3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054.md); [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008).md), equivalent to "it is all over
with us."

To the people speaking thus, Ezekiel is to announce that the Lord will
open their graves, bring them out of them, put His breath of life into
them, and lead them into their own land. If we observe the relation in
which [Eze 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md) and [Eze
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#013.md) stand to [Eze
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#014.md), namely, that the two halves of
the 14th verse are parallel to the two [Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md) and [Eze
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#013.md), the clause 'וידאתּם כּי אני in
[Eze 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#014.md) to the similar clause in
[Eze 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#013.md), there can be no doubt that
the contents of [Eze 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#014.md) also
correspond to those of [Eze 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md) -
that is to say, that the words, "I put my breath (Spirit) into you, that
ye may live, and place you in your own land" (bring you to rest
therein), affirm essentially the same as the words, "I bring you out of
your graves, and lead you into the land of Israel;" with this simple
difference, that the bringing out of the graves is explained and
rendered more emphatic by the more definite idea of causing them to live
through the breath or Spirit of God put into them, and the הביא by
הנּיח, the leading into the land by the transporting and bringing them
to rest therein. Consequently we are not to understand by נתתּי רוּחי
בכם either a divine act differing from the raising of the dead to life,
or the communication of the Holy Spirit as distinguished from the
imparting of the breath of life. רוּחי, the Spirit of Jehovah, is
identical with the רוּח, which comes, according to [Eze
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009.md) and [Eze
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#010.md), into the bones of the dead when
clothed with sinews, flesh, and skin, i.e., is breathed into them. This
spirit or breath of life is the creative principle both of the physical
and of the ethical or spiritual life. Consequently there are not three
things announced in these verses, but only two: (1) The raising to life
from a state of death, by bringing out of the graves, and communicating
the divine Spirit of life; (2) the leading back to their own land to
rest quietly therein. When, therefore, Kliefoth explains these verses as
signifying that for the consolation of Israel, which is mourning
hopelessly in its existing state of death, "God directs the prophet to
say - (1) That at some future time it will experience a resurrection in
the literal sense, that its graves will be opened, and that all its
dead, those deceased with those still alive, will be raised up out of
their graves; (2) that God will place them in their own land; and (3)
that when He has so placed them in their land, He will put His Spirit
within them that they may live: in the first point the idea of the
future resurrection, both of those deceased and of those still living,
is interpolated into the text; and in the third point, placing them in
their land before they are brought to life by the Spirit of God, would
be at variance with the text, according to which the giving of the
Spirit precedes the removal to their own land. The repetition of עמּי in
[Eze 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md) and [Eze
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#013.md) is also worthy of notice: you
who are my people, which bases the comforting promise upon the fact that
Israel is the people of Jehovah.

If, therefore, our vision does not set forth the resurrection of the
dead in general, but simply the raising to life of the nation of Israel
which is given up to death, it is only right that, in order still
further to establish this view, we should briefly examine the other
explanations that have been given. - The Fathers and most of the
orthodox commentators, both of ancient and modern times, have found in
[Eze 37:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md) a locus classicus for the
doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, and that quite correctly. But
their views differ widely as to the strict meaning and design of the
vision itself; inasmuch as some regard the vision as a direct and
immediate prophecy of the general resurrection of the dead at the last
day, whilst others take the raising of the dead to life shown to the
prophet in the vision to be merely a figure or type of the waking up to
new life of the Israel which is now dead in its captivity. The first
view is mentioned by Jerome; but in later times it has been more
especially defended by Calov, and last of all most decidedly by
Kliefoth. Yet the supporters of this view acknowledge that [Eze
37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md) predict the raising to life
of the nation of Israel. The question arises, therefore, how this
prediction is to be brought into harmony with such an explanation of the
vision. The persons noticed by Jerome, who supported the view that in
[Eze 37:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#004.md) it is the general
resurrection that is spoken of, sought to remove the difficulties to
which this explanation is exposed, by taking the words, "these bones are
the whole house of Israel," as referring to the resurrection of the
saints, and connecting them with the first resurrection in [Rev
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005.md), and by interpreting the leading
of Israel back to their own land as equivalent to the inheriting of the
earth mentioned in [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md). Calov, on
the other hand, gives the following explanation of the relation in which
[Eze 37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md) stand to [Eze
37:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md) : "in this striking vision
there was shown by the Lord to the prophet the resurrection of the dead;
but the occasion, the cause, and the scope of this vision were the
resurrection of the Israelitish people, not so much into its earlier
political form, as for the restoration of the ecclesiastical hierarchy
and the establishment of the worship of God, both of which were indeed
restored in the time of Zerubbabel, but were first brought to perfection
at the coming of Jesus Christ." He also assumes that the raising of the
dead is represented in the vision, "because God would have this
representation exhibited for a figure and confirmation of the
restitution of the people." And lastly, according to Kliefoth, [Eze
37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md) do not furnish a literal
exposition of the vision, but simply make an application of it to the
bringing of Israel to life. - We cannot regard either of these views as
correct, because neither of them does justice to the words of the text.
The idea of the Fathers, that [Eze
37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md) treat of the resurrection of
the saints (believers), cannot be reconciled either with the words or
with the context of our prophecy, and has evidently originated in
perplexity. And the assumption of Calov and Kliefoth, that [Eze
37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md) contain simply an application
of the general resurrection of the dead exhibited in [Eze
37:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md) to the resurrection of Israel,
by no means exhausts the meaning of the words, "these bones are the
whole house of Israel," as we have already observed in our remarks on
[Eze 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md). Moreover, in the vision
itself there are certain features to be found which do not apply to the
general resurrection of the dead. In proof of this, we will not lay any
stress upon the circumstance that Ezekiel sees the resurrection of the
dead within certain limits; that it is only the dead men's bones lying
about in one particular valley, and not the dead of the whole earth,
though a very great army, that he sees come to life again; but, on the
other hand, we must press the fact that in [Eze
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009.md) those who are to be raised to
life are called הרוּגים, a word which does not signify the dead of all
kinds, but simply those who have been slain, or have perished by the
sword, by famine, or by other violent deaths, and which indisputably
proves that Ezekiel was not shown the resurrection of all the dead, but
simply the raising to life of Israel, which had been swept away by a
violent death. Kliefoth would account for this restriction from the
purpose for which the vision was shown to the prophet. Because the
design of the vision was to comfort Israel concerning the wretchedness
of its existing condition, and that wretchedness consisted for the most
part in the fact that the greater portion of Israel had perished by
sword, famine, and pestilence, he was shown the resurrection of the dead
generally and universally, as it would take place not in the case of the
Israelites alone, but in that of all the dead, though here confined
within the limits of one particular field of dead; and stress is laid
upon the circumstance that the dead which Ezekiel saw raised to life
instar omnium, were such as had met with a violent death. This
explanation would be admissible, if only it had been indicated or
expressed in any way whatever, that the bones of the dead which Ezekiel
saw lying about in the בּקעה represented all the dead of the whole
earth. But we find no such indication; and because in the whole vision
there is not a single feature contained which would warrant any such
generalization of the field of the dead which Ezekiel saw, we are
constrained to affirm that the dead men's bones seen by Ezekiel in the
valley represent the whole house of Israel alone, and not the deceased
and slain of all mankind; and that the vision does not set forth the
resurrection of all the dead, but only the raising to life of the nation
of Israel which had been given up to death.

Consequently we can only regard the figurative view of the vision as the
correct one, though this also has been adopted in very different ways.
When Jerome says that Ezekiel "is prophesying of the restoration of
Israel through the parable of the resurrection," and in order to defend
himself from the charge of denying the dogma of the resurrection of the
dead, adds that "the similitude of a resurrection would never have been
employed to exhibit the restoration of the Israelitish people, if that
resurrection had been a delusion, and it had not been believed that it
would really take place; because no one confirms uncertain things by
means of things which have no existence;" - Hvernick very justly
replies, that the resurrection of the dead is not to be so absolutely
regarded as a dogma already completed and defined, or as one universally
known and having its roots in the national belief; though Hvernick is
wrong in affirming in support of this that the despair of the people
described in [Eze 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md) plainly shows
that so general a belief cannot possibly be presupposed. For we find
just the same despair at times when faith in the resurrection of the
dead was a universally accepted dogma. The principal error connected
with this view is the assumption that the vision was merely a parable
formed by Ezekiel in accordance with the dogma of the resurrection of
the dead. If, on the contrary, the vision was a spiritual intuition
produced by God in the soul of the prophet, it might set forth the
resurrection of the dead, even if the belief in this dogma had no
existence as yet in the consciousness of the people, or at all events
was not yet a living faith; and God might have shown to the prophet the
raising of Israel to life under this figure, for the purpose of
awakening this belief in Israel.

(Note: No conclusive evidence can be adduced that the doctrine of the
resurrection of the dead was not only known to Ezekiel, but was regarded
by the people as indisputably sure, as both Hengstenberg (Christology,
vol. III p. 51, transl.) and Pareau (Comment. de immortal. p. 109)
assume. Such passages as [Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md) and
[Isa 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md), even if Ezekiel referred
to them, merely prove that the belief or hope of the resurrection of the
dead could not be altogether unknown to the believers of Israel, because
Isaiah had already declared it. But the obvious announcement of this
dogma in [Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md) belongs to a later
period than our vision; and even Daniel does not speak of it as a belief
that prevailed throughout the nation, but simply communicates it as a
consolation offered by the angel of the Lord in anticipation of the
times of severe calamity awaiting the people of God.)

In that case, however, the vision was not merely a parable, but a
symbolical representation of a real fact, which was to serve as a pledge
to the nation of its restoration to life. Theodoret comes much nearer to
the truth when he gives the following as his explanation of the vision:
that "on account of the unbelief of the Jews in exile, who were
despairing of their restoration, the almighty God makes known His might;
and the resurrection of the dead bodies, which was much more difficult
than their restoration, is shown to the prophet, in order that all the
nation may be taught thereby that everything is easy to His will;"

(Note: His words are these: ἐπειδή γὰρ δι ̓ ἥν ἐνόσουν ἀπιστίαν τἀς
χρηστοτέρας ἀπηγόρευσαν ἐλπίδας οἱ ἐκ τῆς ̓Ιουδαίας αἰχμάλωται
γενόμενοι, τὴν οἰκείαν αὐτοῖς ὁ τῶν ὅλων Θεὸς ἐπιδείκνυσι δύναμιν, καὶ
τὴν πολλῷ τῆς ἀνακλήσεως ἐκείνης δυσκολωτέραν τῶν νεκρῶν σωμάτων
ἀνάστασιν ἐπιδείκνυσι τῷ προφήτῃ καὶ δι ̓ ἐκείνου πάντα διδάσκει τὸν
λαὸν, ὡς πάντα αὐτῷ ῥᾴδια βουλομένῳ.)

and when, accordingly, he calls what occurs in the vision "a type not of
the calling to life of the Jews only, but also of the resurrection of
all men." The only defect in this is, that Theodoret regards the dead
bones which are brought to life too much as a figurative representation
of any dead whatever, and thereby does justice neither to the words,
"these bones are the whole house of Israel," which he paraphrases by
τύπος τοῦ ̓Ισραὴλ ταῦτα, nor to the designation applied to them as
הרוּגים, though it may fairly be pleaded as a valid excuse so far as
הרוגים is concerned, that the force of this word has been completely
neutralized in the Septuagint, upon which he was commenting, by the
rendering τοὺς νεκροὺς τούτους. - Hvernick has interpreted the vision in
a much more abstract manner, and evaporated it into the general idea of
a symbolizing of the creative, life-giving power of God, which can raise
even the bones of the dead to life again. His exposition is the
following: "There is no express prediction of the resurrection in these
words, whether of a general resurrection or of the particular
resurrection of Israel; but this is only though of here, inasmuch as it
rests upon the creative activity of God, to which even such a conquest
of death as this is possible."

(Note: The view expressed by Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, II 2, pp. 507ff.)
is a kindred one, namely, that it is not the future resurrection of the
dead, or the resurrection of the deceased Israelites, which is indicated
in the vision, and that it does not even set forth to view the
unconditioned power of God over death, or an idea which is intended as a
pledge of the resurrection of the dead; but that by the revelation made
manifest to the prophet in the state of ecstasy, the completeness of
that state of death out of which Israel is to be restored is exhibited,
and thus the truth is set before his eyes that the word of prophecy has
the inherent power to ensure its own fulfilment, even when Israel is in
a condition which bears precisely the same resemblance to a nation as
the state of death to a human being.)

The calling to life of the thoroughly dried dead bones shown to the
prophet in the vision, is a figure or visible representation of that
which the Lord announces to him in [Eze
37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md), namely, that He will bring
Israel out of its graves, give it life with His breath, and bring it
into its own land; and consequently a figure of the raising of Israel to
life from its existing state of death. The opening of the graves is also
a figure; for those whom the Lord will bring out of their braves are
they who say, "Our bones are dried," etc. ([Eze
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011).md), and therefore not those who
are deceased, nor even the spiritually dead, but those who have lost all
hope of life. We are not, however, to understand by this merely mors
civilis and vita civilis, as Grotius has done. For Israel was destroyed,
not only politically as a nation, but spiritually as a church of the
Lord, through the destruction of its two kingdoms and its dispersion
among the heathen; and in a very large number of its members it had also
been given up to the power of physical death and sunk into the grave.
Even then, if we keep out of sight those who were deceased, Israel, as
the people of God was slain (הרוּג), without any hope of coming to life
again, or a resurrection to new life. But the Lord now shows the prophet
this resurrection under the figure of the raising to life of the very
dry bones that lie scattered all around. This is fulfilled through the
restoration of Israel as the people of Jehovah, to which the leading of
the people back into the land of Israel essentially belongs. The way was
opened and prepared for this fulfilment by the return of a portion of
the people from the Babylonian captivity under Zerubbabel and Ezra,
which was brought to pass by the Lord, by the rebuilding of the cities
of Judah and the temple which had been destroyed, and by the restoration
of political order. But all this was nothing more than a pledge of the
future and complete restoration of Israel. For although the Lord still
raised up prophets for those who had returned and furthered the building
of His house, His glory did not enter the newly erected temple, and the
people never attained to independence again, - that is to say, not to
permanent independence, - but continued in subjection to the imperial
power of the heathen. And even if, according to Ezra, very many more of
the exiles may have returned to their native land, by whom, for example,
Galilee was repopulated and brought into cultivation again, the greater
portion of the nation remained dispersed among the heathen. The true
restoration of Israel as the people of the Lord commenced with the
founding of the new kingdom of God, the "kingdom of heaven," through the
appearing of Christ upon the earth. But inasmuch as the Jewish nation as
such, or in its entirety, did not acknowledge Jesus Christ as the
Messiah foretold by the prophets and sent by God, but rejected its
Saviour, there burst afresh upon Jerusalem and the Jewish nation the
judgment of dispersion among the heathen; whereas the kingdom of God
founded by Christ spread over the earth, through the entrance of
believers from among the Gentiles. This judgment upon the Jewish people,
which is hardened in unbelief, still continues, and will continue until
the time when the full number of the Gentiles has entered into the
kingdom of God, and Israel as a people shall also be converted to
Christ, acknowledge the crucified One as its Saviour, and bow the knee
before Him ([Rom 11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025).md). Then will
"all Israel" be raised up out of its graves, the graves of its political
and spiritual death, and brought back into its own land, which will
extend as far as the Israel of God inhabits the earth. Then also will
the hour come in which all the dead will hear the voice of the Son of
God, and come forth out of their graves to the resurrection ([Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md); [Joh
5:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025).md); when the Lord shall appear
in His glory, and descend from heaven with the trump of God ([Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016).md), to call all the dead to life,
and through the judgment upon all the nations to perfect His kingdom in
glory, and bring the righteous into the Canaan of the new earth, into
the heavenly Jerusalem, to the imperishable life of everlasting
blessedness.

All these several factors in the restoration of Israel, which has been
given up to the death of exile on account of its sins, though far
removed from one another, so far as the time of their occurrence is
concerned, are grouped together as one in the vision of the coming to
life of the dead bones of the whole house of Israel. The two features
which are kept distinct in the visionary description - namely, (1) the
coming together of the dry bones, and their being clothed with sinews,
flesh, and skin; and (2) the bringing to life of the bones, which have
now the form of corpses, through the divine breath of life - are not to
be distinguished in the manner proposed by Hengstenberg, namely, that
the first may be taken as referring to the restoration of the civil
condition - the external restitutio in integrum; the second, to the
giving of new life through the outpouring of the Spirit of God. - Even
according to our view, the vision contains a prophecy of the
resurrection of the dead, only not in this sense, that the doctrine of
the general resurrection of the dead is the premiss, or the design, or
the direct meaning of the vision; but that the figurative meaning
constitutes the foreground, and the full, literal meaning of the words
the background of the prophetic vision, and that the fulfilment advances
from the figurative to the literal meaning, - the raising up of the
people of Israel out of the civil and spiritual death of exile being
completed in the raising up of the dead out of their graves to
everlasting life at the last day.

[Ezekiel 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 37:15</span></span>

Reunion of Israel as One Nation under the Future King David

This word of God directs the prophet to represent by a sign the reunion
of the tribes of Israel, which have been divided into two kingdoms ([Eze
37:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015).md), and to explain this sign to
the people ([Eze 37:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#018).md), and
predict its sanctification and blessedness under the reign of the future
David ([Eze 37:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022).md). What is new in
this word of God is the express prediction embodied in a symbolical
action, of the reunion of the divided tribes of Israel into one single
people of God, which has been already hinted at in the promise of the
raising to life of "the whole house of Israel" ([Eze
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011).md). This brief indication is here
plainly expressed and more fully developed.

[Eze 37:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015.md)

[Eze 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015.md). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016.md). And
thou, son of man, take to thyself a piece of wood, and write upon it: Of
Judah, and the sons of Israel, his associates; and take another piece of
wood, and write upon it: Of Joseph, the wood of Ephraim, and the whole
house of Israel, his associates; [Eze
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#017.md). And put them together, one to
the other, into one piece of wood to thee, that they may be united in
thy hand. [Eze 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#018.md). And when the
sons of thy people say to thee, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest
by this? [Eze 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019.md). Say to them, Thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will take the wood of Joseph, which is
in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his associates, which
I put thereon, with the wood of Judah, and will make them into one
stick, that they may be one in my hand. [Eze
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#020.md). And the pieces of wood upon
which thou hast written shall be in thy hand before their eyes. [Eze
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021.md). And say to them, Thus saith the
Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will take the sons of Israel out of the nations
among whom they walk, and will gather them from round about, and lead
them into their land. [Eze 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022.md). I
will make them into one nation in the land, upon the mountains of
Israel, and one king shall be king over them all; and it shall not
become two nations any more, and they shall not henceforth be divided
into two kingdoms any more; [Eze
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023.md). And shall not defile themselves
by their idols and their abominations, and by all their transgressions;
but I will help them from all their dwelling-places, in which they have
sinned, and will cleanse them; so that they shall be my people, and I
will be their God. [Eze 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md). And my
servant David will be king over them, and be a shepherd for them all;
and they will walk in my rights, and keep my statutes and do them. [Eze
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025.md). And they will dwell in the land
which I gave to my servant Jacob, in which their fathers dwelt; there
will they dwell, and their children's children for ever; and my servant
David will be a prince to them for ever. [Eze
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md). And I make a covenant of peace
with them for ever, an everlasting covenant shall be with them; and I
will place them, and multiply them, and put my sanctuary in the midst of
them for ever. [Eze 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md). And my
dwelling will be over them; I will be their God, and they will be my
people. [Eze 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#028.md). And the nation
shall know that I am Jehovah, who sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary
shall be in the midst of them for ever.

The symbolical action commanded in [Eze
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016.md) and [Eze
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#017.md), which the prophet no doubt
performed in all its external reality (cf. [Eze
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019.md) and [Eze
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#020).md), is easily understood, and
expresses the thing to be represented in the the clearest manner. The
writing of the names of the tribes composing the two kingdoms recalls to
mind the similar act on the part of Moses ([Num
17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001) :17ff..md). But the act itself is
a different one here, and neither the passage referred to nor [Eze
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#015.md) furnishes any proof that עץ
signifies a staff or rod. Ezekiel would undoubtedly have used מטּה for a
staff. Nor have we even to think of flat boards, but simply of pieces of
wood upon which a few words could be written, and which could be held in
one hand. The ל before the names to be written upon each piece of wood
is the sign of the genitive, indicating to whom it belongs, as in the
case of the heading to David's psalms (לדוד). This is evident from the
fact that in אץ אפרים the construct state is used instead. The name is
to indicate that the piece of wood belongs to Judah or Ephraim, and
represents it. The command to Ezekiel to write upon one piece of wood,
not only Judah, but "the sons of Israel, his associates," arose from the
circumstance that the kingdom of Judah included, in addition to the
tribe of Judah, the greater portion of Benjamin and Simeon, the tribe of
Levi and those pious Israelites who emigrated at different times from
the kingdom of the ten tribes into that of Judah, who either were or
became associates of Judah ([Ch2
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#012.md)., [Ch2
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009.md); [Ch2
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#011.md), [Ch2
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018.md); [Ch2
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001).md). In the writing upon the second
piece of wood, אץ אפרים is an explanatory apposition to ליוסף, and an
accusative governed by כּתב. But the command is not to be understood as
signifying that Ezekiel was to write the words עץ אפרים upon the piece
of wood; all that he was to write was, "Joseph and the whole house of
Israel, his associates." The name of Joseph is chosen, in all
probability, not as the more honourable name, as Hvernick supposes, but
because the house of Joseph, consisting of the two powerful tribes of
Ephraim and Manasseh, formed the trunk of the kingdom of the ten tribes
(Kliefoth). The "whole house of Israel, his associates," are the rest of
the tribes belonging to that kingdom. The two pieces of wood, with these
inscriptions upon them, Ezekiel is to put together, and hold in his hand
bound together in one. מה־אלּה לּך, what these (two pieces of wood) are
to thee, is equivalent to, what thou meanest to indicate by them. For
the rest, compare [Eze 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#019.md). In the
word of God explaining the action ([Eze
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019).md), the wood of Joseph is not the
piece of wood with Joseph's name written upon it, but the kingdom
represented by this piece of wood which was in Ephraim's hand, inasmuch
as the hegemony was with the tribe of Ephraim. Instead of the wood,
therefore, the tribes (not staffs) of Israel, i.e., the Israelites who
constituted these tribes, are mentioned as his associates. God will put
these upon the wood of Joseph (עליו), i.e., will join them together, and
then place them with the wood of Judah, i.e., the kingdom of Judah, and
unite them into one wood (or nation). את־עץ , the construction of which
has been misunderstood by Hitzig, is neither in apposition to עליו, nor
governed by נתתּי: "and will put them thereupon, upon the wood of Judah"
(Hitzig and Kliefoth), or, "I add them to it, (namely) with the wood of
Judah" (De Wette); but it is dependent upon לקח, "I take the wood of
Joseph...and the tribes of Israel, his associates, which I put thereon,
along with the wood of Judah, and make them into one wood." The
construction is rendered obscure simply by the fact that the relative
clause, "which I put thereon," is attached to the principal clause 'אני
לקח וגו by Vav consec. In בּידי, "they shall be one in my hand," there
is probably an antithesis to בּיד אפרים, those who have come into
Ephraim's hand, the tribes severed by Ephraim from the kingdom of God,
will God once more bring together with Judah, and hold in His hand as an
undivided nation. - In [Eze 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#020.md) the
description of the sign is completed by the additional statement, that
the pieces of wood on which the prophet has written are to be in his
hand before their eyes, and consequently that the prophet is to perform
the act in such a way that his countrymen may see it; from which it
follows that he performed it in its outward reality. The fulfilment of
the instructions is not specially mentioned, as being self-evident; but
in [Eze 37:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021.md) the further
explanation of the symbolical action is given at once; and the
interpretation goes beyond the symbol, inasmuch as it not only describes
the manner in which God will effect the union of the divided tribes, but
also what He will do for the preservation of the unity of the reunited
people, and for the promotion of their blessedness. This explanation is
arranged in two strophes through the repetition of the concluding
thought: "they will be my people," etc., in [Eze
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023.md) and [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md). Each of these strophes contains
a twofold promise.

The first ([Eze 37:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021)) promises (a.md)
the gathering of the Israelites out of their dispersion, their
restoration to their own land, and their union as one nation under the
rule of David ([Eze 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021.md), [Eze
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022)); (b.md) their purification from
all sins, and sanctification as the true people of the Lord ([Eze
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023).md). The second strophe ([Eze
37:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024)) promises (a.md) their
undisturbed eternal abode in the land, under David their prince ([Eze
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025)); (b.md) the blessedness conferred
upon them through the conclusion of an everlasting covenant of peace
([Eze 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md) and [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027).md). This second promise,
therefore, constitutes the completion of the first, securing to the
nation of Israel its restoration and sanctification for all time. The
whole promise, however, is merely a repetition of that contained in
Ezekiel 34:11-31 and [Eze 36:22-30](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022.md). -
The three factors - the gathering out of the nations, restoration to the
land of Israel, and reunion as one people - form the first act of divine
grace. The union of the Israelites, when brought back to their land, is
accomplished by God giving them in David a king who will so rule the
reunited people that they will not be divided any more into two peoples
and two kingdoms. The Chetib יהיה is not to be altered into the plural
יהיוּ, as in the Keri; but גּוי is to be supplied in thought, from the
preceding clause, as the subject to the verb. The division of the nation
into two kingdoms had its roots, no doubt, in the ancient jealousy
existing between the two tribes Ephraim and Judah; but it was primarily
brought to pass through the falling away of Solomon from the Lord.
Consequently it could only be completely and for ever terminated through
the righteous government of the second David, and the purification of
the people from their sins. This is the way in which [Eze
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023.md) is attached to [Eze
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022.md). For [Eze
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023.md) compare [Eze
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#011.md) and [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md). Different interpretations have
been given of the words, "I help them from all their dwelling-places, in
which they have sinned." They recall to mind [Eze
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029.md), "I help them from all their
uncleannesses." As הושׁע מן signifies, in that case, "to preserve
therefrom," so in the present instance the thought can only be, "God
will preserve them from all the dwelling-places in which they have
sinned." Hengstenberg is of opinion that the redemption from the
dwelling-places does not take place locally, but spiritually, through
the cleansing away of all traces of sin, first from the hearts, and
then, in consequence, from all around. In this way is the land changed,
through the power of the Lord, into another land, from a sinful to a
holy one; just as before it had been changed from a holy to a sinful one
through the guilt of the people. But if this were the only thought which
the words contained, Ezekiel would certainly have placed the וטהרתּי
אותם before 'והושׁעתּי וגו. As the words read, the deliverance of the
people from their sinful dwelling-places is to precede their
purification, to prepare the way for it and bring it to pass, and not to
follow after it. The dwelling-places, at or in which they have sinned,
cannot be the settlements in foreign lands, as Hitzig supposes, but only
the dwelling-places in Canaan, to which the Lord would bring them after
gathering them from their dispersion. הושׁע does not signify, "leading
out from these dwelling-places," which is the explanation given by
Kliefoth, who consequently thinks that we must understand the words as
denoting the leading over of Israel from the present Canaan, or the
Canaan of this life, to which its sins adhere, to the glorified, new,
and eternal Canaan. This view is utterly irreconcilable both with the
words themselves and also with the context. Even if הושׁע meant to lead
out, it would not be allowable to transform the "leading out" from the
sinful Canaan into a "leading in" to the glorified and heavenly Canaan.
Moreover, the further development of this promise in [Eze
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025.md) also shows that it is not in the
glorified, eternal Canaan that Israel is to dwell, but in the earthly
Canaan in which its fathers dwelt. It is obvious from this, that in all
the promise here given there is no allusion to a transformation and
glorification of Canaan itself. The helping or saving from all
dwelling-places in which they have sinned would rather consist in the
fact, therefore, that God would remove from their dwelling-places
everything that could offer them an inducement to sin. For although sin
has its seat, not in the things without us, but in the heart, the
external circumstances of a man do offer various inducements to sin.
Before the captivity, Canaan offered such an inducement to the
Israelites through the idolatry and moral corruption of the Canaanites
who were left in the land. And with reference to this the Lord promises
that in future, when His people are brought back to Canaan, He will
preserve them from the sinful influence of their dwelling-places. But
this preservation will only be effected with complete success when God
purifies Israel itself, and, by means of its renovation, eradicates all
sinful desire from the heart (cf. [Eze
36:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026).md). In this way וטהרתּי is
appended in the most fitting way to 'והושׁעתּי . - Through the removal
of all sinful influences from around them, and the purifying of the
heart, Israel will then become in truth the people of God, and Jehovah
the God of Israel ([Eze 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023).md).

Israel, when thus renewed, will walk in the rights of the Lord and
fulfil His commandments, under the protection of its one shepherd David,
i.e., of the Messiah ([Eze 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md), cf.
[Eze 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027.md), and [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023).md); and its children and
children's children will dwell for ever in its own land, David being its
prince for ever ([Eze 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025.md), and cf.
[Eze 36:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#028.md) and [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024).md). What is new in this promise,
which is repeated from Ezekiel 34 and 36, is contained in לעולם, which
is to be taken in the strict sense of the word. Neither the dwelling of
Israel in Canaan, nor the government of the David-Messiah, will ever
have an end. לעולם is therefore repeated in [Eze
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md) in the promise of the covenant
which the Lord will make with His people. The thought itself has already
been expressed in [Eze 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md), and
בּרית שׁלוּם is to be understood, both here and there, as comprehending
all the saving good which the Lord will bestow upon all His sanctified
people. There are only two factors of this salvation mentioned here in
[Eze 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md) and [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md), namely, the multiplication of
the people, as the earthly side of the divine blessing, and the
establishing of His eternal sanctuary in the midst of them as the
spiritual side. These two points refer back to the former acts of God,
and hold up to view the certain and full realization in the future of
what has hitherto been neither perfectly nor permanently accomplished on
account of the sins of the people. וּנתתּים, in [Eze
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md), is not to be taken in
connection with והרבּיתּי אותם, so as to form one idea in the sense of
dabo eos multiplicatos (Venema and Hengstenberg), for we have no
analogies of such a mode of combination; but נתתּים, I make, or place
them, is to be taken by itself, and completed from the context, "I make
them into a nation, and I multiply them (cf. [Eze
36:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#010.md), [Eze
36:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#037).md). Ezekiel has here [Lev
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#009.md) and [Lev
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011.md) in his mind, as we may see from
the fact that the words, "I give my sanctuary in the midst of them for
ever," are obviously formed after [Lev
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011.md), "I give my dwelling in the
midst of them;" in such a manner, however, that by the substitution of
מקדּשׁי for משׁכּני, and the addition of לעולם, the promise is both
deepened and strengthened. In the change of משׁכּני into מקדּשׁי, he may
indeed have had the words of [Exo 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008.md)
floating before his mind, "they shall make me a sanctuary, that I may
dwell among them;" nevertheless he deliberately selected the expression
"my sanctuary," to indicate that the Lord would dwell in the midst of
Israel as the Holy One, and the Sanctifier of His people. Moreover, the
words are not, "my dwelling will be in the midst of them, or among them"
(בּתוכם), but עליהם, over them. This expression is transferred from the
site of the temple, towering above the city ([Psa
68:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030).md), to the dwelling of God among
His people, to give prominence to the protective power and saving grace
of the God who rules in Israel (cf. Hengstenberg on [Psa
68:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030).md). The sanctuary which Jehovah
will give in Israel for ever, i.e., will found and cause to endure, that
He may dwelling the midst of it to shelter and bless, is the temple, but
not the temple built by Zerubbabel. As an objection to this Jewish
interpretation, Jerome has justly said: "but how could it be said to
stand 'for ever,' when that temple which was built in the time of
Zerubbabel, and afterwards restored by many others, was consumed by
Roman fire? All these things are to be taken as referring to the church
in the time of the Saviour, when His tabernacle was placed in the
church." There is no reference whatever here to the rebuilding of the
temple by Zerubbabel; not because that temple did not stand for ever and
was destroyed by the Romans, but chiefly because God did not make it His
abode, or fill this temple with His gracious presence (Shechinah). The
sanctuary which God will place for ever among His people is the
sanctuary seen by Ezekiel in Ezekiel 40ff.; and this is merely a
figurative representation of the "dwelling of God in the midst of His
people through His Son and Holy Spirit" (cf. Vitringa, Observv. I. p.
161), which began to be realized in the incarnation of the Logos, who is
set forth in [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md) as the true
משׁכּן, in the words ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν ἡμῖν, and is continued in the
spiritual dwelling of God in the heart of believers ([Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019).md), and will be completed at the
second coming of our Lord in the "tabernacle (σκηνή) of God with men" of
the new Jerusalem, of which the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the
temple, since Israel will then first have become in truth the people of
God, and Jehovah (God with them) their God ([Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003.md), [Rev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022).md). - The promise concludes in
[Eze 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#028.md) with an allusion to the
impression which these acts of God in Israel will make upon the heathen
(cf. [Eze 36:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#036).md). From the fact that
Jehovah erects His sanctuary in the midst of Israel for ever, they will
learn that it is He who sanctifieth Israel. קדּשׁ, to sanctify, means,
"to remove from all connection either with sin or with its consequences.
Here the reference is to the latter, because these alone strike the eyes
of the heathen; but the former is presupposed as the necessary
foundation" (Hengstenberg). The words rest upon the promises of the
Pentateuch, where God describes Himself as He who will and does sanctify
Israel (compare [Exo 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013.md); [Lev
22:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#031).md). This promise, which has
hitherto been only imperfectly fulfilled on account of Israel's guilt,
will be perfectly realized in the future, when Israel will walk in the
ways of the Lord, renewed by the Spirit of God.

Thus does this prophecy of Ezekiel span the whole future of the people
of God even to eternity. But the promise in which it culminates, namely,
that the Lord will erect His sanctuary in the midst of His restored
people, and there take up His abode above them for ever ([Eze
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026)..md), is of importance as helping
to decide the question, how we are to understand the fulfilment of the
restoration to Canaan into the land given to the fathers, which is
promised to all Israel; whether, in a literal manner, by the restoration
of the Israelites to Palestine; or spiritually, by the gathering
together of the Israelites converted to the Lord their God and Saviour,
and their introduction into the kingdom of God founded by Christ, in
which case Canaan, as the site of the Old Testament kingdom of God,
would be a symbolical or typical designation of the earthly soil of the
heavenly kingdom, which has appeared in the Christian church. - These
two different views have stood opposed to one another from time
immemorial, inasmuch as the Jews expect from the Messiah, for whose
advent they still hope, not only their restoration to Palestine, but the
erection of the kingdom of David and the rebuilding of the temple upon
Mount Zion, together with the sacrificial worship of the Levitical law;
whereas in the Christian church, on the ground of the New Testament
doctrine, that the old covenant has been abolished along with the
Levitical temple-worship through the perfect fulfilment of the law by
Christ and the perpetual efficacy of His atoning sacrifice, the view has
prevailed that, with the abolition of the Old Testament form of the
kingdom of God, even Palestine has ceased to be the chosen land of the
revelation of the saving grace of God, and under the new covenant Canaan
extends as far as the Israel of the new covenant, the church of Jesus
Christ, is spread abroad over the earth, and that Zion or Jerusalem is
to be sought wherever Christendom worships God in spirit and in truth,
wherever Christ is with His people, and dwells in the hearts of
believers through the Holy Spirit. It was by J. A. Bengel and C. F.
Oetinger that the so-called "realistic" interpretation of the Messianic
prophecies of the Old Testament - according to which, after the future
conversion to Christ of the Jewish people who are hardened still, the
establishment of the kingdom of God in Palestine and its capital
Jerusalem is to be expected - has been revived and made into one of the
leading articles of Christian hope. By means of this "realistic"
exposition of the prophetic word the chiliastic dogma of the
establishment of a kingdom of glory before the last judgment and the end
of the world is then deduced from the twentieth chapter of the
Apocalypse; and many of the theologians of our day regard this as the
certain resultant of a deeper study of the Scriptures. In the more
precise definition of the dogma itself, the several supporters diverge
very widely from one another; but they all agree in this, that they base
the doctrine chiefly upon the prophetic announcement of the eventual
conversion and glorification of all Israel. - As Ezekiel then stands out
among all the prophets as the one who gives the most elaborate
prediction of the restoration of Israel under the government of the
Messiah, and he not only draws in Ezekiel 40-48 a detailed picture of
the new form of the kingdom of God, but also in Ezekiel 38 and 39, in
the prophecy concerning Gog and Magog, foretells an attack on the part
of the heathen world upon the restored kingdom of God, which appears,
according to [Rev 20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007.md), to
constitute the close of the thousand years' reign; we must look somewhat
more closely at this view, and by examining the arguments pro and con,
endeavour to decide the question as to the fulfilment of the Old
Testament prophecies concerning the future of Israel. In doing this,
however, we shall fix our attention exclusively upon the exegetical
arguments adduced in support of the chiliastic view by its latest
supporters.

of John;" also in a treastise on the Messianic Prophecies of the Mosaic

The prophetic announcement, that the Lord will one day gather together
again the people of Israel, which has been thrust out among the heathen
for its unfaithfulness, will bring it back into the land given to the
fathers, and there bless and greatly multiply it, has its roots in the
promises of the law. If the stiff-necked transgressors of the
commandments of God - these are the words of [Lev
26:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md) - bear the punishment of
their iniquity in the land of their enemies, and confess their sins, and
their uncircumcised heart is humbled, then will the Lord remember His
covenant with the patriarchs, and not cast them off even in the land of
their enemies, to destroy them, and to break His covenant with them; but
will remember the covenant which He made with their ancestors, when He
brought them out of Egypt before the eyes of the nations to be their
God. He will, as this is more precisely defined in [Deu
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003.md)., gather them together again out
of the heathen nations, lead them back into the land which their fathers
possessed, and multiply Israel more than its fathers. On the ground of
this promise, of which Moses gives a still further pledge to the people
in his dying song ([Deu 32:36-43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036).md), all
the prophets announce the restoration and ultimate glorification of
Israel. This song, which closes with the promise, "Rejoice, ye nations,
over His people; for He will avenge the blood of His servants, and repay
vengeance to His adversaries, and expiate His land, His people,"
continues to resound - to use the words of Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, II 2,
pp. 89, 90) - "through all the Old Testament prophecy. Not only when
Obadiah ([Oba 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017).md) and Joel ([Joe
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#005).md) promise good to their nation do
they call Mount Zion and the city of Jerusalem the place where there is
protection from the judgment upon the nations of the world; but Micah
also, who foretells the destruction of the temple and the carrying away
of his people to Babylon, beholds Mount Zion exalted at last above all
the seats of worldly power, and his people brought back to the land of
their fathers ([Eze 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md); [Eze
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#014).md). The same Isaiah, who was sent
to harden his people with the word of his prophecy, is nevertheless
certain that at last a holy nation will dwell in Jerusalem, a remnant of
Israel ([Isa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md); [Isa
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021).md); and the holy mountain of
Jehovah, to which His scattered people return from all the ends of the
world, is that abode of peace where even wild beasts do no more harm
under the rule of the second David ([Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md), [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011).md). After all the calamities which
it was the mournful lot of Jeremiah to foretell and also to witness,
Jehovah showed this prophet the days when He would restore His people,
and bring them back to the land which He gave to their fathers ([Jer
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#003).md).... And the same promise is
adhered to even after the return. In every way is the assurance given by
Zechariah, that Judah shall be God's holy possession in God's holy
land."

(Note: Compare with this the words of Auberlen (der Prophet Daniel, p.
399, ed. 2): "The doctrine of the glorious restoration of Israel to
Canaan, after severe chastisement and humiliation, is so essential and
fundamental a thought of all prophecy, that the difficulty is not so
much to find passages to support it, as to make a selection from them.
By way of example, let us notice [Isa
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Isa
4:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md); [Isa
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md), [Isa
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011.md) and [Isa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012.md); more especially [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md)., 24ff., 60ff.; Jer 30-33; [Eze
34:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md), 36-37; [Hos
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#016.md) -25; [Hos
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md); [Hos
11:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md); [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md).; [Joe
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001.md); 4:16-21; [Amo
9:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md); [Oba
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017.md); [Mic
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md); [Mic
4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md); [Mic
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md); [Mic
7:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011).md); [Zep
3:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#014.md); [Zac
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004.md)., [Zac

9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md)., [Zac
10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008.md); 12:2-13:6; [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008)." Auberlen (pp. 400f..md) then gives
the following as the substance of these prophetic descriptions: "Israel
having been brought back to its own land, will be the people of God in a
much higher and deeper sense than before; inasmuch as sin will be
averted, the knowledge of God will fill the land, and the Lord will
dwell again in the midst of His people at Jerusalem. A new period of
revelation is thus commenced, the Spirit of God is richly poured out,
and with this a plenitude of such gifts of grace as were possessed in a
typical manner by the apostolic church. And this rich spiritual life has
also its perfect external manifestation both in a priestly and a regal
form. The priesthood of Israel was more especially seen by Ezekiel, the
son of a priest, in his mysterious vision in ch. 40-48; the monarchy by
Daniel, the statesman; while Jeremiah, for example, unites the two ([Jer
33:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017).md). What took place only in an
outward way, i.e., in the letter, during the Old Testament times, and
withdrew, on the other hand, into the inward and hidden spirit-life
during the time of the Christian church, will then manifest itself
outwardly also, and assume an external though pneumatic form. In the Old
Testament the whole of the national life of Israel in its several forms
of manifestation, domestic and political life, labour and art,
literature and culture, was regulated by religion, though only at first
in an outward and legal way. The church, on the other hand, has, above
all, to urge a renewal of the heart, and must give freedom to the
outward forms which life assumes, enjoining upon the conscience of
individual men, in these also to glorify Christ. In the thousand years'
reign all these departments of life will be truly Christianized, and
that from within. Looked at in this light, there will be nothing left to
give offence, if we bear in mind that the ceremonial law of Moses
corresponds to the priesthood of Israel, and the civil law to the
monarchy. The Gentile church has only been able to adopt the moral law,
however certainly it has been directed merely to the inwardly working
means of the word, or of the prophetic office. But when once the
priesthood and the kingly office have been restored, then, without doing
violence to the Epistle to the Hebrews, the ceremonial and civil law of
Moses will unfold its spiritual depths in the worship and constitution
of the thousand years' reign.")

Continued in next section

\[continued from previous section\]

This restoration of Israel Ezekiel describes, in harmony with Jer 31,
though in a much more detailed picture, in the following way: - "The
condition of things in the future will differ from that in the past,
simply in the fact that Israel will then have a heart converted to
fidelity and obedience by the Spirit of God ([Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md); [Eze
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027).md), and will live in good peace
and prosperity under the shelter of its God, who is known and
acknowledged by all the world ([Eze
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023).md). The land to which it is
restored, a land most decidedly represented by Ezekiel as the same as
that in which its fathers lived ([Eze
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025).md), appears throughout merely as a
happy earthly dwelling-place, and the promise of its possession as an
assurance given to a nation continuing to propagate itself in peace"
(Hofmann, p. 576). This manner of depicting the condition of the Israel
restored and glorified by the Messiah, as a peaceful settlement and a
happy life in the land of the fathers, a life rich in earthly
possessions, is not confined, however, to Jeremiah and Ezekiel, but
stands out more or less conspicuously in the Messianic pictures of all
the prophets. What follows, then, from this in relation to the mode in
which these prophecies are to be fulfilled? Is it that the form assumed
by the life of the people of Israel when restored will be only a
heightened repetition of the conditions of its former life in Palestine,
undisturbed by sin? By no means. On the contrary, it follows from this
that the prophets have depicted the glorious restoration of Israel by
the Messiah by means of figures borrowed from the past and present of
the national life of Israel, and therefore that their picture is not to
be taken literally, but symbolically or typically, and that we are not
to expect it to be literally fulfilled.

We are forced to this conclusion by the fact that, through the coming of
Christ, and the kingdom of heaven which began with Him, the idea of the
people of God has been so expanded, that henceforth not the lineal
descendants of Abraham, or the Jewish nation merely, but the church of
confessors of Jesus Christ, gathered together out of Israel and the
Gentiles, has become the people of God, and the economy of the Old
Testament has ceased to constitute the divinely appointed from of the
church of God. If, therefore, the Jewish people, who have rejected the
Saviour, who appeared in Jesus Christ, and have hardened themselves
against the grace and truth revealed in Him, are not cast off for ever,
but, according to the promises of the Old Testament and the teaching of
the Apostle Paul (Rom 11), will eventually repent, and as a people turn
to the crucified One, and then also realize the fulfilment of the
promises of God; there is still lacking, with the typical character of
the prophetic announcement, any clear and unambiguous biblical evidence
that all Israel, whose salvation is to be looked for in the future, will
be brought back to Palestine, when eventually converted to Christ the
crucified One, and continue there as a people separated from the rest of
Christendom, and from the earthly centre of the church of the Lord
gathered out of all nations and tongues. For, however well founded the
remark of Hofmann (ut sup. p. 88) may be, that "holy people and holy
land are demanded by one another;" this proves nothing more than that
the holy people, gathered out of all the families of the earth through
the believing reception of the gospel, will also have a holy land for
its dwelling-place; in other words, that, with the spread of the church
of the Lord over all the quarters of the globe, the earth will become
holy land or Canaan, so far as it is inhabited by the followers of
Christ. The Apostle Paul teaches this in the same Epistle in which he
foretells to Israel, hardened in unbelief, its eventual restoration and
blessedness; when he explains in [Rom
4:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009.md) that to Abraham or his seed the
promise that he was to be the heir of the world was not fulfilled
through the law, but through the righteousness of the faith, which
Abraham had when still uncircumcised, that he might become a father of
all those who believe, though they be not circumcised, and a father of
the circumcision, not merely of those who are of the circumcision, but
of those also who walk in the footsteps of his faith. And the apostle,
when developing this thought, interprets the promise given to the
patriarch in [Gen 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md) and [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md) : "to thy seed will I give this
land" (i.e., the land of Canaan), by κληρονομεῖν κόσμον (inheriting the
world), he regards Canaan as a type of the world or of the earth, which
would be occupied by the children born of faith to the patriarch.

This typical interpretation of the promise, given in the Old Testament
to the seed of Abraham, of the everlasting possession of the land of
Canaan, which is thus taught by the Apostle Paul, and has been adopted
by the church on his authority, corresponds also to the spirit and
meaning of the Old Testament word of God. This is evident from Gen 17,
where the Lord God, when instituting the covenant of circumcision, gives
not to Abraham only, but expressly to Sarah also, the promise to make
them into peoples (לגּוים), that king of nations (מלכי עמּים) shall come
from them through the son, whom they are to receive ([Gen
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#006.md) and [Gen
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#016).md), and at the same time promises
to give to the seed of Abraham, thus greatly to be multiplied, the land
of his pilgrimage, the whole land of Canaan, for an everlasting
possession ([Gen 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008).md). This promise
the Lord, as the "almighty God," has not carried into effect by making
Abraham and Sarah into nations through the lineal posterity of Isaac,
but only through the spiritual seed of Abraham, believers out of all
nations, who have become, and still will become, children of Abraham in
Christ. It was only through these that Abraham became the father of a
multitude of nations (לאב המון, [Gen
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005).md). For although two peoples sprang
from Isaac, the Israelites through Jacob, and the Edomites through Esau,
and Abraham also became the ancestor of several tribes through Ishmael
and the sons of Keturah, the divine promise in question refers to the
people of Israel alone, because Esau was separated from the seed of the
promise by God Himself, and the other sons of Abraham were excluded by
the fact that they were not born of Sarah. The twelve tribes, however,
formed but one people; and although Ezekiel calls them two peoples ([Eze
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010.md) and [Eze
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022).md), having in view their division
into two kingdoms, they are never designated or described in the Old or
New Testament as המון גּוים. To this one people God did indeed give the
land of Canaan for a possession, according to the boundaries described
in Num 34, so that it dwelt therein until it was driven out and
scattered among the heathen for its persistent unfaithfulness. But
inasmuch as that portion of the promise which referred to the
multiplication of the seed of Abraham into peoples was only to receive
its complete fulfilment in Christ, according to the counsel and will of
God, through the grafting of the believing Gentile nations into the
family of Abraham, and has so received it, we are not at liberty to
restrict the other portion of this promise, relating to the possession
of the land of Canaan, to the lineal posterity of the patriarch, or the
people of Israel by lineal descent, but must assume that in the promise
of the land to be given to the seed of Abraham God even then spoke of
Canaan as a type of the land which was to be possessed by the posterity
of Abraham multiplied into nations.

This typical phraseology runs through all the prophetical writings of
the Old Testament, and that both with regard to the promised seed, which
Abraham received through Isaac ([Gen
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012).md) in the people of Israel, and
also with reference to the land promised to this seed for an
inheritance, although, while the old covenant established at Sinai
lasted, Israel according to the flesh was the people of God, and the
earthly Canaan between the Euphrates and the river of Egypt was the
dwelling-place of this people. For inasmuch as Abraham received the
promise at the very time of his call, that in his seed all the families
of the earth should be blessed, and the germs of the universal
destination of the people and kingdom of God were deposited, according
to Gen 17, in the subsequent patriarchal promises, the prophets
continued to employ the names of Israel and Canaan more and more in
their Messianic prophecies as symbolical terms for the two ideas of the
people and kingdom of God. And from the time when the fortress of
Jerusalem upon Mount Zion was exalted by David into the capital of his
kingdom and the seat of his government over Israel, and was also made
the site of the dwelling of Jehovah in the midst of His people, by the
removal of the ark of the covenant to Zion, and the building of the
temple which was planned by David, though only carried into execution by
Solomon his son, they employed Zion and Jerusalem in the same typical
manner as the seat and centre of the kingdom of God; so that, in the
Messianic psalms and the writings of the prophets, Zion or Jerusalem is
generally mentioned as the place from which the king (David-Messiah),
anointed by Jehovah as prince over His people, extends His dominion over
all the earth, and whither the nations pour to hear the law of the Lord,
and to be instructed as to His ways and their walking in His paths.

Consequently neither the prominence expressly given to the land in the
promises contained in [Lev 26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042.md) and
[Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043.md), upon which such stress is
laid by Auberlen (die messianische Weissagungen, pp. 827 and 833), nor
the fact that Mount Zion or the city of Jerusalem is named as the place
of judgment upon the world of nations and the completion of the kingdom
of God, to which both Hofmann and Auberlen appeal in the passages
already quoted, furnishes any valid evidence that the Jewish people, on
its eventual conversion to Christ, will be brought back to Palestine,
and that the Lord, at His second coming, will establish the millennial
kingdom in the earthly Jerusalem, and take up His abode on the material
Mount Zion, in a temple built by human hands.

Even the supporters of the literal interpretation of the Messianic
prophecies cannot deny the symbolico-typical character of the Old
Testament revelation. Thus Auberlen, for example, observes (die mess.
Weiss. p. 821) that, "in their typical character, the sacrifices furnish
us with an example of the true signification of all the institutions of
the Old Testament kingdom of God, while the latter exhibit to us in
external symbol and type the truly holy people and the Messianic kingdom
in its perfection, just as the former set forth the sacrifice of the
Messiah." But among these institutions the Israelitish sanctuary
(tabernacle or temple) undoubtedly occupied a leading place as a
symbolico-typical embodiment of the kingdom of God established in
Israel, as is now acknowledged by nearly all the expositors of Scripture
who have any belief in revelation. It is not merely the institutions of
the old covenant, however, which have a symbolico-typical signification,
but this is also the case with the history of the covenant nation of the
Old Testament, and the soil in which this history developed itself. This
is so obvious, that Auberlen himself (ut sup. p. 827) has said that "it
is quite a common thing with the prophets to represent the approaching
dispersion and enslaving of Israel among the heathen as a renewal of
their condition in Egypt, and the eventual restoration of both the
people and kingdom as a new exodus from Egypt and entrance into Canaan
([Hos 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001.md) and [Hos
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#016.md), [Hos
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017.md), [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md) and [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md), [Hos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md), [Hos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md); [Mic
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md); [Mic
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015.md); [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md), [Isa
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026.md); [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md); [Jer
16:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014), and other passages.md)." And
even Hofmann, who sets aside this typical phraseology of the prophets in
[Isa 11:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md), where the restoration
of Israel from its dispersion throughout all the world is depicted as a
repetition of its deliverance from Egypt through the miraculous division
of the Red Sea, with the simple remark, "that the names of the peoples
mentioned in the 14th as well as in the 11th verse, and the obstacles
described in the 15th verse, merely serve to elaborate the thought"
(Schriftbeweis, II 2, p. 548), cannot help admitting (at p. 561) "that
in [Isa 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md) אדום is not to be
understood as a special prophecy against the Edomitish people, but as a
symbolical designation of the world of mankind in its enmity against
God." But if Edom is a type of the human race in its hostility to God in
this threatening of judgment, "the ransomed of Jehovah" mentioned in the
corresponding announcement of salvation in [Isa
35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md), who are to "return to Zion
with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads," cannot be the rescued
remnant of the Jewish people, or the Israel of the twelve tribes who
will ultimately attain to blessedness, nor can the Zion to which they
return be the capital of Palestine. If Edom in this eschatological
prophecy denotes the world in its enmity against God, the ransomed of
Jehovah who return to Zion are the people of God gathered from both
Gentiles and Jews, who enter into the blessedness of the heavenly
Jerusalem. By adopting this view of Edom, Hofmann has admitted the
typical use of the ideas, both of the people of Jehovah (Israel) and of
Zion, by the prophets, and has thereby withdrawn all firm foundation
from his explanation of similar Messianic prophecies when the Jewish
nation is concerned. The same rule which applies to Edom and Zion in Isa
34 and [Isa 35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md) must also be
applicable in Isa 40-56. The prophecy concerning Edom in Isa 34 has its
side-piece in [Isa 63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md); and, as
Delitzsch has said, the announcement of the return of the ransomed of
Jehovah to Zion in Ezekiel 36, "as a whole and in every particular, both
in thought and language, is a prelude of this book of consolation for
the exiles (i.e., the one which follows in Isa 40-66)." Ezekiel uses
Edom in the same way, in the prediction of the everlasting devastation
of Edom and the restoration of the devastated land of Israel, to be a
lasting blessing for its inhabitants. As Edom in this case also
represents the world in its hostility to God (see the comm. on Ezekiel
35:1-36:15), the land of Israel also is not Palestine, but the kingdom
of the Messiah, the boundaries of which extend from sea to sea, and from
the river to the ends of the world ([Psa
73:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#008.md) and [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010).md). It is true that in the case of
our prophet there is no express mention made of the spread of the
kingdom of God over the lands, inasmuch as he is watchman over the house
of Israel, and therefore, for the most part, principally speaks of the
restoration of Israel; but it is also obvious that this prophetic truth
was not unknown to him, from the fact that, according to [Eze
47:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#022.md), in the fresh division of the
land among the tribes by lot, the foreigners as well as the natives are
to be reckoned among the children of Israel, and to receive their
portion of the land as well, which plainly abolishes the difference in
lineal descent existing under the old covenant. Still more clearly does
he announce the reception of the heathen nations into the kingdom of God
in [Eze 16:53](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053.md)., where he predicts the
eventual turning of the captivity, not of Jerusalem only, but also of
Samaria and Sodom, as the goal of the ways of God with His people. If,
therefore, in His pictures of the restoration and glorification of the
kingdom of God, he speaks of the land of Israel alone, the reason for
this mode of description is probably also to be sought in the fact that
he goes back to the fundamental prophecies of the Pentateuch more than
other prophets do; and as, on the one hand, he unfolds the fulfilment of
the threats in Lev 26 and Deut 28-32 in his threatenings of judgments,
so, on the other hand, does he display the fulfilment of the promises of
the law in his predictions of salvation. If we bear this in mind, we
must not take his prophecy of the very numerous multiplication of Israel
and of the eternal possession of Canaan and its blessings in any other
sense than in that of the divine promise in Gen 17; that is to say, we
must not restrict the numerous multiplication of Israel to the literal
multiplication of the remnant of the twelve tribes, but must also
understand thereby the multiplication of the seed of Abraham into
peoples in the manner explained above, and interpret in the same way the
restoration of Israel to the land promised to the fathers.

This view of the Old Testament prophecy concerning the eventual
restoration of Israel on its conversion to Christ is confirmed as to its
correctness by the New Testament also; if, for example, we consider the
plain utterances of Christ and His apostles concerning the relation of
the Israel according to the flesh, i.e., of the Jewish nation, to Christ
and His kingdom, and do not adhere in a one-sided manner to the literal
interpretation of the eschatological pictures contained in the language
of the Old Testament prophecy. For since, as Hofmann has correctly
observed in his Schriftbeweis (II 2, pp. 667, 668), "the apostolical
doctrine of the end of the present condition of things, namely, of the
reappearance of Christ, of the glorification of His church, and the
resurrection of its dead, or even of the general resurrection of the
dead, of the glorification of the material world, the destruction of the
present and the creation of a new one, stands in this relation to the
Old Testament prophecy of the end of things, that it is merely a
repetition of it under the new point of view, which accompanied the
appearing and glorification of Jesus and the establishment of His church
of Jews and Gentiles;" these eschatological pictures are also clothed in
the symbolico-typical form peculiar to the Old Testament prophecy, the
doctrinal import of which can only be determined in accordance with the
unambiguous doctrinal passages of the New Testament. Of these doctrinal
passages the first which presents itself is Rom 11, where the Apostle
Paul tells the Christians at Rome as a μυστήριον, that hardness in part
has happened to Israel, till the pleroma of the Gentiles has entered
into the kingdom of God, and so (i.e., after this has taken place) all
Israel will be rescued or saved ([Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md), [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026).md). He then supports this by a
scriptural quotation formed from [Isa
59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020.md) and [Isa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009) (lxx.md), with an evident allusion
to [Jer 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034) (?33.md) also: "there shall
come out of Zion the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from
Jacob," etc.; whilst he has already shown how, as the fall of Israel, or
its ἀποβολή, is the riches of the Gentiles and reconciliation of the
world, the πρόσληψις will not nothing else than life from the dead (ζωὴ
ἐκ νεκρῶν, [Rom 11:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011).md). The apostle
evidently teaches here that the partial hardening of Israel, in
consequence of which the people rejected the Saviour, who appeared in
Jesus, and were excluded from the salvation in Christ, is not an utter
rejection of the old covenant nation; but that the hardening of Israel
will cease after the entrance of the pleroma of the Gentiles into the
kingdom of God, and so all Israel (πᾶς ̓Ισραήλ in contrast with ἐκ
μέρους, i.e., the people of Israel as a whole) will attain to salvation,
although this does not teach the salvation of every individual Jew.

(Note: "All Israel," says Philippi in the 3rd ed. of his Commentary on
the Epistle to the Romans (p. 537), "as contrasted with ἐκ μέρους (in
part) in [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md), and also in the
connection in which it stands with the train of thought in Romans 9-11,
which, as the chapter before us more especially shows, has only to do
with the bringing of the nations as a whole to the Messianic salvation,
cannot be understood in any other sense than as signifying the people of
Israel as a whole (see also [Rom
11:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028).md). The explanation of the
words as denoting the spiritual Israel, the 'Israel of God' ([Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016).md), according to which all the true
children of Abraham and of God are to be saved through the entrance of
the chosen Gentiles, and at the same time also of the ἐκλογή of the
Israel that has not been hardened, is just as arbitrary as it is to take
'all Israel' as referring merely to the believing portion of the Jews,
the portion chosen by God, who have belonged in all ages to the λεῖμμα
κατ ̓ἐκλογὴν χάριτος." But in the appendix to the third edition he has
not only give full expression to the opposite view, which Besser in his
Bibelstunden has supported in the most decided manner, after the example
of Luther and many of the Lutheran expositors, but is inclined to give
preference, even above the view which he preciously upheld, to the idea
that "all Israel is the whole of the Israel intended by the prophetic
word, and included in the divine word of promise, to which alone the
name of Israel truly and justly belongs according to the correct
understanding of the Old Testament word of God - that is to say, those
lineal sons of Abraham who walk in the footsteps of his faith ([Rom
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012).md), those Jews who are so not
merely outwardly in the flesh, but also inwardly in the spirit, through
circumcision of heart ([Rom 2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028).md);"
and also to the following exposition which Calovius gives of the whole
passage, namely, that "it does not relate to a simultaneous or universal
conversion of the Israelites, or to the conversion of a great multitude,
which is to take place at the last times of the world, and is to be
looked forward to still, but rather to successive conversions continuing
even to the end of the world.")

But Auberlen (die mess. Weissagungen, pp. 801ff.) puts too much into
these words of the apostle when he combines them with [Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md), and from the fact that Israel
in the earlier ages of the Old Testament was once a people and kingdom,
but not really a holy and priestly one, and that in the first ages of
the New Testament it was once holy and priestly, though not as a people
and kingdom, draws the conclusion, not only that the Jewish nation must
once more become holy as a people and kingdom, but also that the apostle
of the Gentiles here declares "that the promise given to the people of
Israel, that it is to be a holy people, will still be fulfilled in its
experience, and that in connection with this, after the present period
of the kingdom of God, there is a new period in prospect, when the
converted and sanctified Israel, being called once for all to be a
priestly kingdom, will become the channel of the blessing of fellowship
with God to the nations in a totally different and far more glorious
manner than before." For if the apostle had intended to teach the
eventual accomplishment of this promise in the case of the Israel
according to the flesh, he would certainly have quoted it, or at all
events have plainly hinted at it, and not merely have spoken of the
σώζεσθαι of the Israel which was hardened then. There is nothing to
show, even in the remotest way, that Israel will eventually be exalted
into the holy and priestly people and kingdom for the nations, either in
the assurance that "all Israel shall be saved," or in the declaration
that the "receiving" (πρόσληψις) of Israel will work, or be followed by,
"life from the dead" ([Rom 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md); and
the proposition from which Paul infers the future deliverance of the
people of Israel - viz., "if the first-fruit be holy, the lump is also
holy; and if the root be holy, so are the branches" ([Rom
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016).md) - shows plainly that it never
entered the apostle's mind to predict for the branches that were broken
off the olive tree for a time an exaltation to even greater holiness
than that possessed by the root and beginning of Israel when they should
be grafted in again.

There is also another way in which Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, II 2, pp. 96
and 668) makes insertions in the words of the apostle, - namely, when he
draws the conclusion from the prophetic quotation in [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md), [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md), that the apostle takes the
thought from the prophetic writings, that Zion and Israel are the place
where the final revelation of salvation will be made, and then argues in
support of this geographical exposition of the words, "shall come out of
Zion," on the ground that in these words we have not to think of the
first coming of the Saviour alone, but the apostle extends to the second
coming with perfect propriety what the Old Testament prophecy generally
affirms with regard to the coming of Christ, and what had already been
verified at His first coming. This argument is extremely weak. Even if
one would or could insist upon the fact that, when rendering the words
וּבא (there will come for Zion a Redeemer), in [Isa
59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020.md), by ἥξει ἐκ Σιὼν ὁ ῥυόμενος (the
Redeemer will come out of Zion), the apostle designedly adopted the
expression ἐκ Σιών, it would by no means follow "that he meant the
material Zion or earthly Jerusalem to be regarded as the final site of
the New Testament revelation." For if the apostle used the expression
"come out of Zion," with reference to the second coming of the Lord,
because it had been verified at the first coming of Jesus, although
Jesus did not then come out of Zion, but out of Bethlehem, according to
the prophecy of [Mic 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md) (cf. [Mat
1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005).md), he cannot have meant the
material Mount Zion by ἐκ Σιών, but must have taken Zion on the
prophetico-typical sense of the central seat of the kingdom of God; a
meaning which it also has in such passages in the Psalms as [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md); 53:7, and [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md), which he appears to have had
floating before his mind. It was only by taking this view of Zion that
Paul could use ἐκ Σιών for the לציּון of Isaiah, without altering the
meaning of the prophecy, that the promised Redeemer would come for Zion,
i.e., for the citizens of Zion, the Israelites. The apostle, when making
this quotation from the prophets, had no more intention of giving any
information concerning the place where Christ would appear to the now
hardened Israel, and prove Himself to be the Redeemer, than concerning
the land in which the Israel scattered among the nations would be found
at the second coming of our Lord. And there is nothing whatever in the
New Testament to the effect that "the Lord will not appear again till He
has prepared both Israel and Zion for the scene of His reappearing"
(Hofmann, p. 97). All that Christ says is, that the gospel of the
kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a witness concerning all
nations, and then will the end come ([Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014).md). And if, in addition to this,
on His departing for ever from the temple, He exclaimed to the Jews who
rejected Him, "Your house will be left unto you desolate; for I say unto
you, Ye will not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed be he
that cometh in the name of the Lord" ([Mat
23:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038).md), all that He means is, that
He will not appear to them or come to them before they receive Him with
faith, "greet Him as the object of their longing expectation;" and by no
means that He will not come till they have been brought back from their
dispersion to Palestine and Jerusalem.

Even [Mat 27:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#053.md) and [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md), where Jerusalem is called the
holy city, do not furnish any tenable proof of this, because it is so
called, not with regard to any glorification to be looked for in the
future, but as the city in which the holiest events in the world's
history had taken place; just as Peter ([Pe2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018).md) designates the Mount of
Transfiguration the holy mount, with reference to that event, and not
with any anticipation of a future glorification of the mountain; and in
[Kg1 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#008.md) Horeb is called the Mount of
God, because in the olden time God revealed Himself there. "The old
Jerusalem is even now the holy city still to those who have directed
their hopeful eyes to the new Jerusalem alone" (Hengstenberg). This also
applies to the designation of the temple as the "holy place" in [Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015), by which Hofmann (p. 91.md) would
also, though erroneously, understand Jerusalem.

And the words of Christ in [Luk 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024.md),
that Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, ἄχρι πληρωθῶσιν
καιροὶ ἐθνῶν, cannot be used as furnishing a proof that the earthly
Jerusalem will be occupied by the converted Jews before or at the second
coming of the Lord. For if stress be laid upon the omission of the
article, and the appointed period be understood in such a manner as to
lead to the following rendering, viz.: "till Gentile periods shall be
fulfilled," i.e., "till certain periods which have been appointed to
Gentile nations for the accomplishment of this judgment of wrath from
God shall have elapsed" (Meyer), we may assume, with Hengstenberg (die
Juden und die christl. Kirche, 3 art.), that these times come to an end
when the overthrow of the might of the Gentiles is effected through the
judgment of God, and the Christian church takes their place; and we may
still further say with him, that "the treading down of Jerusalem by the
heathen, among whom, according to the Christian view, the Mahometans
also are to be reckoned, has ceased twice already, - namely, in the
reign of Constantine, and in the time of the Crusades, when a Christian
kingdom existed in Jerusalem. And what then happened, though only in a
transient way, will eventually take place again, and that definitively,
on the ground of this declaration of the Lord. Jerusalem will become the
possession of the Israel of the Christian church." If, on the other
hand, we adopt Hofmann's view (pp. 642, 643), that by καιροὶ ἐθνῶν we
are to understand the times of the nations, when the world belongs to
them, in accordance with [Dan 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md), in
support of which [Rev 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md) may also be
adduced, these times "come to an end when the people of God obtain the
supremacy;" and, according to this explanation, it is affirmed "that
this treading down of the holy city will not come to an end till the
filling up of the time, during which the world belongs to the nations,
and therefore not till the end of the present course of this world." But
if the treading down of Jerusalem by the Gentiles lasts till then, even
the converted Jews cannot recover possession of it at that time; for at
the end of the present course of this world the new creation of the
heaven and earth will take place, and the perfected church of Christ,
gathered out of Israel and the Gentile nations, will dwell in the
heavenly Jerusalem that has come down upon the new earth. - However,
therefore, we may interpret these words of the Lord, we are not taught
in [Luk 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024.md) any more than in [Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md) and [Mat
27:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#053.md), or [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md), that the earthly Jerusalem will
come into the possession of the converted Jews after its liberation from
the power of the Gentiles, that it will hold a central position in the
world, or that the temple will be erected there again.

And lastly, a decisive objection to these Jewish, millenarian hopes, and
at the same time to the literal interpretation of the prophetic
announcements of the restoration of Israel, is to be found in the fact
that the New Testament says nothing whatever concerning are building of
the Jerusalem temple and a restoration of the Levitical worship; but
that, on the contrary, it teaches in the most decided manner, that, with
the completion of the reconciliation of men with God through the
sacrifice of Christ upon Golgotha, the sacrificial and temple service of
the Levitical law was fulfilled and abolished (Heb 7-10), on the ground
of the declaration of Christ, that the hour cometh, and now is, when men
shall worship neither upon Gerizim nor at Jerusalem; but the true
worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth ([Joh
4:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021).md), in accordance with the
direction given by the apostle in [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md). But the prophets of the Old
Testament do not merely predict the return of the Israelites to their
own land, and their everlasting abode in that land under the rule of the
Messiah; but this prediction of theirs culminates in the promise that
Jehovah will establish His sanctuary, i.e., His temple, in the midst of
His redeemed people, and dwell there with them and above them for ever
([Eze 37:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027).md), and that all nations
will come to this sanctuary of the Lord upon Zion year by year, to
worship before the King Jehovah of hosts, and keep the Feast of
tabernacles ([Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md); cf. [Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023).md). If, then, the Jewish people
should receive Palestine again for its possession either at or after its
conversion to Christ, in accordance with the promise of God, the temple
with the Levitical sacrificial worship would of necessity be also
restored in Jerusalem. But if such a supposition is at variance with the
teaching of Christ and the apostles, so that this essential feature in
the prophetic picture of the future of the kingdom of God is not to be
understood literally, but spiritually or typically, it is an
unjustifiable inconsistency to adhere to the literal interpretation of
the prophecy concerning the return of Israel to Canaan, and to look for
the return of the Jewish people to Palestine, when it has come to
believe in Jesus Christ.
