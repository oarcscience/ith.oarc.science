### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 25:1</span></span>

The death of Samuel is inserted here, because it occurred at that time.
The fact that all Israel assembled together to his burial, and lamented
him, i.e., mourned for him, was a sign that his labours as a prophet
were recognised by the whole nation as a blessing for Israel. Since the
days of Moses and Joshua, no man had arisen to whom the covenant nation
owed so much as to Samuel, who has been justly called the reformer and
restorer of the theocracy. They buried him "in his house at Ramah." The
expression "his house" does not mean his burial-place or family tomb,
nor his native place, but the house in which he lived, with the court
belonging to it, where Samuel was placed in a tomb erected especially
for him. After the death of Samuel, David went down into the desert of
Paran, i.e., into the northern portion of the desert of Arabia, which
stretches up to the mountains of Judah (see at [Num
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012).md); most likely for no other
reason than because he could no longer find sufficient means of
subsistence for himself and his six hundred men in the desert of Judah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 25:2</span></span>

The following history of Nabal's folly, and of the wise and generous
behaviour of his pious and intelligent wife Abigail towards David, shows
how Jehovah watched over His servant David, and not only preserved him
from an act of passionate excitement, which might have endangered his
calling to be king of Israel, but turned the trouble into which he had
been brought into a source of prosperity and salvation.

[Sa1 25:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002.md)

At Maon, i.e., Main or the mountains of Judah (see at [Jos
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055).md), there lived a rich man (גּדול,
great through property and riches), who had his establishment at Carmel.
מעשׂה, work, occupation, then establishment, possessions (vid., [Exo
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#015).md). Carmel is not the promontory
of that name (Thenius), but the present Kurmul on the mountains of
Judah, scarcely half an hour's journey to the north-west of Maon (see at
[Jos 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055).md). This man possessed three
thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and was at the sheep-shearing at
Carmel. His name was Nabal (i.e., fool): this was hardly his proper
name, but was a surname by which he was popularly designated on account
of his folly. His wife Abigail was "of good understanding," i.e.,
intelligent, "and of beautiful figure;" but the husband was "harsh and
evil in his doings." He sprang from the family of Caleb. This is the
rendering adopted by the Chaldee and Vulgate, according to the Keri
כּלבּי. The Chethibh is to be read כּלבּו, "according to his heart;"
though the lxx (ἄνθρωπος κυνικός) and Josephus, as well as the Arabic
and Syriac, derive it from כּלב, and understand it as referring to the
dog-like, or shameless, character of the man.

[Sa1 25:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#004.md)

When David heard in the desert (cf. [Sa1
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001).md) that Nabal was shearing his
sheep, which was generally accompanied with a festal meal (see at [Gen
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#012).md), he sent ten young men up to
Carmel to him, and bade them wish him peace and prosperity in his name,
and having reminded him of the friendly services rendered to his
shepherds, solicit a present for himself and his people. לשׁלום לו שׁאל,
ask him after his welfare, i.e., greet him in a friendly manner (cf.
[Exo 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#007).md). The word לחי is obscure,
and was interpreted by the early translators merely according to
uncertain conjectures. The simplest explanation is apparently in vitam,
long life, understood as a wish in the sense of "good fortune to you"
(Luther, Maurer, etc.); although the word חי in the singular can only be
shown to have the meaning life in connection with the formula used in
oaths, נפשׁך חי, etc. But even if חי must be taken as an adjective, it
is impossible to explain לחי in any other way than as an elliptical
exclamation meaning "good fortune to the living man." For the idea that
the word is to be connected with אמרתּם, "say to the living man," i.e.,
to the man if still alive, is overthrown by the fact that David had no
doubt that Nabal was still living. The words which follow are also to be
understood as a wish, "May thou and thy house, and all that is thine, be
well!" After this salutation they were to proceed with the object of
their visit: "And now I have heard that thou hast sheep-shearers. Now
thy shepherds have been with us; we have done them no harm (הכלים, as in
[Jdg 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md) : on the form, see Ges. 53,
3, Anm. 6), and nothing was missed by them so long as they were in
Carmel." When living in the desert, David's men had associated with the
shepherds of Nabal, rendered them various services, and protected them
and their flocks against the southern inhabitants of the desert (the
Bedouin Arabs); in return for which they may have given them food and
information. Thus David proved himself a protector of his people even in
his banishment. וימצאוּ, "so may the young men (those sent by David)
find favour in thine eyes! for we have come to a good (i.e., a festive)
day. Give, I pray, what thy hand findeth (i.e., as much as thou canst)
to thy servant, and to thy son David." With the expression "thy son"
David claims Nabal's fatherly goodwill. So far as the fact itself is
concerned, "on such a festive occasion near a town or village even in
our own time, an Arab sheikh of the neighbouring desert would hardly
fail to put in a word either in person or by message; and his message
both in form and substance would be only the transcript of that of
David" (Robinson, Palestine, p. 201).

[Sa1 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#009.md)

David's messengers delivered their message to Nabal, ויּנוּחוּ, "and sat
down," sc., awaiting the fulfilment of their request. The rendering
given by the Chaldee (פּסקוּ, cessaverunt loqui) and the Vulgate
(siluerunt) is less suitable, and cannot be philologically sustained.
The Septuagint, on the other hand, has καὶ ἀνεπήδησε, "and he (Nabal)
sprang up," as if the translators had read ויּקם (vid., lxx at [Sa1
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#034).md). This rendering, according to
which the word belongs to the following clause, gives a very appropriate
sense, if only, supposing that ויּקם really did stand in the text, the
origin and general adoption of ויּנוּחוּ could in any way be explained.

[Sa1 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#010.md)

Nabal refused the petitioners in the most churlish manner: "Who is
David? who the son of Jesse?" i.e., what have I to do with David? "There
by many servants now-a-days who tear away every one from his master."
Thus, in order to justify his own covetousness, he set down David as a
vagrant who had run away from his master.

[Sa1 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#011.md)

"And I should take my bread and my water (i.e., my food and drink), and
my cattle, ... and give them to men whom I do not know whence they are?"
ולקחתּי is a perfect with vav consec., and the whole sentence is to be
taken as a question.

[Sa1 25:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#012.md)

The messengers returned to David with this answer. The churlish reply
could not fail to excite his anger. He therefore commanded his people to
gird on the sword, and started with 400 men to take vengeance upon
Nabal, whilst 200 remained behind with the things.

1 Samuel 25:14-31

However intelligible David's wrath may appear in the situation in which
he was placed, it was not right before God, but a sudden burst of sinful
passion, which was unseemly in a servant of God. By carrying out his
intention, he would have sinned against the Lord and against His people.
But the Lord preserved him from this sin by the fact that, just at the
right time, Abigail, the intelligent and pious wife of Nabal, heard of
the affair, and was able to appease the wrath of David by her immediate
and kindly interposition.

[Sa1 25:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#014.md)

Abigail heard from one of (Nabal's) servants what had taken place (בּרך,
to wish any one prosperity and health, i.e., to salute, as in [Sa1
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#010.md); and יעט, from עיט, to speak
wrathfully: on the form, see at [Sa1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#019.md) and [Sa1
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#032).md), and also what had been
praiseworthy in the behaviour of David's men towards Nabal's shepherds;
how they had not only done them no injury, had not robbed them of
anything, but had defended them all the while. "They were a wall (i.e.,
a firm protection) round us by night and by day, as long as we were with
them feeding the sheep," i.e., a wall of defence against attacks from
the Bedouins living in the desert.

[Sa1 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#017.md)

"And now," continued the servant, "know and see what thou doest; for
evil is determined (cf. [Sa1 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#009).md)
against our master and all his house: and he (Nabal) is a wicked man,
that one cannot address him."

[Sa1 25:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#018.md)

Then Abigail took as quickly as possible a bountiful present of
provisions, - two hundred loaves, two bottles of wine, five prepared
(i.e., slaughtered) sheep (עשׁוּות, a rare form for עשׂוּית: see Ewald,
189, a.), five seahs (an ephah and two-thirds) of roasted grains (Kali:
see [Sa1 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#017).md), a hundred צמּקים
(dried grapes, i.e., raisin-cakes: Ital. simmuki), and two hundred
fig-cakes (consisting of pressed figs joined together), - and sent these
gifts laden upon asses on before her to meet David whilst she herself
followed behind to appease his anger by coming to meet him in a friendly
manner, but without saying a word to her husband about what she intended
to do.

[Sa1 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#020.md)

When she came down riding upon the ass by a hidden part of the mountain,
David and his men came to meet her, so that she lighted upon them. ההר
סתר, a hidden part of the mountain, was probably a hollow between two
peaks of a mountain. This would explain the use of the word ירד, to come
down, with reference both to Abigail, who approached on the one side,
and David, who came on the other.

[Sa1 25:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#021.md)

[Sa1 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#021.md) and [Sa1
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022.md) contain a circumstantial clause
introduced parenthetically to explain what follows: but David had said,
Only for deception (i.e., for no other purpose than to be deceived in my
expectation) have I defended all that belongs to this man (Nabal) in the
desert, so that nothing of his was missed, and (for) he hath repaid me
evil for good. God do so to the enemies of David, if I leave, etc.;
i.e., "as truly as God will punish the enemies of David, so certainly
will I not leave till the morning light, of all that belongeth to him,
one that pisseth against the wall." This oath, in which the punishment
of God is not called down upon the swearer himself (God do so to me), as
it generally is, but upon the enemies of David, is analogous to that in
[Sa1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017.md), where punishment is
threatened upon the person addressed, who is there made to swear; except
that here, as the oath could not be uttered in the ears of the person
addressed, upon whom it was to fall, the enemies generally are mentioned
instead of "to thee." There is no doubt, therefore, as to the
correctness of the text. The substance of this imprecation may be
explained from the fact that David is so full of the consciousness of
fighting and suffering for the cause of the kingdom of God, that he
discerns in the insult heaped upon him by Nabal an act of hostility to
the Lord and the cause of His kingdom. The phrase בּקיר משׁתּין, mingens
in parietem, is only met with in passages which speak of the destruction
of a family or household to the very last man (viz., besides this
passage, [Kg1 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010.md); [Kg1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#011.md); [Kg1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021.md); [Kg2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#008).md), and neither refers primarily to
dogs, as Ephraem Syrus, Juda ben Karish, and others maintain; nor to the
lowest class of men, as Winer, Maurer, and others imagine; nor to little
boys, as L. de Dieu, Gesenius, etc., suppose; but, as we may see from
the explanatory clause appended to [Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010.md); [Kg1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021.md); [Kg2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#008.md), to every male (quemcumque masculi
generis hominem: vid., Bochart, Hieroz. i. pp. 776ff., and Rdiger on
Ges. Thes. pp. 1397-8).

[Sa1 25:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#023.md)

[Sa1 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#023.md) is connected with [Sa1
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#020.md). When Abigail saw David, she
descended hastily from the ass, fell upon her face before him, bowed to
the ground, and fell at his feet, saying, "Upon me, me, my lord, be the
guilt; allow thy handmaid to reveal the thing to thee." She takes the
guilt upon herself, because she hopes that David will not avenge it upon
her.

[Sa1 25:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025.md)

She prayed that David would take no notice of Nabal, for he was what his
name declared - a fool, and folly in him; but she (Abigail) had not seen
the messengers of David. "The prudent woman uses a good argument; for a
wise man should pardon a fool" (Seb. Schmidt). She then endeavours to
bring David to a friendly state of mind by three arguments, introduced
with ועתּה ([Sa1 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#026.md), [Sa1
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#027).md), before asking for forgiveness
([Sa1 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#028).md). She first of all pointed
to the leadings of God, by which David had been kept from committing
murder through her coming to meet him.

(Note: "She founds her argument upon their meeting, which was so
marvellously seasonable, that it might be easily and truly gathered from
this fact that it had taken place through the providence of God; i.e.,
And now, because I meet thee so seasonably, do thou piously acknowledge
with me the providence of God, which has so arranged all this, that
innocent blood might not by change be shed by thee." - Seb. Schmidt.)

"As truly as Jehovah liveth, and by the life of thy soul! yea, the Lord
hath kept thee, that thou camest not into blood-guiltiness, and thy hand
helped thee" (i.e., and with thy hand thou didst procure thyself help).
אשׁר, introducing her words, as in [Sa1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#020.md), lit. "as truly as thou livest,
(so true is it) that," etc. In the second place, she points to the fact
that God is the avenger of the wicked, by expressing the wish that all
the enemies of David may become fools like Nabal; in connection with
which it must be observed, in order to understand her words fully, that,
according to the Old Testament representation, folly is a correlate of
ungodliness, which inevitably brings down punishment.

(Note: Seb. Schmidt has justly observed, that "she reminds David of the
promise of God. Not that she prophesies, but that she has gathered it
from the general promises of the word of God. The promise referred to
is, that whoever does good to his enemies, and takes no vengeance upon
them, God himself will avenge him upon his enemies; according to the
saying, Vengeance is mine, I will repay. And this is what Abigail says:
And now thine enemies shall be as Nabal.")

The predicate to the sentence "and they that seek evil to my lord" must
be supplied from the preceding words, viz., "may they become just such
fools."

[Sa1 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#027.md)

It is only in the third line that she finally mentions the present, but
in such a manner that she does not offer it directly to David, but
describes it as a gift for the men in his train. "And now this blessing
(בּרכה here and [Sa1 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026.md), as in [Gen
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#011.md) : cf. ἡ εὐλογία, [Co2
9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005).md), which thine handmaid hath
brought, let it be given to the young men in my lord's train" (lit. "at
the feet of:" cf. [Exo 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008.md); [Jdg
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010), etc..md).

[Sa1 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#028.md)

The shrewd and pious woman supports her prayer for forgiveness of the
wrong, which she takes upon herself, by promises of the rich blessing
with which the Lord would recompense David. She thereby gives such clear
and distinct expression to her firm belief in the divine election of
David as king of Israel, that her words almost amount to prophecy: "For
Jehovah will make my lord a lasting house (cf. [Sa1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035.md); and for the fact itself, [Sa2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008.md)., where the Lord confirms this
pious wish by His own promises to David himself); for my lord fighteth
the wars of Jehovah (vid., [Sa1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#017).md), and evil is not discovered in
thee thy whole life long." רעה, evil, i.e., misfortune, mischief; for
the thought that he might also be preserved from wrong-doing is not
expressed till [Sa1 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#031.md). "All thy
days," lit. "from thy days," i.e., from the beginning of thy life.

[Sa1 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#029.md)

"And should any one rise up to pursue thee, ... the soul of my lord will
be bound up in the bundle of the living with the Lord thy God." The
metaphor is taken from the custom of binding up valuable things in a
bundle, to prevent their being injured. The words do not refer primarily
to eternal life with God in heaven, but only to the safe preservation of
the righteous on this earth in the grace and fellowship of the Lord. But
whoever is so hidden in the gracious fellowship of the Lord in this
life, that no enemy can harm him or injure his life, the Lord will not
allow to perish, even though temporal death should come, but will then
receive him into eternal life. "But the soul of thine enemies, He will
hurl away in the cup of the sling." "The cup (caph: cf. [Gen
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026).md) of the sling" was the cavity in
which the stone was placed for the purpose of hurling.

[Sa1 25:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#030.md)

Abigail concluded her intercession with the assurance that the
forgiveness of Nabal's act would be no occasion of anguish of heart to
David when he should have become prince over Israel, on account of his
having shed innocent blood and helped himself, and also with the hope
that he would remember her. From the words, "When Jehovah shall do to my
lord according to all the good that He hath spoken concerning him, and
shall make thee prince over Israel," it appears to follow that Abigail
had received certain information of the anointing of David, and his
designation to be the future king, probably through Samuel, or one of
the pupils of the prophets. There is nothing to preclude this
assumption, even if it cannot be historically sustained. Abigail
manifests such an advance and maturity in the life of faith, as could
only have been derived from intercourse with prophets. It is expressly
stated with regard to Elijah and Elisha, that at certain times the pious
assembled together around the prophets. What prevents us from assuming
the same with regard to Samuel? The absence of any distinct testimony to
that effect is amply compensated for by the brief, and for the most part
casual, notices that are given of the influence which Samuel exerted
upon all Israel.

[Sa1 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#031.md)

[Sa1 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#031.md) introduces the apodosis to
[Sa1 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#030.md) : "So will this (i.e., the
forgiveness of Nabal's folly, for which she had prayed in [Sa1
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#028).md) not be a stumbling-block
(pukah: anything in the road which causes a person to stagger) and
anguish of heart (i.e., conscientious scruple) to thee, and shedding
innocent blood, and that my lord helps himself. וגו ולשׁפּך is perfectly
parallel to וגו לפוּקה, and cannot be taken as subordinate, as it is in
the Vulgate, etc., in the sense of "that thou hast not shed blood
innocently," etc. In this rendering not only is the vav cop. overlooked,
but "not" is arbitrarily interpolated, to obtain a suitable sense, which
the Vulgate rendering, quod effuderis sanguinem innoxiam, does not give.
והיטיב is to be taken conditionally: "and if Jehovah shall deal well
with my lord, then," etc.

[Sa1 25:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#032.md)

These words could not fail to appease David's wrath. In his reply he
praised the Lord for having sent Abigail to meet him ([Sa1
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#032).md), and then congratulated Abigail
upon her understanding and her actions, that she had kept him from
bloodshed ([Sa1 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#033).md); otherwise he
would certainly have carried out the revenge which he had resolved to
take upon Nabal ([Sa1 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#034).md). ואוּלם
is strongly adversative: nevertheless. מהרע, inf. constr. Hiph. of רעע.
כּי, ὅτι, introduces the substance of the affirmation, and is repeated
before the oath: אם כּי ... לוּלי כּי, (that) if thou hadst not, etc.,
(that) truly there would not have been left (cf. [Sa2
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#027).md). The very unusual form תּבאתי,
an imperfect with the termination of the perfect, might indeed possibly
be a copyist's error for תּבאי (Olsh. Gr. pp. 452, 525), but in all
probability it is only an intensified form of the second pers. fem.
imperf., like תּבואתה ([Deu 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#016.md); cf.
Ewald, 191, c.).

[Sa1 25:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#035.md)

David then received the gifts brought for him, and bade Abigail return
to her house, with the assurance that he had granted her request for
pardon. פּנים נשׂא, as in [Gen 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#021.md),
etc.

[Sa1 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#036.md)

When Abigail returned home, she found her husband at a great feast, like
a king's feast, very merry (עליו, "therewith," refers to משׁתּה: cf.
[Pro 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#030).md), and drunken above
measure, so that she told him nothing of what had occurred until the
break of day.

[Sa1 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#037.md)

Then, "when the wine had gone from Nabal," i.e., when he had become
sober, she related the matter to him; whereat he was so terrified, that
he was smitten with a stroke. This is the meaning of the words, "his
heart died within him, and it became as stone." The cause of it was not
his anger at the loss he had sustained, or merely his alarm at the
danger to which he had been exposed, and which he did not believe to be
over yet, but also his vexation that his wife should have made him
humble himself in such a manner; for he is described as a hard, i.e., an
unbending, self-willed man.

[Sa1 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#038.md)

About ten days later the Lord smote him so that he died, i.e., the Lord
put an end to his life by a second stroke.

[Sa1 25:39-44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#039.md)

When David heard of Nabal's death, he praised Jehovah that He had
avenged his shame upon Nabal, and held him back from self-revenge. וגו
רב עשׁר, "who hath pleaded the cause of my reproach (the disgrace
inflicted upon me) against Nabal." "Against Nabal" does not belong to
"my reproach," but to "pleaded the cause." The construction of ריב with
מן is a pregnant one, to fight (and deliver) out of the power of a
person (vid., [Psa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001).md); whereas here
the fundamental idea is that of taking vengeance upon a person.

[Sa1 25:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#040.md)

He then sent messengers to Abigail, and conveyed to her his wish to
marry her, to which she consented without hesitation. With deep
reverence she said to the messengers ([Sa1
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#041).md), "Behold, thy handmaid as
servant (i.e., is ready to become thy servant) to wash the feet of the
servants of my lord;" i.e., in the obsequious style of the East, "I am
ready to perform the humblest possible services for thee."

[Sa1 25:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#042.md)

She then rose up hastily, and went after the messengers to David with
five damsels in her train, and became his wife.

[Sa1 25:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#043.md)

The historian appends a few notices here concerning David's wives: "And
David had taken Ahinoam from Jezreel; thus they also both became his
wives." The expression "also" points to David's marriage with Michal,
the daughter of Saul ([Sa1 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#028).md).
Jezreel is not the city of that name in the tribe of Issachar ([Jos
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018).md), but the one in the mountains
of Judah ([Jos 15:56](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#056).md).

[Sa1 25:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#044.md)

But Saul had taken his daughter Michal away from David, and given her to
Palti of Gallim. Palti is called Paltiel in [Sa2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#015.md). According to [Isa
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030.md), Gallim was a place between
Gibeah of Saul and Jerusalem. Valentiner supposes it to be the hill to
the south of Tuleil el Phul (Gibeah of Saul) called Khirbet el Jisr.
After the death of Saul, however, David persuaded Ishbosheth to give him
Michal back again (see [Sa2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#014)..md).
