### [Leviticus Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 15:1</span></span>

The Uncleanness of Secretions. - These include (1) a running issue from
a man ([Lev 15:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002)); (2.md) involuntary
emission of seed ([Lev 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#016.md), [Lev
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#017).md), and the emission of seed in
sexual intercourse ([Lev 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#018)); (3.md)
the monthly period of a woman ([Lev
15:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019)); (4.md) a diseased issue of
blood from a woman ([Lev 15:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#025).md).
They consist, therefore, of two diseased and two natural secretions from
the organs of generation.

[Leviticus 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 15:2</span></span>

The running issue from a man is not described with sufficient clearness
for us to be able to determine with certainty what disease is referred
to: "if a man becomes flowing out of his flesh, he is unclean in his
flux." That even here the term flesh is not a euphemism for the organ of
generation, as is frequently assumed, is evident from [Lev
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013.md), "he shall wash his clothes and
bathe his flesh in water," when compared with [Lev
16:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#023.md), [Lev
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#028.md), etc., where flesh cannot
possibly have any such meaning. The "flesh" is the body as in [Lev
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#007.md), "whoever touches the flesh of
him that hath the issue," as compared with [Lev
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019.md), "whosoever toucheth her." At
the same time, the agreement between the law relating to the man with an
issue and that concerning the woman with an issue ([Lev
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019), "her issue in her flesh".md)
points unmistakeably to a secretion from the sexual organs. Only the
seat of the disease is not more closely defined. The issue of the man is
not a hemorrhoidal disease, for nothing is said about a flow of blood;
still less is it a syphilitic suppuration (gonorrhaea virulenta), for
the occurrence of this at all in antiquity is very questionable; but it
is either a diseased flow of semen (gonorrhaea), i.e., an involuntary
flow drop by drop arising from weakness of the organ, as Jerome and the
Rabbins assume, or more probably, simply blenorrhaea urethrae, a
discharge of mucus arising from a catarrhal affection of the mucous
membrane of the urethra (urethritis). The participle זב יהיה is
expressive of continued duration. In [Lev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#003.md) the uncleanness is still more
closely defined: "whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh
closes before his issue," i.e., whether the member lets the matter flow
out or by closing retains it, "it is his uncleanness," i.e., in the
latter case as well as the former it is uncleanness to him, he is
unclean. For the "closing" is only a temporary obstruction, brought
about by some particular circumstance.

[Leviticus 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 15:4</span></span>

Every bed upon which he lay, and everything upon which he sat, was
defiled in consequence; also every one who touched his bed ([Lev
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#005).md), or sat upon it ([Lev
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#006).md), or touched his flesh, i.e., his
body ([Lev 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#007).md), was unclean, and had
to bathe himself and wash his clothes in consequence.

[Leviticus 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 15:9</span></span>

The conveyance in which such a man rode was also unclean, as well as
everything under him; and whoever touched them was defiled till the
evening, and the person who carried them was to wash his clothes and
bathe himself.

[Leviticus 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 15:11</span></span>

This also applied to every one whom the man with an issue might touch,
without first rinsing his hands in water.

[Leviticus 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 15:12</span></span>

Vessels that he had touched were to be broken to pieces if they were of
earthenware, and rinsed with water if they were of wood, for the reasons
explained in [Lev 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#033.md) and [Lev
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#021.md).

[Leviticus 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 15:13</span></span>

When he was cleansed, i.e., recovered from his issue, he was to wait
seven days with regard to his purification, and then wash his clothes
and bathe his body in fresh water, and be clean. On the eighth day he
was to bring two turtle-doves or young pigeons, in order that the priest
might prepare one as a sin-offering and the other as a burnt-offering,
and make an atonement for him before the Lord for his issue.

[Leviticus 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 15:16</span></span>

Involuntary emission of seed. - This defiled for the whole of the day,
not only the man himself, but any garment or skin upon which any of it
had come, and required for purification that the whole body should be
bathed, and the polluted things washed.

[Leviticus 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 15:18</span></span>

Sexual connection. "If a man lie with a woman with the emission of seed,
both shall be unclean till the evening, and bathe themselves in water."
Consequently it was not the concubitus as such which defiled, as many
erroneously suppose, but the emission of seed in the coitus. This
explains the law and custom, of abstaining from conjugal intercourse
during the preparation for acts of divine worship, or the performance of
the same ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Sa1
21:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#005.md); [Sa2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#004).md), in which many other nations
resembled the Israelites. (For proofs see Leyrer's article in Herzog's
Cyclopaedia, and Knobel in loco, though the latter is wrong in supposing
that conjugal intercourse itself defiled.)

[Leviticus 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 15:19</span></span>

The menses of a woman. - "If a woman have an issue, (if) blood is her
issue in her flesh, she shall be seven days in her uncleanness." As the
discharge does not last as a rule more than four or five days, the
period of seven days was fixed on account of the significance of the
number seven. In this condition she rendered every one who touched her
unclean ([Lev 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019).md), everything upon
which she lay or sat ([Lev 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#020).md),
every one who touched her bed or whatever she sat upon ([Lev
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#021.md), [Lev
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#022).md), also any one who touched the
blood upon her bed or seat ([Lev
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#023.md), where הוּא and בּו are to be
referred to דּם); and they remained unclean till the evening, when they
had to wash their clothes and bathe themselves.

[Leviticus 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 15:24</span></span>

If a man lay with her and her uncleanness came upon him, he became
unclean for seven days, and the bed upon which he lay became unclean as
well. The meaning cannot be merely if he lie upon the same bed with her,
but if he have conjugal intercourse, as is evident from [Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018.md) and [Num
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#013.md) (cf. [Gen
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#010.md); [Gen
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002.md); [Gen
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022.md); [Sa1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022).md). It cannot be adduced as an
objection to this explanation, which is the only admissible one, that
according to [Lev 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019.md) and [Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018.md) intercourse with a woman during
her menses was an accursed crime, to be punished by extermination. For
the law in [Lev 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018.md) refers partly to
conjugal intercourse during the hemorrhage of a woman after child-birth,
as the similarity of the words in [Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018.md) and [Lev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#007) (דּמיה מקור.md) clearly proves, and
to the case of a man attempting cohabitation with a woman during her
menstruation. The verse before us, on the contrary, refers simply to the
possibility of menstruation commencing during the act of conjugal
intercourse, when the man would be involuntarily defiled through the
unexpected uncleanness of the woman.

[Leviticus 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 15:25</span></span>

Diseased issue from a woman. - If an issue of blood in a woman flowed
many days away from (not in) the time of her monthly uncleanness, or if
it flowed beyond her monthly uncleanness, she was to be unclean as long
as her unclean issue continued, just as in the days of her monthly
uncleanness, and she defiled her couch as well as everything upon which
she sat, as in the other case, also every one who touched either her or
these things.

[Leviticus 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 15:28</span></span>

After the issue had ceased, she was to purify herself like the man with
an issue, as described in [Lev
15:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013.md). - Obedience to these
commands is urged in [Lev 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#031.md) :
"Cause that the children of Israel free themselves from their
uncleanness, that they die not through their uncleanness, by defiling My
dwelling in the midst of them." הזּיר, Hiphil, to cause that a person
keeps aloof from anything, or loosens himself from it, from נזר, Niphal
to separate one's self, signifies here deliverance from the state of
uncleanness, purification from it. Continuance in it was followed by
death, not merely in the particular instance in which an unclean man
ventured to enter the sanctuary, but as a general fact, because
uncleanness as irreconcilable with the calling of Israel to be a holy
nation, in the midst of which Jehovah the Holy One had His
dwelling-place ([Lev 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044).md), and
continuance in uncleanness without the prescribed purification was a
disregard of the holiness of Jehovah, and involved rebellion against Him
and His ordinances of grace.

[Leviticus 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 15:32</span></span>

Concluding formula. The words, "him that lieth with her that is
unclean," are more general than the expression, "lie with her," in [Lev
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#024.md), and involve not only
intercourse with an unclean woman, but lying by her side upon one and
the same bed.
