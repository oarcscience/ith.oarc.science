The Oracle Concerning Moab - Isaiah 15-16

So far as the surrounding nations were concerned, the monarchy of Israel
commenced with victory and glory. Saul punished them all severely for
their previous offences against Israel ([Sa1
14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047).md), and the Moabites along with
the rest. The latter were completely subdued by David ([Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002).md). After the division of the
kingdom, the northern kingdom took possession of Joab. The Moabites paid
tribute from their flocks to Samaria. But when Ahab died, Mesha the king
of Moab refused this tribute ([Kg2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md); [Kg2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004)..md). Ahaziah of Israel let this
refusal pass. In the meantime, the Moabites formed an alliance with
other nations, and invaded Judah. But the allies destroyed one another,
and Jehoshaphat celebrated in the valley of Berachah the victory which
he had gained without a battle, and which is commemorated in several
psalms. And when Jehoram the king of Israel attempted to subjugate Moab
again, Jehoshaphat made common cause with him. And the Moabites were
defeated; but the fortress, the Moabitish Kir, which was situated upon a
steep and lofty chalk rock, remained standing still. The interminable
contests of the northern kingdom with the Syrians rendered it quite
impossible to maintain either Moab itself, or the land to the east of
the Jordan in general. During the reign of Jehu, the latter, in all its
length and breadth, even as far south as the Arnon, was taken by the
Syrians ([Kg2 10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032).md). The tribes
that were now no longer tributary to the kingdom of Israel oppressed the
Israelitish population, and avenged upon the crippled kingdom the loss
of their independence. Jeroboam II, as the prophet Jonah had foretold
([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md), was the first to
reconquer the territory of Israel from Hamath to the Dead Sea. It is not
indeed expressly stated that he subjugated Moab again; but as Moabitish
bands had disturbed even the country on this side under his predecessor
Joash ([Kg2 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020).md), it may be supposed
that he also attempted to keep Moab within bounds. If the Moabites, as
is very probable, had extended their territory northwards beyond the
Arnon, the war with Joab was inevitable. Moreover, under Jeroboam II on
the one hand, and Uzziah-Jotham on the other, we read nothing about the
Moabites rising; but, on the contrary, such notices as those contained
in [Ch1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#017.md) and [Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010.md), show that they kept themselves
quiet. But the application made by Ahaz to Assyria called up the
hostility of Joab and the neighbouring nations again. Tiglath-pileser
repeated what the Syrians had done before. He took possession of the
northern part of the land on this side, and the whole of the land on the
other side, and depopulated them. This furnished an opportunity for the
Moabites to re-establish themselves in their original settlements to the
north of the Arnon. And this was how it stood at the time when Isaiah
prophesied. The calamity which befel them came from the north, and
therefore fell chiefly and primarily upon the country to the north of
the Arnon, which the Moabites had taken possession of but a short time
before, after it had been peopled for a long time by the tribes of
Reuben and Gad.

[Isaiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 15:1</span></span>

There is no other prophecy in the book of Isaiah in which the heart of
the prophet is so painfully affected by what his mind sees, and his
mouth is obliged to prophesy. All that he predicts evokes his deepest
sympathy, just as if he himself belonged to the unfortunate nation to
which he is called to be a messenger of woe. He commences with an
utterance of amazement. "Oracle concerning Moab! for in a night 'Ar-Moab
is laid waste, destroyed; for in a night Kir-Moab is laid waste,
destroyed." The ci (for) is explanatory in both instances, and not
simply affirmative, or, as Knobel maintains, recitative, and therefore
unmeaning. The prophet justifies the peculiar heading to his prophecy
from the horrible vision given him to see, and takes us at once into the
very heart of the vision, as in [Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md); [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md). 'Ar Moab (in which 'Ar is
Moabitish for 'Ir; cf., [Jer 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md),
where we find 'Ai written instead of 'Ar, which we should naturally
expect) is the name of the capital of Moab (Grecized, Areopolis), which
was situated to the south of the Arnon, at present a large field of
ruins, with a village of the name of Rabba. Kir Moab (in which Kir is
the Moabitish for Kiryah) was the chief fortress of Joab, which was
situated to the south-east of Ar, the present Kerek, where there is
still a town with a fortification upon a rock, which can be seen from
Jerusalem with a telescope on a clear day, and forms so thoroughly one
mass with the rock, that in 1834, when Ibrahim Pasha resolved to pull it
down, he was obliged to relinquish the project. The identity of Kir and
Kerek is unquestionable, but that of Ar and Rabba has been disputed; and
on the ground of [Num 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#036.md), where it
seems to be placed nearer the Arnon, it has been transposed to the ruins
on the pasture land at the confluence of the Lejm and Mujib (= "the city
that is by the river" in [Deu 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md) and
[Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md), [Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016.md) : see Comm. on [Num
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015).md) - a conjecture which has this
against it, that the name Areopolis, which has been formed from Ar, is
attached to the "metropolis civitas Ar," which was called Rabba as the
metropolis, and of which Jerome relates (on the passage before us), as
an event associated with his own childhood, that it was then destroyed
by an earthquake (probably in 342). The two names of the cities are used
as masculine here, like Dammesek in [Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md), and Tzor in [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md), though it cannot therefore be
said, as at [Mic 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md), that the city
stands for the inhabitants (Ges. Lehrgebude, p. 469). "In a night" (ליל
absolute, as in [Isa 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md), not
construct, which would give an illogical assertion, as shuddad and
nidmâh are almost coincident, so far as the sense is concerned) the two
pillars of the strength of Moab are overthrown. In the space of a night,
and therefore very suddenly ([Isa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#014).md), Moab is destroyed. The prophet
repeats twice what it would have been quite sufficient to say once, just
as if he had been condemned to keep his eye fixed upon the awful
spectacle (on the asyndeton, see at [Isa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009.md); and on the anadiplosis, [Isa
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008.md); [Isa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md); [Isa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md); [Isa
17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012).md). His first sensation is that
of horror.

[Isaiah 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 15:2</span></span>

But just as horror, when once it begins to reflect, is dissolved in
tears, the thunder-claps in [Isa 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md)
are followed by universal weeping and lamentation. "They go up to the
temple-house and Dibon, up to the heights to weep: upon Nebo and upon
Medebah of Moab there is weeping: on all heads baldness, every beard is
mutilated. In the markets of Moab they gird themselves with sackcloth;
on the roofs of the land, and in its streets, everything wails, melting
into tears. Heshbon cries, and 'Elle; even to Jahaz they hear their
howling; even the armed men of Moab break out into mourning thereat; its
soul trembles within it." The people (the subject to עלה) ascend the
mountain with the temple of Chemosh, the central sanctuary of the land.
This temple is called hab-baith, though not that there was a Moabitish
town or village with some such name as Bth-Diblathaim ([Jer
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#022).md), as Knobel supposes. Dibon,
which lay above the Arnon (Wady Mujib), like all the places mentioned in
[Isa 15:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002.md), at present a heap of
ruins, a short hour to the north of the central Arnon, in the splendid
plain of el-Chura, had consecrated heights in the neighbourhood (cf.,
[Jos 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017.md); [Num
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041).md), and therefore would turn to
them. Moab mourns upon Nebo and Medebah; ייליל, for which we find יהיליל
in [Isa 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md), is written intentionally
for a double preformative, instead of ייליל (compare the similar forms
in [Job 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#021.md); [Psa
138:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006), and Ges. 70, Anm..md). על is to be
taken in a local sense, as Hendewerk, Drechsler, and Knobel have
rendered it. For Nebo was probably a place situated upon a height on the
mountain of that name, towards the south-east of Heshbon (the ruins of
Nabo, Nabau, mentioned in the Onom.); and Medebah (still a heap of ruins
bearing the same name) stood upon a round hill about two hours to the
south-east of Heshbon. According to Jerome, there was an image of
Chemosh in Nebo; and among the ruins of Madeba, Seetzen discovered the
foundations of a strange temple. There follows here a description of the
expressions of pain. Instead of the usual ראשיו, we read ראשיו here. And
instead of gedu‛âh (abscissae), Jeremiah ([Jer
48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037).md) has, according to his usual
style, geru'âh (decurtatae), with the simple alteration of a single
letter.

(Note: At the same time, the Masora on this passage before us is for
geru‛ah with Resh, and we also find this reading in Nissel, Clodius,
Jablonsky, and in earlier editions; whilst Sonc. 1486, Ven. 1521, and
others, have gedu‛ah, with Daleth.)

All runs down with weeping (culloh, written as in [Isa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md); in [Isa
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008.md), [Isa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#016), we have cullo instead.md). In other
cases it is the eyes that are said to run down in tears, streams, or
water-brooks; but here, by a still bolder metonymy, the whole man is
said to flow down to the ground, as if melting in a stream of tears.
Heshbon and Elale are still visible in their ruins, which lie only half
an hour apart upon their separate hills and are still called by the
names Husban and el-Al. They were both situated upon hills which
commanded an extensive prospect. And there the cry of woe created an
echo which was audible as far as Jahaz (Jahza), the city where the king
of Heshbon offered battle to Israel in the time of Moses ([Deu
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#032).md). The general mourning was so
great, that even the armed men, i.e., the heroes ([Jer
48:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#041).md) of Moab, were seized with
despair, and cried out in their anguish (the same figure as in [Isa
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007).md). על־כן(, thereat, namely on
account of this universal lamentation. Thus the lamentation was
universal, without exception. Naphsho (his soul) refers to Moab as a
whole nation. The soul of Moab trembles in all the limbs of the national
body; ירעה (forming a play upon the sound with יריעוּ), an Arabic word,
and in יריעה a Hebrew word also, signifies tremere, huc illuc agitari -
an explanation which we prefer, with Rosenmller and Gesenius, to the
idea that ירע is a secondary verb to רעע, fut. ירע. לו is an ethical
dative (as in [Psa 120:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#006.md) and [Psa
123:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004).md), throwing the action or the
pathos inwardly (see Psychology, p. 152). The heart of the prophet
participates in this pain with which Moab is agitated throughout; for,
as Rashi observes, it is just in this that the prophets of Israel were
distinguished from heathen prophets, such as Balaam for example, viz.,
that the calamities which they announced to the nations went to their
own heart (compare [Isa 21:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003.md), with
[Isa 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 15:5</span></span>

The difficult words in which the prophet expresses this sympathy we
render as follows: "My heart, towards Moab it crieth out; its bolts
reached to Zoar, the three-year-old heifer." The Lamed in l'Moab is the
same both here and in [Isa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011.md) as in
[Isa 14:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008.md), viz., "turned toward
Moab." Moab, which was masculine in [Isa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004.md), is feminine here. We may infer
from this that עד־צער בריחה is a statement which concerns Moab as a
land. Now, berichim signifies the bolts in every other passage in which
it occurs; and it is possible to speak of the bolts of a land with just
as much propriety as in [Lam 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009.md) and
[Jer 51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030.md) (cf., [Jon
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#007).md) of the bolts of a city. And the
statement that the bolts of this land went to Zoar is also a very
appropriate one, for Kir Moab and Zoar formed the southern fortified
girdle of the land; and Zoar, on the south-western tongue of land which
runs into the Dead Sea, was the uttermost fortress of Moab, looking over
towards Judah; and in its depressed situation below the level of the sea
it formed, as it were, the opposite pole of Kir Moab, the highest point
in the high land itself. Hence we agree with Jerome, who adopts the
rendering vectes ejus usque ad Segor, whereas all the modern translators
have taken the word in the sense of fugitives. ‛Eglath sheilshiyyâh,
which Rosenmller, Knobel, Drechsler, Meier, and others have taken quite
unnecessarily as a proper name, is either in apposition to Zoar or to
Moab. In the former case it is a distinguishing epithet. An ox of the
three years, or more literally of the third year (cf., meshullesheth,
[Gen 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009).md), i.e., a three-year-old ox,
is one that is still in all the freshness and fulness of its strength,
and that has not yet been exhausted by the length of time that it has
worn the yoke. The application of the term to the Moabitish nation is
favoured by [Jer 46:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#020.md), where Egypt is
called "a very fair heifer" (‛eglâh yephēh-phiyyâh), whilst Babylon is
called the same in [Jer 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md) (cf.,
[Hos 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md); [Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011).md). And in the same way, according
to the lxx, Vulg., Targum, and Gesenius, Moab is called juvenca tertii
anni, h. e. indomita jugoque non assueta, as a nation that was still in
the vigour of youth, and if it had hitherto borne the yoke, had always
shaken it off again. But the application of it to Zoar is favoured (1.)
by [Jer 48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034.md), where this epithet is
applied to another Moabitish city; (2.) by the accentuation; and (3.) by
the fact that in the other case we should expect berı̄châh (the
three-year-old heifer, i.e., Moab, is a fugitive to Zoar: vid.,
Luzzatto). Thus Zoar, the fine, strong, and hitherto unconquered city,
is now the destination of the wildest flight before the foe that is
coming from the north. A blow has fallen upon Joab, that is more
terrible than any that has preceded it.

In a few co-ordinate clauses the prophet now sets before us the several
scenes of mourning and desolation. "for the mountain slope of Luhith
they ascend with weeping; for on the road to Horonayim they lift up a
cry of despair. For the waters of Nimrim are waste places from this time
forth: for the grass is dried up, the vegetation wasteth away, the green
is gone." The road to Luhith (according to the Onom. between Ar-Moab and
Zoar, and therefore in the centre of Moabitis proper) led up a height,
and the road to Horonayim (according to [Jer
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005).md) down a slope. Weeping, they ran
up to the mountain city to hide themselves there (bo, as in [Psa
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md); in [Jer
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005) it is written incorrectly בּכי.md).
Raising loud cries of despair, they stand in front of Horonayim, which
lay below, and was more exposed to the enemy. יעערוּ is softened from
יערערוּ (possibly to increase the resemblance to an echo), like כּוכב
from כּבכּב. The Septuagint renders it very well, κραυγὴν συντριμμοῦ
ἐξαναγεροῦσιν - an unaccustomed expression of intense and ever renewed
cries at the threatening danger of utter destruction, and with the hope
of procuring relief and assistance (sheber, as in [Isa
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#028.md); [Isa
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026).md). From the farthest south the
scene would suddenly be transferred to the extreme north of the
territory of Moab, if Nimrim were the Nimra (Beth-Nimra, Talm. nimrin)
which was situated near to the Jordan in Gilead, and therefore farther
north than any of the places previously mentioned, and the ruins of
which lie a little to the south of Salt, and are still called Nimrin.
But the name itself, which is derived from the vicinity of fresh water
(Arab. nemir, nemı̄r, clear, pure, sound), is one of frequent occurrence;
and even to the south of Moabitis proper there is a Wadi Numere, and a
brook called Moyet Numere (two diminutives: "dear little stream of
Nimra"), which flows through stony tracks, and which formerly watered
the country (Burckhardt, Seetzen, and De Saulcy). In all probability the
ruins of Numere by the side of this wady are the Nimrim referred to
here, and the waters of the brook the "waters of Nimrim" (me Nimrim).
The waters that flowed fresh from the spring had been filled up with
rubbish by the enemy, and would now probably lie waste for ever (a
similar expression to that in [Isa
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002).md). He had gone through the land
scorching and burning, so that all the vegetation had vanished. On the
miniature-like short sentences, see [Isa
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md); [Isa
33:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008.md); [Isa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010.md); and on היה לא ("it is not in
existence," or "it has become not," i.e., annihilated), vid., [Eze
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032.md).

[Isaiah 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 15:7</span></span>

As Moabitis has thus become a great scene of conflagration, the Moabites
cross the border and fly to Idumaea. The reason for this is given in
sentences which the prophet again links on to one another with the
particle ci (for). "Therefore what has been spared, what has been
gained, and their provision, they carry it over the willow-brook. For
the scream has gone the round in the territory of Moab; the wailing of
Joab resounds to Eglayim, and his wailing to Beeer-Elim. For the waters
of Dimon are full of blood: for I suspend over Dimon a new calamity,
over the escaped of Moab a lion, and over the remnant of the land."
Yithrâh is what is superfluous or exceeds the present need, and pekuddâh
(lit. a laying up, depositio) that which has been carefully stored;
whilst ‛âsâh, as the derivative passage, [Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md), clearly shows (although the
accusative in the whole of [Isa 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007.md)
is founded upon a different view: see Rashi), is an attributive clause
(what has been made, worked out, or gained). All these things they carry
across nachal hâ‛arâbim, i.e., not the desert-stream, as Hitzig, Maurer,
Ewald, and Knobel suppose, since the plural of ‛arâbâh is ‛arâboth, but
either the Arab stream (lxx, Saad.), or the willow-stream, torrens
salicum (Vulg.). The latter is more suitable to the connection; and
among the rivers which flow to the south of the Arnon from the mountains
of the Moabitish highlands down to the Dead Sea, there is one which is
called Wadi Sufsaf, i.e., willow-brook (Tzaphtzphh is the name of a
brook in Hebrew also), viz., the northern arm of the Seil el-Kerek. This
is what we suppose to be intended here, and not the Wadi el-Ahsa,
although the latter (probably the biblical Zered

(Note: Hence the Targ. II renders nachal zered "the brook of the
willows." See Buxtorf, Lex. chald. s.v. Zerad.))

is the boundary river on the extreme south, and separates Moab from Edom
(Kerek from Gebal: see Ritter, Erdk. xv 1223-4). Wading through the
willow-brook, they carry their possessions across, and hurry off to the
land of Edom, for their own land has become the prey of the foe
throughout its whole extent, and within its boundaries the cry of
wailing passes from Eglayim, on the south-west of Ar, and therefore not
far from the southern extremity of the Dead Sea ([Eze
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010).md), as far as Beer-elim, in the
north-east of the land towards the desert ([Num
21:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016.md); עד must be supplied: Ewald,
351, a), that is to say, if we draw a diagonal through the land, from
one end to the other. Even the waters of Dibon, which are called Dimon
here to produce a greater resemblance in sound to dâm, blood, and by
which we are probably to understand the Arnon, as this was only a short
distance off (just as in [Jdg 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md) the
"waters of Megiddo" are the Kishon), are full of blood,

(Note: דם מלאוּ, with munach (which also represents the metheg) at the
first syllable of the verb (compare [Isa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004), לּו ירעה, with mercha.md),
according to Vened. 1521, and other good editions. This is also
grammatically correct.)

so that the enemy must have penetrated into the very heart of the land
in his course of devastation and slaughter. But what drives them across
the willow-brook is not this alone; it is as if they forebode that what
has hitherto occurred is not the worst or the last. Jehovah suspends
(shith, as in [Hos 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011).md) over Dibon,
whose waters are already reddened with blood, nōsâphōth, something to be
added, i.e., a still further judgment, namely a lion. The measure of
Moab's misfortunes is not yet full: after the northern enemy, a lion
will come upon those that have escaped by flight or have been spared at
home (on the expression itself, compare [Isa
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020.md); [Isa
37:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#032), and other passages.md). This lion
is no other than the basilisk of the prophecy against Philistia, but
with this difference, that the basilisk represents one particular
Davidic king, whilst the lion is Judah generally, whose emblem was the
lion from the time of Jacob's blessing, in [Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md).
