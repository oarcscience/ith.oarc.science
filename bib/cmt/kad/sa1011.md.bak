[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 11:1</span></span>

Saul's Victory over the Ammonites. - Even after the election by lot at
Mizpeh, Saul did not seize upon the reins of government at once, but
returned to his father's house in Gibeah, and to his former agricultural
occupation; not, however, merely from personal humility and want of
ambition, but rather from a correct estimate of the circumstances. The
monarchy was something so new in Israel, that the king could not expect
a general and voluntary recognition of his regal dignity and authority,
especially after the conduct of the worthless people mentioned in [Sa1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027.md), until he had answered their
expectations from a king ([Sa1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#006.md),
[Sa1 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#020).md), and proved himself a
deliverer of Israel from its foes by a victorious campaign. But as
Jehovah had chosen him ruler over his people without any seeking on his
part, he would wait for higher instructions to act, before he entered
upon the government. The opportunity was soon given him.

[Sa1 11:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md)

Nahash, the king of the Ammonites (cf. [Sa1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012.md); [Sa2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002).md), attacked the tribes on the east
of the Jordan, no doubt with the intention of enforcing the claim to
part of Gilead asserted by his ancestor in the time of Jephthah ([Jdg
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013).md), and besieged Jabesh in Gilead,

(Note: The time of this campaign is not mentioned in the Hebrew text.
But it is very evident from [Sa1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012.md), where the Israelites are said
to have desired a king, when they saw that Nahash had come against them,
that Nahash had invaded Gilead before the election of Saul as king. The
Septuagint, however, renders the words כמחרישׁ ויהי ([Sa1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027).md) by καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς μετὰ μῆνα,
and therefore the translators must have read כּמחדשׁ, which Ewald and
Thenius would adopt as an emendation of the Hebrew text. But all the
other ancient versions give the Masoretic text, viz., not only the
Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, but even Jerome, who renders it ille vero
dissimulabat se audire. It is true that in our present Vulgate text
these words are followed by et factum est quasi post mensem; but this
addition has no doubt crept in from the Itala. With the general
character of the Septuagint, the rendering of כמחרישׁ by ὡς μετὰ μῆνα is
no conclusive proof that the word in their Hebrew Codex was כּמחדשׁ; it
simply shows that this was the interpretation which they gave to כמחריש.
And Josephus (vi. 5, 1), who is also appealed to, simply establishes the
fact that ὡς μετὰ μῆνα stood in the Sept. version of his day, since he
made use of this version and not of the original text. Moreover, we
cannot say with Ewald, that this was the last place in which the time
could be overlooked; for it is perfectly evident that Nahash commenced
the siege of Jabesh shortly after the election of Saul at Mizpeh, as we
may infer from the verb ויּעל, when taken in connection with the fact
implied in [Sa1 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012.md), that he had
commenced the war with the Israelites before this. And lastly, it is
much more probable that the lxx changed כמחריש into כמחדש, than that the
Hebrew readers of the Old Testament should have altered כמחדש into
כמחריש, without defining the time more precisely by אחד, or some other
number.)

\- according to Josephus the metropolis of Gilead, and probably situated
by the Wady Jabes (see at [Jdg 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#008).md);
from which we may see that he must have penetrated very far into the
territory of the Israelites. The inhabitants of Jabesh petitioned the
Ammonites in their distress, "Make a covenant with us, and we will serve
thee;" i.e., grant us favourable terms, and we will submit.

[Sa1 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#002.md)

But Nahash replied, "On this condition (בּזאת, lit. at this price, בּ
pretii) will I make a covenant with you, that I may put out all your
right eyes, and so bring a reproach upon all Israel." From the fact that
the infinitive נקור is continued with ושׂמתּי, it is evident that the
subject to נקור is Nahash, and not the Israelites, as the Syriac,
Arabic, and others have rendered it. The suffix to שׂמתּיה is neuter,
and refers to the previous clause: "it," i.e., the putting out of the
right eye. This answer on the part of Nahash shows unmistakeably that he
sought to avenge upon the people of Israel the shame of the defeat which
Jephthah had inflicted upon the Ammonites.

[Sa1 11:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#003.md)

The elders of Jabesh replied: "Leave us seven days, that we may send
messengers into all the territory of Israel; and if there is no one who
saves us, we will come out to thee," i.e., will surrender to thee. This
request was granted by Nahash, because he was not in a condition to take
the town at once by storm, and also probably because, in the state of
internal dissolution into which Israel had fallen at that time, he had
no expectation that any vigorous help would come to the inhabitants of
Jabesh. From the fact that the messengers were to be sent into all the
territory of Israel, we may conclude that the Israelites had no central
government at that time, and that neither Nahash nor the Jabeshites had
heard anything of the election that had taken place; and this is still
more apparent from the fact that, according to [Sa1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#004.md), their messengers came to Gibeah
of Saul, and laid their business before the people generally, without
applying at once to Saul.

[Sa1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#005.md)

Saul indeed did not hear of the matter will he came (returned home) from
the field behind the oxen, and found the people weeping and lamenting at
these mournful tidings. "Behind the oxen," i.e., judging from the
expression "yoke of oxen" in [Sa1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#007.md), the pair of oxen with which he
had been ploughing.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 11:6</span></span>

When the report of the messengers had been communicated to him, "the
Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and his anger was kindled greatly,"
sc., at the shame which the Ammonites had resolved to bring upon all
Israel.

[Sa1 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#007.md)

He took a yoke of oxen, cut them in pieces, and sent (the pieces) into
every possession of Israel by messengers, and said, "Whoever cometh not
forth after Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen." The
introduction of Samuel's name after that of Saul, is a proof that Saul
even as king still recognised the authority which Samuel possessed in
Israel as the prophet of Jehovah. This symbolical act, like the cutting
up of the woman in [Jdg 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#029.md), made a
deep impression. "The fear of Jehovah fell upon the people, so that they
went out as one man." By "the fear of Jehovah" we are not to understand
δεῖμα πανικόν (Thenius and Bttcher), for Jehovah is not equivalent to
Elohim, nor the fear of Jehovah in the sense of fear of His punishment,
but a fear inspired by Jehovah. In Saul's energetic appeal the people
discerned the power of Jehovah, which inspired them with fear, and
impelled them to immediate obedience.

[Sa1 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#008.md)

Saul held a muster of the people of war, who had gathered together at
(or near) Bezek, a place which was situated, according to the Onom. (s.
v. Bezek), about seven hours to the north of Nabulus towards Beisan (see
at [Jdg 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#004).md). The number assembled
were 300,000 men of Israel, and 30,000 of Judah. These numbers will not
appear too large, if we bear in mind that the allusion is not to a
regular army, but that Saul had summoned all the people to a general
levy. In the distinction drawn between the children of Judah and the
children of Israel we may already discern a trace of that separation of
Judah from the rest of the tribes, which eventually led to a formal
secession on the part of the latter.

[Sa1 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#009.md)

The messengers from Jabesh, who had been waiting to see the result of
Saul's appeal, were now despatched with this message to their
fellow-citizens: "To-morrow you will have help, when the sun shines
hot," i.e., about noon.

[Sa1 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#010.md)

After receiving these joyful news, the Jabeshites announced to the
Ammonites: "To-morrow we will come out to you, and ye may do to us what
seemeth good to you," - an untruth by which they hoped to assure the
besiegers, so that they might be fallen upon unexpectedly by the
advancing army of Saul, and thoroughly beaten.

[Sa1 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011.md)

The next day Saul arranged the people in three divisions (ראשׁים, as in
[Jdg 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016).md), who forced their way into
the camp of the foe from three different sides, in the morning watch
(between three and six o'clock in the morning), smote the Ammonites
"till the heat of the day," and routed them so completely, that those
who remained were all scattered, and there were not two men left
together.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 11:12</span></span>

Renewal of the Monarchy. - Saul had so thoroughly acted the part of a
king in gaining this victory, and the people were so enthusiastic in his
favour, that they said to Samuel, viz., after their return from the
battle, "Who is he that said, Saul should reign over us!" The clause
עלינוּ ימלך שׁאוּל contains a question, though it is indicated simply by
the tone, and there is no necessity to alter שׁאוּל into השׁאוּל. These
words refer to the exclamation of the worthless people in [Sa1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027.md). "Bring the men (who spoke in
this manner), that we may put them to death." But Saul said, "There
shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah hath
wrought salvation in Israel;" and proved thereby not only his
magnanimity, but also his genuine piety.

(Note: "Not only signifying that the public rejoicing should not be
interrupted, but reminding them of the clemency of God, and urging that
since Jehovah had shown such clemency upon that day, that He had
overlooked their sins, and given them a glorious victory, it was only
right that they should follow His example, and forgive their neighbours'
sins without bloodshed." - Seb. Schmidt.)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 11:14</span></span>

Samuel turned this victory to account, by calling upon the people to go
with him to Gilgal, and there renew the monarchy. In what the renewal
consisted is not clearly stated; but it is simply recorded in [Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015) that "they (the whole people.md)
made Saul king there before the Lord in Gilgal." Many commentators have
supposed that he was anointed afresh, and appeal to David's second
anointing ([Sa2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004.md) and [Sa2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003).md). But David's example merely
proves as Seb. Schmidt has correctly observed, that the anointing could
be repeated under certain circumstances; but it does not prove that it
was repeated, or must have been repeated, in the case of Saul. If the
ceremony of anointing had been performed, it would no doubt have been
mentioned, just as it is in [Sa2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004.md)
and [Sa2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003.md). But ימלכוּ does not mean
"they anointed," although the lxx have rendered it ἔχρισε Σαμουήλ,
according to their own subjective interpretation. The renewal of the
monarchy may very well have consisted in nothing more than a solemn
confirmation of the election that had taken place at Mizpeh, in which
Samuel once more laid before both king and people the right of the
monarchy, receiving from both parties in the presence of the Lord the
promise to observe this right, and sealing the vow by a solemn
sacrifice. The only sacrifices mentioned are zebachim shelamim, i.e.,
peace-offerings. These were thank-offerings, which were always connected
with a sacrificial meal, and when presented on joyous occasions, formed
a feast of rejoicing for those who took part, since the sacrificial meal
shadowed forth a living and peaceful fellowship with the Lord. Gilgal is
in all probability the place where Samuel judged the people every year
([Sa1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#016).md). But whether it was the
Gilgal in the plain of the Jordan, or Jiljilia on higher ground to the
south-west of Shiloh, it is by no means easy to determine. The latter is
favoured, apart from the fact that Samuel did not say "Let us go down,"
but simply "Let us go" (cf. [Sa1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008).md), by the circumstance that the
solemn ceremony took place after the return from the war at Jabesh;
since it is hardly likely that the people would have gone down into the
valley of the Jordan to Gilgal, whereas Jiljilia was close by the road
from Jabesh to Gibeah and Ramah.
