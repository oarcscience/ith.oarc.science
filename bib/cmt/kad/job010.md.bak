### [Job Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001.md)

[Job 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 10:1</span></span>

1 My soul is full of disgust with my life,

Therefore I will freely utter my complaint;

I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

2 I will say to Eloah: Condemn me not;

Let me know wherefore Thou contendest with me!

His self-consciousness makes him desire that the possibility of
answering for himself might be granted him; and since he is weary of
life, and has renounced all claim for its continuance, he will at least
give his complaints free course, and pray the Author of his sufferings
that He would not permit him to die the death of the wicked, contrary to
the testimony of his own conscience. נקטה is equivalent to נקטּה ot
tnel, [Eze 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009.md), after the usual manner
of the contraction of double Ayin verbs ([Gen
11:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#006.md); [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003.md); [Jdg
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005.md); [Eze
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007); vid., Ges. 67, rem. 11.md); it may
nevertheless be derived directly from נקט, for this secondary verb
formed from the Niph. נקט is supported by the Aramaic. In like manner,
in [Gen 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#011.md) perhaps a secondary verb
נמל, and certainly in [Gen 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#019.md) and
[Isa 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003.md) a secondary verb נפץ ([Sa1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#011).md), formed from the Niph. נפץ
([Gen 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018).md), is to be supposed; for
the contraction of the Niphal form נקומה into נקמה is impossible; and
the supposition which has been advanced, of a root פצץ = פוץ in the
signification diffundere, dissipare is unnecessary. His soul is
disgusted (fastidio affecta est, or fastidit) with his life, therefore
he will give free course to his plaint (comp. [Job
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011).md). עלי is not super or de me, but,
as [Job 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#016.md), in me; it belongs to
the Ego, as an expression of spontaneity: I in myself, since the Ego is
the subject, ὑποκείμενον, of his individuality (Psychol. S. 151f.). The
inner man is meant, which has the Ego over or in itself; from this the
complaint shall issue forth as a stream without restraint; not, however,
a mere gloomy lamentation over his pain, but a supplicatory complaint
directed to God respecting the peculiar pang of his suffering, viz.,
this stroke which seems to come upon him from his Judge (ריב, seq. acc.,
as [Isa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008).md), without his being
conscious of that for which he is accounted guilty.

[Job 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 10:3</span></span>

3 Doth it please Thee when Thou oppressest,

That Thou rejectest the work of Thy hands,

While Thou shinest upon the counsel of the wicked?

4 Hast Thou eyes of flesh,

Or seest Thou as a mortal seeth?

5 Are Thy days as the days of a mortal,

Or Thy years as man's days,

6 That Thou seekest after my iniquity,

And searchest after my sin?

7 Although Thou knowest that I am not a wicked man,

And there is none that can deliver out of Thy hand.

There are three questions by which Job seeks to exhaust every possible
way of accounting for his sufferings as coming from God. These attempts
at explanation, however, are at once destroyed, because they proceed
upon conceptions which are unworthy of God, and opposed to His nature.
Firstly, Whether it gives Him pleasure (טּוב, agreeable, as [Job
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#009).md) when He oppresses, when He
despises, i.e., keeps down forcibly or casts from Him as hateful (מאס,
as [Psa 89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md); [Isa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006).md) the work of His hand; while, on
the contrary, He permits light to shine from above upon the design of
the wicked, i.e., favours it? Man is called the יגיע of the divine
hands, as though he were elaborated by them, because at his origin ([Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md), the continuation of which is the
development in the womb ([Psa 139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015).md),
he came into existence in a remarkable manner by the directly personal,
careful, and, so to speak, skilful working of God. That it is the
morally innocent which is here described, may be seen not only from the
contrast ([Job 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#003).md), but also from
the fact that he only can be spoken of as oppressed and rejected.
Moreover, "the work of Thy hands" involves a negative reply to the
question. Such an unloving mood of self-satisfaction is contrary to the
bounty and beneficence of that love to which man owes his existence.
Secondly, Whether God has eyes of flesh, i.e., of sense, which regard
only the outward appearance, without an insight into the inner nature,
or whether He sees as mortals see, i.e., judges, κατὰ τῆν σάρκα ([Joh
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015).md)? Mercier correctly: num ex facie
judicas, ut affectibus ducaris more hominum. This question also supplies
its own negative; it is based upon the thought that God lookest on the
heart ([Sa1 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007).md). Thirdly, Whether
His life is like to the brevity of man's life, so that He is not able to
wait until a man's sin manifests itself, but must institute such a
painful course of investigation with him, in order to extort from him as
quickly as possible a confession of it? Suffering appears here to be a
means of inquisition, which is followed by the final judgment when the
guilt is proved. What is added in [Job
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#007.md) puts this supposition aside also
as inconceivable. Such a mode of proceeding may be conceived of in a
mortal ruler, who, on account of his short-sightedness, seeks to bring
about by severe measures that which was at first only conjecture, and
who, from the apprehension that he may not witness that vengeance in
which he delights, hastens forward the criminal process as much as
possible, in order that his victim may not escape him. God, however, to
whom belongs absolute knowledge and absolute power, would act thus,
although, etc. על, although, notwithstanding (proceeding from the
signification, besides, insuper), as [Job
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016.md) ([Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009).md), [Job
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#006.md). God knows even from the first
that he (Job) will not appear as a guilty person (רשׁע, as in [Job
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#029).md); and however that may be, He is
at all events sure of him, for nothing escapes the hand of God.

That operation of the divine love which is first echoed in "the labour
of Thy hands," is taken up in the following strophe, and, as Job
contemplates it, his present lot seems to him quite incomprehensible.

[Job 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 10:8</span></span>

8 Thy hands have formed and perfected me

Altogether round about, and Thou hast now swallowed me up!

9 Consider now, that Thou has perfected me as clay,

And wilt Thou turn me again into dust?

10 Hast Thou not poured me out as milk,

And curdled me as curd?

11 With skin and flesh hast Thou clothed me,

And Thou hast intertwined me with bones and sinews;

12 Life and favour Thou hast shown me,

And thy care hath guarded my breath.

The development of the embryo was regarded by the Israelitish Chokma as
one of the greatest mysteries ([Ecc
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005); 2 Macc. 7:22f..md). There are two
poetical passages which treat explicitly of this mysterious existence:
this strophe of the book of Job, and the Psalm by David, [Psa
139:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013) (Psychol. S. 210.md). The
assertion of Scheuchzer, Hoffmann, and Oetinger, that these passages of
Scripture "include, and indeed go beyond, all recent systemata
generationis," attributes to Scripture a design of imparting
instruction, - a purpose which is foreign to it. Scripture nowhere
attempts an analysis of the workings of nature, but only traces them
back to their final cause. According to the view of Scripture, a
creative act similar to the creation of Adam is repeated at the origin
of each individual; and the continuation of development according to
natural laws is not less the working of God than the creative planting
of the very beginning. Thy hands, says Job, have formed (עצּב, to cut,
carve, fashion; cognate are חצב, קצב, without the accompanying notion of
toil, which makes this word specially appropriate, as describing the
fashioning of the complicated nature of man) and perfected me. We do not
translate: made; for עשׂה stands in the same relation to ברא and יצר as
perficere to creare and fingere ([Gen
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002.md); [Isa
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007).md). יחד refers to the members of
the body collectively, and סביב to the whole form. The perfecting as
clay implies three things: the earthiness of the substance, the origin
of man without his knowledge and co-operation, and the moulding of the
shapeless substance by divine power and wisdom. The primal origin of
man, de limo terrae ([Job 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006.md); [Psa
139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015).md), is repeated in the womb. The
figures which follow ([Job 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#010).md)
describe this origin, which being obscure is all the more mysterious,
and glorifies the power of God the more. The sperma is likened to milk;
the חתּיך (used elsewhere of smelting), which Seb. Schmid rightly
explains rem colliquatam fundere et immittere in formam aliquam, refers
to the nisus formativus which dwells in it. The embryo which is formed
from the sperma is likened to גּבינה, which means in all the Semitic
dialects cheese (curd). "As whey" (Ewald, Hahn) is not suitable; whey
does not curdle; in making cheese it is allowed to run off from the
curdled milk. "As cream" (Schlottm.) is not less incorrect; cream is not
lac coagulatum, which the word signifies. The embryo forming itself from
the sperma is like milk which is curdled and beaten into shape.

The consecutio temporum, moreover, must be observed here. It is, for
example, incorrect to translate, with Ewald: Dost Thou not let me flow
away like milk, etc. Job looks back to the beginning of his life; the
four clauses, [Job 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#010.md), [Job
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#011.md), under the control of the first
two verbs ([Job 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008).md), which influence
the whole strophe, are also retrospective in meaning. The futt. are
consequently like synchronous imperff.; as, then, [Job
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#012.md) returns to perff., [Job
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#011.md) describes the development of the
embryo to the full-grown infant, on which Grotius remarks: Hic ordo est
in genitura: primum pellicula fit, deinde in ea caro, duriora paulatim
accedunt, and by [Job 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#012.md), the
manifestations of divine goodness, not only in the womb, but from the
beginning of life and onwards, are intended. The expression "Life and
favour (this combination does not occur elsewhere) hast Thou done to me"
is zeugmatic: He has given him life, and sustained that life amidst
constant proofs of favour; His care has guarded the spirit (רוּח), by
which his frame becomes a living and self-conscious being. This grateful
retrospect is interspersed with painful reflections, in which Job gives
utterance to his feeling of the contrast between the manifestation of
the divine goodness which he had hitherto experienced and his present
condition. As in [Job 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008.md).,
ותּבלּעני, which Hirzel wrongly translates: and wilt now destroy me; it
is rather: and hast now swallowed me up, i.e., drawn me down into
destruction, as it were brought me to nought; or even, if in the fut.
consec., as is frequently the case, the consecutive and not the aorist
signification preponderates: and now swallowest me up; and in [Job
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#009.md) (where, though not clear from the
syntax, it is clear from the substance that תשׁיבני is not to be
understood as an imperfect, like the futt. in [Job
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#010)..md): wilt Thou cause me to become
dust again? The same tone is continued in the following strophe. Thus
graciously has he been brought into being, and his life sustained, in
order that he may come to such a terrible end.

[Job 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 10:13</span></span>

13 And such Thou hast hidden in Thy heart,

I perceive that this was in Thy mind:

14 If I should sin, Thou wouldst take note of it,

And not acquit me of my iniquity.

15 If I should act wickedly, woe unto me!

And were I righteous, I should not lift up my head,

Being full of shame and conscious of my misery.

16 And were I to raise it, Thou wouldst hunt me as a lion,

And ever display on me Thy wondrous power,

17 Thou wouldst ever bring fresh witnesses against me,

And increase Thy wrath against me,

I should be compelled to withstand continuously advancing troops and a
host.

This manifestation of divine goodness which Job has experienced from the
earliest existence seems to him, as he compares his present lot of
suffering with it, to have served as a veil to a hidden purpose of a
totally opposite character. That purpose - to make this life, which has
been so graciously called into existence and guarded thus far, the
object of the severest and most condemning visitation - is now manifest.
Both אלּה and זאת refer to what is to follow: עמּך זאת used of the
thought conceived, the purpose cherished, as [Job
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md); [Job
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011.md). All that follows receives a
future colouring from this principal clause, "This is what Thou hadst
designed to do," which rules the strophe. Thus [Job
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#014.md) is to be rendered: If I had
sinned, Thou wouldst have kept me in remembrance, properly custodies me,
which is here equivalent to custoditurus eras me. שׁמר, with the acc. of
the person, according to [Psa 130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003.md)
(where it is followed by the acc. of the sin), is to be understood: to
keep any one in remembrance, i.e., to mark him as sinful (Hirzel). This
appears more appropriate than rigide observaturus eras me (Schlottm.).
ושׁמרתני, according to Ges. 121, 4, might be taken for לי ושׁמרת (viz.,
חטּאתי); but this is unnecessary, and we have merely translated it thus
for the sake of clearness. His infirmities must not be passed by
unpunished; and if he should act wickedly (רשׁע, of malignant sin, in
distinction from חטא), woe unto him (comp. οἰαί μοι, [Co1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016).md). According to the construction
referred to above, וצדקתי is praet. hypotheticum (Ges. 155, 4, a); and
the conclusion follows without waw apodosis: If I had acted rightly, I
should not have raised my head, being full of shame and conscious of my
misery. The adjectives are not in apposition to ראשׁי (Bttcher), but
describe the condition into which he would be brought, instead of being
able (according to the ethical principle, [Gen
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007).md) to raise his head cheerfully. ראה
constr. of ראה, as שׂבע or שׂבע. It is needless, with Pisc., Hirz.,
Bttch., and Ewald, to alter it to ראה, since ראה is verbal adjective
like יפה, נכה, קשׁה. Moreover, וּראה cannot be imperative (Rosenm., De
Wette); for although imperatives, joined by waw to sentences of a
different construction, do occur ([Psa
77:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#002.md); [Sa2
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#003).md), such an exclamation would
destroy the connection and tone of the strophe in the present case.

[Job 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#016.md)

יגאה is hypothetical, like וצדקתי, but put in the future form, because
referring to a voluntary act (Ewald, 357, b): and if it (the head) would
(nevertheless) exalt itself (גאה, to raise proudly or in joyous
self-consciousness), then (without waw apod., which is found in other
passages, e.g., [Job 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#028).md) Thou
wouldst hunt me like a shachal (vid., [Job
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#010).md), - Job likens God to the lion
(as [Hos 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014.md); [Hos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007).md), and himself to the prey which
the lion pursues-Thou wouldst ever anew show Thyself wonderful at my
expense (תּשׁב, voluntative form, followed by a future with which it is
connected adverbially, Ges. 142, 3, b; תּתפּלּא, with in the last
syllable, although not in pause, as [Num
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#012); Ewald, 141, c..md), i.e.,
wonderful in power, and inventive by ever new forms off suffering, by
which I should be compelled to repent this haughtiness. The witnesses
(עדים) that God continually brings forth afresh against him are his
sufferings (vid., [Job 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#008).md), which,
while he is conscious of his innocence, declare him to be a sinner; for
Job, like the friends, cannot think of suffering and sin otherwise than
as connected one with the other: suffering is partly the result of sin,
and partly it sets the mark of sin on the man who is no sinner. תּרב
(fut. apoc. Hiph. Ges. 75, rem. 15) is also the voluntative form: Thou
wouldst multiply, increase Thy malignity against me. עם, contra, as also
in other passages with words denoting strife and war, [Job
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#019.md); [Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md); [Job
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md); or where the context implies
hostility, [Psa 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md); [Psa
94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016.md). The last line is a clause by
itself consisting of nouns. וצבא חליפות is considered by all modern
expositors as hendiadys, as Mercier translates: impetor variis et sibi
succedentibus malorum agminibus; and צבא is mostly taken collectively.
Changes and hosts = hosts continuously dispersing themselves, and always
coming on afresh to the attack. But is not this form of expression
unnatural? By חליפות Job means the advancing troops, and by צבא the main
body of the army, from which they are reinforced; the former stands
first, because the thought figuratively expressed in תחדשׁ and תרב is
continued (comp. [Job 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#012).md): the
enmity of God is manifested against him by ever fresh sufferings, which
are added to the one chief affliction. Bttcher calls attention to the
fact that all the lines from v. 14 end in , a rhythm formed by the
inflection, which is also continued in v. 18. This repetition of the
pronominal suffix gives intensity to the impression that these
manifestations of the divine wrath have special reference to himself
individually.

[Job 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 10:18</span></span>

18 And wherefore hast Thou brought me forth out of the womb?

I should have expired, that no eye had seen me,

19 I should have been as though I had never been,

Carried from the womb to the grave.

20 Are not my days few? then cease

And turn from me, that I may become a little cheerful,

21 Before I go to return no more

Into the land of darkness and of the shadow of death,

22 The land of deep darkness like to midnight,

Of the shadow of death and of confusion,

And which is bright like midnight.

The question Wherefore? [Job 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#018.md), is
followed by futt. as modi conditionales (Ges. 127, 5) of that which
would and should have happened, if God had not permitted him to be born
alive: I should have expired, prop. I ought to have expired, being put
back to the time of birth (comp. [Job
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013.md), where the praet. more
objectively expressed what would then have happened). These modi condit.
are continued in [Job 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#019.md) : I should
have been (sc. in the womb) as though I had not been (comp. the short
elliptical

(Note: כלא is there = לא כאשׁר, like ללא, [Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md) = לא לאשׁר \[vid. Ges. 123, 3\],
and כּ is used as a conjunction as little as ל (vid., on [Psa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#014))..md)

expression, [Oba 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#016).md), i.e., as one
who had scarcely entered upon existence, and that only of the earliest
(as at conception); I should have been carried (הוּבל, as [Job
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#032).md) from the womb (without seeing
the light as one born alive) to the grave. This detestation of his
existence passes into the wish, [Job
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020.md), that God would be pleased at
least somewhat to relieve him ere he is swallowed up by the night of
Hades. We must neither with the Targ. translate: are not my days few,
and vanishing away? nor with Oetinger: will not my fewness of days
cease? Both are contrary to the correct accentuation. Olshausen thinks
it remarkable that there is not a weaker pausal accent to ימי; but such
a one is really indirectly there, for Munach is here equivalent to Dech,
from which it is formed (vid., the rule in Comm. ber den Psalter, ii.
504). Accordingly, Seb. Schmid correctly translates: nonne parum dies
mei? ideo cessa. The Keri substitutes the precative form of expression
for the optative: cease then, turn away from me then (imper. consec.
with waw of the result, Ewald, 235, a); comp. the precative conclusion
to the speech, [Job 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#016.md)., but there
is no real reason for changing the optative form of the text. ישׁית
(voluntative for ישׁת, [Job 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033).md) may
be supplemented by ידו, פניו, עיניו ,פ, or לבו ([Job
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017).md) (not, however, with Hirz.,
שׁבטו, after [Job 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034.md), which is too
far-fetched for the usage of the language, or with Bttch., מחנהו, copias
suas); שׁית can however, like שׂים, [Job
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020.md), signify to turn one's self to,
se disponere = to attend to, consequently מן שׁית, to turn the attention
from, as מן שׁעה, [Job 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019.md), Ps. 39:14
(where, as here, ואבליגה follows).

He desires a momentary alleviation of his sufferings and ease before his
descent to Hades, which seems so near at hand. He calls Hades the land
of darkness and of the shadow of death. צלמות, which occurs for the
first time in the Old Testament in [Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md), is made into a compound from
סלמוּת, and is the proper word for the obscurity of the region of the
dead, and is accordingly repeated later on. Further, he calls it the
land of encircling darkness (עפתה, defective for עיפתה, from עוף,
caligare, and with He parag. intensive for עיפה, in [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013.md), who also uses הבליג, [Job
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#009), in common with Job.md), like
midnight darkness. אפל cannot mean merely the grey of twilight, it is
the entire absence of sunlight, [Job
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#006.md); [Job
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003.md); [Psa
91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md); comp. ex. [Job
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022.md), where the Egyptian darkness is
called אפלה חשׁך. Bttch. correctly compares אפל and נפל: mersa ad imum
h.e. profunda nox (the advancing night). Still further he calls it (the
land) of the shadow of death, and devoid of order (סדרים, ἅπ. λεγ. in
the Old Testament, but a common word in the later Hebrew), i.e., where
everything is so encompassed by the shadow of death that it seems a
chaos, without any visible or distinct outline. It is difficult to
determine whether ותּפע is to be referred to ארץ: and which lights (fut.
consec. as the accent on the penult. indicates, the syntax like [Job
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#021.md), [Job
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#023.md); [Isa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003).md); or is to be taken as neuter:
and it shines there (= and where it shines) like midnight darkness.
Since ותּפע (from יפע = ופע, to rise, shine forth; vid., on [Psa
95:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#004).md), as also האיר, does not occur
elsewhere as neuter, we prefer, with Hirzel, to refer it to ארץ ot, as
being more certain. Moreover, אפל is here evidently the intensest
darkness, ipsum medullitium umbrae mortis ejusque intensissimum, as
Oetinger expresses it. That which is there called light, i.e., the
faintest degree of darkness, is like the midnight of this world; "not
light, but darkness visible," as Milton says of hell.

The maxim of the friends is: God does not pervert right, i.e., He deals
justly in all that He does. They conclude from this, that no man, no
sufferer, dare justify himself: it is his duty to humble himself under
the just hand of God. Job assents to all this, but his assent is mere
sarcasm at what they say. He admits that everything that God does is
right, and must be acknowledged as right; not, however, because it is
right in itself, but because it is the act of the absolute God, against
whom no protest uttered by the creature, though with the clearest
conviction of innocence, can avail. Job separates goodness from God, and
regards that which is part of His very being as a produce of His
arbitrary will. What God says and does must be true and right, even if
it be not true and right in itself. The God represented by the friends
is a God of absolute justice; the God of Job is a God of absolute power.
The former deals according to the objective rule of right; the latter
according to a freedom which, because removed from all moral restraint,
is pure caprice.

How is it that Job entertains such a cheerless view of the matter? The
friends, by the strong view which they have taken up, urge him into
another extreme. On their part, they imagine that in the justice of God
they have a principle which is sufficient to account for all the
misfortunes of mankind, and Job's in particular. They maintain, with
respect to mankind in general (Eliphaz by an example from his own
observation, and Bildad by calling to his aid the wisdom of the
ancients), that the ungodly, though prosperous for a time, come to a
fearful end; with respect to Job, that his affliction is a just
chastisement from God, although designed for his good. Against the one
assertion Job's own experience of life rebels; against the other his
consciousness rises up with indignation. Job's observation is really as
correct as that of the friends; for the history of the past and of the
present furnishes as many illustrations of judgments which have suddenly
come upon the godless in the height of their prosperity, as of general
visitations in which the innocent have suffered with the guilty, by whom
these judgments have been incurred. But with regard to his misfortune,
Job cannot and ought not to look at it from the standpoint of the divine
justice. For the proposition, which we will give in the words of
Brentius, quidquid post fidei justificationem pio acciderit, innocenti
accidit, is applicable to our present subject.

If, then, Job's suffering were not so severe, and his faith so
powerfully shaken, he would comfort himself with the thought that the
divine ways are unsearchable; since, on the one hand, he cannot deny the
many traces of the justice of the divine government in the world (he
does not deny them even here), and on the other hand, is perplexed by
the equally numerous incongruities of human destiny with the divine
justice. (This thought is rendered more consolatory to us by the
revelation which we possess of the future life; although even in the
later Old Testament times the last judgment is referred to as the
adjustment of all these incongruities; vid., the conclusion of
Ecclesiastes.) His own lot might have remained always inexplicable to
him, without his being obliged on that account to lose the consciousness
of the divine love, and that faith like Asaph's, which, as Luther says,
struggles towards God through wrath and disfavour, as through thorns,
yea, even through spears and swords.

Job is passing through conflict and temptation. He does not perceive the
divine motive and purpose of his suffering, nor has he that firm and
unshaken faith which will keep him from mistaken views of God, although
His dispensations are an enigma to him; but, as his first speech (ch. 3)
shows, he is tormented by thoughts which form part of the conflict of
temptation. The image of the gracious God is hidden from him, he feels
only the working of the divine wrath, and asks, Wherefore doth God give
light to the suffering ones? - a question which must not greatly
surprise us, for, as Luther says, "There has never been any one so holy
that he has not been tormented with this quare, quare, Wherefore?
wherefore should it be so?" And when the friends, who know as little as
Job himself about the right solution of this mystery, censure him for
his inquiry, and think that in the propositions: man has no
righteousness which he can maintain before God, and God does not pervert
the right, they have found the key to the mystery, the conflict becomes
fiercer for Job, because the justice of God furnishes him with no
satisfactory explanation of his own lot, or of the afflictions of
mankind generally. The justice of God, which the friends consider to be
sufficient to explain everything that befalls man, Job can only regard
as the right of the Supreme Being; and while it appears to the friends
that every act of God is controlled by His justice, it seems to Job that
whatever God does must be right, by virtue of His absolute power.

This principle, devoid of consolation, drives Job to the utterances so
unworthy of him, that, in spite of his conviction of his innocence, he
must appear guilty before God, because he must be speechless before His
terrible majesty, - that if, however, God would only for once so meet
him that he could fearlessly address Him, he would know well enough how
to defend himself (ch. 9). After these utterances of his feeling, from
which all consciousness of the divine love is absent, he puts forth the
touching prayer: Condemn me not without letting me know why Thou dost
condemn me! ([Job 10:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001).md).

As he looks back, he is obliged to praise God, as his Creator and
Preserver, for what He has hitherto done for him ([Job
10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008).md); but as he thinks of his
present condition, he sees that from the very beginning God designed to
vent His wrath upon him, to mark his infirmities, and to deprive him of
all joy in the consciousness of his innocence ([Job
10:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#013).md). He is therefore compelled
to regard God as his enemy, and this thought overpowers the remembrance
of the divine goodness. If, however, God were his enemy, he might well
ask, Wherefore then have I come into being? And while he writhes as a
worm crushed beneath the almighty power of God, he prays that God would
let him alone for a season ere he passes away into the land of darkness,
whence there is no return ([Job
10:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#018).md).

Brentius remarks that this speech of Job contains inferni blasphemias,
and explains them thus: non enim in tanto judicii horrore Deum patrem,
sed carnificem sentit; but also adds, that in passages like [Job
10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008.md) faith raises its head even in
the midst of judgment; for when he praises the mercies of God, he does
so spiritu fidei, and these he would not acknowledge were there not a
fidei scintilla still remaining. This is true. The groundwork of Job's
faith remains even in the fiercest conflict of temptation, and is
continually manifest; we should be unable to understand the book unless
we could see this fidei scintilla, the extinction of which would be the
accomplishment of Satan's design against him, glimmering everywhere
through the speeches of Job. The unworthy thoughts he entertains of God,
which Brentius calls inferni blasphemias, are nowhere indulged to such a
length that Job charges God with being his enemy, although he fancies
Him to be an enraged foe. In spite of the imagined enmity of God against
him, Job nowhere goes so far as to declare enmity on his part against
God, so far as אלהים ברך. He does not turn away from God, but inclines
to Him in prayer. His soul is filled with adoration of God, and with
reverence of His power and majesty; he can clearly discern God's
marvellous works in nature and among men, and His creative power and
gracious providence, the workings of which he has himself experienced.
But that mystery, which the friends have made still more mysterious, has
cast a dark cloud over his vision, so that he can no longer behold the
loving countenance of God. His faith is unable to disperse this cloud,
and so he sees but one side of the divine character - His Almightiness.
Since he consequently looks upon God as the Almighty and the Wrathful
One, his felling alternately manifests itself under two equally tragical
phases. At one time he exalts himself in his consciousness of the
justice of his cause, to sink back again before the majesty of God, to
whom he must nevertheless succumb; at another time his feeling of
self-confidence is overpowered by the severity of his suffering, and he
betakes himself to importunate supplication.

It is true that Job, so long as he regards his sufferings as a
dispensation of divine judgment, is as unjust towards God as he believes
God to be unjust towards him; but if we bear in mind that this state of
conflict and temptation does not preclude the idea of a temporal
withdrawal of faith, and that, as Baumgarten (Pentat. i. 209) aptly
expresses it, the profound secret of prayer is this, that man can
prevail with the Divine Being, then we shall understand that this dark
cloud need only be removed, and Job again stands before the God of love
as His saint.
