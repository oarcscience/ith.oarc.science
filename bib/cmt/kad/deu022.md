### [Deuteronomy Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 22:1</span></span>

Going deeper and deeper into the manifold relations of the national
life, Moses first of all explains in [Deu
22:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md) the attitude of an Israelite,
on the one hand, towards a neighbour; and, on the other hand, towards
the natural classification and arrangement of things, and shows how love
should rule in the midst of all these relations. The different relations
brought under consideration are selected rather by way of examples, and
therefore follow one another without any link of connection, for the
purpose of exhibiting the truth in certain concrete cases, and showing
how the covenant people were to hold all the arrangement of God sacred,
whether in nature or in social life.

[Deu 22:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md)

In [Deu 22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md) Moses shows, by a still
further expansion of [Exo 23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004.md), how
the property of a neighbour was to be regarded and preserved. If any man
saw an ox or a sheep of his brother's (fellow-countryman) going astray,
he was not to draw back from it, but to bring it back to his brother;
and if the owner lived at a distance, or was unknown, he was to take it
into his own house or farm, till he came to seek it. He was also to do
the same with an ass or any other property that another had lost.

[Deu 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#004.md)

A fallen animal belonging to another he was also to help up (as in [Exo
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#005.md) : except that in this case,
instead of a brother generally, an enemy or hater is mentioned).

[Deu 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005.md)

As the property of a neighbour was to be sacred in the estimation of an
Israelite, so also the divine distinction of the sexes, which was kept
sacred in civil life by the clothing peculiar to each sex, was to be not
less but even more sacredly observed. "There shall not be man's things
upon a woman, and a man shall not put on a woman's clothes." כּלי does
not signify clothing merely, nor arms only, but includes every kind of
domestic and other utensils (as in [Exo
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#006.md); [Lev
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#032.md); [Lev
13:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#049).md). The immediate design of this
prohibition was not to prevent licentiousness, or to oppose idolatrous
practices (the proofs which Spencer has adduced of the existence of such
usages among heathen nations are very far-fetched); but to maintain the
sanctity of that distinction of the sexes which was established by the
creation of man and woman, and in relation to which Israel was not to
sin. Every violation or wiping out of this distinction - such even, for
example, as the emancipation of a woman - was unnatural, and therefore
an abomination in the sight of God.

[Deu 22:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006.md)

The affectionate relation of parents to their young, which God had
established even in the animal world, was also to be kept just as
sacred. If any one found a bird's nest by the road upon a tree, or upon
the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the mother sitting upon them,
he was not to take the mother with the young ones, but to let the mother
fly, and only take the young. נקרא for נקרה, as in [Exo
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003.md). The command is related to the one
in [Lev 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#028.md) and [Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md), and is placed upon a par with
the commandment relating to parents, by the fact that obedience is urged
upon the people by the same promise in both instances (vid., [Deu
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016.md); [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012).md).

[Deu 22:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008.md)

Still less were they to expose human life to danger through
carelessness. "If thou build a new house, make a rim (maakeh) - i.e., a
balustrade - to thy roof, that thou bring not blood-guiltiness upon thy
house, if any one fall from it." The roofs of the Israelitish houses
were flat, as they mostly are in the East, so that the inhabitants often
lived upon them ([Jos 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#006.md); [Sa2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002.md); [Mat
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027).md). - In [Deu
22:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009.md), there follow several
prohibitions against mixing together the things which are separated in
God's creation, consisting partly of a verbal repetition of [Lev
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019.md) (see the explanation of this
passage). - To this there is appended in [Deu
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#012.md) the law concerning the tassels
upon the hem of the upper garment ([Num
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#037)..md), which were to remind the
Israelites of their calling, to walk before the Lord in faithful
fulfilment of the commandments of God (see the commentary upon this
passage).

[Deuteronomy 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 22:13</span></span>

Laws of Chastity and Marriage. - Higher and still holier than the order
of nature stands the moral order of marriage, upon which the well-being
not only of domestic life, but also of the civil commonwealth of
nations, depends. Marriage must be founded upon fidelity and chastity on
the part of those who are married. To foster this, and secure it against
outbreaks of malice and evil lust, was the design and object of the laws
which follow. The first ([Deu
22:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013).md) relates to the chastity of a
woman on entering into the married state, which might be called in
question by her husband, either from malice or with justice. The former
case is that which Moses treats of first of all. If a man took a wife,
and came to her, and hated her, i.e., turned against her after
gratifying his carnal desires (like Amnon, for example, [Sa2
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#015).md), and in order to get rid of her
again, attributed "deeds or things of words" to her, i.e., things which
give occasion for words or talk, and so brought an evil name upon her,
saying, that on coming to her he did not find virginity in her.
בּתוּלים, virginity, here the signs of it, viz., according to [Deu
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#017.md), the marks of a first
intercourse upon the bed-clothes or dress.

[Deuteronomy 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 22:15</span></span>

In such a case the parents of the young woman (הנּער for הנּערה, as in
[Gen 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#014.md), [Gen
24:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#028.md), according to the earliest usage
of the books of Moses, a virgin, then also a young woman, e.g., [Rut
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#006.md); [Rut
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#012).md) were to bring the matter before
the elders of the town into the gate (the judicial forum; see [Deu
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#019).md), and establish the chastity and
innocence of their daughter by spreading the bed-clothes before them. It
was not necessary to this end that the parents should have taken
possession of the spotted bed-clothes directly after the marriage night,
as in customarily done by the Bedouins and the lower classes of the
Moslem in Egypt and Syria (cf. Niebuhr, Beschr. v. Arab. pp. 35ff.;
Arvieux, merkw. Nachr. iii. p. 258; Burckhardt, Beduinen, p. 214, etc.).
It was sufficient that the cloth should be kept, in case such a proof
might be required.

[Deuteronomy 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 22:18</span></span>

The elders, as the magistrates of the place, were then to send for the
man who had so calumniated his young wife, and to chastise him (יסּר, as
in [Deu 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018.md), used to denote bodily
chastisement, thought the limitation of the number of strokes to forty
save one, may have been a later institution of the schools); and in
addition to this they were to impose a fine upon him of 100 shekels of
silver, which he was to pay to the father of the young wife for his
malicious calumniation of an Israelitish maiden, - twice as much as the
seducer of a virgin was to pay to her father for the reproach brought
upon him by the humiliation of his daughter ([Deu
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#029).md); and lastly, they were to
deprive the man of the right of divorce from his wife.

[Deuteronomy 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 22:20</span></span>

In the other case, however, if the man's words were true, and the girl
had not been found to be a virgin, the elders were to bring her out
before the door of her father's house, and the men of the town were to
stone her to death, because she had committed a folly in Israel (cf.
[Gen 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#007).md), to commit fornication in
her father's house. The punishment of death was to be inflicted upon
her, not so much because she had committed fornication, as because
notwithstanding this she had allowed a man to marry her as a spotless
virgin, and possibly even after her betrothal had gone with another man
(cf. [Deu 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md), [Deu
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024).md). There is no ground for
thinking of unnatural wantonness, as Knobel does.

[Deuteronomy 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 22:22</span></span>

If any one lay with a married woman, they were both of them to be put to
death as adulterers (cf. [Lev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010).md).

[Deuteronomy 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 22:23</span></span>

In connection with the seduction of a virgin (נער, puella, a
marriageable girl; בּתוּלה, virgo immaculata, a virgin), two, or really
three, cases are distinguished; viz., (1) whether she was betrothed
([Deu 22:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023).md), or not betrothed
([Deu 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#028.md), [Deu
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#029)); (2.md) if she were betrothed,
whether it was (a) in the town ([Deu
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md), [Deu
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024)) or (b.md) in the open field ([Deu
22:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#025).md) that she had been violated
by a man.

[Deu 22:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md)

If a betrothed virgin had allowed a man to have intercourse with her
(i.e., one who was not her bridegroom), they were both of them, the man
and the girl, to be led out to the gate of the town, and stoned that
they might die: the girl, because she had not cried in the city, i.e.,
had not called for help, and consequently was to be regarded as
consenting to the deed; the man, because he had humbled his neighbour's
wife. The betrothed woman was placed in this respect upon a par with a
married woman, and in fact is expressly called a wife in [Deu
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024.md). Betrothal was the first step
towards marriage, even if it was not a solemn act attested by witnesses.
Written agreements of marriage were not introduced till a later period
(Tobit 7:14; Tr. Ketuboth i. 2).

[Deu 22:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#025.md)

If, on the other hand, a man met a betrothed girl in the field, and laid
hold of her and lay with her, the man alone was to die, and nothing was
to be done to the girl. "There is in the damsel no death-sin (i.e., no
sin to be punished with death); but as when a man riseth against his
neighbour and slayeth him, even so is this matter." In the open field
the girl had called for help, but no one had helped her. It was
therefore a forcible rape.

[Deu 22:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#028.md)

The last case: if a virgin was not betrothed, and a man seized her and
lay with her, and they were found, i.e., discovered or convicted of
their deed, the man was to pay the father of the girl fifty shekels of
silver, for the reproach brought upon him and his house, and to marry
the girl whom he had humbled, without ever being able to divorce her.
This case is similar to the one mentioned in [Exo
22:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#015.md). The omission to mention the
possibility of the father refusing to give him his daughter for a wife,
makes no essential difference. It is assumed as self-evident here, that
such a right was possessed by the father.

[Deuteronomy 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">deu 22:30</span></span>

(or [Deu 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001).md) This verse, in which
the prohibition of incest is renewed by a repetition of the first
provision in the earlier law ([Lev
18:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007).md), is no doubt much better
adapted to form the close of the laws of chastity and marriage, than the
introduction to the laws which follow concerning the right of
citizenship in the congregation of the Lord.
