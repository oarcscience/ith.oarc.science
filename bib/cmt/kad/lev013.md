### [Leviticus Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 13:1</span></span>

Leprosy. - The law for leprosy, the observance of which is urged upon
the people again in [Deu 24:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#008.md),
treats, in the first place, of leprosy in men: (a) in its dangerous
forms when appearing either on the skin (vv. 2-28), or on the head and
beard ([Lev 13:29-37](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#029)); (b.md) in harmless
forms ([Lev 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#038.md) and [Lev
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#039)); and (c.md) when appearing on a
bald head ([Lev 13:40-44](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#040).md). To this
there are added instructions for the removal of the leper from the
society of other men ([Lev 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md) and
[Lev 13:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046).md). It treats, secondly, of
leprosy in linen, woollen, and leather articles, and the way to treat
them ([Lev 13:47-59](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#047).md); thirdly, of the
purification of persons recovered from leprosy (Lev 14:1-32); and
fourthly, of leprosy in houses and the way to remove it (vv. 33-53). -
The laws for leprosy in man relate exclusively to the so-called white
leprosy, λεύκη λέπρα, lepra, which probably existed at that time in
hither Asia alone, not only among the Israelites and Jews ([Num
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010.md).; [Sa2
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#029.md); [Kg2
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027.md); [Kg2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003.md); [Kg2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005.md); [Mat
8:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002.md); [Mat
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008.md); [Mat
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#005.md); [Mat
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#006), etc..md), but also among the
Syrians ([Kg2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001)..md), and which is
still found in that part of the world, most frequently in the countries
of the Lebanon and Jordan and in the neighbourhood of Damascus, in which
city there are three hospitals for lepers (Seetzen, pp. 277, 278), and
occasionally in Arabia (Niebuhr, Arab. pp. 135ff.) and Egypt; though at
the present time the pimply leprosy, lepra tuberosa s. articulorum (the
leprosy of the joints), is more prevalent in the East, and frequently
occurs in Egypt in the lower extremities in the form of elephantiasis.
Of the white leprosy (called Lepra Mosaica), which is still met with in
Arabia sometimes, where it is called Baras, Trusen gives the following
description: "Very frequently, even for years before the actual outbreak
of the disease itself, white, yellowish spots are seen lying deep in the
skin, particularly on the genitals, in the face, on the forehead, or in
the joints. They are without feeling, and sometimes cause the hair to
assume the same colour as the spots. These spots afterwards pierce
through the cellular tissue, and reach the muscles and bones. The hair
becomes white and woolly, and at length falls off; hard gelatinous
swellings are formed in the cellular tissue; the skin gets hard, rough,
and seamy, lymph exudes from it, and forms large scabs, which fall off
from time to time, and under these there are often offensive running
sores. The nails then swell, curl up, and fall off; entropium is formed,
with bleeding gums, the nose stopped up, and a considerable flow of
saliva... The senses become dull, the patient gets thin and weak,
colliquative diarrhea sets in, and incessant thirst and burning fever
terminate his sufferings" (Krankheiten d. alten Hebr. p. 165).

[Leviticus 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 13:2</span></span>

The symptoms of leprosy, whether proceeding directly from eruptions in
the skin, or caused by a boil or burn. - [Lev
13:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#002.md). The first case: "When a man
shall have in the skin of his flesh (body) a raised spot or scab, or a
bright spot." שׂאת, a lifting up ([Gen
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007), etc..md), signifies here an
elevation of the skin in some part of the body, a raised spot like a
pimple. ספּחת, an eruption, scurf, or scab, from ספח to pour out, "a
pouring out as it were from the flesh or skin" (Knobel). בּהרת .)le,
from בּהר, in the Arabic and Chaldee to shine, is a bright swollen spot
in the skin. If ether of these signs became "a spot of leprosy," the
person affected was to be brought to the priest, that he might examine
the complaint. The term zaraath, from an Arabic word signifying to
strike down or scourge, is applied to leprosy as a scourge of God, and
in the case of men it always denotes the white leprosy, which the Arabs
call baras. נגע, a stroke (lit., "stroke of leprosy"), is applied not
only to the spot attacked by the leprosy, the leprous mole ([Lev
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003.md), [Lev
13:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#029.md), [Lev
13:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#042), etc..md), but to the persons and
even to things affected with leprosy ([Lev
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#004.md), [Lev
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#012.md), [Lev
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#013.md), [Lev
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#031.md), [Lev
13:50](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#050.md), [Lev
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#055).md).

[Lev 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003.md)

A person so diseased was to be pronounced unclean, (a) if the hair of
his head had turned white on the mole, i.e., if the dark hair which
distinguished the Israelites had become white; and (b) if the appearance
of the mole was deeper than the skin of the flesh, i.e., if the spot,
where the mole was, appeared depressed in comparison with the rest of
the skin. In that case it was leprosy. These signs are recognised by
modern observers (e.g., Hensler); and among the Arabs leprosy is
regarded as curable if the hair remains black upon the white spots, but
incurable if it becomes whitish in colour.

[Lev 13:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#004.md)

But if the bright spot was white upon the skin, and its appearance was
not deeper than the skin, and the place therefore was not sunken, nor
the hair turned white, the priest was to shut up the leper, i.e.,
preclude him from intercourse with other men, for seven days, and on the
seventh day examine him again. If he then found that the mole still
stood, i.e., remained unaltered, "in his eyes," or in his view, that it
had not spread any further, he was to shut him up for seven days more.
And if, on further examination upon the seventh day, he found that the
mole had become paler, had lost its brilliant whiteness, and had not
spread, he was to declare him clean, for it was a scurf, i.e., a mere
skin eruption, and not true leprosy. The person who had been pronounced
clean, however, was to wash his clothes, to change himself from even the
appearance of leprosy, and then to be clean.

[Lev 13:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#007.md)

But if the scurf had spread upon the skin "after his (first) appearance
before the priest with reference to his cleansing," i.e., to be examined
concerning his purification; and if the priest notice this on his second
appearance, he was to declare him unclean, for in that case it was
leprosy.

[Lev 13:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#009.md)

The second case ([Lev 13:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#009).md): if the
leprosy broke out without previous eruptions.

[Lev 13:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#009.md)

"If a mole of leprosy is in a man, and the priest to whom he is brought
sees that there is a white rising in the skin, and this has turned the
hair white, and there is raw (proud) flesh upon the elevation, it is an
old leprosy." The apodosis to [Lev
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#009.md) and [Lev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#010.md) commences with [Lev
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#011.md). חי בּשׂר living, i.e., raw,
proud flesh. מחיה the preservation of life ([Gen
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#005).md), sustenance ([Jdg
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#004).md); here, in [Lev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#010.md) and [Lev
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#024.md), it signifies life in the sense
of that which shows life, not a blow or spot (נגע, from מחה to strike),
as it is only in a geographical sense that the verb has this
signification, viz., to strike against, or reach as far as ([Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011).md). If the priest found that the
evil was an old, long-standing leprosy, he was to pronounce the man
unclean, and not first of all to shut him up, as there was no longer any
doubt about the matter.

[Lev 13:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#012.md)

If, on the other hand, the leprosy broke out blooming on the skin, and
covered the whole of the skin from head to foot "with regard to the
whole sight of the eyes of the priest," i.e., as far as his eyes could
see, the priest was to pronounce the person clean. "He has turned quite
white," i.e., his dark body has all become white. The breaking out of
the leprous matter in this complete and rapid way upon the surface of
the whole body was the crisis of the disease; the diseased matter turned
into a scurf, which died away and then fell off.

[Lev 13:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#014.md)

"But in the day when proud flesh appears upon him, he is unclean,...the
proud flesh is unclean; it is leprosy." That is to say, if proud flesh
appeared after the body had been covered with a white scurf, with which
the diseased matter had apparently exhausted itself, the disease was not
removed, and the person affected with it was to be pronounced unclean.

The third case: if the leprosy proceeded from an abscess which had been
cured. In [Lev 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#018.md) בּשׂר is first of
all used absolutely, and then resumed with בּו, and the latter again is
more closely defined in בּעורו: "if there arises in the flesh, in him,
in his skin, an abscess, and (it) is healed, and there arises in the
place of the abscess a white elevation, or a spot of a reddish white, he
(the person so affected) shall appear at the priest's."

[Lev 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#020.md)

If the priest found the appearance of the diseased spot lower than the
surrounding skin, and the hair upon it turned white, he was to pronounce
the person unclean. "It is a mole of leprosy: it has broken out upon the
abscess."

[Lev 13:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#021.md)

But if the hair had not turned white upon the spot, and there was no
depression on the skin, and it (the spot) was pale, the priest was to
shut him up for seven days. If the mole spread upon the skin during this
period, it was leprosy; but if the spot stood in its place, and had not
spread, it was השּׁחין צרבת, "the closing of the abscess:" literally
"the burning;" here, that part of the skin or flesh which has been burnt
up or killed by the inflammation or abscess, and gradually falls off as
scurf (Knobel).

[Lev 13:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#024.md)

The fourth case ([Lev 13:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#024).md): if
there was a burnt place upon the skin of the flesh (מבות־אשׁ, a spot
where he had burnt himself with fire, the scar of a burn), and the "life
of the scar" - i.e., the skin growing or forming upon the scar (see [Lev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#010).md), - "becomes a whitish red, or
white spot," i.e., if it formed itself into a bright swollen spot. This
was to be treated exactly like the previous case. המּכוה שׂאת ([Lev
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#028).md), rising of the scar of the
burn, i.e., a rising of the flesh and skin growing out of the scar of
the burn.

[Leviticus 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 13:29</span></span>

Leprosy upon the head or chin. - If the priest saw a mole upon the head
or chin of a man or woman, the appearance of which was deeper than the
skin, and on which the hair was yellow (צהב golden, reddish, fox-colour)
and thin, he was to regard it as נתק. Leprosy on the head or chin is
called נתק, probably from נתק to pluck or tear, from its plucking out
the hair, or causing it to fall off; like κνήφη, the itch, from κνάω, to
itch or scratch, and scabies, from scabere. But if he did not observe
these two symptoms, if there was no depression of the skin, and the hair
was black and not yellow, he was to shut up the person affected for
seven days. In בּו אין שׁחר ([Lev
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#031).md) there is certainly an error of
the text: either שׁחר must be retained and אין dropped, or שׁהר must be
altered into צהב, according to [Lev
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#037.md). The latter is probably the
better of the two.

[Leviticus 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 13:32</span></span>

If the mole had not spread by that time, and the two signs mentioned
were not discernible, the person affected was to shave himself, but not
to shave the nethek, the eruption or scurfy place, and the priest was to
shut him up for seven days more, and then to look whether any alteration
had taken place; and if not, to pronounce him clean, whereupon he was to
wash his clothes (see [Lev 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#006).md).

[Leviticus 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 13:35</span></span>

But if the eruption spread even after his purification, the priest, on
seeing this, was not to look for yellow hair. "He is unclean:" that is
to say, he was to pronounce him unclean without searching for yellow
hairs; the spread of the eruption was a sufficient proof of the leprosy.

[Leviticus 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lev 13:37</span></span>

But if, on the contrary, the eruption stood (see [Lev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#005).md), and black hair grew out of it,
he was healed, and the person affected was to be declared clean.

[Leviticus 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lev 13:38</span></span>

Harmless leprosy. - This broke out upon the skin of the body in בּהרת
plaits, "white rings." If these were dull or a pale white, it was the
harmless bohak, ἀλφός (lxx), which did not defile, and which even the
Arabs, who still call it bahak, consider harmless. It is an eruption
upon the skin, appearing in somewhat elevated spots or rings of inequal
sizes and a pale white colour, which do not change the hair; it causes
no inconvenience, and lasts from two months to two years.

[Leviticus 13:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">lev 13:40</span></span>

The leprosy of bald heads. - קרח is a head bald behind; גּבּח, in front,
"bald from the side, or edge of his face, i.e., from the forehead and
temples." Bald heads of both kinds were naturally clean.

[Leviticus 13:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">lev 13:42</span></span>

But if a white reddish mole was formed upon the bald place before or
behind, it was leprosy breaking out upon it, and was to be recognised by
the fact that the rising of the mole had the appearance of leprosy on
the skin of the body. In that case the person was unclean, and to be
pronounced so by the priest. "On his head is his plague of leprosy,"
i.e., he has it in his head.

[Leviticus 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">lev 13:45</span></span>

With regard to the treatment of lepers, the lawgiver prescribed that
they should wear mourning costume, rend their clothes, leave the hair of
their head in disorder (see at [Lev
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006).md), keep the beard covered ([Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md), [Eze
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#022).md), and cry "Unclean, unclean,"
that every one might avoid them for fear of being defiled ([Lam
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015).md); and as long as the disease
lasted they were to dwell apart outside the camp ([Num
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#002.md)., [Num
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010.md)., cf. [Kg2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005.md); [Kg2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003).md),

(Note: At the present day there are pest-houses specially set apart for
lepers outside the towns. In Jerusalem they are situated against the
Zion-gate (see Robinson, Pal. i.p. 364).)

a rule which implies that the leper rendered others unclean by contact.
From this the Rabbins taught, that by merely entering a house, a leper
polluted everything within it (Mishnah, Kelim i. 4; Negaim xiii. 11).

[Leviticus 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">lev 13:47</span></span>

Leprosy in linen, woollen, and leather fabrics and clothes. - The only
wearing apparel mentioned in [Lev
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#047.md) is either woollen or linen, as
in [Deu 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#011.md); [Hos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#007.md); [Pro
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#013.md); and among the ancient Egyptians
and ancient Greeks these were the materials usually worn. In [Lev
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#048.md). שׁתי and ערב, "the flax and the
wool," i.e., for linen and woollen fabrics, are distinguished from
clothes of wool or flax. The rendering given to these words by the early
translators is στήμων and κρόκη, stamen et subtegmen (lxx, Vulg.), i.e.,
warp and weft. The objection offered to this rendering, that warp and
weft could not be kept so separate from one another, that the one could
be touched and rendered leprous without the other, has been met by
Gussetius by the simple but correct remark, that the reference is to the
yarn prepared for the warp and weft, and not to the woven fabrics
themselves. So long as the yarn was not woven into a fabric, the
warp-yarn and weft-yarn might very easily be separated and lie in
different places, so that the one could be injured without the other. In
this case the yarn intended for weaving is distinguished from the woven
material, just as the leather is afterwards distinguished from
leather-work ([Lev 13:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#049).md). The signs
of leprosy were, if the mole in the fabric was greenish or reddish. In
that case the priest was to shut up the thing affected with leprosy for
seven days, and then examine it. If the mole had spread in the meantime,
it was a "grievous leprosy." ממארת, from מאר irritavit, recruduit
(vulnus), is to be explained, as it is by Bochart, as signifying lepra
exasperata. הנּגע ממארת making the mole bad or angry; not, as Gesenius
maintains, from מאר = מרר acerbum faciens, i.e., dolorem acerbum
excitans, which would not apply to leprosy in fabrics and houses ([Lev
14:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#044).md), and is not required by [Eze
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024.md). All such fabrics were to be
burned as unclean.

[Leviticus 13:53](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">lev 13:53</span></span>

If the mole had not spread during the seven days, the priest was to
cause the fabric in which the mole appeared to be washed, and then shut
it up for seven days more. If the mole did not alter its appearance
after being washed, even though it had not spread, the fabric was
unclean, and was therefore to be burned. "It is a corroding in the back
and front" (of the fabric of leather). פּחתת, from פּחת, in Syriac
fodit, from which comes פּחת a pit, lit., a digging: here a corroding
depression. קרחת a bald place in the front or right side, גּבּחת a bald
place in the back or left side of the fabric or leather.

[Leviticus 13:56](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">lev 13:56</span></span>

But if the mole had turned pale by the seventh day after the washing, it
(the place of the mole) was to be separated (torn off) from the clothes,
leather or yarn, and then (as is added afterwards in [Lev
13:58](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#058).md) the garment or fabric from
which the mole had disappeared was to be washed a second time, and would
then be clean.

[Leviticus 13:57](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">lev 13:57</span></span>

But if the mole appeared again in any such garment or cloth, i.e., if it
appeared again after this, it was a leprosy bursting forth afresh, and
the thing affected with it was to be burned. Leprosy in linen and
woollen fabrics or clothes, and in leather, consisted in all probability
in nothing but so-called mildew, which commonly arises from damp and
want of air, and consists, in the case of linen, of round, partially
coloured spots, which spread, and gradually eat up the fabric, until it
falls to pieces like mould. In leather the mildew consists most strictly
of "holes eaten in," and is of a "greenish, reddish, or whitish colour,
according to the species of the delicate cryptogami by which it has been
formed."
