### [Jeremiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 10:1</span></span>

Warning against idolatry by means of a view of the nothingness of the
false gods ([Jer 10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001)), and a
counter-view of the almighty and everlasting God ([Jer
10:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006)) and of His governing care in
the natural world. This warning is but a further continuation of the
idea of [Jer 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023), that Israel's glory
should consist in Jahveh who doth grace, right, and justice upon earth.
In order thoroughly to impress this truth on the backsliding and
idolatrous people, Jeremiah sets forth the nullity of the gods feared by
the heathen, and, by showing how these gods are made of wood, plated
with silver and gold, proves that these dead idols, which have neither
life nor motion, cannot be objects of fear; whereas Jahveh is God in
truth, a living and everlasting God, before whose anger the earth
trembles, who has created the earth, and rules it, who in the day of
visitation will also annihilate the false gods.

(Note: This whole passage is declared by Movers (de utr. rec. Jer. p.
43), de W., Hitz., and Ng. to be spurious and a late interpolation;
because, as they allege, it interrupts the continuity, because its
matter brings us down to the time of the Babylonian exile, and because
the language of it diverges in many respects from Jeremiah's. Against
these arguments Kper, Haev., Welte, and others have made a Stand. See my
Manual of Introd. 75, 1. - By the exhibition of the coherence of the
thought given in the text, we have already disposed of the argument on
which most stress is laid by the critics referred to, the alleged
interruption of the connection. How little weight this argument is
entitled to, may over and above be seen from the fact that Graf holds
[Jer 9:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022) to be an interpolation,
by reason of the want of connection; in which view neither Movers
preceded him, nor has Hitz. or Ng. followed Him. The second reason, that
the subject-matter brings us down to the time of the exile, rests upon a
misconception of the purpose in displaying the nothingness of the false
gods. In this there is presupposed neither a people as yet unspotted by
idolatry, nor a people purified therefrom; but, in order to fill the
heart with a warmer love for the living God and Lord of the world,
Israel's own God, the bias towards the idols, deep-seated in the hearts
of the people, is taken to task and attacked in that which lies at its
root, namely, the fear of the power of the heathen's gods. Finally, as
to the language of the passage, Movers tried to show that the whole not
only belonged to the time of the pseudo-Isaiah, but that it was from his
hand. Against this Graf has pronounced emphatically, with the remark
that the similarity is not greater than is inevitable in the discussion
of the same subject; whereas, he says, the diversity in expression is so
great, that it does not even give us any reason to suppose that the
author of this passage had the pseudo-Isaiah before him when he was
writing. This assertion is certainly an exaggeration; but it contains
thus much of truth, that along with individual similarities in
expression, the diversities are so great as to put out of the question
all idea of the passage's having been written by the author of Isa
40-56. In several verses Jeremiah's characteristic mode of expression is
unmistakeable. Such are the frequent use of הבל for the idols, [Jer
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003) and [Jer
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015), cf. [Jer
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019); [Jer
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022), and עת פּקדּתם, [Jer
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015), cf. [Jer
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#012); [Jer
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#021); [Jer
50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027), neither of which occurs in the
second part of Isaiah; and הובישׁ, [Jer
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014), for which Isaiah uses בּושׁ,
[Isa 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#017); [Isa
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#011). Further, in passages cognate in
sense the expression is quite different; cf. [Jer
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#004) and [Jer
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009) with [Isa
40:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019); [Isa
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007), where we find ימּוט instead of
יפיק, which is not used by Isaiah in the sense of "move;" cf. [Jer
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005) with [Isa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007) and [Isa
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023); [Jer
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012) with [Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018). Finally, the two common
expressions cannot prove anything, because they are found in other
books, as שׁבט נחלתו, [Jer 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016) and
[Isa 63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017), derived from [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009); or יהוה צבאות , which is used
frequently by Amos; cf. [Amo 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013);
[Amo 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027), [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008); [Amo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006), cf. with [Jer
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002). - Even נסך in the sense of
molten image in [Jer 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014), as in [Isa
41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029); [Isa
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005), is found also in [Dan
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008); consequently this use of the
word is no peculiarity of the second part of Isaiah.)

[Jer 10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001)

The nothingness of the false gods. - [Jer
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001). "Hear the word which Jahveh
speaketh unto you, house of Israel! [Jer
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#002). Thus saith Jahveh: To the ways
of the heathen use yourselves not, and at the signs of the heaven be not
dismayed, because the heathen are dismayed at them. [Jer
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003). For the ordinances of the
peoples are vain. For it is wood, which one hath cut out of the forest,
a work of the craftsman's hands with the axe. [Jer
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#004). With silver and with gold he
decks it, with nails and hammers they fasten it, that it move not. [Jer
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005). As a lathe-wrought pillar are
they, and speak not; they are borne, because they cannot walk. Be not
afraid of them; for they do not hurt, neither is it in them to do good."

This is addressed to the house of Israel, i.e., to the whole covenant
people; and "house of Israel" points back to "all the house of Israel"
in [Jer 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025). עליכם for אליכם, as
frequently in Jeremiah. The way of the heathen is their mode of life,
especially their way of worshipping their gods; cf. ἡ ὁδὸς, [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002); [Act
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009). למד c. אל, accustom oneself to a
thing, used in [Jer 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021) with the
synonymous על, and in [Psa 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035)
(Piel) with ל. The signs of heaven are unwonted phenomena in the
heavens, eclipses of the sun and moon, comets, and unusual conjunctions
of the stars, which were regarded as the precursors of extraordinary and
disastrous events. We cannot admit Hitz.'s objection, that these signs
in heaven were sent by Jahveh ([Joe
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003)), and that before these, as
heralds of judgment, not only the heathen, but the Jews themselves, had
good cause to be dismayed. For the signs that marked the dawning of the
day of the Lord are not merely such things as eclipses of sun and moon,
and the like. There is still less ground for Ng.'s idea, that the signs
of heaven are such as, being permanently there, call forth religious
adoration from year to year, the primitive constellations ([Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009)), the twelve signs of the zodiac;
for תּחתּוּ( נחת), to be in fear, consternari, never means, even in [Mal
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005), regular or permanent adoration.
"For the heathen," etc., gives the cause of the fear: the heathen are
dismayed before these, because in the stars they adored supernatural
powers.

[Jer 10:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003)

The reason of the warning counsel: The ordinances of the peoples, i.e.,
the religious ideas and customs of the heathen, are vanity. הוּא refers
to and is in agreement with the predicate; cf. Ew. 319, c. The vanity of
the religious ordinances of the heathen is proved by the vanity of their
gods. "For wood, which one has hewn out of the forest," sc. it is, viz.,
the god. The predicate is omitted, and must be supplied from הבל, a word
which is in the plural used directly for the false gods; cf. [Jer
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019); [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021), etc. With the axe, sc. wrought.
מעצד Rashi explains as axe, and suitably; for here it means in any case
a carpenter's tool, whereas this is doubtful in [Isa
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#012). The images were made of wood,
which was covered with silver plating and gold; cf. [Isa
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022); [Isa
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019). This Jeremiah calls adorning
them, making them fair with silver and gold. When the images were
finished, they were fastened in their places with hammer and nails, that
they might not tumble over; cf. [Isa
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007); [Isa
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#020). When thus complete, they are
like a lathe-wrought pillar. In [Jdg
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#005), where alone this word elsewhere
occurs. תּמר means palm-tree (=תּמר); here, by a later, derivative
usage, = pillar, in support of which we can appeal to the Talmudic
תּמּר, columnam facere, and to the O.T. תּימרה, pillar of smoke. מקשׁה
is the work of the turning-lathe, [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018), [Exo
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031), etc. Lifeless and motionless as
a turned pillar.

(Note: Ew., Hitz., Graf, Ng. follow in the track of Movers, Phniz. i. S.
622, who takes מקשׁה se acc. to [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008) for a cucumber garden, and, acc.
to Epist. Jerem. v. 70, understands by תּמר מקשׁה the figure of Priapus
in a cucumber field, serving as a scare-crow. But even if we admit that
there is an allusion to the verse before us in the mockery of the gods
in the passage of Epist. Jerem. quoted, running literally as follows:
ὧσπερ γὰρ ἐν οἰκυηράτῳ προβασκάνιον οὐδὲν φυλάσσον, οὕτως οἱ θεοὶ αὐτῶν
εἰσὶ ξύλινοι καὶ περίχρυσοι καὶ περιάργυροι; and if we further admit
that the author was led to make his comparison by his understanding
מקשׁה in [Isa 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008) of a cucumber
garden; - yet his comparison has so little in common with our verse in
point of form, that it cannot at all be regarded as a translation of it,
or serve as a rule for the interpretation of the phrase in question. And
besides it has yet to be proved that the Israelites were in the habit of
setting up images of Priapus as scare-crows.)

Not to be able to speak is to be without life; not to walk, to take not
a single step, i.e., to be without all power of motion; cf. [Isa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007). The Chald. paraphrases
correctly: quia non est in iis spiritus vitalis ad ambulandum. The
incorrect form ינּשׂוּא for ינּשׂאוּ is doubtless only a copyist's
error, induced by the preceding נשׂוא. They can do neither good nor
evil, neither hurt nor help; cf. [Isa
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023). אותם for אתּם, as frequently;
see on [Jer 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016).

[Jer 10:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006)

The almighty power of Jahveh, the living God. - [Jer
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006). "None at all is like Thee,
Jahveh; great art Thou, and Thy name is great in might. [Jer
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007). Who would not fear Thee, Thou
King of the peoples? To Thee doth it appertain; for among all the wise
men of the peoples, and in all their kingdoms, there is none at all like
unto Thee. [Jer 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008). But they are all
together brutish and foolish; the teaching of the vanities is wood. [Jer
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009). Beaten silver, from Tarshish it
is brought, and gold from Uphaz, work of the craftsman and of the hands
of the goldsmith; blue and red purple is their clothing; the work of
cunning workmen are they all. [Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010). But Jahveh is God in truth, He
is living God and everlasting King; at His wrath the earth trembles, and
the peoples abide not His indignation. [Jer
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011). Thus shall ye say unto them:
The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall
perish from the earth and from under the heavens."

In this second strophe Jahveh is contrasted, as the only true God and
Lord of the world, with the lifeless gods. These there is no need to
fear, but it behoves all to fear the almighty God, since in His wrath He
can destroy nations. When compared with [Psa
86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008), the מן in מאין seems redundant -
so much so, that Ven. pronounces it a copyist's error, and Hitz. sets it
aside by changing the vowels. The word as it stands contains a double
negation, and is usually found only in dependent clauses with a strong
negative force: so that there is none. Here it has the same force, but
at the beginning of the sentence: none at all is as Thou; cf. Ew. 323,
a. Great is Thy name, i.e., the manifestation of Thee in the world, in
Thy government of the earth. "In (or with) might" belongs to "great:"
great with might, displaying itself in acts of might; cf. [Jer
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021). Who would not fear Thee? a
negative setting of the thought: every one must fear Thee. King of the
nations; cf. [Psa 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029); [Psa
47:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#008); [Psa
96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010). יאתה from יאה, ἁπ. λεγ..
equivalent to נאה (whence נאוה), to be seemly, suitable. Among the wise
men of the peoples none is like Thee, so as that any should be able to
make head against Thee by any clever stroke; cf. [Isa
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#012); [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014). Nor is there in any kingdom of
the peoples any one like Jahveh, i.e., in might. It is not merely
earthly kings that are meant, but the gods of the heathen as well. In no
heathen kingdom is there any power to be compared with Jahveh. We are
led here to think also of the pagan gods by [Jer
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008), where the wisdom and almighty
power of the living God are contrasted with foolishness and vanity of
the false gods. בּאחת is not: in uno = in una re, sc. idololatria
(Rabb.); nor is it, as Hitz. in most strained fashion makes it: by means
of one thing, i.e., by (or at) a single word, the word which comes
immediately after: it is wood. אחת is unquestionably neuter, and the
force of it here is collective, = all together, like the Chald. כחדא.
The nominative to "are brutish" is "the peoples." The verb בּער is
denom. from בּעיר, to be brutish, occurring elsewhere in the Kal only in
[Psa 94:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008), Ezek. 21:36; in the Niph.
[Jer 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014), [Jer
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021), [Jer
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#017); [Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011). כּסל as verb is found only
here; elsewhere we have כּסיל, foolish, and כּסל, folly ([Sol
7:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001) :25), and, as a verb, the
transposed form סכל. The remaining words of the verse make up one
clause; the construction is the same as in [Jer
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003), but the sense is not: "a mere
vain doctrine is the wood," i.e., the idol is itself but a doctrine of
vanities. In this way Ew. takes it, making "wood" the subject of the
clause and מוּסר the predicate. מוּסר הבלים is the antithesis to מוּסר
יהוה, [Deu 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#002); [Pro
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011); [Job
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017). As the latter is the παιδεία of
the Lord, so the former is the παιδεία of the false gods (הבלים, cf.
[Jer 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019)). The παιδεία of Jahveh
displayed itself, acc. to [Deu 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#002),
in deeds of might by means of which Jahveh set His people Israel free
from the power of Egypt. Consequently it is the education of Israel by
means of acts of love and chastenings, or, taken more generally, the
divine leading and guidance of the people. Such a παιδεία the null and
void gods could not give to their worshippers. Their παιδεία is wood,
i.e., not: wooden, but nothing else than that which the gods themselves
are - wood, which, however it be decked up ([Jer
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009)), remains a mere lifeless block.
So that the thought of [Jer 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008) is
this: The heathen, with all their wise men, are brutish; since their
gods, from which they should receive wisdom and instruction, are wood.
Starting from this, [Jer 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009)
continues to this effect: However much this wood be decked out with
silver, gold, and purple raiment, it remains but the product of men's
hands; by no such process does the wood become a god. The description of
the polishing off of the wood into a god is loosely attached to the
predicate עץ, by way of an enumeration of the various things made use of
therefore. The specification served to make the picture the more
graphic; what idols were made of was familiar to everybody. מרקּע, beat
out into thin plates for coating over the wooden image; cf. [Exo
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#003); [Num
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#003). As to תּרשׁישׁ, Tartessus in
Spain, the source of the silver, see on [Eze
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#012). Gold from Ophir; אוּפז here and
[Dan 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005) is only a dialectical
variety of אופיר, see on [Kg1 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#027). As
the blue and red purple, see on [Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004). חכמים, skilful artisans, cf.
[Isa 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#020). They all, i.e., all the
idols.

[Jer 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010)

Whereas Jahveh is really and truly God. אלהים (standing in apposition),
God in truth, "truth" being strongly contrasted with "vanity," and
"living God" (cf. [Deu 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#023)) with the
dead gods ([Jer 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005), [Jer
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008)); and everlasting King of the
whole world (cf. [Psa 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016); [Psa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010); [Exo
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#018)), before whose wrath the earth
trembles and the peoples quake with terror; cf. [Nah
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005); [Joe
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011); [Psa
97:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#005). לא יכלוּ (written as in [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013)), they hold not, do not hold out,
do not endure.

[Jer 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011)

[Jer 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011) is Chaldee. But it must not
be regarded as a gloss that has found its way into the text, on the
grounds on which Houb., Ven., Ros., Ew., Hitz., Gr., etc., so regard it,
namely, because it is Chaldee, and because there is an immediate
connection between [Jer 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010) and [Jer
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012). Both the language in which the
verse is written, and the subject-matter of it, are unfavourable to this
view. The latter does not bear the character of a gloss; and no copyist
would have interpolated a Chaldee verse into the Hebrew text. Besides,
the verse is found in the Alexandrian version; and in point of sense it
connects very suitably with [Jer 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010)
: Jahveh is everlasting King, whereas the gods which have not made
heaven and earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens.
This the Israelites are to say to the idolaters. ארקא is the harder form
for ארעא. The last word, אלּה, is Hebrew; it does not belong to שׁמיּא,
but serves to emphasize the subject: the gods - these shall perish.
Jeremiah wrote the verse in Chaldee, ut Judaeis suggerat, quomodo
Chaldaeis (ad quos non nisi Chaldaice loqui poterant) paucis verbis
respondendum sit, as Seb. Schm has remarked. The thought of this verse
is a fitting conclusion to the exhortation not to fear the gods of the
heathen; it corresponds to the 5th verse, with which the first strophe
concludes the warning against idolatry The Israelites are not only not
to fear the null and void gods of the heathen, but they are to tell the
heathen that their gods will perish from the earth and from under the
heavens.

[Jer 10:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012)

The third strophe. - In it the almighty power of the living God is shown
from His providential government of nature, the overthrow of the false
gods in the time of judgment is declared, and, finally, the Creator of
the universe is set forth as the God of Israel. - [Jer
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012). "That made the earth by His
power, that founded the world by His wisdom, and by His understanding
stretched out the heavens. [Jer 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013).
When He thundering makes the roar of waters in the heavens, He causes
clouds to rise from the ends of the earth, makes lightnings for the
rain, and brings the wind forth out of His treasuries. [Jer
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014). Brutish becomes every man
without knowledge; ashamed is every goldsmith by reason of the image,
for falsehood is his molten image, and there is no spirit in them. [Jer
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015). Vanity are they, a work of
mockery; in the time of their visitation they perish. [Jer
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016). Not like these is the portion
of Jacob: the framer of (the) all is He, and Israel is the stock of His
inheritance: Jahveh of hosts is His name."

In point of form, "that made the earth," etc., connects with "Jahveh
God," [Jer 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010); but in respect of
its matter, the description of God as Creator of heaven and earth is led
up to by the contrast: The gods which have not made the heaven and the
earth shall perish. The subject to עשׂה and the following verbs is not
expressed, but may be supplied from the contrasted statement of [Jer
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011), or from the substance of the
several statements in [Jer 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012). The
connection may be taken thus: The true God is the one making the earth
by His power = is He that made, etc. As the creation of the earth is a
work of God's almighty power, so the establishing, the founding of it
upon the waters ([Psa 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002)) is an act
of divine wisdom, and the stretching out of the heavens over the earth
like a tent ([Isa 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022); [Psa
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002)) is a work of intelligent
design. On this cf. [Isa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005); [Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024); [Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018); [Isa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013). Every thunder-storm bears
witness to the wise and almighty government of God, [Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013). The words לקול are difficult.
Acc. to Ew. ֗307, b, they stand for לתּתּו קול: when He gives His voice,
i.e., when He thunders. In support of this it may be said, that the
mention of lightnings, rain, and wind suggests such an interpretation.
But the transposition of the words cannot be justified. Hitz. has justly
remarked: The putting of the accusative first, taken by itself, might
do; but not when it must at the same time be stat. constr., and when its
genitive thus separated from it would assume the appearance of being an
accusative to תּתּו. Besides, we would expect לתת קולו rather than
לתּתּו קול. קול תּתּו cannot grammatically be rendered: the voice which
He gives, as Ng. would have it, but: the voice of His giving; and "roar
of waters" must be the accusative of the object, governed by תּתּו.
Hence we must protest against the explanation of L. de Dieu: ad vocem
dationis ejus multitudo aquarum est in caelo, at least if ad vocem
dationis is tantamount to simul ac dat. Just as little can לקול taken by
itself mean thunder, so that ad vocem should, with Schnur., be
interpreted by tonitru est dare ejus multitudinem aquae. The only
grammatically feasible explanation is the second of those proposed by L.
de Dieu: ad vocem dandi ipsum, i.e., qua dat vel ponit multitudinem
aquarum. So Hitz.: at the roar of His giving wealth of waters.
Accordingly we expound: at the noise, when He gives the roar of waters
in heaven, He raises up clouds from the ends of the earth; taking, as we
do, the ויּעלה to be a ו consec. introducing the supplementary clause.
The voice or noise with which God gives the roar or the fulness of
waters in the heaven, is the sound of the thunder. With this the
gathering of the dark thunder-clouds is put into causal connection, as
it appears to be to the eye; for during the thunder we see the
thunder-clouds gather thicker and darker on the horizon. נשׂיא, the
ascended, poetic word for cloud. Lightnings for the rain; i.e., since
the rain comes as a consequence of the lightning, for the lightning
seems to rend the clouds and let them pour their water out on the earth.
Thunder-storms are always accompanied by a strong wind. God causes the
wind to go forth from His store-chambers, where He has it also under
custody, and blow over the earth. See a like simile of the
store-chambers of the snow and hail, [Job
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022). From ויּעלה onwards, this verse
is repeated in [Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007).

[Jer 10:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014)

In presence of such marvels of divine power and wisdom, all men seem
brutish and ignorant (away from knowledge = without knowledge), and all
makers of idols are put to shame "because of the image" which they make
for a god, and which is but a deception, has no breath of life. נסך,
prop. drink-offering, libamen, cf. [Jer
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#015); here molten image = מסּכה, as in
[Isa 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029); [Isa
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005); [Dan
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008). Vanity they are, these idols
made by the goldsmith. A work of mockings, i.e., that is exposed to
ridicule when the nullity of the things taken to be gods is clearly
brought to light. Others: A work which makes mockery of its worshippers,
befools and deludes them (Hitz., Ng.). In the time of their visitation,
cf. [Jer 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#015).

[Jer 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016)

Quite other is the portion of Jacob, i.e., the God who has fallen to the
lot of Jacob (the people of Israel) as inheritance. The expression is
formed after [Deu 4:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019), where it is
said of sun, moon, and stars that Jahveh has apportioned (חלק) them to
the heathen as gods, but has taken Israel that it may be to Him לעם
נחלה; accordingly Israel is in [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009) called חלק יהוה, while in [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005) David praises Jahveh as מנת־חלקו.
For He is the framer הכּל, i.e., of the universe. Israel is the stock of
His inheritance, i.e., the race which belongs to Him as a peculiar
possession. שׁבט נחלתו is like חבל נחלתו, [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009); in [Psa
74:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002) it is said of Mount Zion, and in
[Isa 63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017) it is used in the plural,
'שׁבטי נ, of the godly servants of the Lord. The name of this God, the
framer of the universe, is Jahveh of hosts - the God whom the hosts of
heaven, angels and stars, serve, the Lord and Ruler of the whole world;
cf. [Isa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013).

[Jeremiah 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 10:17</span></span>

The captivity of the people, their lamentation for the devastation of
the land, and entreaty that the punishment may be mitigated. - [Jer
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017). "Gather up thy bundle out of
the land, thou that sittest in the siege. [Jer
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#018). For thus hath Jahveh spoken:
Behold, I hurl forth the inhabitants of the land this time, and press
them hard, that they may find them. [Jer
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019). Woe is me for my hurt! grievous
is my stroke! yet I think: This is my suffering, and I will bear it!
[Jer 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020). My tent is despoiled, and
all my cords are rent asunder. My sons have forsaken me, and are gone:
none stretches forth my tent any more, or hangs up my curtains. [Jer
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021). For the shepherds are become
brutish, and have not sought Jahveh; therefore they have not dealt
wisely, and the whole flock is scattered. - [Jer
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#022). Hark! a rumour: behold, it
comes, and great commotion from the land of midnight, to make the cities
of Judah a desolation, an abode of jackals. - [Jer
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023). I know, Jahveh, that the way of
man is not in himself, nor in the man that walketh to fix his step. [Jer
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024). Chasten me, Jahveh, but
according to right; not in Thine anger, lest Thou make me little. [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025). Pour out Thy fury upon the
peoples that know Thee not, and upon the races that call not upon Thy
name! for they have devoured Jacob, have devoured him and made an end of
him, and laid his pastures waste."

[Jer 10:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017)

In [Jer 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017) the congregation of the
people is addressed, and captivity in a foreign land is announced to
them. This announcement stands in connection with [Jer
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025), in so far as captivity is the
accomplishment of the visitation of Judah threatened in [Jer
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024). That connection is not, however,
quite direct; the announcement is led up to by the warning against
idolatry of vv. 1-16, inasmuch as it furnishes confirmation of the
threat uttered in [Jer 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015), that the
idols shall perish in the day of their visitation, and shows besides
how, by its folly in the matter of idolatry, Judah has drawn judgment
down on itself. The confession in [Jer
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021) : the shepherds are become
brutish, points manifestly back to the description in [Jer
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014) of the folly of the idolaters,
and exhibits the connection of [Jer
10:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017) with the preceding warning
against idolatry. For "gather up," etc., Hitz. translates: gather thy
trumpery from the ground; so that the expression would have a
contemptuous tone. But the meaning of rubbish cannot be proved to belong
to כּנעה; and the mockery that would lie in the phrase is out of place.
כּנעה, from Arab. kǹ, contrahere, constipare, means that which is put
together, packed up, one's bundle. The connection of אסף and מארץ is
pregnant: put up thy bundle and carry it forth of the land. As N. G.
Schroeder suspected, there is about the expression something of the
nature of a current popular phrase, like the German Schnr dein Bndel,
pack up, i.e., make ready fore the road. She who sits in the siege. The
daughter of Zion is meant, but we must not limit the scope to the
population of Jerusalem; as is clear from "inhabitants of the land,"
[Jer 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#018), the population of the
whole land are comprised in the expression. As to the form יושׁבתי, see
at [Jer 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023). אספּי with dag. lene
after the sibilant, as in [Isa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002).
"I hurl forth" expresses the violent manner of the captivity; cf. [Isa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#017). "This time;" hitherto hostile
invasions ended with plundering and the imposition of a tribute: [Kg2
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#014); [Kg2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005); [Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013). - And I press them hard, or
close them in, למען ימצאוּ. These words are variously explained, because
there is no object expressed, and there may be variety of opinion as to
what is the subject. Hitz., Umbr., Ng., take the verb find in the sense
of feel, and so the object צרה would easily be supplied from the verb
הצרתי: so that they may feel it, i.e., I will press them sensibly. But
we cannot make sure of this meaning for מצא either from [Jer
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009) or from [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017), where know (ידע) and מצא are
clearly identical conceptions. Still less is Graf entitled to supply as
object: that which they seek and are to find, namely, God. His appeal in
support of this to passages like [Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006); [Deu
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#027) and [Deu
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029), proves nothing; for in such the
object is manifestly suggested by the contest, which is not the case
here. A just conclusion is obtained when we consider that הצרתי contains
a play on בּמּצור in [Jer 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017), and
cannot be understood otherwise than as a hemming in by means of a siege.
The aim of the siege is to bring those hemmed in under the power of the
besiegers, to get at, reach them, or find them. Hence we must take the
enemy as subject to "find," while the object is given in להם: so that
they (the enemy) may find them (the besieged). Thus too Jerome, who
translates the disputed verb passively: et tribulabo eos ut inveniantur;
while he explains the meaning thus: sic eos obsideri faciam, sicque
tribulabo et coangustabo, ut omnes in urbe reperiantur et effugere
nequeant malum. Taken thus, the second clause serves to strengthen the
first: I will hurl forth the inhabitants of this land into a foreign
land, and none shall avoid this fate, for I will so hem them in that
none shall be able to escape.

This harassment will bring the people to their senses, so that they
shall humble themselves under the mighty hand of God. Such feelings the
prophet utters at [Jer 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019)., in the
name of the congregation, as he did in the like passage [Jer
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019). As from the hearts of those who
had been touched by their affliction, he exclaims: Woe is me for my
breach! i.e., my crushing overthrow. The breach is that sustained by the
state in its destruction, see at [Jer
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006). נחלה, grown sick, i.e., grievous,
incurable is the stroke that has fallen upon me. For this word we have
in [Jer 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018) אנוּשׁה, which is
explained by "refuseth to be healed." ואני introduces an antithesis: but
I say, sc. in my heart, i.e., I think. Hitz. gives אך the force of a
limitation = nothing further than this, but wrongly; and, taking the
perf. אמרתּי as a preterite, makes out the import to be: "in their state
of careless security they had taken the matter lightly, saying as it
were, If no further calamity than this menace us, we may be well
content;" a thought quite foreign to the context. For "this my
suffering" can be nothing else than the "hurt" on account of which the
speaker laments, or the stroke which he calls dangerous, incurable. אך
has, besides, frequently the force of positive asseveration: yea,
certainly (cf. Ew. 354, a), a force readily derived from that of only,
nothing else than. And so here: only this, i.e., even this is my
suffering. חלי, sickness, here suffering in general, as in [Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013); [Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003)., etc. The old translators took
the Yod as pronoun (my suffering), whence it would be necessary to point
חלי, like גּוי, [Zep 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009); cf. Ew. 293,
b, Rem. - The suffering which the congregation must bear consists in the
spoliation of the land and the captivity of the people, represented in
[Jer 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020) under the figure of a
destruction of their tent and the disappearance of their sons. The
Chald. has fairly paraphrased the verse thus: my land is laid waste and
all my cities are plundered, my people has gone off (into exile) and is
no longer here. יצאני construed with the accus. like egredi urbem; cf.
Ge. 54:4, etc. - From "my sons have forsaken me" Ng. draws the inference
that [Jer 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019) and [Jer
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020) are the words of the country
personified, since neither the prophet could so speak, nor the people,
the latter being indeed identical with the sons, and so not forsaken,
but forsaking. This inference rests on a mistaken view of the figure of
the daughter of Zion, in which is involved the conception of the
inhabitants of a land as the children of the land when personified as
mother. Nor is there any evidence that the land is speaking in the
words: I think, This is my suffering, etc. It is besides alleged that
the words give no expression to any sense of guilt; they are said, on
the contrary, to give utterance to a consolation which only an innocent
land draws from the fact that a calamity is laid upon it, a calamity
which must straightway be borne. This is neither true in point of fact,
nor does it prove the case. The words, This is my suffering, etc.,
indicate resignation to the inevitable, not innocence or undeserved
suffering. Hereon Graf remarks: "The suffering was unmerited, in so far
as the prophet and the godly amongst the people were concerned; but it
was inevitable that he and they should take it upon their shoulders,
along with the rest." Asserted with so great width, this statement
cannot be admitted. The present generation bears the punishment not only
for the sins of many past generations, but for its own sins; nor were
the godly themselves free from sin and guilt, for they acknowledge the
justice of God's chastisement, and pray God to chasten them בּמשׁפּט,
not in anger ([Jer 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024)). Besides, we
cannot take the words as spoken by the prophet or by the godly as
opposed to the ungodly, since it is the sons of the speaker ("my sons")
that are carried captive, who can certainly not be the sons of the godly
alone.

[Jer 10:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021)

The cause of this calamity is that the shepherds, i.e., the princes and
leaders of the people (see on [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008); [Jer
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015)), are become brutish, have not
sought Jahveh, i.e., have not sought wisdom and guidance from the Lord.
And so they could not deal wisely, i.e., rule the people with wisdom.
השׂכּיל is here not merely: have prosperity, but: show wisdom, deal
wisely, securing thus the blessed results of wisdom. This is shown both
by the contrasted "become brutish" and by the parallel passage, [Jer
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015). מרעיתם, their pasturing,
equivalent to "flock of their pasturing," their flock, [Jer
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001).

The calamity over which the people mourns is drawing near, [Jer
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#022). Already is heard the tremendous
din of a mighty host which approaches from the north to make the cities
of Judah a wilderness. קול שׁמוּעה is an exclamation: listen to the
rumour, it is coming near. From a grammatical point of view the subject
to "comes" is "rumour," but in point of sense it is that of which the
rumour gives notice. Graf weakens the sense by gathering the words into
one assertory clause: "They hear a rumour come." The "great commotion"
is that of an army on the march, the clattering of the weapons, the
stamping and neighing of the war-horses; cf. [Jer
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#023); [Jer
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016). From the land of midnight, the
north, cf. [Jer 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014); [Jer
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006), etc. "To make the cities," etc.,
cf. [Jer 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007); [Jer
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010). - The rumour of the enemy's
approach drives the people to prayer, [Jer
10:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023). The prayer of these verses
is uttered in the name of the congregation. It begins with the
confession: Not with man is his way, i.e., it is not within man's power
to arrange the course of his life, nor in the power of the man who walks
to fix his step (וbefore הכין merely marking the connection of the
thought: cf. Ew. 348, a). The antithesis to לאדם and לאישׁ is ליהוה,
with God; cf. [Psa 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023); [Pro
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009) : Man's heart deviseth his way,
but Jahveh establisheth the steps. The thought is not: it is not in
man's option to walk in straight or crooked, good or evil ways, but: the
directing of man, the way by which he must go, lies not in his own but
in God's power. Hitz. justly finds here the wisdom that admits: "Mit
unserer Macht ist nichts getan," - man's destiny is ordained not by
himself, but by God. Upon this acquiescence in God's dispensation of
events follows the petition: Chasten me, for I have deserved punishment,
but chasten בּמשׁפּט, acc. to right, not in Thine anger; cf. [Psa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002); [Psa
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002). A chastening in anger is the
judgment of wrath that shall fall on obstinate sinners and destroy them.
A chastening acc. to right is one such as is demanded by right
(judgment), as the issue of God's justice, in order to the reclamation
and conversion of the repentant sinner. "Lest Thou make me little,"
insignificant, puny; not merely, diminish me, make me smaller than I now
am. For such a decrease of the people would result even from a gentle
chastisement. There is no comparative force in the words. To make small,
in other words, reduce to a small, insignificant people. This would be
at variance with "right," with God's ordained plan in regard to His
people. The expression is not equivalent to: not to make an utter end,
[Jer 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011), etc. The people had no
call to pray that they might escape being made an utter end of; thus
much had been promised by God, [Jer
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027); [Jer
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010). - God is asked to pour forth His
fury upon the heathen who know not the Lord nor call upon His name,
because they seek to extirpate Jacob (the people of Israel) as the
people of God, at this time found in Judah alone. The several words in
[Jer 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025) suggest the fury with which
the heathen proceed to the destruction of Israel. The present verse is
reproduced in [Psa 79:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006), a psalm
written during the exile, or at least after the destruction of Jerusalem
by the Chaldeans; but in the reproduction the energetic expansion of the
"devoured" is omitted.
