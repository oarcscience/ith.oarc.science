### [Jeremiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 5:1</span></span>

The Causes which Called Down the Judgment Pronounced: The Total
Corruption of the People. - Chr. B. Mich. has excellently summed up thus
the contents of this chapter: Deus judicia sua, quae cap. IV
praedixerat, justificat ostendens, se quamvis invitum, tamen non aliter
posse quam punire Judaeos propter praefractam ipsorum malitiam. The
train of thought in this chapter is the following: God would pardon if
there were to be found in Jerusalem but one who practised righteousness
and strove to keep good faith; but high and low have forsaken God and
His law, and serve the false gods. This the Lord must punish ([Jer
5:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001).md). Judah, like Israel, disowns
the Lord, and despises the words of His prophets; therefore the Lord
must affirm His word by deeds of judgment ([Jer
5:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010).md). Because they serve the gods
of strangers, He will throw them into bondage to strange peoples, that
they may learn to fear Him as the Almighty God and Lord of the world,
who withholds His benefits from them because their sins keep them far
from Him ([Jer 5:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019).md); for
wickedness and crime have acquired a frightful predominance ([Jer
5:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026).md).

[Jer 5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md)

By reason of the universal godlessness and moral corruption the Lord
cannot pardon. - [Jer 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md). "Range
through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek upon
her thoroughfares, if ye find any, if any doth judgment, seeketh after
faithfulness, and I will pardon her. [Jer
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md). And if they say, 'As Jahveh
liveth,' then in this they swear falsely. [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003.md). Jahveh, are not Thine yes upon
faithfulness? Thou smitest them, an they are not pained; thou consumest
them, they will take no correction; they make their face harder than
rock, they will not turn. [Jer 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004.md).
And I thought, It is but the baser sort, they are foolish; for they know
not the way of Jahveh, the judgment of their God. [Jer
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005.md). I will get me then to the great,
and will speak with them, for they know the way of Jahveh, the judgment
of their God; yet together have they broken the yoke, burst the bonds.
[Jer 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md). Therefore a lion out of the
wood smiteth them, a wolf of the deserts spoileth them, a leopard lieth
in wait against their cities: every one that goeth out thence is torn in
pieces; because many are their transgressions, many their backslidings.
[Jer 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md). Wherefore should I pardon
thee? thy sons have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods. I
caused them to sear, but they committed adultery, and crowd into the
house of the harlot. [Jer 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008.md). Like
well-fed horses, they are roaming about; each neigheth after the other's
wife. [Jer 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#009.md). Shall I not punish
this? saith Jahveh; or shall not my soul be avenged on such a people as
this?"

The thought of [Jer 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md), that in
Jerusalem there is not to be found one solitary soul who concerns
himself about uprightness and sincerity, does not, though rhetorically
expressed, contain any rhetorical hyperbole or exaggeration such as may
have arisen from the prophet's righteous indignation, or have been
inferred from the severity of the expected judgment (Hitz.); it gives
but the simple truth, as is seen when we consider that it is not
Jeremiah who speaks according to the best of his judgment, but God, the
searcher of hearts. Before the all-seeing eye of God no man is pure and
good. They are all gone astray, and there is none that doeth good, [Psa
14:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002.md). And if anywhere the fear of
God is the ruling principle, yet when the look falls on the mighty hosts
of the wicked, even the human eye loses sight of the small company of
the godly, since they are in no case to exert an influence on the moral
standing of the whole mass. "If ye find any" is defined by, "if there is
a worker of right;" and the doing of right or judgment is made more
complete by "that seeketh faithfulness," the doing of right or judgment
is made more complete by "that seeketh faithfulness," the doing being
given as the outcome of the disposition. אמוּנה is not truth (אמת), but
sincerity and good faith. On this state of affairs, cf. [Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md); [Mic
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002.md); [Isa
64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md). The pledge that God would pardon
Jerusalem if He found but one righteous man in it, recalls Abraham's
dealing with God on behalf of Sodom, [Gen
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023.md). In support of what has been
said, it is added in [Jer 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md), that
they even abuse God's name for lying purposes; cf. [Lev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012.md). Making oath by the life of
Jahveh is not looked on here as a confession of faith in the Lord,
giving thus as the sense, that even their worship of God was but the
work of the lips, not of the heart (Ros.); but the solemn appeal to the
living God for the purpose of setting the impress of truth on the face
of a life, is brought forward as evidence that there is none that
strives after sincerity. the antithesis forced in here by Hitz. and Graf
is foreign to text and context both, viz., that between swearing by
Jahveh and by the false gods, or any other indifferent name. The
emphasis lies on swearing לשׁקר, as opposed to swearing in the way
demanded by God, בּאמת וּבמשׁפּט וּבצדקה, [Jer
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002.md). לכן, therein, i.e., yet even in
this, or nevertheless.

[Jer 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003.md)

The eye of the Lord is directed towards faithfulness, which is not to be
found in Jerusalem ([Jer 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001).md), ל
showing the direction toward person or thing, as in [Psa
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#018.md), where ל alternates with אל.
Hitz. is wrong in translating: are not thine eyes faithful, i.e.,
directed according to faithfulness; a sense quite unsuitable here, since
the matter in hand is not the character or direction of the eye of God,
but that on which God looks. But because God desired sincerity, and
there was none in the people of Jerusalem, He has smitten them,
chastised them, but they felt no pain (חלוּ from חלה, the tone being
drawn back by reason of the '); the chastisement made no impression.
Thou consumedst them, exterminatedst them, i.e., "Thou hast utterly
exterminated multitudes and swarms of them" (Hitz.), but they refused to
receive correction; cf. [Jer 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030.md).
They made their face harder than rock, i.e., hardened themselves by
obstinately setting the divine chastisements at naught; cf. [Eze
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md).

[Jer 5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004.md)

This total want of good faith and uprightness is found not only in the
lower orders of the populace, amongst the mean and ignorant rabble, but
in the higher ranks of the educated. This is rhetorically put in this
shape, that Jeremiah, believing that only the common people are so
deeply sunk in immorality, turns to the great to speak to them, and
amongst them discovers a thorough-going renunciation of the law of God.
דּלּים, weak, are the mean and poor of the people, who live from hand to
mouth in rudeness and ignorance, their anxieties bent on food and
clothing (cf. [Jer 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010.md); [Jer
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007).md). These do foolishly (נואלוּ as
in [Num 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#011).md), from want of religious
training. They know not the way of Jahveh, i.e., the way, the manner of
life, prescribed to men by God in His word; cf. [Kg2
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#022.md); [Psa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md), etc. The judgment of their God,
i.e., that which God demanded as right and lawful, [Kg2
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#026.md), etc. The great, i.e., the
wealthy, distinguished, and educated. Yet even these have broken the
yoke of the law, i.e., have emancipated themselves from obedience to the
law (Hitz.); cf. [Jer 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md). Therefore
they must be visited with punishment.

[Jer 5:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md)

This verse is neither a threatening of future punishments, nor is to be
taken figuratively (lion, bear, leopard, as figures for dreadful
enemies). The change from the perf. הכּם to the imperf. ישׁדדם and יטּרף
tells against the future construction, showing as it does that the verbs
are used aoristically of chastisements which have partly already taken
place, which may be partly yet to come. And the figurative explanation
of the beasts of prey by hostile peoples - found so early as the Chald.
- is not in the least called for by the text; nor is it easy to
reconcile it with the specification of various kinds of wild beasts. The
words are a case of the threatening of the law in [Lev
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022.md), that God will chasten the
transgressors of His law by sending beasts of prey which shall rob them
of their children. Cf. with the promise, that if they keep His
commandments, He will destroy the wild beasts out of the land. Cf. also
the fact given in [Kg2 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025.md), that God
sent lions amongst the heathen colonists who had been transplanted into
the depopulated kingdom of the ten tribes, lions which slew some of
them, because they served not Jahveh. The true conception of the words
is confirmed by [Eze 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#015.md), when in
like manner the sending of evil (ravening) beasts is mentioned as an
example of God's punishments. הכּה, smite, is a standing expression for
the lion's way of striking down his prey with his paws; cf. [Kg1
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#036.md). זאב ערבות is not wolf of the
evening, as Chald. Syr., Hitz. explain it, following [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md) and [Zep
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md); for ערבות is not the plural of
ערב, but of ערבה, steppe: the wolf that lives in the steppe, and thence
makes its raids on inhabited spots. The reference of the words to place
is suggested plainly by the parallel, the lion out of the wood. The
leopard (panther) watches, i.e., lies lurking in wait against their
cities, to tear those that come out. The panther is wont to lie in wait
for his prey, and to spring suddenly out on it; cf. [Hos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007.md). With "because many are thy
transgressions," cf. [Jer 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014.md).

Since these chastisements have profited nothing God cannot pardon the
people. This is the meaning of the question in [Jer
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md), אי לזאת, wherefore should I then
pardon? not, should I then pardon for this? for אי by itself does not
stand for ה interrog., but is set before the pronom. demonstr. to give
it the force of an interrogative adjective; cf. Ew. 326, a. The Cheth.
אסלוחest obsoletum adeoque genuinum (Ros.); the Keri substitutes the
usual form. To justify the question with a negative answer implied, the
people's fall into idolatry is again set up before it in strong colours.
Thy sons (the sons of the daughter of Zion, i.e., of the national
congregation, and so the individual members of the nation; cf. [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018).md) have forsaken me, and swear by
them that are not gods, i.e., the idols; cf. [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md). For אשׁבּיע אותם, I caused them
to swear, the old translators have אשׂבּיע , I filled them to the full,
and so it is read in many codd. and edd. This reading is preferred by
most of the ancient commentators, and they appeal for a parallel to [Jer
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md), and [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md) ("when Jeshurun waxed fat, he
kicked"), [Hos 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006.md); [Neh
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#025.md), etc., where apostasy from God is
chidden as a consequence of superfluity of earthly goods. So Luther:
"and now that I have filled them full, they committed adultery." Now
possibly it is just the recollection of the passages cited that has
suggested the reading אשׂביע. The apodosis, they committed adultery,
forms no antithesis to filling full. Adultery presupposes a marriage
vow, or troth plighted by an oath. God caused Israel to swear fidelity
when He made the covenant with it at Sinai, Ex 24. This oath Israel
repeated at each renewal of the covenant, and last under Josiah: [Kg2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003.md); [Ch2
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#031.md). Hence we must not wholly
restrict the searing to the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai, nor
wholly to the renewal of it under Josiah. We must refer it to both acts,
or rather to the solemnity at Sinai, together with all solemn renewals
of it in after times; while at the same time the reference to the
renewal under Josiah, this being still fresh in memory, may have been
the foremost. We must not confine the reference of ינאפוּ to spiritual
adultery (= a fall away from Jahveh into idolatry); the context,
especially the next clause, and yet more unmistakeably [Jer
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008.md), refers to carnal uncleanness.
This too was a breach of the covenant, since in taking it the people
bound itself not only to be faithful to God, but to keep and follow all
the laws of His covenant. That the words, crowd into the house of the
harlot, i.e., go thither in crowds, are to be taken of carnal
uncleanness, may be gathered from [Jer
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008.md): each neighs after the wife of his
neighbour. Fornication is denounced as a desecration of the name of the
Lord in [Amo 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007.md). The first clause of
[Jer 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008.md) suggests a comparison:
well-fed horses are they, i.e., they resemble such. On the lechery of
horses, see on [Eze 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#020.md). The Cheth.
מוזנים is partic. Hoph. of זוּן, in Aram. feed, fatten, here most
suitable. The Keri מיזנים would be the partic. Pu. from יזן, the meaning
of which is doubtful, given arbitrarily by Kimchi and others as armati
sc. membro genitali. משׁכּים, too, is derived from משׁך, and given by
Jerome sensu obscaeno: trahentes sc. genitalia; but משׁכּים cannot come
from משׁך, משׁכּים being the only possible form in that case. Nor does
trahentes, "draught-horses" (Hitz.), give a sense at all in point for
the comparison. A better view is that of those who follow Simonis, in
holding it to be partic. Hiph. of שׁכה, in Aethiop. oberravit, vagatus
est. The participle is not to be joined with "horses" as a second
qualifying word, but to be taken with היוּ, the periphrastic form being
chosen to indicate the enduring chronic character of the roaming.

[Jer 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#009.md)

Such abandoned behaviour the Lord must punish.

[Jeremiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 5:10</span></span>

In spite of the feeling of security fostered by the false prophets, the
Lord will make good His word, and cause the land and kingdom to be laid
waste by a barbarous people. - [Jer
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md). "Go ye up upon her walls, and
destroy, but make not a full end: tear away her tendrils; for they are
not Jahveh's. [Jer 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#011.md). For faithless
to me is the house of Israel become and the house of Judah, saith
Jahveh. [Jer 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012.md). They deny Jahveh,
and say, He is not; and evil shall not come upon us, and sword and
famine we shall not see. [Jer 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013.md).
And the prophets shall become wind, and he that speaketh is not in them:
so may it happen unto them. [Jer 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014.md).
Therefore thus saith Jahveh the God of hosts: Because ye speak this
word, behold, I make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood,
and it shall devour them. [Jer 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015.md).
Behold, I bring upon you a nation from far, house of Israel, saith
Jahveh, a people that is strong, a people that is from of old, a people
whose speech thou knowest not, and understandest not what it saith. [Jer
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#016.md). Its quiver is as an open grave,
they are all mighty men. [Jer 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#017.md). It
shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread; they shall eat up thy sons and
thy daughters; it shall eat up thy flocks and thy cattle, eat up thy
vine and thy fig-tree; it shall break down thy fenced cities, wherein
thou trustest, with the sword. [Jer
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018.md). But yet in those days, saith
Jahveh, I will not make a full end with you."

To give emphasis to the threat, that the Lord will avenge Himself on
such a people, we have immediately following, in [Jer
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md), the summons given to the enemy
to subdue the land.עלוּ בשׁרותיה is variously explained. The old
translators took שׁרות to mean walls; but the second clause, tear away
the tendrils, seems not to suit this well. And then this word occurs but
once again, and with the meaning "caravan," while walls are שׁוּרות in
[Job 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#011.md). But this reason is not
strong enough to throw any doubt on the rendering: walls, supported as
it is by the old versions. The form שׁרות from שׁוּר is contracted from
a form שׁורים, constructed analogously to שׁורות. The second clause
would be unsuitable to the first only in the case that walls were to
mean exclusively town walls or fortifications. But this is not the case.
Even if the suffix here referred to Jerusalem, mentioned in [Jer
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md), which is very doubtful, still
then the city would be looked on not in the light of a stronghold, but
only as representative of the kingdom or of the theocracy. Probably,
however, the suffix refers to the daughter of Zion as seat of the
kingdom of God, and the idea of a vineyard was in the prophet's mind
(cf. [Jer 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021).md), under which figure
Isaiah ([Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001).md) set forth the
kingdom of God founded on Mount Zion; so that under walls, the walls of
the vineyard are to be thought of. Elsewhere, indeed, these are called
גּדרות (also in [Jer 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003).md), but only
where the figure of a vineyard is further developed, or at least is
brought more plainly and prominently forward. Here, again, where the
enemy is summoned to go upon the walls, this figure is mixed up with
that of a city; and so the word שׂרות, as indicating walls of any kind,
seems most fitting. Graf has overthrown, as being unfounded, Hitz.'s
assertion, that עלה signified only, to go up against a thing; and that
accuracy and elegance required that the destruction should be of the
walls, not of the vineyard itself. עלה c. בּ means also: to go up upon a
thing, e.g., [Psa 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md); [Deu
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#005.md); and the verb שׁחתוּ stands quite
absolutely, so that it cannot be restricted to the walls. "And
destruction can only take place when, by scaling the walls, entrance has
been obtained into that which is to be destroyed, be it city or
vineyard." We therefore adhere to the sig. walls, especially since the
other translations attempted by Ew. and Hitz. are wholly without
foundation. Hitz. will have us read שׂרותיה, and take this as plural of
שׁורה; next he supposes a row of vines to be intended, but he obtains
this sense only by arbitrarily appending the idea of vines. Ew.
endeavours, from the Aram. and Arab., to vindicate for the word the
meaning: clusters of blossom, and so to obtain for the whole the
translation: push in amidst the blossom-spikes. A singular figure truly,
which in no way harmonizes with עלוּ ב. "Destroy" is restricted by the
following "but make not," etc.; see on [Jer
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md). On "tear away her tendrils," cf.
[Isa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005.md). The spoilers are not to
root up the vine itself, but to remove the tendrils, which do not belong
to Jahveh. Spurious members of the nation are meant, those who have
degenerated out of their kind.

The reasons of this command are given in [Jer
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#011.md)., by a renewed exposure of the
people's apostasy. The house of Israel and the house of Judah are become
faithless. On this cf. [Jer 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md). The
mention of Israel along with Judah gives point to the threatening, since
judgment has already been executed upon Israel. Judah has equalled
Israel in faithlessness, and so a like fate will be its lot. Judah shows
its faithlessness by denying the Lord, by saying לא הוּא. This Ew.
translates: not so, after the οὐκ ἔστι ταῦτα of the lxx; but he is
certainly wrong in this. Even though הוּא may be used in place of the
neuter, yet it cannot be so used in this connection, after the preceding
כּחשׁוּ ביהוה. Better to take it: He is not, as the fools speak in [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) : there is no God, i.e., go on in
their lives as if God were not. "Jahveh is not" is therefore in other
words: there exists not a God such as Jahveh is preached to us, who is
to visit His people with sore punishments. This view is not open to the
objection, quod pro lubitu supplent, which Ros. raises against the
interpretation: non est is, qualem prophetae describunt. For we take
הוּא not as is qualem, but as est sc. Jahveh; and we explain the meaning
of Jahveh only in that reference in which He is disowned by these men,
namely, as God who visits His people with punishments. In this character
He was preached by the prophets. This appears from what is further said
by these disowners of God: evil or mischief will not come on us. To a
saying of this kind they could have been provoked only by threatenings
of punishments. The prophets were not indeed the first to announce
judgments; Moses in the law threatened transgressors with the sorest
punishments. But the context, the threatening against the false prophets
in [Jer 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013.md), suggests that here we
are to think of announcements by the prophets. Doubtless the false
prophets assured the people: evil shall not come upon you, in opposition
to the true prophets, who threatened the sinful race with the judgments
of God. Such prophets are to become wind, sc. with their utterances.
הדּבּר is not a noun: the word, but a verb, with the article instead of
the relative pronoun, as in Josh. 1:24; [Ch1
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#028.md), and often: He who speaks is not
in them, i.e., in them there is none other speaker than themselves; the
Spirit of God is not in them. אין, "there is none," is stronger than לא,
meaning: they speak out of their own hearts. The threat, so be it unto
them, may be most simply referred to the first clause: they become wind.
Let the emptiness of their prophecies fall on their own heads, so that
they themselves may come to nought.

[Jeremiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 5:14</span></span>

But the people is to have proof of the truth of the word of the Lord.
Because it, despising the threatening of punishment, says: Misfortune
shall not light upon us, the Lord will make the word in the mouth of
Jeremiah a fire, and the people wood, that the fire may consume it. On
this figure, cf. [Isa 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#031.md); [Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017.md). [Jer
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015.md). explain this, and announce the
inroad of a dreadful enemy that is to lay waste the land and consume the
people. "A people from far," as in [Jer
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#016.md). Judah is called "house of
Israel," not so much because it is what remains of Israel, but because,
after the captivity of the ten tribes, Judah regarded itself as the only
true Israel or people of God. Further description of the hostile people
is intended to show its formidable power, and to inspire dread. איתן,
enduring, firm, strong; cf. [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md); [Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002.md). מעולם, dating from eternity,
i.e., very ancient, not of recent origin, but become mighty in
immemorial antiquity. A people speaking a language unfamiliar to the
Jews, to comprehend whom is impossible, i.e., barbarous; cf. [Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md). Further ([Jer
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#016).md), it is a race of very heroes,
fully furnished with deadly weapons. J. D. Mich. took objection to the
figure, "its quiver is as an open grave;" but his conjecture שׂפתו put
nothing better in place of it. The link of comparison is this: as an
open grave is filled with dead men, so the quiver of this enemy is
filled with deadly missiles.

[Jeremiah 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 5:17</span></span>

This people will devour the harvest and the bread, the children, the
cattle, and the best fruits of the land. Devour, here as often, in the
wider sense, destroy; cf. e.g., [Jer
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024.md) and [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md), where the first half of the
present verse is compressed into the words: they ate up Jacob. We need
not wait to refute Hitz.'s absurd remark, that the author imagined the
enemy, the assumed Scythians, to be cannibals. In the second half of the
verse the words, "the fenced cities wherein thou trustest,"are a
reminiscence of [Deu 28:52](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#052.md); and hence
we may see, that while our prophet is describing the enemy in [Jer
5:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015.md), Moses' threatening, [Deu
28:49-52](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md), was in his mind. רשׁשׁ,
break in pieces, as in [Mal 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#004.md). With
the sword, i.e., by force of arms; the sword, as principal weapon, being
named, instead of the entire apparatus of war. In [Jer
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018.md) the restriction of [Jer
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md) (cf. [Jer
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027).md) is repeated, and with it the
threatening of judgment is rounded off.

[Jeremiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 5:19</span></span>

This calamity Judah is preparing for itself by its obduracy and excess
of wickedness. - [Jer 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019.md). "And if ye
then shall say, Wherefore hath Jahveh our God done all this unto us?
then say to them, Like as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in
your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours. [Jer
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#020.md). Declare this in the house of
Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, [Jer
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021.md). Hear now this, foolish people
without understanding, that have eyes and see not, have ears and hear
not. [Jer 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md). Me will ye not fear,
saith Jahve, nor tremble before me? who have set the sand for a bound to
the sea, an everlasting boundary that it passes not, and its waves toss
themselves and cannot, and roar and pass not over. [Jer
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023.md). But this people hath a stubborn
and rebellious heart; they turned away and went. [Jer
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024.md). And said not in their heart: Let
us now fear Jahveh our God, who giveth rain, the early rain and the late
rain, in its season; who keepeth for us the appointed weeks of the
harvest. [Jer 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025.md). Your iniquities
have turned away these, and your sins have withholden the good from you.
[Jer 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026.md). For among my people are
found wicked men; they lie in wait as fowlers stoop; they set a trap,
they catch men. [Jer 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#027.md). As a cage
full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit; therefore are they
become great and rich. [Jer 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md). They
are grown fat and sleek, they go beyond bound in wickedness; the cause
they try not, the cause of the orphans, that they might have prosperity;
and the right of the needy they judge not. [Jer
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#029.md). Shall I not punish this? saith
Jahveh; shall not my soul be avenged on such a people as this? [Jer
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030.md). The appalling and horrible is
done in the land. [Jer 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md). The
prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule under their lead,
and my people loves it so. But what will ye do in the end thereof."

The thought of [Jer 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019.md), that the
people, by its apostasy, draws down this judgment on itself, forms the
transition from the threat of punishment to the reproof of sins. The
penalty corresponds to the sin. Because Judah in its own land serves the
gods of foreigners, so it must serve strangers in a foreign land.

[Jer 5:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#020.md)

The reproof of sins is introduced by an apostrophe to the hardened race.
The exhortation, "Publish this," is addressed to all the prophet's
hearers who have the welfare of the people at heart. "This," in [Jer
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#020.md) and [Jer
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021.md), refers to the chiding statement
from [Jer 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023.md) onwards, that the
people fears not God. The form of address, people foolish and without
understanding (cf. [Jer 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#022.md); [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011).md), is made cutting, in order, if
possible, to bring the people yet to their senses. The following
clauses, "they have eyes," etc., depict spiritual blindness and
deafness, as in [Eze 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022.md); cf. [Deu
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#003.md). Blindness is shown in that they
see not the government of God's almighty power in nature; deafness, in
that they hear not the voice of God in His word. They have no fear even
of the God whose power has in the sand set an impassable barrier for the
mighty waves of the sea. "Me" is put first for emphasis. The waves beat
against their appointed barrier, but are not able, sc. to pass it.

[Jer 5:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023.md)

But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; it bows not beneath
the almighty hand of God. "Stubborn and rebellious," joined as in [Deu
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018.md), [Deu
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#020.md). Hence the following סרוּ is not
to be taken from סרר: they defy (Hitz.), but from סוּר: they turn away
and go off, and consider not that they owe their daily bread to the
Lord. Neither does God's power move the obdurate people to the fear of
Him, nor do the proofs of His love make any impression. They do not
consider that God gives them the rain which lends the land its
fruitfulness, so that at the fixed time they may gather in the harvest.
The ו cop. before יורה is rejected by the Masoretes in the Keri as out
of place, since גּשׁם is not any special rain, co-ordinate to the early
and late rain (Hitz.), or because they had [Deu
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014.md); [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md) before them. But in this they
failed to notice that the ו before יורה and that before מלקושׁ are
correlative, having the force of et - et. שׁבעת is stat. constr. from
שׁבעת, weeks, and to it חקּות is co-ordinated in place of an adjective,
so that קציר is dependent on two co-ordinate stat. constr., as in [Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md), [Jer
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011.md); [Zep
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006.md). But the sense is not, the weeks,
the statutes, of the harvest, i.e., the fixed and regulated phenomena
which regulate the harvest (Graf), but, appointed weeks of harvest. The
seven weeks between the second day of the passover and the feast of
harvest, or of weeks, [Exo 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md); [Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md); [Deu
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009.md)., are what is here meant. We must
reject the rendering, "oath as to the harvest-time" (L. de Dieu, J. D.
Mich., and Ew.), since Scripture knows nothing of oaths taken by God as
to the time of harvest; in [Gen 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022.md)
there is no word of an oath.

[Jer 5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025.md)

The people has by its sins brought about the withdrawal of these
blessings (the withholding of rain, etc.). הטּוּ, turned away, as in
[Amo 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012.md); [Mal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005.md). "These," i.e., the blessings
mentioned in [Jer 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024.md). The second
clause repeats the same thing. The good, i.e., which God in His goodness
bestowed on them.

This is established in [Jer 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026.md). by
bringing home to the people their besetting sins. In (amidst) the people
are found notorious sinners. ישׁוּר in indefinite generality: they spy
about, lie in wait; cf. [Hos 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007.md). The
singular is chosen because the act described is not undertaken in
company, but by individuals. שׁך from שׁכך, bend down, stoop, as
bird-catchers hide behind the extended nets till the birds have gone in,
so as then to draw them tight. "They set;" not the fowlers, but the
wicked ones. משׁחית, destroyer ([Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023), and often.md), or destruction
(Ezek. 21:36); here, by virtue of the context, a trap which brings
destruction. The men they catch are the poor, the needy, and the just;
cf. [Jer 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md) and [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md). The figure of bird-catching
leads to a cognate one, by which are set forth the gains of the wicked
or the produce of their labours. As a cage is filled with captured
birds, so the houses of the wicked are filled with deceit, i.e.,
possessions obtained by deceit, through which they attain to credit,
power, and wealth. Graf has overthrown Hitz.'s note, that we must
understand by מרמה, not riches obtained by deceit, but he means and
instruments of deceit; and this on account of the following: therefore
they enrich themselves. But, as Graf shows, it is not the possession of
these appliances, but of the goods acquired by deceit, that has made
these people great and rich, "as the birds that fill the cage are not a
means for capture, but property got by cunning." כּלוּב, cage, is not
strictly a bird-cage, but a bird-trap woven of willows ([Amo
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001).md), with a lid to shut down, by
means of which birds were caught.

[Jer 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md)

Through the luxurious living their wealth makes possible to them, they
are grown fat and sleek. עשׁתוּ, in graphic description, is joined
asynd. to the preceding verb. It is explained by recent comm. of fat
bodies, become glossy, in keeping with the noun עשׁת, which in [Sol
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#014.md) expresses the glitter of ivory;
for the meaning cogitare, think, meditate, which עשׁת bears in Chald.,
yields no sense available here. The next clause is variously explained.
גּם points to another, yet worse kind of behaviour. It is not possible
to defend the translation: they overflow with evil speeches, or swell
out with evil things (Umbr., Ew.), since עבר c. accus. does not mean to
overflow with a thing. Yet more arbitrary is the assumption of a change
of the subject: (their) evil speeches overflow. The only possible
subject to the verb is the wicked ones, with whom the context deals
before and after. דּברי־רע are not words of wickedness = what may be
called wickedness, but things of wickedness, wicked things. דּברי serves
to distribute the idea of רע into the particular cases into which it
falls, as in [Psa 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004.md); [Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027.md), and elsewhere, where it is
commonly held to be pleonastic. Hitz. expounds truly: the individual
wickednesses in which the abstract idea of wicked manifests itself.
Sense: they go beyond all that can be conceived as evil, i.e., the
bounds of evil or wickedness. The cause they plead not, namely, the case
of the orphans. ויצליחוּ, imperf. c. ו consec.: that so they might have
prosperity. Hitz. regards the wicked men as the subject, and explains
the words thus: such justice would indeed be a necessary condition of
their success. But that the wicked could attain to prosperity by seizing
every opportunity of defending the rights of the fatherless is too weak
a thought, coming after what has preceded, and besides it does not fit
the case of those who go beyond all bounds in wickedness. Ew. and Graf
translate: that they (the wicked) might make good the rightful cause (of
the orphan), help the poor man to his rights. But even if הצליח seems in
[Ch2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#011.md); [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md), to have the signif. carry
through, make good, yet in these passages the sig. carry through with
success is fundamental; there, as here, this will not suit, הצליח being
in any case applicable only to doubtful and difficult causes - a thought
foreign to the present context. Blame is attached to the wicked, not
because they do not defend the orphan's doubtful pleas, but because they
give no heed at all to the orphan's rights. We therefore hold with
Raschi that the orphans are subject to this verb: that the orphans might
have had prosperity. The plural is explained when we note that יתום is
perfectly general, and may be taken as collective. The accusation in
this verse shows further that the prophet had the godless rulers and
judges of the people in his eye.

[Jer 5:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#029.md)

[Jer 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#029.md) is a refrain-like repetition
of [Jer 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#009.md). - The [Jer
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030.md) and [Jer
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md) are, as Hitz. rightly says, "a
sort of epimetrum added after the conclusion in [Jer
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#029.md)," in which the already described
moral depravity is briefly characterized, and is asserted of all ranks
of the people. Appalling and horrible things happen in the land; cf.
[Jer 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012.md); [Jer
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014.md); [Jer
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013.md); [Hos
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#010.md). The prophets prophesy with
falsehood, בּשּׁקר, as in [Jer 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006.md);
[Jer 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#009.md); more fully בּשׁמי לשׁקר,
[Jer 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025.md); [Jer
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#015.md). The priests rule על, at their
(the prophets') hands, i.e., under their guidance or direction; cf. [Ch1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md)., [Ch2
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#018.md); not: go by their side (Ges.,
Dietr.), for רדה is not: go, march on, but: trample down. My people
loves it so, yields willingly to such a lead; cf. [Amo
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005.md). What will ye do לאחריתהּ, as to
the end of this conduct? The suff. faem. with neuter force. The end
thereof will be the judgment; will ye be able to turn it away?
