### [Deuteronomy Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 15:1</span></span>

On the Year of Release. - The first two regulations in this chapter,
viz., [Deu 15:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md) and [Deu
15:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md), follow simply upon the law
concerning the poor tithe in [Deu
14:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md). The Israelites were not only
to cause those who had no possessions (Levites, strangers, widows, and
orphans) to refresh themselves with the produce of their inheritance,
but they were not to force and oppress the poor. Debtors especially were
not to be deprived of the blessings of the sabbatical year ([Deu
15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001).md). "At the end of seven years
thou shalt make a release." The expression, "at the end of seven years,"
is to be understood in the same way as the corresponding phrase, "at the
end of three years," in [Deu 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md).
The end of seven years, i.e., of the seven years' cycle formed by the
sabbatical year, is mentioned as the time when debts that had been
contracted were usually wiped off or demanded, after the year's harvest
had been gathered in (cf. [Deu 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010.md),
according to which the feast of Tabernacles occurred at the end of the
year). שׁמטּה, from שׁמט morf ,, to let lie, to let go (cf. [Exo
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011).md), does not signify a remission
of the debt, the relinquishing of all claim for payment, as Philo and
the Talmudists affirm, but simply lengthening the term, not pressing for
payment. This is the explanation in [Deu
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002.md) : "This is the manner of the
release" (shemittah): cf. [Deu 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#004.md);
[Kg1 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md). "Every owner of a loan of
his hand shall release (leave) what he has lent to his neighbour; he
shall not press his neighbour, and indeed his brother; for they have
proclaimed release for Jehovah." As שׁמוט (release) points unmistakeably
back to [Exo 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011.md), it must be
interpreted in the same manner here as there. And as it is not used
there to denote the entire renunciation of a field or possession, so
here it cannot mean the entire renunciation of what had been lent, but
simply leaving it, i.e., not pressing for it during the seventh year.
This is favoured by what follows, "thou shalt not press thy neighbour,"
which simply forbids an unreserved demand, but does not require that the
debt should be remitted or presented to the debtor (see also Bhr,
Symbolik, ii. pp. 570-1). "The loan of the hand:" what the hand has lent
to another. "The master of the loan of the hand:" i.e., the owner of a
loan, the lender. "His brother" defines with greater precision the idea
of "a neighbour." Calling a release, presupposes that the sabbatical
year was publicly proclaimed, like the year of jubilee ([Lev
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009).md). קרא is impersonal ("they
call"), as in [Gen 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009.md) and [Gen
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#014.md). "For Jehovah:" i.e., in honour
of Jehovah, sanctified to Him, as in [Exo
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#042.md). - This law points back to the
institution of the sabbatical year in [Exo
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#010.md); [Lev
25:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#002.md), though it is not to be
regarded as an appendix to the law of the sabbatical year, or an
expansion of it, but simply as an exposition of what was already implied
in the main provision of that law, viz., that the cultivation of the
land should be suspended in the sabbatical year. If no harvest was
gathered in, and even such produce as had grown without sowing was to be
left to the poor and the beasts of the field, the landowner could have
no income from which to pay his debts. The fact that the "sabbatical
year" is not expressly mentioned, may be accounted for on the ground,
that even in the principal law itself this name does not occur; and it
is simply commanded that every seventh year there was to be a sabbath of
rest to the land ([Lev 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#004).md). In the
subsequent passages in which it is referred to ([Deu
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009.md) and [Deu
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010).md), it is still not called a
sabbatical year, but simply the "year of release," and that not merely
with reference to debtors, but also with reference to the release
(Shemittah) to be allowed to the field ([Exo
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011).md).

[Deuteronomy 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 15:3</span></span>

The foreigner thou mayest press, but what thou hast with thy brother
shall thy hand let go. נכרי is a stranger of another nation, standing in
no inward relation to Israel at all, and is to be distinguished from
גּר, the foreigner who lived among the Israelites, who had a claim upon
their protection and pity. This rule breathes no hatred of foreigners,
but simply allows the Israelites the right of every creditor to demand
his debts, and enforce the demand upon foreigners, even in the
sabbatical year. There was no severity in this, because foreigners could
get their ordinary income in the seventh year as well as in any other.

[Deuteronomy 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 15:4</span></span>

"Only that there shall be no poor with thee." יהיה is jussive, like the
foregoing imperfects. The meaning in this connection is, "Thou needest
not to remit a debt to foreigners in the seventh year; thou hast only to
take care that there is no poor man with or among thee, that thou dost
not cause or increase their poverty, by oppressing the brethren who have
borrowed of thee." Understood in this way, the sentence is not at all at
variance with [Deu 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#011.md), where it is
stated that the poor would never cease out of the land. The following
clause, "for Jehovah will bless thee," etc., gives a reason for the main
thought, that they were not to press the Israelitish debtor. The
creditor, therefore, had no need to fear that he would suffer want, if
he refrained from exacting his debt from his brother in the seventh
year.

[Deuteronomy 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 15:5</span></span>

This blessing would not fail, if the Israelites would only hearken to
the voice of the Lord; "for Jehovah blesseth thee" (by the perfect
בּרכך, the blessing is represented not as a possible and future one
only, but as one already bestowed according to the counsel of God, and,
so far as the commencement was concerned, already fulfilled), "as He
hath spoken" (see at [Deu 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#011).md). "And
thou wilt lend on pledge to many nations, but thou thyself wilt not
borrow upon pledge." עבט, a denom. verb, from עבוט, a pledge, signifies
in Kal to give a pledge for the purpose of borrowing; in Hiphil, to
cause a person to give a pledge, or furnish occasion for giving a
pledge, i.e., to lend upon pledge. "And thou wilt rule over many
nations," etc. Ruling is mentioned here as the result of superiority in
wealth (cf. [Deu 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001) : Schultz.md).

[Deuteronomy 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 15:7</span></span>

And in general Israel was to be ready to lend to the poor among its
brethren, not to harden its heart, to be hard-hearted, but to lend to
the poor brother מחסרו דּי, "the sufficiency of his need," whatever he
might need to relieve his wants.

[Deuteronomy 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 15:9</span></span>

Thus they were also to beware "that there was not a word in the heart,
worthlessness," i.e., that a worthless thought did not arise in their
hearts (בּליּעל is the predicate of the sentence, as the more precise
definition of the word that was in the heart); so that one should say,
"The seventh year is at hand, the year of release," sc., when I shall
not be able to demand what I have lent, and "that thine eye be evil
towards thy poor brother," i.e., that thou cherishest ill-will towards
him (cf. [Deu 28:54](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#054.md), [Deu
28:56](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056).md), "and givest him not, and he
appeals to Jehovah against thee, and it becomes sin to thee," sc., which
brings down upon thee the wrath of God.

[Deu 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#010.md)

Thou shalt give him, and thy heart shall not become evil, i.e.,
discontented thereat (cf. [Co2 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007).md),
for Jehovah will bless thee for it (cf. [Pro
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009.md); [Pro
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#027.md); [Psa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md); [Mat
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#004).md).

[Deuteronomy 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 15:11</span></span>

For the poor will never cease in the land, even the land that is richly
blessed, because poverty is not only the penalty of sin, but is ordained
by God for punishment and discipline.

[Deuteronomy 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 15:12</span></span>

These provisions in favour of the poor are followed very naturally by
the rules which the Israelites were to be urged to observe with
reference to the manumission of Hebrew slaves. It is not the reference
to the sabbatical year in the foregoing precepts which forms the
introduction to the laws which follow respecting the manumission of
Hebrews who had become slaves, but the poverty and want which compelled
Hebrew men and women to sell themselves as slaves. The seventh year, in
which they were to be set free, is not the same as the sabbatical year,
therefore, but the seventh year of bondage. Manumission in the seventh
year of service had already been commanded in [Exo
21:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002.md), in the rights laid down for
the nation, with special reference to the conclusion of the covenant.
This command is not repeated here for the purpose of extending the law
to Hebrew women, who are not expressly mentioned in Ex 21; for that
would follow as a matter of course, in the case of a law which was quite
as applicable to women as to men, and was given without any reserve to
the whole congregation. It is rather repeated here as a law which
already existed as a right, for the purpose of explaining the true mode
of fulfilling it, viz., that it was not sufficient to give a man-servant
and maid-servant their liberty after six years of service, which would
not be sufficient relief to those who had been obliged to enter into
slavery on account of poverty, if they had nothing with which to set up
a home of their own; but love to the poor was required to do more than
this, namely, to make some provision for the continued prosperity of
those who were set at liberty. "If thou let him go free from thee, thou
shalt not let him go (send him away) empty:" this was the new feature
which Moses added here to the previous law. "Thou shalt load (העניק,
lit., put upon the neck) of thy flock, and of thy floor (corn), and of
thy press (oil and wine); wherewith thy God hath blessed thee, of that
thou shalt give to him."

[Deuteronomy 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 15:15</span></span>

They were to be induced to do this by the recollection of their own
redemption out of the bondage of Egypt, - the same motive that is urged
for the laws and exhortations enjoining compassion towards foreigners,
servants, maids, widows, orphans, and the poor, not only in [Deu
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015.md); [Deu
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#019.md); [Deu
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#012.md); [Deu
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#018.md), [Deu
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#022.md), but also in [Exo
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020.md); [Exo
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#009.md), and [Lev
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#034.md).

[Deuteronomy 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 15:16</span></span>

But if the man-servant and the maid-servant should not wish for liberty
in the sixth year, because it was well with them in the house of their
master, they were not to be compelled to go, but were to be bound to
eternal, i.e., lifelong bondage, in the manner prescribed in [Exo
21:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#005.md).

(Note: Knobel's assertion, that the judicial process enjoined in [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md) does not seem to have been usual
in the author's own time, is a worthless argumentum e silentio.)

This is repeated from Ex 21, to guard against such an application of the
law as might be really cruelty under the circumstances rather than love.
Manumission was only an act of love, when the person to be set free had
some hope of success and of getting a living for himself; and where
there was no such prospect, compelling him to accept of freedom might be
equivalent to thrusting him away.

[Deuteronomy 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 15:18</span></span>

If, on the other hand, the servant (or maid) wished to be set free, the
master was not to think it hard; "for the double of the wages of a
day-labourer he has earned for thee for six years," i.e., not "twice the
time of a day-labourer, so that he had really deserved twice the wages"
(Vatablius, Ad. Osiander, J. Gerhard), for it cannot be proved from [Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md), that a day-labourer generally
hired himself out for three years; nor yet, "he has been obliged to work
much harder than a day-labourer, very often by night as well as day"
(Clericus, J. H. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Baumgarten); but simply, "he has
earned and produced so much, that if you had been obliged to keep a
day-labourer in his place, it would have cost you twice as much"
(Schultz, Knobel).

[Deuteronomy 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 15:19</span></span>

Application of the first-born of Cattle. - From the laws respecting the
poor and slaves, to which the instructions concerning the tithes ([Deu
14:22-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022).md) had given occasion, Moses
returns to appropriation of the first-born of the herd and flock to
sacrificial meals, which he had already touched upon in [Deu
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md), [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md), and [Deu
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023.md), and concludes by an explanation
upon this point. The command, which the Lord had given when first they
came out of Egypt ([Exo 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md), [Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012).md), that all the first-born of the
herd and flock should be sanctified to Him, is repeated here by Moses,
with the express injunction that they were not to work with the
first-born of cattle (by yoking them to the plough or waggon), and not
to shear the first-born of sheep; that is to say, they were not to use
the first-born animals which were sanctified to the Lord for their own
earthly purposes, but to offer them year by year as sacrifices to the
Lord, and consume them in sacrificial meals. To this he adds ([Deu
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021.md), [Deu
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#022).md) that further provision, that
first-born animals, which were blind or lame, or had any other bad
fault, were not to be offered in sacrifice to the Lord, but, like
ordinary animals used for food, could be eaten in all the towns of the
land. Although the first part of this law was involved in the general
laws as to the kind of animal that could be offered in sacrifice ([Lev
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#019)..md), it was by no means
unimportant to point out distinctly their applicability to the
first-born, and add some instructions with regard to the way in which
they were to be applied. (On [Deu
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#022.md) and [Deu
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#023.md), see [Deu
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md) and [Deu
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#016)..md)
