### [Job Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md)

[Job 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 2:1</span></span>

1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
before Jehovah, and Satan came also among them, to present himself
before Jehovah.

The clause expressive of the purpose of their appearing is here repeated
in connection with Satan (comp. on the contrary, [Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006).md), for this time he appears with a
most definite object. Jehovah addresses Satan as He had done on the
former occasion.

[Job 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 2:2</span></span>

2 And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan answered
Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and wandering up
and down in it.

Instead of מאין, [Job 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#007.md), we have
here the similar expression מזּה אי (Ges. 150, extra). Such slight
variations are also frequent in the repetitions in the Psalms, and we
have had an example in Job 1 in the interchange of עוד and עד. After the
general answer which Satan givers, Jehovah inquires more particularly.

[Job 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 2:3</span></span>

3 Then Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for
there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
fearing God and eschewing evil; and still he holdeth fast his integrity,
although thou hast moved me against him, to injure him without cause.

From the foregoing fact, that amidst all his sufferings hitherto Job has
preserved and proved his תּמּה (except in the book of Job, only [Pro
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003).md), the fut. consec. draws the
conclusion: there was no previous reason for the injury which Satan had
urged God to decree for Job. הסית does not signify, as Umbreit thinks,
to lead astray, in which case it were an almost blasphemous
anthropomorphism: it signifies instigare, and indeed generally, to evil,
as e.g., [Ch1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001.md); but not always,
e.g., [Jos 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#018.md) : here it is
certainly in a strongly anthropopathical sense of the impulse given by
Satan to Jehovah to prove Job in so hurtful a manner. The writer
purposely chooses these strong expressions, הסית and בּלּע. Satan's aim,
since he suspected Job still, went beyond the limited power which was
given him over Job. Satan even now again denies what Jehovah affirms.

[Job 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 2:4</span></span>

4, 5 And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, and all that
man hath will he give for his life: stretch forth yet once Thy hand, and
touch his bone, and his flesh, truly he will renounce Thee to Thy face.

Olshausen refers עזר בּעד עזר to Job in relation to Jehovah: So long as
Thou leavest his skin untouched, he will also leave Thee untouched;
which, though it is the devil who speaks, were nevertheless too
unbecomingly expressed. Hupfeld understands by the skin, that skin which
is here given for the other, - the skin of his cattle, of his servants
and children, which Job had gladly given up, that for such a price he
might get off with his own skin sound; but בּעד cannot be used as Beth
pretii: even in [Pro 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#026.md) this is not
the case. For the same reason, we must not, with Hirz., Ew., and most,
translate, Skin for skin = like for like, which Ewald bases on the
strange assertion, that one skin is like another, as one dead piece is
like another. The meaning of the words of Satan (rightly understood by
Schlottm. and the Jewish expositors) is this: One gives up one's skin to
preserve one's skin; one endures pain on a sickly part of the skin, for
the sake of saving the whole skin; one holds up the arm, as Raschi
suggests, to avert the fatal blow from the head. The second clause is
climacteric: a man gives skin for skin; but for his life, his highest
good, he willingly gives up everything, without exception, that can be
given up, and life itself still retained. This principle derived from
experience, applied to Job, may be expressed thus: Just so, Job has
gladly given up everything, and is content to have escaped with his
life. ואולם, verum enim vero, is connected with this suppressed because
self-evident application. The verb ננע, above, [Job
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011.md), with בּ, is construed here with
אל, and expresses increased malignity: Stretch forth Thy hand but once
to his very bones, etc. Instead of על־פּניך, [Job
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011.md), על־פּ is used here with the same
force: forthwith, fearlessly and regardlessly (comp. [Job
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015.md); [Deu
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#010).md), he will bid Thee farewell.

[Job 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 2:6</span></span>

The Grant of New Power:

6 And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only take care
of his life.

Job has not forfeited his life; permission is given to place it in
extreme peril, and nothing more, in order to see whether or not, in the
face of death, he will deny the God who has decreed such heavy
affliction for him. נפשׁ does not signify the same as חיּים; it is the
soul producing the spirit-life of man. We must, however, translate
"life," because we do not use "soul" in the sense of ψυχή, anima.

[Job 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 2:7</span></span>

The Working Out of the Commission:

7, 8 Then Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job
with sore boils, from the sole of his foot to his crown. And he took him
a potsherd to scrape himself with, and sat in the midst of ashes.

The description of this disease calls to mind [Deu
28:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035.md) with [Deu
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md), and is, according to the
symptoms mentioned further on in the book, elephantiasis so called
because the limbs become jointless lumps like elephants' legs), Arab.
jḏâm, ‛gudhâm, Lat. lepra nodosa, the most fearful form of lepra, which
sometimes seizes persons even of the higher ranks. Artapan (C. Mller,
Fragm. iii. 222) says, that an Egyptian king was the first man who died
of elephantiasis. Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, was afflicted with it in a
very dangerous form.

(Note: Vid., the history in Heer, De elephantiasi Graecorum et Arabum,
Breslay, 1842, and coloured plates in Trait de la Spdalskhed ou
Elephantiasis des Grecs par Danielssen et Boeck, Paris, 1848, translated
from the Norwegian; and in Hecker, Elephantiasis oder Lepra Arabica,
Lahr, 1858 (with lithographs). "The means of cure," says Aretus the
Cappadocian (vid., his writings translated by Mann, 1858, S. 221), "must
be more powerful than the disease, if it is to be removed. But what cure
can be successfully applied to the fearful evil of elephantiasis? It is
not confined to one part, either internally or externally, but takes
possession of the entire system. It is terrible and hideous to behold,
for it gives a man the appearance of an animal. Every one dreads to
live, and have any intercourse, with such invalids; they flee from them
as from the plague, for infection is easily communicated by the breath.
Where, in the whole range of pharmacy, can such a powerful remedy be
found?")

The disease begins with the rising of tubercular boils, and at length
resembles a cancer spreading itself over the whole body, by which the
body is so affected, that some of the limbs fall completely away.
Scraping with a potsherd will not only relieve the intolerable itching
of the skin, but also remove the matter. Sitting among ashes is on
account of the deep sorrow (comp. [Jon
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006).md) into which Job is brought by his
heavy losses, especially the loss of his children. The lxx adds that he
sat on a dunghill outside the city: the dunghill is taken from the
passage [Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md), and the "outside
the city" from the law of the מצרע. In addition to the four losses, a
fifth temptation, in the form of a disease incurable in the eye of man,
is now come upon Job: a natural disease, but brought on by Satan,
permitted, and therefore decreed, by God. Satan does not appear again
throughout the whole book. Evil has not only a personal existence in the
invisible world, but also its agents and instruments in this; and by
these it is henceforth manifested.

[Job 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 2:9</span></span>

First Job's Wife (who is only mentioned in one other passage ([Job
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#017).md), where Job complains that his
breath is offensive to her) Comes to Him:

9 Then his wife said to him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity?
renounce God, and die.

In the lxx the words of his wife are unskilfully extended. The few words
as they stand are sufficiently characteristic. They are not to be
explained, Call on God for the last time, and then die (von Gerl.); or,
Call on Him that thou die (according to Ges. 130, 2); but בּרך
signifies, as Job's answer shows, to take leave of. She therefore
counsels Job to do that which Satan has boasted to accomplish. And
notwithstanding, Hengstenberg, in his Lecture on the Book of Job (1860),

(Note: Clark's Foreign Theological Library.)

defends her against the too severe judgment of expositors. Her
desperation, says he, proceeds from her strong love for her husband; and
if she had to suffer the same herself, she would probably have struggled
against despair. But love hopeth all things; love keeps its despondency
hidden even when it desponds; love has no such godless utterance, as to
say, Renounce God; and none so unloving, as to say, Die. No, indeed!
this woman is truly diaboli adjutrix (August.); a tool of the temper
(Ebrard); impiae carnis praeco (Brentius). And though Calvin goes too
far when he calls her not only organum Satanae, but even Proserpinam et
Furiam infernalem, the title of another Xantippe, against which
Hengstenberg defends her, is indeed rather flattery than slander.
Tobias' Anna is her copy.

(Note: She says to the blind Tobias, when she is obliged to work for the
support of the family, and does not act straightforwardly towards him:
ποῦ εἰσὶν αἱ ἐλεημοσύναι σου καὶ αἱ δικαιοσύναι σου, ἰδοὺ γνωστὰ πάντα
μετὰ σοῦ, i.e., (as Sengelmann, Book of Tobit, 1857, and O. F.
Fritzsche, Handbuch zu d. Apokr. Lief. ii. S. 36, correctly explain) one
sees from thy misfortunes that thy virtue is not of much avail to thee.
She appears still more like Job in the revised text: manifeste vana
facta est spes tua et eleemosynae tuae modo apparuerunt, i.e., thy
benevolence has obviously brought us to poverty. In the text of Jerome a
parallel between Tobias and Job precedes this utterance of Tobias'
wife.)

What experience of life and insight the writer manifests in introducing
Job's wife as the mocking opposer of his constant piety! Job has lost
his children, but this wife he has retained, for he needed not to be
tried by losing her: he was proved sufficiently by having her. She is
further on once referred to, but even then not to her advantage. Why,
asks Chrysostom, did the devil leave him this wife? Because he thought
her a good scourge, by which to plague him more acutely than by any
other means. Moreover, the thought is not far distant, that God left her
to him in order that when, in the glorious issue of his sufferings, he
receives everything doubled, he might not have this thorn in the flesh
also doubled.

(Note: The delicate design of the writer here must not be overlooked: it
has something of the tragi-comic about it, and has furnished acceptable
material for epigrammatic writers not first from Kstner, but from early
times (vid., das Epigramm vom J. 1696, in Serpilius' Personalia Iobi).
Vid., a Jewish proverb relating thereto in Tendlau, Sprchw. u.
Redensarten deutsch-jd. Vorzeit (1860), S. 11.)

What enmity towards God, what uncharitableness towards her husband, is
there in her sarcastic words, which, if they are more than mockery,
counsel him to suicide! (Ebrard). But he repels them in a manner
becoming himself.

[Job 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 2:10</span></span>

10 But he said to her, As one of the ungodly would speak, thou speakest.
Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not also receive evil?

The answer of Job is strong but not harsh, for the אחת (comp. [Sa2
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#013).md) is somewhat soothing. The
translation "as one of the foolish women" does not correspond to the
Hebrew; נבל is one wxo thinks madly and acts impiously. What follows is
a double question, גּם for הגם. The גּם stands at the beginning of the
sentence, but logically belongs to the second part, towards which
pronunciation and reading must hurry over the first, - a frequent
occurrence after interrogative particles, e.g., [Num
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022.md); [Isa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md); after causal particles, e.g.,
[Isa 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md); [Pro
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md); after the negative פּן, [Deu
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#012.md)., and often. Hupfeld renders the
thought expressed in the double question very correctly: bonum quidem
hucusque a Deo accepimus, malum vero jam non item accipiemus? גּם is
found also elsewhere at the beginning of a sentence, although belonging
to a later clause, and that indeed not always the one immediately
following, e.g., [Hos 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md); [Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md); the same syntax is to be found
with אף, אך, and רק. קבּל, like תּמּה, is a word common to the book of
Job and Proverbs ([Pro 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#020).md); besides
these, it is found only in books written after the exile, and is more
Aramaic than Hebraic. By this answer which Job gives to his wife, he has
repelled the sixth temptation. For 10b In all this Job sinned not with
his lips.

[Job 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md)

10b In all this Job sinned not with his lips.

The Targum adds: but in his thoughts he already cherished sinful words.
בּשׂפתיו is certainly not undesignedly introduced here and omitted in
[Job 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#022.md). The temptation to murmur
was now already at work within him, but he was its master, so that no
murmur escaped him.

[Job 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 2:11</span></span>

After the sixth temptation there comes a seventh; and now the real
conflict begins, through which the hero of the book passes, not indeed
without sinning, but still triumphantly.

11 When Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon
him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz from Teman, and
Bildad from Shuach, and Zophar from Naama: for they had made an
appointment to come together to go and sympathize with him, and comfort
him.

אליפז is, according to Gen 36, an old Idumaean name (transposed = Phasal
in the history of the Herodeans; according to Michaelis, Suppl. p. 87;
cui Deus aurum est, comp. [Job 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#025).md),
and תּימן a district of Idumaea, celebrated for its native wisdom ([Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007); Bar. 3:22f..md). But also in
East-Hauran a Tm is still found (described by Wetzstein in his Bericht
ber seine Reise in den beiden Trachonen und um das Hauran-Gebirge,
Zeitschr. fr allg. Erdkunde, 1859), and about fifteen miles south of Tm,
a Bzn suggestive of Elihu's surname (comp. [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023).md). שׁוּח we know only from Gen 25
as the son of Abraham and Keturah, who settled in the east country.
Accordingly it must be a district of Arabia lying not very far from
Idumaea: it might be compared with trans-Hauran Schakka, though the
sound, however, of the word makes it scarcely admissible, which is
undoubtedly one and the same with Dakkai'a, east from Batanaea,
mentioned in Ptolem. v. 15. נעמה is a name frequent in Syria and
Palestine: there is a town of the Jewish Shephla (the low ground by the
Mediterranean) of this name, [Jos
15:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#041.md), which, however, can hardly be
intended here. הבּאה is Milel, consequently third pers. with the art.
instead of the relative pron. (as, besides here, [Gen
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021.md); [Gen
46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027).md), vid., Ges. 109 ad init. The
Niph. נועד is strongly taken by some expositors as the same meaning with
נועץ, to confer with, appoint a meeting: it signifies, to assemble
themselves, to meet in an appointed place at an appointed time ([Neh
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#002).md). Reports spread among the mounted
tribes of the Arabian desert with the rapidity of telegraphic
despatches.

[Job 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 2:12</span></span>

Their Arrival:

12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they
lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and
threw dust upon their heads toward heaven.

They saw a form which seemed to be Job, but in which they were not able
to recognise him. Then they weep and rend their outer garments, and
catch up dust to throw up towards heaven ([Sa1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012).md), that it may fall again upon
their heads. The casting up of dust on high is the outwards sign of
intense suffering, and, as von Gerlach rightly remarks, of that which
causes him to cry to heaven.

[Job 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 2:13</span></span>

Their Silence:

13 And they sat with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights;
and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his pain was very
great.

Ewald erroneously thinks that custom and propriety prescribed this seven
days' silence; it was (as [Eze 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015).md)
the force of the impression produced on them, and the fear of annoying
the sufferer. But their long silence shows that they had not fully
realized the purpose of their visit. Their feeling is overpowered by
reflection, their sympathy by dismay. It is a pity that they let Job
utter the first word, which they might have prevented by some word of
kindly solace; for, becoming first fully conscious of the difference
between his present and former position from their conduct, he breaks
forth with curses.
