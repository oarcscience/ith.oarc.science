B. Exposition of the Principal Laws - Deuteronomy 12-26

The statutes and rights which follow in the second or special half of
this address, and which consist in part of rules having regard to
circumstances not contemplated by the Sinaitic laws, and partly of
repetitions of laws already given, were designed as a whole to regulate
the ecclesiastical, civil, and domestic life of Israel in the land of
Canaan, in harmony with its calling to be the holy nation of the Lord.
Moses first of all describes the religious and ecclesiastical life of
the nation, in its various relations to the Lord (ch. 12-16:17); and
then the political organization of the congregation, or the rights and
duties of the civil and spiritual leaders of the nation (Deut
16:18-18:22); and lastly, seeks to establish upon a permanent basis the
civil and domestic well-being of the whole congregation and its
individual members, by a multiplicity of precepts, intended to set
before the people, as a conscientious obligation on their part,
reverence and holy awe in relation to human life, to property, and to
personal rights; a pious regard for the fundamental laws of the world;
sanctification of domestic life and of the social bond; practical
brotherly love towards the poor, the oppressed, and the needy; and
righteousness of walk and conversation (ch. 19-26). - So far as the
arrangement of this address is concerned, the first two series of these
laws may be easily regarded as expositions, expansions, and completions
of the commandments in the decalogue in relation to the Sabbath, and to
the duty of honouring parents; and in the third series also there are
unquestionably many allusions to the commandments in the second table of
the decalogue. But the order in which the different laws and precepts in
this last series are arranged, does not follow the order of the
decalogue, so as to warrant us in looking there for the leading
principle of the arrangement, as Schultz has done. Moses allows himself
to be guided much more by analogies and the free association of ideas
than by any strict regard to the decalogue; although, no doubt, the
whole of the book of Deuteronomy may be described, as Luther says, as "a
very copious and lucid explanation of the decalogue, an acquaintance
with which will supply all that is requisite to a full understanding of
the ten commandments."

[Deuteronomy 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 12:1</span></span>

The laws relating to the worship of the Israelites commence with a
command to destroy and annihilate all places and memorials of the
Canaanitish worship ([Deu 12:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002).md), and
then lay it down as an established rule, that the Israelites were to
worship the Lord their God with sacrifices and gifts, only in the place
which He Himself should choose ([Deu
12:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005).md). On the other hand, in the
land of Canaan cattle might be slain for eating and the flesh itself be
consumed in any place; though sacrificial meals could only be celebrated
in the place of the sanctuary appointed by the Lord ([Deu
12:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015).md). Moreover, on the extension
of the borders of the land, oxen, and sheep, and goats could be
slaughtered for food in any place; but the blood was not to be eaten,
and consecrated gifts and votive sacrifices were not to be prepared as
meals anywhere, except at the altar of the Lord ([Deu
12:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#020).md). Lastly, the Israelites were
not to be drawn aside by the Canaanites, to imitate them in their
worship ([Deu 12:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029).md).

[Deu 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md)

On the heading in [Deu 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md), see chs.
[Deu 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001.md) and [Deu
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md). "All the days that ye live"
relates to the more distant clause, "which ye shall observe," etc. (cf.
[Deu 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010).md).

[Deu 12:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002.md)

Ye shall destroy all the places where the Canaanites worship their gods,
upon the high mountains, upon the hills, and under every green tree (cf.
[Jer 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md); [Jer
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002.md); [Kg2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#004.md); [Kg2
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#010).md). The choice of mountains and
hills for places of worship by most of the heathen nations, had its
origin in the wide-spread belief, that men were nearer to the Deity and
to heaven there. The green trees are connected with the holy groves, of
which the heathen nations were so fond, and the shady gloom of which
filled the soul with holy awe at the nearness of the Deity. In the
absence of groves, they chose green trees with thick foliage ([Eze
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013.md); [Eze
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#028).md), such as the vigorous oak,
which attains a great age, the evergreen terebinth ([Isa
1:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md); [Isa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005).md), and the poplar or osier, which
continues green even in the heat of summer ([Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013).md), and whose deep shade is adapted
to dispose the mind to devotion.

[Deu 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#003.md)

Beside the place of worship, they were also to destroy all the idols of
the Canaanitish worship, as had already been commanded in [Deu
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005.md), and to blot out even their names,
i.e., every trace of their existence (cf. [Deu
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#024).md).

[Deu 12:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#004.md)

"Ye shall not do so to Jehovah your God," i.e., not build altars and
offer sacrifices to Him in any place you choose, but ([Deu
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005)..md) shall only keep yourselves (אל
דּרשׁ) to the place "which He shall choose out of all the tribes to put
His name there for His dwelling." Whereas the heathen seeks and worships
his nature-gods, wherever he thinks he can discern in nature any trace
of Divinity, the true God has not only revealed His eternal power and
Godhead in the works of creation, but His personal being, which unfolds
itself to the world in love and holiness, in grace and righteousness, He
has made known to man, who was created in His image, in the words and
works of salvation; and in these testimonies of His saving presence He
has fixed for Himself a name, in which He dwells among His people. This
name presents His personality, as comprehended in the word Jehovah, in a
visible sign, the tangible pledge of His essential presence. During the
journeying of the Israelites this was effected by the pillar of cloud
and fire; and after the erection of the tabernacle, by the cloud in the
most holy place, above the ark of the covenant, with the cherubim uon
it, in which Jehovah had promised to appear to the high priest as the
representative of the covenant nation. Through this, the tabernacle, and
afterwards Solomon's temple, which took its place, became the
dwelling-place of the name of the Lord. But if the knowledge of the true
God rested upon direct manifestations of the divine nature, - and the
Lord God had for that very reason made Himself known to His people in
words and deeds as their God-then as a matter of course the mode of His
worship could not be dependent upon any appointment of men, but must be
determined exclusively by God Himself. The place of His worship depended
upon the choice which God Himself should make, and which would be made
known by the fact that He "put His name," i.e., actually manifested His
own immediate presence, in one definite spot. By the building of the
tabernacle, which the Lord Himself prescribed as the true spot for the
revelation of His presence among His people, the place where His name
was to dwell among the Israelites was already so far determined, that
only the particular town or locality among the tribes of Israel where
the tabernacle was to be set up after the conquest of Canaan remained to
be decided. At the same time, Moses not only speaks of the Lord choosing
the place among all the tribes for the erection of His sanctuary, but
also of His choosing the place where He would put His name, that He
might dwell there (לשׁכנו from שׁכן, for שׁכנו from שׁכן). For the
presence of the Lord was not, and was not intended, to be exclusively
confined to the tabernacle (or the temple). As God of the whole earth,
wherever it might be necessary, for the preservation and promotion of
His kingdom, He could make known His presence, and accept the sacrifices
of His people in other places, independently of this sanctuary; and
there were times when this was really done. The unity of the worship,
therefore, which Moses here enjoined, was not to consist in the fact
that the people of Israel brought all their sacrificial offerings to the
tabernacle, but in their offering them only in the spot where the Lord
made His name (that is to say, His presence) known.

What Moses commanded here, was only an explanation and more emphatic
repetition of the divine command in [Exo
20:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#023.md) ([Deu
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#021.md) and [Deu
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#022).md); and to understand "the place
which Jehovah would choose" as relating exclusively to Jerusalem or the
temple-hill, is a perfectly arbitrary assumption. Shiloh, the place
where the tabernacle was set up after the conquest of the land ([Jos
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001).md), and where it stood during the
whole of the times of the judges, was also chosen by the Lord (cf. [Jer
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012).md). It was not till after David had
set up a tent for the ark of the covenant upon Zion, in the city of
Jerusalem, which he had chosen as the capital of his kingdom, and had
erected an altar for sacrifice there ([Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md); [Ch1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001).md), that the will of the Lord was
made known to him by the prophet Gad, that he should build an altar upon
the threshing-floor of Araunah, where the angel of the Lord had appeared
to him; and through this command the place was fixed for the future
temple ([Sa2 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#018.md); [Ch1
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#018).md). דּרשׁ with אל, to turn in a
certain direction, to inquire or to seek. את־שׁמו שׂוּם, "to put His
name," i.e., to make known His presence, is still further defined by the
following word לשׁכנו, as signifying that His presence was to be of
permanent duration. It is true that this word is separated by an athnach
from the previous clause; but it certainly cannot be connected with
תדרשׁוּ (ye shall seek), not only because of the standing phrase, שׁם
שׁמו לשׁכּן ("to cause His name to dwell there," [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md); [Deu
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023.md); [Deu
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#002.md), [Deu
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#006), etc..md), but also because this
connection would give no fitting sense, as the infinitive שׁכן does not
mean "a dwelling-place."

[Deu 12:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md)

Thither they were to take all their sacrificial gifts, and there they
were to celebrate their sacrificial meals. The gifts are classified in
four pairs: (1) the sacrifices intended for the altar, burnt-offerings
and slain-offerings being particularly mentioned as the two principal
kinds, with which, according to [Num
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#004.md)., meat-offerings and
drink-offerings were to be associated; (2) "your tithes and every
heave-offering of your hand." By the tithes we are to understand the
tithes of field-produce and cattle, commanded in [Lev
27:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md) and [Num
18:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021.md), which were to be brought to
the sanctuary because they were to be offered to the Lord, as was the
case under Hezekiah ([Ch2 31:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005).md).
That the tithes mentioned here should be restricted to vegetable tithes
(of corn, new wine, and oil), is neither allowed by the general
character of the expression, nor required by the context. For instance,
although, according to [Deu 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md) and
[Deu 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md), [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md), as compared with [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md), a portion of the vegetable
tithe was to be applied to the sacrificial meals, there is no ground
whatever for supposing that all the sacrifices and consecrated gifts
mentioned in [Deu 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md) were offerings
of this kind, and either served as sacrificial meals, or had such meals
connected with them. Burnt-offerings, for example, were not associated
in any way with the sacrificial meals. The difficulty, or as some
suppose "the impossibility," of delivering all the tithes from every
part of the land at the place of the sanctuary, does not warrant us in
departing from the simple meaning of Moses' words in the verse before
us. The arrangement permitted in [Deu
14:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#024.md), with reference to the
so-called second tithe, - viz., that if the sanctuary was too far off,
the tithe might be sold at home, and whatever was required for the
sacrificial meals might be bought at the place of the sanctuary with the
money so obtained, - might possibly have been also adopted in the case
of the other tithe. At all events, the fact that no reference is made to
such cases as these does not warrant us in assuming the opposite. As the
institution of tithes generally did not originate with the law of Moses,
but is presupposed as a traditional and well-known custom, - all that is
done being to define them more precisely, and regulate the way in which
they should be applied, - Moses does not enter here into any details as
to the course to be adopted in delivering them, but merely lays down the
law that all the gifts intended for the Lord were to be brought to Him
at His sanctuary, and connects with this the further injunction that the
Israelites were to rejoice there before the Lord, that is to say, were
to celebrate their sacrificial meals at the place of His presence which
He had chosen. - The gifts, from which the sacrificial meals were
prepared, are not particularized here, but are supposed to be already
known either form the earlier laws or from tradition. From the earlier
laws we learn that the whole of the flesh of the burnt-offerings was to
be consumed upon the altar, but that the flesh of the slain-offerings,
except in the case of the peace-offerings, was to be applied to the
sacrificial meals, with the exception of the fat pieces, and the
wave-breast and heave-shoulder. With regard to the tithes, it is stated
in [Num 18:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021.md) that Jehovah had
given them to the Levites as their inheritance, and that they were to
give the tenth part of them to the priests. In the laws contained in the
earlier books, nothing is said about the appropriation of any portion of
the tithes to sacrificial meals. Yet in Deuteronomy this is simply
assumed as a customary thing, and not introduced as a new commandment,
when the law is laid down (in [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md); [Deu
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md)., [Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012)..md), that they were not to eat the
tithe of corn, new wine, and oil within their gates (in the towns of the
land), any more than the first-born of oxen and sheep, but only at the
place of the sanctuary chosen by the Lord; and that if the distance was
too great for the whole to be transported thither, they were to sell the
tithes and firstlings at home, and then purchase at the sanctuary
whatever might be required for the sacrificial meals. From these
instructions it is very apparent that sacrificial meals were associated
with the delivery of the tithes and firstlings to the Lord, to which a
tenth part of the corn, must, and oil was applied, as well as the flesh
of the first-born of edible cattle. This tenth formed the so-called
second tithe (δευτέραν δεκάτην, Tob. 1:7), which is mentioned here for
the first time, but not introduced as a new rule or an appendix to the
former laws. It is rather taken for granted as a custom founded upon
tradition, and brought into harmony with the law relating to the oneness
of the sanctuary and worship.

(Note: The arguments employed by De Wette and Vater against this
arrangement with regard to the vegetable tithe, which is established
beyond all question by the custom of the Jews themselves, have been so
fully met by Hengstenberg (Dissertations, ii. 334ff.), that Riehm has
nothing to adduce in reply, except the assertion that in Deut 18, where
the revenues of the priests and Levites are given, there is nothing said
about the tithe, and the tithe of the tithe, and also that the people
would have been overburdened by a second tithe. But, apart from the fact
that argumenta e silentio generally do not prove much, the first
assertion rests upon the erroneous assumption that in Deut 18 all the
revenues of the priests are given separately; whereas Moses confines
himself to this general summary of the revenues of the priests and
Levites enumerated singly in Num 18, "The firings of Jehovah shall be
the inheritance of the tribe of Levi, these they shall eat," and then
urges upon the people in [Num 18:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#003.md)
an addition to the revenues already established. The second objection is
refuted by history. For if in later times, when the people of Israel had
to pay very considerable taxes to the foreign kings under whose rule
they were living, they could give a second tenth of the fruits of the
ground in addition to the priests' tithe, as we may see from Tobit 1:7,
such a tax could not have been too grievous a burden for the nation in
the time of its independence; to say nothing of the fact that this
second tenth belonged in great part to the donors themselves, since it
was consumed in sacrificial meals, to which only poor and needy persons
were invited, and therefore could not be regarded as an actual tax.)

"The heave-offerings of your hand," which are mentioned again in [Mal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md) along with the tithes, are not to
be restricted to the first-fruits, as we may see from [Eze
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040.md), where the terumoth are
mentioned along with the first-fruits. We should rather understand them
as being free gifts of love, which were consecrated to the Lord in
addition to the legal first-fruits and tithes without being actual
sacrifices, and which were then applied to sacrificial meals. - The
other gifts were (3) נדרים and נדבות, sacrifices which were offered
partly in consequence of vows and partly of their own free will (see at
[Lev 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#038.md), compared with [Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016.md); [Lev
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#021.md), and [Num
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003.md); [Num
29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039)); and lastly (4.md), "firstlings of
your herds and of your flocks," viz., those commanded in [Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md), [Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012.md)., and [Num
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015.md).

According to [Exo 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#015.md), the
Israelites were to sacrifice the firstlings to the Lord; and according
to [Num 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#008.md). they belonged to the
holy gifts, which the Lord assigned to the priests for their
maintenance, with the more precise instructions in [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md), [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md), that the first-born of oxen,
sheep, and goats were not to be redeemed, but being holy were to be
burned upon the altar in the same manner as the shelamim, and that the
flesh was to belong to the priests, like the wave-breast and right leg
of the shelamim. These last words, it is true, are not to be understood
as signifying that the only portions of the flesh of the firstlings
which were to be given to the priest were the wave-breast and heave-leg,
and that the remainder of the flesh was to be left to the offerer to be
applied to a sacrificial meal (Hengstenberg); but they state most
unequivocally that the priest was to apply the flesh to a sacrificial
meal, like the wave-breast and heave-leg of all the peace-offerings,
which the priest was not even allowed to consume with his own family at
home, like ordinary flesh, but to which the instructions given for all
the sacrificial meals were applicable, namely, that "whoever was clean
in the priest's family" might eat of it ([Num
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#011).md), and that the flesh was to be
eaten on the day when the sacrifice was offered ([Lev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015).md), or at the latest on the
following morning, as in the case of the votive offering ([Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016).md), and that whatever was left was
to be burnt. These instructions concerning the flesh of the firstlings
to be offered to the Lord no more prohibit the priest from allowing the
persons who presented the firstlings to take part in the sacrificial
meals, or handing over to them some portion of the flesh which belonged
to himself to hold a sacrificial meal, than any other law does; on the
contrary, the duty of doing this was made very plain by the fact that
the presentation of firstlings is described as ליהוה זבח in [Exo
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#015.md), in the very first of the
general instructions for their sanctification, since even in the
patriarchal times the זבח was always connected with a sacrificial meal
in which the offerer participated. Consequently it cannot be shown that
there is any contradiction between Deuteronomy and the earlier laws with
regard to the appropriation of the first-born. The command to bring the
firstlings of the sacrificial animal, like all the rest of the
sacrifices, to the place of His sanctuary which the Lord would choose,
and to hold sacrificial meals there with the tithes of corn, new wine,
and oil, and also with the firstlings of the flocks, and herds, is given
not merely to the laity of Israel, but to the whole of the people,
including the priests and Levites, without the distinction between the
tribe of Levi and the other tribes, established in the earlier laws,
being even altered, much less abrogated. The Israelites were to bring
all their sacrificial gifts to the place of the sanctuary to be chosen
by the Lord, and there, not in all their towns, they were to eat their
votive and free-will offerings in sacrificial meals. This, and only
this, is what Moses commands the people both here in [Deu
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md) and [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md), [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md), and also in [Deu
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md). and [Deu
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019.md).

(Note: If, therefore, the supposed discrepancies between the law of
Deuteronomy and that of Exodus and Leviticus concerning the tithes and
firstlings vanish into mere appearance when the passages in Deuteronomy
are correctly explained, the conclusions to which Riehm comes (pp.
43ff.), - viz., that in Deuteronomy the tithes and firstlings are no
longer the property of the priests and Levites, and that all the laws
concerning the redemption and sale of them are abrogated there-are
groundless assertions, founded upon the unproved and unfounded
assumption, that Deuteronomy was intended to contain a repetition of the
whole of the earlier law.)

"Rejoice in all that your hand has acquired." The phrase יד משׁלח (cf.
[Deu 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md); [Deu
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#010.md); [Deu
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021.md); [Deu
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#008.md), [Deu
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#020).md) signifies that to which the
hand is stretched out, that which a man undertakes (synonymous with
מעשׂה), and also what a man acquires by his activity: hence [Isa
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014.md), יד משׁלוח, what a man
appropriates to himself with his hand, or takes possession of. אשׁר
before בּרכך is dependent upon ידכם משׁלה, and בּרך is construed with a
double accusative, as in [Gen 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025.md).
The reason for these instructions is given in [Deu
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#008.md), [Deu
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009.md), namely, that this had not
hitherto taken place, but that up to this day every one had done what he
thought right, because they had not yet come to the rest and to the
inheritance which the Lord was about to give them. The phrase,
"whatsoever is right in his own eyes," is applied to actions performed
according to a man's own judgment, rather than according to the standard
of objective right and the law of God (cf. [Jdg
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006.md); [Jdg
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#025).md). The reference is probably not
so much to open idolatry, which was actually practised, according to
[Lev 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md); [Num
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md); [Eze
20:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#016.md); [Amo
5:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md), as to acts of illegality, for
which some excuse might be found in the circumstances in which they were
placed when wandering through the desert, - such, for example, as the
omission of the daily sacrifice when the tabernacle was not set up, and
others of a similar kind.

[Deu 12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#010.md)

But when the Israelites had crossed over the Jordan, and dwelt peaceably
in Canaan, secured against their enemies round about, these
irregularities were not to occur any more; but all the sacrifices were
to be offered at the place chosen by the Lord for the dwelling-place of
His name, and there the sacrificial meals were to be held with joy
before the Lord. "The choice of your vows," equivalent to your chosen
vows, inasmuch as every vow was something special, as the standing
phrase נדר פּלּא ([Lev 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#021.md), and [Num
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003.md), [Num
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#008).md) distinctly shows. - "Rejoicing
before the Lord," which is the phrase applied in [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md) to the celebration of the feast
of Tabernacles, was to be the distinctive feature of all the sacrificial
meals held by the people at the sanctuary, as is repeatedly affirmed
([Deu 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#026.md); [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011.md); [Deu
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#011.md); [Deu
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#007).md). This holy joy in the
participation of the blessing bestowed by the Lord was to be shared not
only by sons and daughters, but also by salve (men-servants and
maid-servants), that they too might taste the friendliness of their God,
and also by "the Levite that is in your gates" (i.e., your towns and
hamlets; see at [Exo 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010).md). This
frequently recurring description of the Levites (cf. [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md); [Deu
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#027.md); [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011.md), [Deu
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#014.md); [Deu
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#006.md); [Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012).md) does not assume that they were
homeless, which would be at variance with the allotment of towns for
them to dwell in (Num 35); but simply implies what is frequently added
in explanation, that the Levites had "no part nor inheritance," no share
of the land as their hereditary property, and in this respect resembled
strangers ([Deu 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md), [Deu
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#029.md); [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011), etc..md).

(Note: The explanation given by De Wette, and adopted by Riehm, of the
expression, "the Levite that is within thy gates," is perfectly
arbitrary and unfounded: viz., that "the Levites did not live any longer
in the towns assigned them by the earlier laws, but were scattered about
in the different towns of the other tribes.")

And the repeated injunction to invite the Levites to the sacrificial
meals is not at variance with [Num
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021.md), where the tithes are assigned
to the tribe of Levi for their maintenance. For however ample this
revenue may have been according to the law, it was so entirely
dependent, upon the honesty and conscientiousness of the people, that
the Levites might very easily be brought into a straitened condition, if
indifference towards the Lord and His servants should prevail throughout
the nation. - In [Deu 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013.md), [Deu
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014.md), Moses concludes by once more
summing up these instructions in the admonition to beware of offering
sacrifices in every place that they might choose, the burnt-offering, as
the leading sacrifice, being mentioned instar omnium.

[Deuteronomy 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 12:15</span></span>

But if these instructions were really to be observed by the people in
Canaan, it was necessary that the law which had been given with
reference to the journey through the wilderness, viz., that no animal
should be slain anywhere else than at the tabernacle in the same manner
as a slain-offering ([Lev 17:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003).md),
should be abolished. This is done in [Deu
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md), where Moses, in direct
connection with what goes before, allows the people, as an exception
(רק, only) to the rules laid down in [Deu
12:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#004.md), to kill and eat flesh for
their own food according to all their soul's desire. Flesh that was
slaughtered for food could be eaten by both clean and unclean, such for
example as the roebuck and the hart, animals which could not be offered
in sacrifice, and in which, therefore, the distinction between clean and
unclean on the part of the eaters did not come into consideration at
all.

[Deu 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#016.md)

But blood was forbidden to be eaten (see at [Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010)..md). The blood was to be poured
out upon the earth like water, that it might suck it in, receive it into
its bosom.

[Deu 12:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md)

Sacrificial meals could only be held at the sanctuary; and the Levite
was not to be forgotten or neglected in connection with them (see at
[Deu 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md), [Deu
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md), and [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012).md). תוּכל לא, "thou must not," as
in [Deu 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022.md).

[Deuteronomy 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 12:20</span></span>

These rules were still to remain in force, even when God should extend
the borders of the land in accordance with His promise. This extension
relates partly to the gradual but complete extermination of the
Canaanites ([Deu 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022.md), comp. with [Exo
23:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027).md), and partly to the extension
of the territory of the Israelites beyond the limits of Canaan Proper,
in accordance with the divine promise in [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md). The words "as He hath spoken to
thee" refer primarily to [Exo
23:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md). (On [Deu
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#020.md), see [Deu
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015).md). - In [Deu
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#021.md), "if the place...be too far from
thee," supplies the reason for the repeal of the law in [Lev
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003.md), which restricted all
slaughtering to the place of the sanctuary. The words "kill...as I have
commanded thee" refer back to [Deu
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md).

[Deuteronomy 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 12:22</span></span>

Only the flesh that was slaughtered was to be eaten as the hart and the
roebuck (cf. [Deu 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015).md), i.e., was
not to be made into a sacrifice. יחדּו, together, i.e., the one just the
same as the other, as in [Isa 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008.md),
without the clean necessarily eating along with the unclean.

[Deuteronomy 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 12:23</span></span>

The law relating to the blood, as in [Deu
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#016.md). - "Be strong not to eat the
blood," i.e., stedfastly resist the temptation to eat it.

[Deuteronomy 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 12:25</span></span>

On the promise for doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord, see
[Deu 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#018.md). - In [Deu
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#026.md), [Deu
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#027.md), the command to offer all the
holy gifts at the place chosen by the Lord is enforced once more, as in
[Deu 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md), [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md), [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md), [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md); also to prepare the sacrifices
at His altar. קדשׁים, the holy offerings prescribed in the law, as in
[Num 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008.md); see at [Lev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#022.md). The "votive offerings" are
mentioned in connection with these, because vows proceeded from a
spontaneous impulse. לך יהיוּ אשׁר, "which are to thee," are binding
upon thee. In v. 27, "the flesh and the blood" are in opposition to "thy
burnt-offerings:" "thy burnt-offerings, namely the flesh and blood of
them," thou shalt prepare at the altar of Jehovah; i.e., the flesh and
blood of the burnt-offerings were to be placed upon and against the
altar (see at [Lev 1:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005).md). Of the
slain-offerings, i.e., the shelamim, the blood was to be poured out
against the altar ([Lev 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#002.md), [Lev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#008.md), [Lev
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#013).md); "the flesh thou canst eat" (cf.
[Lev 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011)..md). There is no ground for
seeking an antithesis in ישּׁפך, as Knobel does, to the זרק in the
sacrificial ritual. The indefinite expression may be explained from the
retrospective allusion to [Deu 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#024.md)
and the purely suggestive character of the whole passage, the thing
itself being supposed to be sufficiently known from the previous laws.

[Deuteronomy 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 12:28</span></span>

The closing admonition is a further expansion of [Deu
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#025.md) (see at [Deu
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#021).md). - In [Deu
12:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029.md), the exhortation goes back to
the beginning again, viz., to a warning against the Canaanitish idolatry
(cf. [Deu 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002)..md). When the Lord had
cut off the nations of Canaan from before the Israelites, they were to
take heed that they did not get into the snare behind them, i.e., into
the sin of idolatry, which had plunged the Canaanites into destruction
(cf. [Deu 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#016.md), [Deu
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025).md). The clause "after they be
destroyed from before thee" is not mere tautology, but serves to depict
the danger of the snare most vividly before their eyes. The second
clause, "that thou inquire not after them" (their gods), etc., explains
more fully to the Israelites the danger which threatened them. This
danger was so far a pressing one, that the whole of the heathen world
was animated with the conviction, that to neglect the gods of a land
would be sure to bring misfortune (cf. [Kg2
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#026).md).

[Deuteronomy 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">deu 12:31</span></span>

[Deu 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031.md), like [Deu
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#004.md), with the reason assigned in [Deu
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031.md) : "for the Canaanites prepare
(עשׂה, as in [Deu 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#027).md) all kinds of
abominations for their gods," i.e., present offerings to these, which
Jehovah hates and abhors; they even burn their children to their
idols-for example, to Moloch (see at [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021).md).

[Deuteronomy 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">deu 12:32</span></span>

The admonition to observe the whole law, without adding to it or taking
from it (cf. [Deu 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002).md), is regarded by
many commentators as the conclusion of the previous chapter. But it is
more correct to understand it as an intermediate link, closing what goes
before, and introductory to what follows. Strictly speaking, the warning
against inclining to the idolatry of the Canaanites ([Deu
12:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029).md) forms a transition from the
enforcement of the true mode of worshipping Jehovah to the laws relating
to tempters to idolatry and worshippers of idols (ch. 13). The
Israelites were to cut off not only the tempters to idolatry, but those
who had been led astray to idolatry also. Three different cases are
mentioned.
