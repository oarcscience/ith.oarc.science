### [Numbers Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 31:1</span></span>

The Campaign. - After the people of Israel had been mustered as the army
of Jehovah, and their future relation to the Lord had been firmly
established by the order of sacrifice that was given to them immediately
afterwards, the Lord commanded Moses to carry out that hostility to the
Midianites which had already been commanded in [Num
25:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#016.md). Moses was to revenge (i.e.,
to execute) the revenge of the children of Israel upon the Midianites,
and then to be gathered to his people, i.e., to die, as had already been
revealed to him ([Num 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#013).md). "The
revenge of the children of Israel" was revenge for the wickedness which
the tribes of the Midianites who dwelt on the east of Moab (see at [Num
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004).md) had practised upon the
Israelites, by seducing them to the idolatrous worship of Baal Peor.
This revenge is called the "revenge of Jehovah" in [Num
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#003.md), because the seduction had
violated the divinity and honour of Jehovah. The daughters of Moab had
also taken part in the seduction ([Num
25:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001).md); but they had done so at the
instigation of the Midianites, and not of their own accord, and
therefore the Midianites only were to atone for the wickedness.

[Numbers 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 31:3</span></span>

To carry out this revenge, Moses had 1000 men of each tribe delivered
(ימּסרוּ, see at [Num 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016).md) from the
families (alaphim, see [Num 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#016).md) of
the tribes, and equipped for war; and these he sent to the army (into
the war) along with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the high priest, who
carried the holy vessels, viz., the alarm-trumpets, in his hand.
Phinehas was attached to the army, not as the leader of the soldiers,
but as the high priest with the holy trumpets ([Num
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009).md), because the war was a holy war
of the congregation against the enemies of themselves and their God.
Phinehas had so distinguished himself by the zeal which he had displayed
against the idolaters ([Num 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#007).md),
that it was impossible to find any other man in all the priesthood to
attach to the army, who would equal him in holy zeal, or be equally
qualified to inspire the army with zeal for the holy conflict. "The holy
vessels" cannot mean the ark of the covenant on account of the plural,
which would be inapplicable to it; nor the Urim and Thummim, because
Phinehas was not yet high priest, and the expression כּלי would also be
unsuitable to these. The allusion can only be to the trumpets mentioned
immediately afterwards, the ו before חצצרות being the ו explic., "and in
fact." Phinehas took these in his hand, because the Lord had assigned
them to His congregation, to bring them into remembrance before Him in
time of war, and to ensure His aid ([Num
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009).md).

[Numbers 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 31:7</span></span>

Of the campaign itself, the results are all that is recorded. No doubt
it terminated with a great battle, in which the Midianites were taken
unawares and completely routed. As it was a war of vengeance of Jehovah,
the victors slew all the males, i.e., all the adult males, as the sequel
shows, without quarter; and "upon those that were slain," i.e., in
addition to them, the five Midianitsh kings and Balaam, who first
advised the Midianites, according to [Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016.md), to tempt the Israelites to
idolatry. The five kings were chiefs of the larger or more powerful of
the Midianitish tribes, as Zur is expressly said to have been in [Num
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#015.md). In [Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md) they are called "vassals of
Sihon," because Sihon had subjugated them and made them tributary when
he first conquered the land. The women and children of the Midianites
were led away prisoners; and their cattle (behemah, beasts of draft and
burden, as in [Exo 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010).md), and their
flocks, and their goods taken away as spoil. The towns in their
dwellings, and all their villages (tiroth, tent-villages, as in [Gen
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016).md), were burnt down. The
expression "towns in their dwellings" leads to the conclusion that the
towns were not the property of the Midianites themselves, who were a
nomad people, but that they originally belonged in all probability to
the Moabites, and had been taken possession of by the Amorites under
Sihon. This is confirmed by [Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md), according to which these five
Midianitish vassals of Sihon dwelt in the land, i.e., in the kingdom of
Sihon. This also serves to explain why the conquest on their country is
not mentioned in the account before us, although it is stated in Joshua
(l.c.), that it was allotted to the Reubenites with the kingdom of
Sihon.

[Numbers 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 31:11</span></span>

All this booty (shalal, booty in goods), and all the prey in man and
beast (malkoach), was brought by the conquerors to Moses and Eleazar and
the congregation, into the camp in the steppes of Moab. In [Num
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#012.md), שׁבי applies to the women and
children who were taken prisoners, מלקוח to the cattle taken as booty,
and שׁלל to the rest of the prey.

[Numbers 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 31:13</span></span>

Treatment of the Prisoners. - When Moses went out to the front of the
camp with Eleazar and the princes of the congregation to meet the
returning warriors, he was angry with the commanders, because they had
left all the women alive, since it was they who had been the cause, at
Balaam's instigation, of the falling away of the Israelites from Jehovah
to worship Peor; and he commanded all the male children to be slain, and
every woman who had lain with a man, and only the young girls who had
hitherto had no connection with a man to be left alive. החיל פּקוּדי,
lit., the appointed persons, i.e., the officers of the army, who were
then divided into princes (captains) over thousands and hundreds. -
"Which came from the battle," i.e., who had returned. The question in
[Num 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#015.md), "Have ye left all the
women alive?" is an expression of dissatisfaction, and reproof for their
having done this. למסר־מעל...היוּ, "they have become to the Israelites
to work unfaithfulness towards Jehovah," i.e., they have induced them to
commit an act of unfaithfulness towards Jehovah. The word מסר, which
only occurs in this chapter, viz., in [Num
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#005.md) and [Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016.md), appears to be used in the sense
of giving, delivering, and then, like נתן, doing, making, effecting. On
the fact itself, see [Num 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#006.md). The
object of the command to put all the male children to death, was to
exterminate the whole nation, as it could not be perpetuated in the
women. Of the female sex, all were to be put to death who had known the
lying with a man, and therefore might possibly have been engaged in the
licentious worship of Peor ([Num
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#002).md), to preserve the congregation
from all contamination from that abominable idolatry.

[Numbers 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 31:19</span></span>

Purification of the Warriors, the Prisoners, and the Booty. - Moses
commanded the men of war to remain for seven days outside the camp of
the congregation, to carry out upon the third and seventh day the legal
purification of such persons and things as had been rendered unclean
through contact with dead bodies. Every one who had slain a soul
(person), or touched one who had been slain, was to be purified, whether
he were a warrior or a prisoner. And so also were all the clothes,
articles of leather, materials of goats' hair, and all wooden things.

[Numbers 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 31:21</span></span>

To this end Eleazar, whose duty it was as high priest to see that the
laws of purification were properly observed, issued fuller instructions
with reference to the purification of the different articles, in
accordance with the law in ch. 19. למּלחמה הבּאים, those who came to the
war, i.e., who went into the battle (see at [Num
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009).md). "The ordinance of the law:" as
in [Num 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#002.md). The metal (gold, silver,
copper, tin, lead), all that usually comes into the fire, i.e., that
will bear the fire, was to be drawn through the fire, that it might
become clean, and was then to be sprinkled with water of purification
([Num 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009).md); but everything that would
not bear the fire was to be drawn through water. - The washing of
clothes on the seventh day was according to the rule laid down in [Num
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#019.md).

[Numbers 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 31:25</span></span>

Distribution of the Booty. - God directed Moses, with Eleazar and the
heads of the fathers' houses ("fathers" for "fathers' houses:" see at
[Exo 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014).md) of the congregation, to
take the whole of the booty in men and cattle, and divide it into two
halves: one for the men of war (המּלחמה תּפשׂי, those who grasped at
war, who engaged in war), the other for the congregation, and to levy a
tribute upon it (מכס = מכסה, computatio, a certain amount: see [Exo
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#004).md) for Jehovah. Of the half that
came to the warriors, one person and one head of cattle were to be
handed over to Eleazar the priest out of every 500 (i.e., one-fifth per
cent.), as a heave-offering for Jehovah; and of the other half that was
set apart for the children of Israel, i.e., for the congregation, one
out of every fifty (i.e., 2 per cent.) was to be taken for the Levites.
אחז, laid hold of, i.e., snatched out of the whole number during the
process of counting; not seized or touched by the lot, as in [Ch1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006.md), as there was no reason for
resorting to the lot in this instance. The division of the booty into
two equal halves, one of which was given to the warriors, and the other
to the congregation that had taken no part in the war, was perfectly
reasonable and just. As the 12,000 warriors had been chosen out of the
whole congregation to carry on the war on their behalf, the congregation
itself could properly lay claim to its share of the booty. But as the
12,000 had had all the trouble, hardships, and dangers of the war, they
could very properly reckon upon some reward for their service; and this
was granted them by their receiving quite as much as the whole of the
congregation which had taken no part in the war-in fact, more, because
the warriors only gave one-fifth per cent. of their share as a
thank-offering for the victory that had been granted them, whilst those
who remained at home had to give 2 per cent. of their share to Jehovah
for the benefit of the priests and Levites. The arrangement, however,
was only made for this particular case, and not as a law for all times,
although it was a general rule that those who remained at home received
a share of the booty brought back by the warriors (cf. [Jos
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#008.md); [Sa1
30:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#024); 2 Macc. 8:28, 30.md).

[Numbers 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 31:31</span></span>

The booty, viz., "the rest of the booty, which the men of war had
taken," i.e., all the persons taken prisoners that had not been put to
death, and all the cattle taken as booty that had not been consumed
during the march home, amounted to 675,000 head of small cattle, 72,000
oxen, 61,000 asses, and 32,000 maidens. Each half, therefore, consisted
of 337,500 head of small cattle, 36,000 oxen, 30,500 asses, and 16,000
maidens ([Num 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#036.md) and [Num
31:43-46](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#043).md). Of the one half the priests
received 675 head of small cattle, 72 oxen, 61 asses, and 32 maidens for
Jehovah; and these Moses handed over to Eleazar, in all probability for
the maintenance of the priests, in the same manner as the tithes ([Num
18:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#026.md), and [Lev
27:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030).md), so that they might put the
cattle into their own flocks ([Num
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#003).md), and slay oxen or sheep as they
required them, whilst they sold the asses, and made slaves of the gifts;
and not in the character of a vow, in which case the clean animals would
have had to be sacrificed, and the unclean animals, as well as the human
beings, to be redeemed ([Lev 27:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002).md).
Of the other half, the Levites received the fiftieth part ([Num
31:43-47](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#043).md), that is to say, 6750 head
of small cattle, 720 oxen, 610 asses, and 320 girls. The וגו מחצית ("the
half," etc.), in [Num 31:42](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#042.md), is
resumed in [Num 31:47](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#047.md), and the
enumeration of the component parts of this half in [Num
31:43-46](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#043.md) is to be regarded as
parenthetical.

[Numbers 31:48](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">num 31:48</span></span>

Sacred Oblations of the Officers. - When the officers reviewed the men
of war who were "in their hand," i.e., who had fought the battle under
their command, and found not a single man missing, they felt constrained
to give a practical expression to their gratitude for this miraculous
preservation of the whole of the men, by presenting a sacrificial gift
to Jehovah; they therefore brought all the golden articles that they had
received as booty, and offered them to the Lord "for the expiation of
their souls" (see at [Lev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004).md),
namely, with the feeling that they were not worthy of any such grace,
and not "because they had done wrong in failing to destroy all the
enemies of Jehovah" (Knobel). This gift, which was offered as a
heave-offering for Jehovah, consisted of the following articles of gold:
אצעדה, "arm-rings," according to [Sa2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#010.md) (lxx χελιδῶνα; Suidas: χελιδόναι
κοσμοὶ περὶ τοὺς βραχιόνας, καλοῦνται δὲ βραχιάλια); צמיד, bands,
generally armlets ([Gen 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022), etc..md);
טבּעת, signet-rings; עגיל, hoops, - according to [Eze
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#012.md), ear-rings; and כּוּמז, gold
balls ([Exo 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022).md). They amounted in
all to 16,750 shekels; and the men of war had received their own booty
in addition to this. This gift, presented on the part of the officers,
was brought into the tabernacle "as a memorial of the children of Israel
before Jehovah" (cf. [Exo 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#016).md); that
is to say, it was placed in the treasury of the sanctuary.

The fact that the Israelites did not lose a single man in the battle, is
certainly a striking proof of the protection of God; but it is not so
marvellous as to furnish any good ground for calling in question the
correctness of the narrative.

(Note: Rosenmller has cited an example from Tacitus (Ann. xiii. 39), of
the Romans having slaughtered all the foe without losing a single man on
the capture of a Parthian castle; and another from Strabo (xvi. 1128),
of a battle in which 1000 Arabs were slain, and only 2 Romans. And
Hvernick mentions a similar account from the life of Saladin in his
Introduction (i. 2, p. 452).)

The Midianites were a nomad tribe, who lived by rearing flocks and
herds, and therefore were not a warlike people. Moreover, they were
probably attacked quite unawares, and being unprepared, were completely
routed and cut down without quarter. The quantity of booty brought home
is also not so great as to appear incredible. Judging from the 32,000
females who had never lain with a man, the tribes governed by the five
kings may have numbered about 130,000 or 150,000, and therefore not have
contained much more than 35,000 fighting men, who might easily have been
surprised by 12,000 brave warriors, and entirely destroyed. And again,
there is nothing in the statement that 675,000 sheep and goats, 72,000
oxen, and 61,000 asses were taken as booty from these tribes, to
astonish any one who has formed correct notions of the wealth of nomad
tribes in flocks and herds. The only thing that could appear surprising
is, that there are no camels mentioned.

But it is questionable, in the first place, whether the Midianites were
in the habit of rearing camels; and, in the second place, if they did
possess them, it is still questionable whether the Israelitish army took
them away, and did not rather put to death all that they found, as being
of no value to the Israelites in their existing circumstances. Lastly,
the quantity of jewellery seized as booty is quite in harmony with the
well-known love of nomads, and even of barbarous tribes, for ornaments
of this kind; and the peculiar liking of the Midianites for such things
is confirmed by the account in [Jdg
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#026.md), according to which Gideon took
as much as 1700 shekels in weight of golden rings from the Midianites
alone, beside ornaments of other kinds. If we take the golden shekel at
10 thalers (30 shillings), the value of the ornaments taken by the
officers under Moses would be about 167,500 thalers (L.25,125). It is
quite possible that the kings and other chiefs, together with their
wives, may have possessed as much as this.
