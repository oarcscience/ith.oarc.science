### [Isaiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 39:1</span></span>

From this point onwards the text of the book of Kings ([Kg2
20:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md), cf., [Ch2
32:24-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024).md) runs parallel to the text
before us. Babylonian ambassadors have an interview with the
convalescent king of Judah. "At that time Merodach Bal'adan (K. Berodach
Bal'adan), son of Bal'adan king of Babel, sent writings and a present to
Hizkiyahu, and heard (K. for he had heard) that he (K. Hizkiyahu) had
been sick, and was restored again." The two texts here share the
original text between them. Instead of the unnatural ויּשׁמע (which
would link the cause on to the effect, as in [Sa2
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#005).md), we should read שׁמע כּי,
whereas ויּחזק in our text appears to be the genuine word out of which
חזקיהו in the other text has sprung, although it is not indispensable,
as חלה has a pluperfect sense. In a similar manner the name of the king
of Babylon is given here correctly as מראדך (Nissel, מרדך without א, as
in [Jer 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002).md), whilst the book of
Kings has בּראד (according to the Masora with א), probably occasioned by
the other name Bal'ădân, which begins with Beth. It cannot be maintained
that the words ben Bal'ădân are a mistake; at the same time, Bal'ădân
(Jos. Baladas) evidently cannot be a name by itself if Merō'dakh
Bal'ădân signifies "Merodach (the Babylonian Bel or Jupiter)

(Note: Rawlinson, Monarchies, i. 169.)

filium dedit."

(Note: Oppert, Expdition, ii. 355.)

In the Canon Ptol. Mardokempados is preceded by a Jugaeus; and the
inscriptions, according to G. Rawlinson, Mon. ii. 395, indicate
Merodach-Baladan as the "son of Yakin." They relate that the latter
acknowledged Tiglath-pileser as his feudal lord; that, after reigning
twelve years as a vassal, he rose in rebellion against Sargon in league
with the Susanians and the Aramaean tribes above Babylonia, and lost
everything except his life; that he afterwards rebelled against
Sennacherib in conjunction with a Chaldean prince named Susub, just
after Sennacherib had returned from his first

(Note: The inscription is mention two campaigns.)

Judaean campaign to Nineveh; and that having been utterly defeated, he
took refuge in an island of the Persian Gulf. He does not make his
appearance any more; but Susub escaped from his place of concealment,
and being supported by the Susanians and certain Aramaean tribes, fought
a long and bloody battle with Sennacherib on the Lower Tigris. this
battle he lost, and Nebo-som-iskun, a son of Merodach Baladan, fell into
the hands of the conqueror. In the midst of these details, as given by
the inscriptions, the statement of the Can. Ptol. may still be
maintained, according to which the twelve years of Mardokempados (a
contraction, as Ewald supposes, of Mardokempalados) commence with the
year 721. From this point onwards the biblical and extra-biblical
accounts dovetail together; whereas in Polyhistor (Eus. chron. arm.) the
following Babylonian rulers are mentioned: "a brother of Sennacherib,
Acises, who reigned hardly a month; Merodach Baladan, six months; Elibus
into the third year; Asordan, Sennacherib's son, who was made king after
the defeat of Elibus." Now, as the Can. Ptolem. also gives a Belibos
with a three years' reign, the identity of Mardokempados and Marodach
Baladan is indisputable. The Can. Ptol. seems only to take into account
his legitimate reign as a vassal, and Polyhistor (from Berosus) only his
last act of rebellion. At the same time, this is very far from removing
all the difficulties that lie in the way of a reconciliation, more
especially the chronological difficulties. Rawlinson, who places the
commencement of the (second) Judaean campaign in the year 698, and
therefore transfers it to the end of the twenty-ninth year of Hezekiah's
reign instead of the middle, sets himself in opposition not only to [Isa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001.md), but also to [Isa
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005.md) and [Kg2
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#002.md). According to the biblical
accounts, as compared with the Can. Ptol., the embassy must have been
sent by Merodach Baladan during the period of his reign as vassal, which
commenced in the year 721. Apparently it had only the harmless object of
congratulating the king upon his recovery (and also, according to [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md), of making some inquiry, in the
interests of Chaldean astrology, into the mōphēth connected with the
sun-dial); but it certainly had also the secret political object of
making common cause with Hezekiah to throw off the Assyrian yoke. All
that can be maintained with certainty beside this is, that the embassy
cannot have been sent before the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign;
for as he reigned twenty-nine years, his illness must have occurred,
according to [Isa 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005.md), in the
fourteenth year itself, i.e., the seventh year of Mardokempados. Such
questions as whether the embassy came before or after the Assyrian
catastrophe, which was till in the future at the time referred to in
[Isa 38:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#004.md), or whether it came before
or after the payment of the compensation money to Sennacherib ([Kg2
18:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014).md), are open to dispute. In all
probability it took place immediately before the Assyrian campaign,

(Note: A reviewer in the Theol. L. Bl. 1857, p. 12, inquires: "How could
the prophet have known that all that Hezekiah showed to the Babylonian
ambassador would one day be brought to Babylon, when in a very short
time these treasures would all have been given by Hezekiah to the king
of Assyria?" Answer: The prophecy is so expressed in [Isa
39:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006.md), that this intervening
occurrence does not prejudice its truth at all.)

as Hezekiah was still able to show off the abundance of his riches to
the Babylonian ambassadors.

[Isaiah 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 39:2</span></span>

"And Hezekiah rejoiced (K. heard, which is quite inappropriate)
concerning them, and showed them (K. all) his storehouse: the silver,
and the gold, and the spices, and the fine oil (hasshâmen,K. shemen),
and all his arsenal, and all that was in his treasures: there was
nothing that Hezekiah had not shown them, in his house or in all his
kingdom." Although there were spices kept in נכת בּית, נכת is not
equivalent to נכאת (from נכא, to break to pieces, to pulverize), which
is applied to gum-dragon and other drugs, but is the niphal נכת from
כּוּת (piel, Arab. kayyata, to cram full, related to כּוּס (כּיס), נכס
(נכס), and possibly also to כּתם, katama (Hitzig, Knobel, Frst), and
consequently it does not mean "the house of his spices," as Aquila,
Symmachus, and the Vulgate render it, but his "treasure-house or
storehouse" (Targ., Syr., Saad.). It differs, however, from bēth kēilim,
the wood house of Lebanon ([Isa 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008).md).
He was able to show them all that was worth seeing "in his whole
kingdom," inasmuch as it was all concentrated in Jerusalem, the capital.

[Isaiah 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 39:3</span></span>

The consequences of this coqueting with the children of the stranger,
and this vain display, are pointed out in [Isa
39:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003.md) : "Then came Isaiah the prophet
to king Hizkiyahu, and said to him, What have these men said, and whence
come they to thee? Hizkiyahu said, They came to me from a far country
(K. omits to me), out of Babel. He said further, What have they seen in
thy house? Hizkiyahu said, All that is in my house have they seen: there
was nothing in my treasures that I had not shown them. Then Isaiah said
to Hizkiyahu, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts (K. omits tsebhâ'ōth);
Behold, days come, that all that is in thy house, and all that thy
fathers have laid up unto this day, will be carried away to Babel (בּבל,
K. בּבלה): nothing will be left behind, saith Jehovah. And of thy
children that proceed from thee, whom thou shalt beget, will they take
(K. chethib, 'will he take'); and they will be courtiers in the palace
of the king of Babel. Then said Hizkiyahu to Isaiah, Good is the word of
Jehovah which thou hast spoken. And he said further, Yea (כּי, K. אם
הלוא), there shall be peace and stedfastness in my days." Hezekiah's two
candid answers in vv. 3 and 4 are an involuntary condemnation of his own
conduct, which was sinful in two respects. This self-satisfied display
of worthless earthly possessions would bring its own punishment in their
loss; and this obsequious suing for admiration and favour on the part of
strangers, would be followed by plundering and enslaving on the part of
those very same strangers whose envy he had excited. The prophet here
foretells the Babylonian captivity; but, in accordance with the occasion
here given, not as the destiny of the whole nation, but as that of the
house of David. Even political sharp-sightedness might have foreseen,
that some such disastrous consequences would follow Hezekiah's imprudent
course; but this absolute certainty, that Babylon, which was then
struggling hard for independence, would really be the heiress to the
Assyrian government of the world, and that it was not from Assyria,
which was actually threatening Judah with destruction for its rebellion,
but from Babylon, that this destruction would really come, was
impossible without the spirit of prophecy. We may infer from [Isa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md) (cf., [Isa
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#019.md), and for the fulfilment, [Dan
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#003).md) that Hezekiah had no son as yet,
at least none with a claim to the throne; and this is confirmed by [Kg2
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001.md). So far as the concluding words
are concerned, we should quite misunderstand them, if we saw nothing in
them but common egotism. כּי (for) is explanatory here, and therefore
confirmatory. אם הלוא, however, does not mean "yea, if only," as Ewald
supposes (324, b), but is also explanatory, though in an interrogative
form, "Is it not good (i.e., still gracious and kind), if," etc.? He
submits with humility to the word of Jehovah, in penitential
acknowledgement of his vain, shortsighted, untheocratic conduct, and
feels that he is mercifully spared by God, inasmuch as the divine
blessings of peace and stability (אמת a self-attesting state of things,
without any of those changes which disappoint our confident
expectations) would continue. "Although he desired the prosperity of
future ages, it would not have been right for him to think it nothing
that God had given him a token of His clemency, by delaying His
judgment" (Calvin).

Over the kingdom of Judah there was now hanging the very same fate of
captivity and exile, which had put an end to the kingdom of Israel eight
years before. When the author of the book of Kings prefaces the four
accounts of Isaiah in [Kg2 18:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md),
with the recapitulation in [Kg2
18:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009.md) (cf., [Isa
17:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#005).md), his evident meaning is, that
the end of the kingdom of Israel, and the beginning of the end of the
kingdom of Judah, had their meeting-point in Hezekiah's time. As Israel
fell under the power of the Assyrian empire, which foundered upon Judah,
though only through a miraculous manifestation of the grace of God (see
[Hos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007).md); so did Judah fall a victim
to the Babylonian empire. The four accounts are so arranged, that the
first two, together with the epilogue in [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md)., which contains the account of
the fulfilment, bring the Assyrian period of judgment to a close; and
the last two, with the eventful sketch in [Isa
39:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006.md), open the way for the great
bulk of the prophecies which now follow in chapters 40-66, relating to
the Babylonian period of judgment. This Janus-headed arrangement of the
contents of chapters 36-39 is a proof that this historical section
formed an original part of the "vision of Isaiah." At any rate, it leads
to the conclusion that, whoever arranged the four accounts in their
present order, had chapters 40-66 before him at the time. We believe,
however, that we may, or rather, considering the prophetico-historical
style of chapters 36-39, that we must, draw the still further
conclusion, that Isaiah himself, when he revised the collection of his
prophecies at the end of Hezekiah's reign, or possibly not till the
beginning of Manasseh's, bridged over the division between the two
halves of the collection by the historical trilogy in the seventh book.
