Taking Heart in God, the All-Recompensing One

The same longing after Zion meets us sounding forth from this as from
the preceding Psalm. To remain his whole life long in the vicinity of
the house of God, is here his only prayer; and that, rescued from his
enemies, he shall there offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, is his
confident expectation. The היכל of God, the King, is at present only a
אהל which, however, on account of Him who sits enthroned therein, may
just as much be called היכל as the היכל which Ezekiel beheld in
remembrance of the Mosaic tabernacle, אהל, [Eze
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001). Cut off from the sanctuary, the
poet is himself threatened on all sides by the dangers of war; but he is
just as courageous in God as in [Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007), where the battle is already going
on: "I do not fear the myriads of people, who are encamped against me."
The situation, therefore, resembles that of David during the time of
Absolom. But this holds good only of the first half, [Psa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001). In the second half, [Psa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010) is not in favour of its being
composed by David. In fact the two halves are very unlike one another.
They form a hysteron-proteron, inasmuch as the fides triumphans of the
first part changes into fides supplex in the second, and with the
beginning of the δέησις in [Psa 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007),
the style becomes heavy and awkward, the strophic arrangement obscure,
and even the boundaries of the lines of the verses uncertain; so that
one is tempted to regard [Psa 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007) as
the appendage of another writer. The compiler, however, must have had
the Psalm before him exactly as we now have it; for the grounds for his
placing it to follow [Psa 26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001) are
to be found in both portions, cf. [Psa
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007) with [Psa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#011); [Psa
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011) with [Psa
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#012).

[Psalms 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 27:1</span></span>

In this first strophe is expressed the bold confidence of faith. It is a
hexastich in the caesural schema. Let darkness break in upon him, the
darkness of night, of trouble, and of spiritual conflict, yet Jahve is
his Light, and if he is in Him, he is in the light and there shines upon
him a sun, that sets not and knows no eclipse. This sublime, infinitely
profound name for God, אורי, is found only in this passage; and there is
only one other expression that can be compared with it. viz., בּא אורך
in [Isa 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001); cf. φῶς ἐλήλυθα, [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046). ישׁעי does not stand beside
אורי as an unfigurative, side by side with a figurative expression; for
the statement that God is light, is not a metaphor. David calls Him his
"salvation" in regard to everything that oppresses him, and the
"stronghold (מעוז from עזז, with an unchangeable ) of his life" in
regard to everything that exposes him to peril. In Jahve he conquers far
and wide; in Him his life is hidden as it were behind a fortress built
upon a rock ([Psa 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003)). When to the
wicked who come upon him in a hostile way (קרב על differing from קרב
אל), he attributes the intention of devouring his flesh, they are
conceived of as wild beasts. To eat up any one's flesh signifies, even
in [Job 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#022), the same as to pursue
any one by evil speaking (in Aramaic by slander, back-biting) to his
destruction. In בּקרב (the Shebג of the only faintly closed syllable is
raised to a Chateph, as in ולשׁכני, [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012), לשׁאול, and the like. The לי of
איבי לּי may, as also in [Psa 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002)
(cf. [Psa 144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002)), be regarded as
giving intensity to the notion of special, personal enmity; but a mere
repetition of the subject (the enemy) without the repetition of their
hostile purpose would be tame in the parallel member of the verse: לי is
a variation of the preceding עלי, as in [Lam
3:60](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#060). In the apodosis המּה כּשׁלוּ
ונפלוּ, the overthrow of the enemy is regarded beforehand as an
accomplished fact. The holy boldness and imperturbable repose are
expressed in [Psa 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003) in the very
rhythm. The thesis or downward movement in [Psa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003) is spondaic: he does not allow
himself to be disturbed; the thesis in [Psa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003) is iambic: he can be bold. The
rendering of Hitzig (as of Rashi): "in this do I trust, viz., that Jahve
is my light, etc.," is erroneous. Such might be the interpretation, if
בזאת אני בוטח closed [Psa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002); but it
cannot refer back over [Psa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002) to
[Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001); and why should the poet
have expressed himself thus materially, instead of saying ביהוה? The
fact of the case is this, בוטח signifies even by itself "of good
courage," e.g., [Pro 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015); and בזאת
"in spite of this" (Coccejus: hoc non obstante), [Lev
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#027), cf. [Psa
78:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#032), begins the apodosis, at the
head of which we expect to find an adversative conjunction.

[Psalms 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 27:4</span></span>

There is only one thing, that he desires, although he also has besides
full satisfaction in Jahve in the midst of strangers and in trouble. The
future is used side by side with the perfect in [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004), in order to express an ardent
longing which extends out of the past into the future, and therefore
runs through his whole life. The one thing sought is unfolded in שׁבתּי
וגו. A life-long dwelling in the house of Jahve, that is to say intimate
spiritual intercourse with the God, who has His dwelling (בית), His
palace (היכל) in the holy tent, is the one desire of David's heart, in
order that he may behold and feast upon (חזה בּ of a clinging,
lingering, chained gaze, and consequently a more significant form of
expression than חזה with an accusative, [Psa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#003)) נעם ה ([Psa
90:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#017)), the pleasantness (or
gracefulness) of Jahve, i.e., His revelation, full of grace, which is
there visible to the eye of the spirit. The interpretation which regards
amaenitas as being equivalent to amaenus cultus takes hold of the idea
from the wrong side. The assertion that בּקּר בּ is intended as a
synonym of חזה בּ, of a pleased and lingering contemplation (Hupf.,
Hitz.), is contrary to the meaning of the verb, which signifies "to
examine (with ל to seek or spie about after anything, [Lev
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#036)), to reflect on, or consider;"
even the post-biblical signification to visit, more especially the sick
(whence בּקּוּר הלים), comes from the primary meaning investigare. An
appropriate sense may be obtained in the present instance by regarding
it as a denominative from בּקשׁ and rendering it as Dunash and Rashi
have done, "and to appear early in His temple;" but it is unnecessary to
depart from the general usage of the language. Hengstenberg rightly
retains the signification "to meditate on." בּהיכלו is a designation of
the place consecrated to devotion, and לבקּר is meant to refer to
contemplative meditation that loses itself in God who is there manifest.
In [Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005) David bases the
justification of his desire upon that which the sanctuary of God is to
him; the futures affirm what Jahve will provide for him in His
sanctuary. It is a refuge in which he may hide himself, where Jahve
takes good care of him who takes refuge therein from the storms of
trouble that rage outside: there he is far removed from all dangers, he
is lifted high above them and his feet are upon rocky ground. The Chethb
may be read בּסכּה, as in [Psa 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021)
and with Ewald 257, d; but, in this passage, with אהל alternates סך,
which takes the place of סכּה in the poetic style ([Psa
76:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#003); [Lam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006)), though it does not do so by
itself, but always with a suffix.

(Note: Just in like manner they say in poetic style צידהּ, [Psa
132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015); פּנּהּ, [Pro
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#008); מדּה, [Job
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#009); גּלּהּ, [Zac
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002); and perhaps even נצּהּ, [Gen
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#010); for צידתהּ, פּנּתהּ, מדּתהּ,
גּלּתהּ, and נצּתהּ; as, in general, shorter forms are sometimes found
in the inflexion, which do not occur in the corresponding principal
form, e.g., צוּרם, [Psa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015), for
צוּרתם; מגוּרם, [Psa 55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016), for
מגוּרתם; בּערמם, [Job 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013), for
בּערמתם; בּתבוּנם, [Hos 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002), for
בּתבוּנתם; פּחם; [Neh 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014), for פּחתם;
cf. Hitzig on [Hos 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002), and Bttcher's
Neue Aehrenlese, No. 693.)

[Psalms 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 27:6</span></span>

With ועתּה the poet predicts inferentially (cf. [Psa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010)) the fulfilment of what he
fervently desires, the guarantee of which lies in his very longing
itself. זבחי תּרוּעה do not mean sacrifices in connection with which the
trumpets are blown by the priests; for this was only the case in
connection with the sacrifices of the whole congregation ([Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010)), not with those of individuals.
תּרוּעה is a synonym of תּודה, [Psa
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#007); and זבחי תּרוּעה is a stronger
form of expression for זבחי תודה ([Psa
107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022)), i.e., (cf. זבחי צדק, [Psa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006); 51:21) sacrifices of jubilant
thanksgiving: he will offer sacrifices in which his gratitude plays a
prominent part, and will sing songs of thanksgiving, accompanied by the
playing of stringed instruments, to his Deliverer, who has again and so
gloriously verified His promises.

[Psalms 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 27:7</span></span>

Vows of thanksgiving on the assumption of the answering of the prayer
and the fulfilment of the thing supplicated, are very common at the
close of Psalms. But in this Psalm the prayer is only just beginning at
this stage. The transition is brought about by the preceding conception
of the danger that threatens him from the side of his foes who are round
about him. The reality, which, in the first part, is overcome and
surmounted by his faith, makes itself consciously felt here. It is not
to be rendered, as has been done by the Vulgate, Exaudi Domine vocem qua
clamavi (rather, clamo) ad te (the introit of the Dominica
exspectationis in the interval of preparation between Ascension and
Pentecost). שׁמע has Dechמ, and accordingly קולי אקרא, voce mea (as in
[Psa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005)) clamo, is an adverbial
clause equivalent to voce mea clamante me. In [Psa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008) לך cannot possibly be so rendered
that ל is treated as Lamed auctoris (Dathe, Olshausen): Thine, saith my
heart, is (the utterance:) seek ye may face. The declaration is opposed
to this sense, thus artificially put upon it. לך אמר are undoubtedly to
be construed together; and what the heart says to Jahve is not: Seek ye
my face, but by reason of this, and as its echo (Calvin: velut Deo
succinens): I will therefore seek Thy face. Just as in [Job
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003), a personal inference is drawn
from a directly quoted saying of God. In the periodic style it would be
necessary to transpose בּקּשׁוּ פּני thus: since Thou hast permitted and
exhorted us, or in accordance with Thy persuasive invitation, that we
should seek Thy face, I do seek Thy face (Hupfeld). There is no
retrospective reference to any particular passage in the Tפra, such as
[Deu 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029). The prayer is not based
upon any single passage of Scripture, but upon God's commands and
promises in general.

[Psalms 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 27:9</span></span>

The requests are now poured forth with all the greater freedom and
importunity, that God may be willing to be entreated and invoked. The
Hiph. הטּה signifies in this passage standing by itself (cf. [Job
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#004)): to push aside. The clause עזרתי
היית does not say: be Thou my help (which is impossible on syntactical
grounds), nor is it to be taken relatively: Thou who wast my help (for
which there is no ground in what precedes); but on the contrary the
praet. gives the ground of the request that follows "Thou art my help
(lit., Thou has become, or hast ever been) - cast me, then, not away,"
and it is, moreover, accented accordingly. [Psa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010), as we have already observed,
does not sound as though it came from the lips of David, of whom it is
only said during the time of his persecution by Saul, that at that time
he was obliged to part from his parents, [Sa1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003). The words certainly might be
David's, if [Psa 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010) would admit of
being taken hypothetically, as is done by Ewald, ֗362, b: should my
father and my mother forsake me, yet Jahve will etc. But the entreaty
"forsake me not" is naturally followed by the reason: for my father and
my mother have forsaken me; and just as naturally does the consolation:
but Jahve will take me up, prepare the way for the entreaties which
begin anew in [Psa 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011). Whereas, if
כי is taken hypothetically, [Psa 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011)
stands disconnectedly in the midst of the surrounding requests. On
יאספני cf. [Jos 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004).

[Psalms 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 27:11</span></span>

He is now wandering about like a hunted deer; but God is able to guide
him so that he may escape all dangers. And this is what he prays for. As
in [Psa 143:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#010), מישׁור is used in an
ethical sense; and differs in this respect from its use in [Psa
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#012). On שׁררים, see the primary
passage [Psa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009), of which this is an
echo. Wily spies dodge his every step and would gladly see what they
have invented against him and wished for him, realised. Should he enter
the way of sin leading to destruction, it would tend to the dishonour of
God, just as on the contrary it is a matter of honour with God not to
let His servant fall. Hence he prays to be led in the way of God, for a
oneness of his own will with the divine renders a man inaccessible to
evil. נפשׁ, [Psa 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012), is used, as in
[Psa 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#009), and in the similar passage,
which is genuinely Davidic, [Psa 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003),
in the signification passion or strong desire; because the soul, in its
natural state, is selfishness and inordinate desire. יפח is a collateral
form of יפיח; they are both adjectives formed from the future of the
verb פּוּח (like ירב, יריב): accustomed to breathe out (exhale), i.e.,
either to express, or to snort, breathe forth (cf. πνεῖν, or ἐμπνεῖν
φόνον and θόνοῦ, θυμον, and the like, [Act
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)). In both Hitzig sees participles
of יפח ([Jer 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031)); but [Psa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#005) and [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003) lead back to פּוּח (פּיח); and
Hupfeld rightly recognises such nouns formed from futures to be,
according to their original source, circumlocutions of the participle
after the manner of an elliptical relative clause (the ṣifat of the
Arabic syntax), and explains יפיח כּזבים, together with יפח חמס, from
the verbal construction which still continues in force.

[Psalms 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 27:13</span></span>

Self-encouragement to firmer confidence of faith. Joined to [Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012) (Aben-Ezra, Kimchi), [Psa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013) trails badly after it. We must,
with Geier, Dachselt, and others, suppose that the apodosis is wanting
to the protasis with its לוּלא pointed with three points above,

(Note: The ו has not any point above it, because it might be easily
mistaken for a Cholem, vid., Baer's Psalterium p. 130.)

and four below, according to the Masora (cf. B. Berachoth 4a), but a
word which is indispensably necessary, and is even attested by the lxx
(ἑαυτῇ) and the Targum (although not by any other of the ancient
versions); cf. the protasis with לוּ, which has no apodosis, in [Gen
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#015), and the apodoses with כּי after
לוּלי in [Gen 31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042); [Gen
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#010); 1 Sam. 35:34; [Sa2
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#027) (also [Num
22:33](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#033), where אוּלי = אם לא = לוּלי),
which are likewise to be explained per aposiopesin. The perfect after
לוּלא (לוּלי) has sometimes the sense of a plusquamperfectum (as in [Gen
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#010), nisi cunctati essemus), and
sometimes the sense of an imperfect, as in the present passage (cf. [Deu
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029), si saperent). The poet does not
speak of a faith that he once had, a past faith, but, in regard to the
danger that is even now abiding and present, of the faith he now has, a
present faith. The apodosis ought to run something like this ([Psa
119:92](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#092); [Psa
94:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017)): did I not believe, were not
confidence preserved to me...then (אז( ne or כּי אז) I should perish;
or: then I had suddenly perished. But he has such faith, and he
accordingly in [Psa 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014) encourages
himself to go on cheerfully waiting and hoping; he speaks to himself, it
is, as it were, the believing half of his soul addressing the despondent
and weaker half. Instead of ואמץ ([Deu
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#007)) the expression is, as in Ps
31:25, ויאמץ לבּך, let thy heart be strong, let it give proof of
strength. The rendering "May He (Jahve) strengthen thy heart" would
require יאמּץ; but האמיץ, as e.g., הרחיב [Psa
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017), belongs to the transitive
denominatives applying to the mind or spirit, in which the Hebrew is by
no means poor, and in which the Arabic is especially rich.
