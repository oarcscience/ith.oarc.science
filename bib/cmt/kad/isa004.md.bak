### [Isaiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 4:1</span></span>

When war shall thus unsparingly have swept away the men of Zion, a most
unnatural effect will ensue, namely, that women will go in search of
husbands, and not men in search of wives. "And seven women lay hold of
one man in that day, saying, We will eat our won bread, and wear our own
clothes; only let thy name be named upon us, take away our reproach."
The division of the chapters is a wrong one here, as this v. is the
closing v. of the prophecy against the women, and the closing portion of
the whole address does not begin till [Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md). The present pride of the
daughters of Zion, every one of whom now thought herself the greatest as
the wife of such and such a man, and for whom many men were now the
suitors, would end in this unnatural self-humiliation, that seven of
them would offer themselves to the same man, the first man who presented
himself, and even renounce the ordinary legal claim upon their husband
for clothing and food ([Exo 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#010).md). It
would be quite sufficient for them to be allowed to bear his name ("let
thy name be named upon us:" the name is put upon the thing named, as
giving it its distinctness and character), if he would only take away
their reproach (namely, the reproach of being unmarried, [Isa
54:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004.md), as in [Gen
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#023), of being childless.md) by letting
them be called his wives. The number seven (seven women to one man) may
be explained on the ground that there is a bad seven as well as a holy
one (e.g., [Mat 12:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045).md).

In [Isa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md) the threat denounced
against the women of Jerusalem is brought to a close. It is the
side-piece to the threat denounced against the national rulers. And
these two scenes of judgment were only parts of the general judgment
about to fall upon Jerusalem and Judah, as a state or national
community. And this again was merely a portion, viz., the central group
of the picture of a far more comprehensive judgment, which was about to
fall upon everything lofty and exalted on the earth. Jerusalem,
therefore, stands here as the centre and focus of the great
judgment-day. It was in Jerusalem that the ungodly glory which was ripe
for judgment was concentrated; and it was in Jerusalem also that the
light of the true and final glory would concentrate itself. To this
promise, with which the address returns to its starting-point, the
prophet now passes on without any further introduction. In fact it
needed no introduction, for the judgment in itself was the medium of
salvation. When Jerusalem was judged, it would be sifted; and by being
sifted, it would be rescued, pardoned, glorified. The prophet proceeds
in this sense to speak of what would happen in that day, and describes
the one great day of God at the end of time (not a day of
four-and-twenty hours any more than the seven days of creation were),
according to its general character, as opening with judgment, but
issuing in salvation.

[Isaiah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 4:2</span></span>

"In that day will the sprout of Jehovah become an ornament and glory,
and the fruit of the land pride and splendour for the redeemed of
Israel." The four epithets of glory, which are here grouped in pairs,
strengthen our expectation, that now that the mass of Israel has been
swept away, together with the objects of its worthless pride, we shall
find a description of what will become an object of well-grounded pride
to the "escaped of Israel," i.e., to the remnant that has survived the
judgment, and been saved from destruction. But with this interpretation
of the promise it is impossible that it can be the church of the future
itself, which is here called the "sprout of Jehovah" and "fruit of the
land," as Luzzatto and Malbim suppose; and equally impossible, with such
an antithesis between what is promised and what is abolished, that the
"sprout of Jehovah" and "fruit of the earth" should signify the harvest
blessings bestowed by Jehovah, or the rich produce of the land. For
although the expression zemach Jehovah (sprout of Jehovah) may
unquestionably be used to signify this, as in [Gen
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009.md) and [Psa
104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md) (cf., [Isa
61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011).md), and fruitfulness of the land
is a standing accompaniment of the eschatological promises (e.g., [Isa
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#023.md)., compare the conclusion of Joel
and Amos), and it was also foretold that the fruitful fields of Israel
would become a glory in the sight of the nations ([Eze
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#029.md); [Mal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#012.md); cf., [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017).md); yet this earthly material good,
of which, moreover, there was no lack in the time of Uzziah and Jotham,
was altogether unsuitable to set forth such a contrast as would surpass
and outshine the worldly glory existing before. But even granting what
Hofmann adduces in support of this view - namely, that the natural
God-given blessings of the field do form a fitting antithesis to the
studied works of art of which men had hitherto been proud - there is
still truth in the remark of Rosenmller, that "the magnificence of the
whole passage is at variance with such an interpretation." Only compare
[Isa 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005.md), where Jehovah Himself is
described in the same manner, as the glory and ornament of the remnant
of Israel. But if the "sprout of Jehovah" is neither the redeemed
remnant itself, nor the fruit of the field, it must be the name of the
Messiah. And it is in this sense that it has been understood by the
Targum, and by such modern commentators as Rosenmller, Hengstenberg,
Steudel, Umbreit, Caspari, Drechsler, and others. The great King of the
future is called zemach, ἀνατολή in the sense of [Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014.md), viz., as a shoot springing out
of the human, Davidic, earthly soil - a shoot which Jehovah had planted
in the earth, and would cause to break through and spring forth as the
pride of His congregation, which was waiting for this heavenly child. It
is He again who is designated in the parallel clause as the "fruit of
the land" (or lit., fruit of the earth), as being the fruit which the
land of Israel, and consequently the earth itself, would produce, just
as in [Eze 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005.md) Zedekiah is called a
"seed of the earth." The reasons already adduced to show that "the
sprout of Jehovah" cannot refer to the blessings of the field, apply
with equal force to "the fruit of the earth." This also relates to the
Messiah Himself, regarded as the fruit in which all the growth and bloom
of this earthly history would eventually reach its promised and divinely
appointed conclusion. The use of this double epithet to denote "the
coming One" can only be accounted for, without anticipating the New
Testament standpoint,

(Note: From a New Testament point of view we might say that the "sprout
of Jehovah" or "fruit of the earth" was the grain of wheat which
redeeming love sowed in the earth on Good Friday; the grain of wheat
which began to break through the ground and grow towards heaven on
Easter Sunday; the grain of wheat whose golden blade ascended
heavenwards on Ascension Day; the grain of wheat whose myriad-fold ear
bent down to the earth on the day of Pentecost, and poured out the
grains, from which the holy church not only was born, but still
continues to be born. But such thoughts as these lie outside the
historico-grammatical meaning.)

from the desire to depict His double-sided origin. He would come, on the
one hand, from Jehovah; but, on the other hand, from the earth, inasmuch
as He would spring from Israel. We have here the passage, on the basis
of which zemach (the sprout of "Branch") was adopted by Jeremiah ([Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md) and [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015).md) and Zechariah ([Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md); [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012).md) as a proper name for the
Messiah, and upon which Matthew, by combining this proper name zemach
(sprout) with nezer ([Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), cf.,
[Isa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002).md), rests his affirmation,
that according to the Old Testament prophecies the future Messiah was to
be called a Nazarene. It is undoubtedly strange that this epithet should
be introduced so entirely without preparation even by Isaiah, who coined
it first. In fact, the whole passage relating to the Messiah stands
quite alone in this cycle of prophecies in chapters 1-6. But the book of
Isaiah is a complete and connected work. What the prophet indicates
merely in outline here, he carries out more fully in the cycle of
prophecies which follows in chapters 7-12; and there the enigma, which
he leaves as an enigma in the passage before us, receives the fullest
solution. Without dwelling any further upon the man of the future,
described in this enigmatically symbolical way, the prophet hurries on
to a more precise description of the church of the future.

[Isaiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 4:3</span></span>

"And it will come to pass, whoever is left in Zion and remains in
Jerusalem, holy will he be called, all who are written down for life in
Jerusalem." The leading emphasis of the whole v. rests upon kadosh
(holy). Whereas formerly in Jerusalem persons had been distinguished
according to their rank and condition, without any regard to their moral
worth ([Isa 3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md), [Isa
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md); cf., [Isa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005)); so the name kadosh (holy.md) would
now be the one chief name of honour, and would be given to every
individual, inasmuch as the national calling of Israel would now be
realized in the persons of all ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006), etc..md). Consequently the
expression "he shall be called" is not exactly equivalent to "he shall
be," but rather presupposes the latter, as in [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md); [Isa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006.md); [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md). The term kadosh denotes that
which is withdrawn from the world, or separated from it. The church of
the saints or holy ones, which now inhabits Jerusalem, is what has been
left from the smelting; and their holiness is the result of washing.
הנוּתר is interchanged with נהנּשׁאר. The latter, as Papenheim has shown
in his Hebrew synonyms, involves the idea of intention, viz., "that
which has been left behind;" the former merely expresses the fact, viz.,
that which remains. The character of this "remnant of grace," and the
number of members of which it would consist, are shown in the apposition
contained in [Isa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md). This apposition
means something more than those who are entered as living in Jerusalem,
i.e., the population of Jerusalem as entered in the city register
(Hofmann); for the verb with Lamed does not mean merely to enter as a
certain thing, but (like the same verb with the accusative in [Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030).md) to enter as intended for a
certain purpose. The expression להיּים may either be taken as a noun,
viz., "to life" ([Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002).md), or as an
adjective, "to the living" (a meaning which is quite as tenable; cf.,
[Psa 69:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#029.md); [Sa1
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#029).md). In either case the notion of
predestination is implied, and the assumption of the existence of a
divine "book of life" ([Exo 32:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md);
[Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); cf., [Psa
139:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#016).md); so that the idea is the same
as that of [Act 13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048.md) : "As many as
were ordained to eternal life." The reference here is to persons who
were entered in the book of God, on account of the good kernel of faith
within them, as those who should become partakers of the life in the new
Jerusalem, and should therefore be spared in the midst of the judgment
of sifting in accordance with this divine purpose of grace. For it was
only through the judgment setting this kernel of faith at liberty, that
such a holy community as is described in the protasis which comes
afterwards, as in [Psa 63:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#006.md), could
possibly arise.

[Isaiah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 4:4</span></span>

"When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of
Zion, and shall have purged away the bloodguiltinesses of Jerusalem from
the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of
sifting." "When," followed by a preterite (equivalent to a fut. exact.
as in [Isa 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013); Ges. 126, 5.md),
introduces the circumstance, whose previous occurrence would be the
condition of all the rest. The force of the future yâdiach ("shall have
purged") is regulated by that of the preterite râchatz, as in [Isa
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#011.md); for although, when regarded
simply by itself, as in [Isa 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md),
the future tense may suggest the idea of a future prefect, it cannot
have the force of such a future. The double purification answers to the
two scenes of judgment described in chapter 3. The filth of the
daughters of Zion is the moral pollution hidden under their vain and
coquettish finery; and the murderous deeds of Jerusalem are the acts of
judicial murder committed by its rulers upon the poor and innocent. This
filth and these spots of blood the Sovereign Ruler washes and purges
away (see [Ch2 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006).md), by causing His
spirit or His breath to burst in upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
both male and female. This breath is called "the spirit of judgment,"
because it punishes evil; and "the spirit of sifting," inasmuch as it
sweeps or cleans it away. בּער is to be explained, as in [Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md), in accordance with [Deu
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md) (5, Eng. Ver.; "put the evil
away") and other passages, such especially as [Isa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md); [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md). The rendering given in the
Septuagint and Vulgate, viz., "in the spirit of burning," is founded
upon the radical meaning of the verb, which signifies literally to burn
up, and hence to clear away or destroy (see Comm. on Job, at [Job
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#012), Eng. Tr..md). Nevertheless,
"burning" in connection with judgment is not definite enough, since
every manifestation of divine judgment is a manifestation of fire; but
it is not every judgment that has connected with it what is here implied
- namely, the salutary object of burning away or, in other words, of
winnowing. The "spirit" is in both instances the Spirit of God which
pervades the world, not only generating and sustaining life, but also at
times destroying and sifting ([Isa
30:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027).md), as it does in the case
before us, in which the imperishable glory described in [Isa
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005.md) is so prepared.

[Isaiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 4:5</span></span>

"And Jehovah creates over every spot of Mount Zion, and over its festal
assemblies, a cloud by day, and smoke, and the shining of flaming fire
by night: for over all the glory comes a canopy." Just as Jehovah guided
and shielded Israel in the days of the redemption from Egypt in a
smoke-cloud by day and a fire-cloud by night, which either moved in
front like a pillar, or floated above them as a roof ([Num
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014), etc..md), the perpetuation of His
presence at Sinai ([Exo 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009.md), [Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016)..md); so would Jehovah in like
manner shield the Israel of the final redemption, which would no longer
need the pillar of cloud since its wanderings would be over, but only
the cloudy covering; and such a covering Jehovah would create, as the
praet. consec. וּברא) ("and He creates") distinctly affirms. The verb
bârâh always denotes a divine and miraculous production, having its
commencement in time; for even the natural is also supernatural in its
first institution by God. In the case before us, however, the reference
is to a fresh manifestation of His gracious presence, exalted above the
present course of nature. This manifestation would consist by day in "a
cloud," and as the hendiadys "cloud and smoke" (i.e., cloud in form and
smoke in substance) distinctly affirms, a smoke-cloud, not a watery
cloud, like those which ordinarily cover the sky; and by night in a
fiery splendour, not merely a lingering fiery splendour like that of the
evening sky, but, as the words clearly indicate, a flaming brightness
(lehâbâh ), and therefore real and living fire. The purpose of the cloud
would not only be to overshadow, but also to serve as a wall of defence
against opposing influences;

(Note: The cloud derived its name, ‛ânân, not from the idea of covering,
but from that of coming to meet one. The clouds come towards the man who
gazes at them, inserting themselves between him and the sky, and thus
forcing themselves upon his notice instead of the sky; hence the visible
outer side of the vault of heaven is also called ‛anan (plur. ‛anân),
just as the same word is used to denote the outermost portion of the
branches or foliage of a tree which is the first to strike the eye (in
contradistinction to the inner portions, which are not so easily seen,
seven if visible at all).)

and the fire would not only give light, but by flaming and flashing
would ward off hostile powers. But, above all, the cloud and fire were
intended as signs of the nearness of God, and His satisfaction. In the
most glorious times of the temple a smoke-cloud of this kind filled the
Holy of holies; and there was only one occasion - namely, at the
dedication of Solomon's temple - on which it filled the whole building
([Kg1 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010).md); but now the cloud, the
smoke of which, moreover, would be turned at night into flaming fire,
would extend over every spot (mâcōn, a more poetical word for mâkōm) of
Mount Zion, and over the festal assemblies thereon. The whole mountain
would thus become a Holy of holies. It would be holy not only as being
the dwelling-place of Jehovah, but as the gathering-place of a community
of saints. "Her assemblies" (mikrâehâ) points back to Zion, and is a
plural written defectively (at least in our editions),

(Note: Such codices and ancient editions as Soncino (1488), Brescia
(1494), and many others, have the word with the yod of the plural.)

\- as, for example, in [Jer 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md).
There is no necessity to take this noun in the sense of "meeting halls"
(a meaning which it never has anywhere else), as Gesenius, Ewald,
Hitzig, and others have done, since it may also signify "the meetings,"
though not in an abstract, but in a concrete sense (ecclesiae).

(Note: It is doubtful whether the form מפעל (מפעל) is ever strictly a
nomen actionis kal (Ges. 84, 14). Its meaning seems rather to be always
concrete, even in Arabic, where menâm signifies a sleeping-place,
sleeping-time, or a dream, but never sleep, or sleeping (like inse, Heb.
shenâh, or naum, Heb. nūm).)

The explanatory clause, "for over all the glory (comes) a canopy,"
admits of several interpretations. Dr. Shegg and others take it in the
general sense: "for defence and covering are coming for all that is
glorious." Now, even if this thought were not so jejune as it is, the
word Chuppâh would not be the word used to denote covering for the sake
of protection; it signifies rather covering for the sake of beautifying
and honouring that which is covered. Chuppâh is the name still given by
the Jews to the wedding canopy, i.e., a canopy supported on four poles
and carried by four boys, under which the bride and bridegroom receive
the nuptial blessing - a meaning which is apparently more appropriate,
even in [Psa 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006.md) and [Joe
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#016.md), than the ordinary explanation
thalamus to torus. Such a canopy would float above Mount Zion in the
form of a cloud of smoke and blaze of fire. (There is no necessity to
take Chuppâh as a third pers. pual, since תּהיה, which follows
immediately afterwards in [Isa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md),
may easily be supplied in thought.) The only question is whether Col
Câbōd signifies "every kind of glory," or according to [Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md); [Psa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014.md), "pure glory" (Hofmann, Stud. u.
Krit. 1847, pp. 936-38). The thought that Jerusalem would now be "all
glory," as its inhabitants were all holiness, and therefore that this
shield would be spread out over pure glory, is one that thoroughly
commends itself. but we nevertheless prefer the former, as more in
accordance with the substantive clause. The glory which Zion would now
possess would be exposed to no further injury: Jehovah would acknowledge
it by signs of His gracious presence; for henceforth there would be
nothing glorious in Zion, over which there would not be a canopy spread
in the manner described, shading and yet enlightening, hiding,
defending, and adorning it.

[Isaiah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 4:6</span></span>

Thus would Zion be a secure retreat from all adversities and
disasters."And it will be a booth for shade by day from the heat of the
sun, and for a refuge and covert from storm and from rain." The subject
to "will be" is not the miraculous roofing; for ânân (cloud) is
masculine, and the verb feminine, and there would be no sense in saying
that a Chuppâh or canopy would be a succâh or booth. Either, therefore,
the verb contains the subject in itself, and the meaning is, "There will
be a booth" (the verb hâyâh being used in a pregnant sense, as in [Isa
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006.md); [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013).md); or else Zion ([Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005).md) is the subject. We prefer the
latter. Zion or Jerusalem would be a booth, that is to say, as the
parallel clause affirms, a place of security and concealment (mistor,
which only occurs here, is used on account of the alliteration with
machseh in the place of sether, which the prophet more usually employs,
viz., in [Isa 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017.md); [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002).md). "By day" (yōmâm, which is
construed with לצל in the construct state, cf., [Eze
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#016).md) is left intentionally without
any "by night" to answer to it in the parallel clause, because reference
is made to a place of safety and concealment for all times, whether by
day or night. Heat, storm, and rain are mentioned as examples to denote
the most manifold dangers; but it is a singular fact that rain, which is
a blessing so earnestly desired in the time of Chōreb, i.e., of drought
and burning heat, should also be included. At the present day, when rain
falls in Jerusalem, the whole city dances with delight. Nevertheless
rain, i.e., the rain which falls from the clouds, is not paradisaical;
and its effects are by no means unfrequently destructive. According to
the archives of Genesis, rain from the clouds took the place of dew for
the first time at the flood, when it fell in a continuous and
destructive form. The Jerusalem of the last time will be paradise
restored; and there men will be no longer exposed to destructive changes
of weather. In this prediction the close of the prophetic discourse is
linked on to the commencement. This mountain of Zion, roofed over with a
cloud of smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night, is no
other than the mountain of the house of Jehovah, which was to be exalted
above all the mountains, and to which the nations would make their
pilgrimage; and this Jerusalem, so holy within, and all glorious
without, is no other than the place from which the word of Jehovah was
one day to go forth into all the world. But what Jerusalem is this? Is
it the Jerusalem of the time of final glory awaiting the people of God
in this life, as described in Rev 11 (for, notwithstanding all that a
spiritualistic and rationalistic anti-chiliasm may say, the prophetic
words of both Old and New Testament warrant us in expecting such a time
of glory in this life); or is it the Jerusalem of the new heaven and new
earth described in [Rev 20:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001.md) :21?
The true answer is, "Both in one." The prophet's real intention was to
depict the holy city in its final and imperishable state after the last
judgment. But to his view, the state beyond and the closing state here
were blended together, so that the glorified Jerusalem of earth and the
glorified Jerusalem of heaven appeared as if fused into one. It was a
distinguishing characteristic of the Old Testament, to represent the
closing scene on this side the grave, and the eternal state beyond, as a
continuous line, having its commencement here. The New Testament first
drew the cross line which divides time from eternity. It is true,
indeed, as the closing chapters of the Apocalypse show, that even the
New Testament prophecies continue to some extent to depict the state
beyond in figures drawn from the present world; with this difference,
however, that when the line had once been drawn, the demand was made, of
which there was no consciousness in the Old Testament, that the figures
taken from this life should be understood as relating to the life
beyond, and that eternal realities should be separated from their
temporal forms.
