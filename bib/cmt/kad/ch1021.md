The Numbering of the People, the Pestilence, and the Determination of
the Site for the Temple - 1 Chronicles 21-22:1

The motive which influenced the king, in causing a census of the men
capable of bearing arms throughout the kingdom to be taken in the last
year of his reign, has already been discussed in the remarks on 2 Sam,
where we have also pointed out what it was which was so sinful and
displeasing to God in the undertaking. We have, too, in the same place
commented upon the various stages of its progress, taking not of the
differences which exist between the numbers given in [Sa2
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#009.md), [Sa2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#013.md), [Sa2
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#024.md), and those in our record, [Ch1
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#005.md), [Ch1
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#012.md), [Ch1
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#025.md); so that here we need only
compare the two accounts somewhat more minutely. They correspond not
merely in the main points of their narrative of the event, but in many
places make use of the same terms, which shows that they have both been
derived from the same source; but, as the same time, very considerable
divergences are found in the conception and representation of the
matter. In the very first verse, David's purpose is said in 2nd Samuel
to be the effect of the divine anger; in the Chronicle it is the result
of the influence of Satan on David. Then, in [Sa2
24:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#004.md), the numbering of the people is
narrated at length, while in the Chronicle, [Ch1
21:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#004.md), only the results are recorded,
with the remark that Joab did not complete the numbering, Levi and
Benjamin not being included, because the king's command was an
abomination to him. On the other hand, the Chronicle, in [Ch1
21:19-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#019.md), narrates the purchase of
Araunah's threshing-floor for a place of sacrifice, and gives not merely
a more circumstantial account of David's offering than we find in Samuel
([Sa2 24:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#019).md), but also states, in
conclusion (vv. 28-30), the circumstances which induced David to offer
sacrifice even afterwards, on the altar which he had built at the divine
command, on the threshing-floor bought of Araunah. The purpose which the
author of the Chronicle had in view in making this concluding remark is
manifest from [Ch1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001.md), which should
properly be connected with 1 Chron 21: "And David said, Here is the
house of Jahve God, and here the altar for the burnt-offering of
Israel." Only in this verse, as Bertheau has correctly remarked, do we
find the proper conclusion of the account of the numbering of the
people, the pestilence, and the appearance of the angel, and yet it is
omitted in the book of Samuel; "although it is manifest from the while
connection, and the way in which the history of David and Solomon is
presented in the books of Samuel and Kings, that the account is given
there also only to point out the holiness of the place where Solomon
built the temple even in the time of David, and to answer the question
why that particular place was chosen for the site of the sanctuary."
This remark is perfectly just, if it be not understood to mean that the
author of our book of Samuel has given a hint of this purpose in his
narrative; for the conclusion of [Sa2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#025.md), "And Jahve was entreated for
the land, and the plague was stayed," is irreconcilable with any such
idea. This concluding sentence, and the omission of any reference to the
temple, or to the appointment of the altar built on the threshing-floor
of Araunah to be a place of sacrifice for Israel, and of the
introductory words of the narrative, "And again the wrath of Jahve was
kindled against Israel, and moved David against them," ([Sa2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001).md), plainly show that the author of
the book of Samuel regarded, and has here narrated, the event as a
chastisement of the people of Israel for their rebellion against the
divinely chosen king, in the revolts of Absalom and Sheba (cf. the
remarks on [Sa2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001).md). The author of
the Chronicle, again, has without doubt informed us of the numbering of
the people, and the pestilence, with its results, with the design of
showing how God Himself had chosen and consecrated this spot to be the
future place of worship for Israel, by the appearance of the angel, the
command given to David through the prophet Gad to build an altar where
the angel had appeared, and to sacrifice thereon, and by the gracious
acceptance of this offering, fire having come down from heaven to devour
it. For this purpose he did not require to give any lengthened account
of the numbering of the people, since it was of importance to him only
as being the occasion of David's humiliation.

[1 Chronicles 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 21:1</span></span>

"And Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel."
The mention of Satan as the seducer of David is not to be explained
merely by the fact that the Israelites in later times traced up
everything contrary to God's will to this evil spirit, but in the
present case arises from the author's design to characterize David's
purpose from the very beginning as an ungodly thing.

[1 Chronicles 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 21:2</span></span>

The naming of the העם שׂרי along with Joab is in accordance with the
circumstances, for we learn from [Sa2
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#004.md) that Joab did not carry out the
numbering of the people alone, but was assisted by the captains of the
host. The object of אלי והביאוּ, which is not expressed, the result of
the numbering, may be supplied from the context. No objection need be
taken to the simple כּהם of [Ch1 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#003.md),
instead of the double וכהם כּהם in Samuel. The repetition of the same
word, "there are so and so many of them," is a peculiarity of the author
of the book of Samuel (cf. [Sa2 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008).md),
while the expression in the Chronicle corresponds to that in [Deu
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#011.md). With the words וגו אדני הלא,
"Are they not, my lord king, all my lord's servants," i.e., subject to
him? Joab allays the suspicion that he grudged the king the joy of
reigning over a very numerous people. In [Sa2
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#003.md) the thought takes another turn;
and the last clause, "Why should it (the thing or the numbering) become
a trespass for Israel?" is wanting. אשׁמה denotes here a trespass which
must be atoned for, not one which one commits. The meaning is therefore,
Why should Israel expiate thy sin, in seeking thy glory in the power and
greatness of thy kingdom? On the numbers, [Ch1
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#005.md), see on [Sa2
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#009.md). In commenting on [Ch1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#006.md), which is not to be found in
Samuel, Berth. defends the statement that Joab did not make any muster
of the tribes Levi and Benjamin, against the objections of de Wette and
Gramberg, as it is done in my apologet. Versuche, Sa. 349ff., by showing
that the tribe of Levi was by law (cf. [Num
1:47-54](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#047).md) exempted from the censuses of
the people taken for political purposes; and the tribe of Benjamin was
not numbered, because David, having become conscious of his sin, stopped
the numbering before it was completed (cf. also the remarks on [Sa2
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#009).md). The reason given, "for the
king's word was an abomination unto Joab," is certainly the subjective
opinion of the historian, but is shown to be well founded by the
circumstances, for Joab disapproved of the king's design from the
beginning; (cf. [Sa2 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#003.md) and [Ch1
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#003).md). - In [Ch1
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#007.md), the author of the Chronicle,
instead of ascribing the confession of sin on David's part which follows
to the purely subjective motive stated in the words, "and David's heart
smote him," i.e., his conscience ([Sa2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#010).md), has ascribed the turn matters
took to objective causes: the thing displeased God; and anticipating the
course of events, he remarks straightway, "and He (God) smote Israel."
This, however, is no reason for thinking, with Berth., that the words
have arisen out of a misinterpretation or alteration of [Sa2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#010.md); for such anticipatory remarks,
embracing the contents of the succeeding verses, not unfrequently occur
in the historical books (cf. e.g., [Kg1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#014.md); [Kg1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002).md). - In reference to [Ch1
21:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#008.md), see on [Sa2
24:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#010.md). - In [Ch1
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#012.md), נספּה has not come into the
text by mistake or by misreading נסך ([Sa2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#013).md), but is original, the author of
the Chronicle describing the two latter evils more at length than Samuel
does. The word is not a participle, but a noun formed from the
participle, with the signification "perishing" (the being snatched
away). The second parallel clause, "the sword of thine enemies to
attaining" (so that it reach thee), serves to intensify. So also in
reference to the third evil, the יהוה חרב which precedes בּארץ דּבר, and
the parallel clause added to both: "and the angel of the Lord destroying
in the whole domain of Israel."

[1 Chronicles 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 21:15</span></span>

ליר מלאך האלהים ויּשׁלח, "And God sent an angel towards Jerusalem,"
gives no suitable sense. Not because of the improbability that God sent
the angel with the commission to destroy Jerusalem, and at the same
moment gives the contrary command, "Stay now," etc. (Berth.); for the
reason of this change is given in the intermediate clause, "and at the
time of the destroying the Lord repented it," and command and
prohibition are not given "at the same moment;" but the difficulty lies
in the indefinite מלאך (without the article). For since the angel of
Jahve is mentioned in [Ch1 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#012.md) as
the bringer of the pestilence, in our verse, if it treats of the sending
of this angel to execute the judgment spoken of, המּלאך must necessarily
be used, or המּלאך את המּלא, as in [Ch1
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md); the indefinite מלאך can by no
means be used for it. In [Sa2 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md) we
read, instead of the words in question, יר המּלאך ידו ויּשׁלח, "and the
angel stretched out his hand towards Jerusalem;" and Bertheau thinks
that the reading האלהים (in the Chron.) has arisen out of that, by the
letters ידו ה being exchanged for יהוה, and אלהים being substituted for
this divine name, as is often the case in the Chronicle; while Movers,
S. 91, on the contrary, considers the reading of the Chronicle to be
original, and would read יהוה ישׁלח in Samuel. But in that way Movers
leaves the omission of the article before מלאך in the Chronicle
unexplained; and Bertheau's conjecture is opposed by the improbability
of such a misunderstanding of a phrase so frequent and so unmistakeable
as ידו ישׁלח, as would lead to the exchange supposed, ever occurring.
But besides that, in Samuel the simple המּלאך is strange, for the angel
has not been spoken of there at all before, and the lxx have
consequently explained the somewhat obscure המּלאך by ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ
Θεοῦ. This explanation suggests the way in which the reading of our text
arose. The author of the Chronicle, although he had already made mention
of the יהוה מלאך in [Ch1 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#012.md), wrote
in [Ch1 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#015.md) האלהים מלאך האלהי
ויּשׁלח, "the angel of God stretched (his hand) out towards Jerusalem,"
using האלהים instead of יהוה, - as, for example, in [Jdg
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#020.md), [Jdg
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022.md); [Jdg
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006.md), [Jdg
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#009.md), and [Jdg
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#013.md), [Jdg
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#015.md), [Jdg
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017.md). האלהים מלאך alternates with
יהוה מלאך, and omitting ידו with ישׁלח, as is often done, e.g., [Sa2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006.md); [Psa
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017.md), etc. By a copyist מלאך and
האלהים have been transposed, and מלאך was then taken by the Masoretes
for an accusative, and pointed accordingly. The expression is made
clearer by וּכהשׁחית, "And as he destroyed, Jahve saw, and it repented
Him of the evil." The idea is: Just as the angel had begun to destroy
Jerusalem, it repented God. רב, adverb, "enough," as in [Kg1
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md), etc., with a dativ commodi, [Deu
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#006.md), etc. Bertheau has incorrectly
denied this meaning of the word, connecting רב with בּעם in [Sa2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md), and desiring to alter our text
to make it conform to that. In 2nd Samuel also רב is an adverb, as
Thenius also acknowledges.

[1 Chronicles 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 21:16</span></span>

The account of David's repentant beseeching of the Lord to turn away the
primitive judgment, and the word of the Lord proclaimed to him by the
prophet, commanding him to build an altar to the Lord in the place where
the destroying angel visibly appeared, together with the carrying out of
this divine command by the purchase of Araunah's threshing-floor, the
erection of an altar, and the offering of burnt-offering, is given more
at length in the Chronicle than in [Sa2
24:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017.md), where only David's
negotiation with Araunah is more circumstantially narrated than in the
Chronicle. In substance both accounts perfectly correspond, except that
in the Chronicle several subordinate circumstances are preserved, which,
as being minor points, are passed over in Samuel. In [Ch1
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md), the description of the angel's
appearance, that he had a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over
Jerusalem, and the statement that David and the elders, clad in
sackcloth (garments indicating repentance), fell down before the Lord;
in [Ch1 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#020.md), the mention of Ornan's
(Araunah's) sons, who hid themselves on beholding the angel, and of the
fact that Ornan was engaged in threshing wheat when David came to him;
and the statement in [Ch1 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026.md), that
fire came down from heaven upon the altar-are examples of such minor
points. We have already commented on this section in our remarks on [Sa2
24:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017.md), and the account in the
Chronicle is throughout correct and easily understood. Notwithstanding
this, however, Bertheau, following Thenius and Bttcher, conjectures that
the text is in several verses corrupt, and wishes to correct them by 2nd
Samuel. But these critics are misled by the erroneous presumption with
which they entered upon the interpretation of the Chronicle, that the
author of it used as his authority, and revised, our Masoretic text of
the second book of Samuel. Under the influence of this prejudice,
emendations are proposed which are stamped with their own unlikelihood,
and rest in part even on misunderstandings of the narrative in the book
of Samuel. Of this one or two illustrations will be sufficient. Any one
who compares [Sa2 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017) (Sam..md) with
[Ch1 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md) and [Ch1
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#017.md) of the Chronicle, without any
pre-formed opinions, will see that what is there (Sam.) concisely
expressed is more clearly narrated in the Chronicle. The beginning of
[Ch1 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#017.md), "And David spake unto
Jahve," is entirely without connection, as the thought which forms the
transition from [Ch1 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md) to [Ch1
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#017.md), viz., that David was moved by
the sight of the destroying angel to pray to God that the destruction
might be turned away, is only brought in afterwards in the subordinate
clause, "on seeing the angel." This abrupt form of expression is got rid
of in the Chronicle by the clause: "And David lifted up his eyes, and
saw the angel ... and fell ... upon his face; and David spake to God."
That which in Samuel is crushed away into an infinitive clause
subordinate to the principle sentence, precedes in the Chronicle, and is
circumstantially narrated. Under these circumstances, of course, the
author of the Chronicle could not afterwards in [Ch1
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#017.md) make use of the clause, "on
seeing the angel who smote the people," without tautology. Berth., on
the contrary, maintains that [Ch1
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md) is an interpolation of the
chronicler, and proposes then to cull out from the words and letters בעם
המכה המלאך את בראתו (Sam.), the words בעם למנותי אמרתי בראתו ([Ch1
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#017).md), great use being made in the
process of the ever ready auxiliaries, mistakes, and a text which has
become obscure. This is one example out of many. [Ch1
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md) of the Chronicle is not an
addition which the Chronicle has interpolated between [Sa2
24:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md) of Samuel, but a more
detailed representation of the historical course of things. No mention
is made in 2nd Samuel of the drawn sword in the angel's hand, because
there the whole story is very concisely narrated. This detail need not
have been borrowed from [Num 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#023.md),
for the drawn sword is a sensible sign that the angle's mission is
punitive; and the angel, who is said to have visibly appeared in 2nd
Samuel also, could be recognised as the bearer of the judicial
pestilence only by this emblem, such recognition being plainly the
object of his appearance. The mention of the elders along with David as
falling on their faces in prayer, clad in sackcloth, will not surprise
any reader or critic who considers that in the case of so fearful a
pestilence the king would not be alone in praying God to turn away the
judgment. Besides, from the mention of the עבדים of the king who went
with David to Ornan ([Sa2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#020).md), we
learn that the king did not by himself take steps to turn away the
plague, but did so along with his servants. In the narrative in 2nd
Samuel, which confines itself to the main point, the elders are not
mentioned, because only of David was it recorded that his confession of
sin brought about the removal of the plague. Just as little can we be
surprised that David calls his command to number the people the delictum
by which he had brought the judgment of the plague upon himself. - To
alter בּדבר, [Ch1 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#019.md), into כּדבר,
as Berth. wishes, would show little intelligence. בּדבר, at Gad's word
David went up, is proved by [Num 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016.md)
to be good Hebrew, and is perfectly suitable.

[1 Chronicles 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 21:20</span></span>

ארנן ויּשׁב, "and Ornan turned him about," is translated by Berth.
incorrectly, "then Ornan turned back," who then builds on this erroneous
interpretation, which is contrary to the context, a whole nest of
conjectures. ויּשׁב is said to have arisen out of ויּשׁקף, the
succeeding המּלאך out of המּלך, עמּו בּניו ערבּעת out of עליו עברים
עבדיו ([Sa2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#020).md), "by mistake and
further alteration." In saying this, however, he himself has not
perceived that [Sa2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#020) (Sam..md) does
not correspond to the [Ch1 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#020.md) of
the Chronicle at all, but to the [Ch1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#021.md), where the words, "and Araunah
looked out (ישׁקף) and saw the king," as parallel to the words, "and
Ornan looked (יבּט) and saw David." The [Ch1
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#020.md) of the Chronicle contains a
statement which is not found in Samuel, that Ornan (Araunah), while
threshing with his four sons, turned and saw the angel, and being
terrified at the sight, hid himself with his sons. After that, David
with his train came from Zion to the threshing-floor in Mouth Moriah,
and Araunah looking out saw the king, and came out of the
threshing-floor to meet him, with deep obeisance. This narrative
contains nothing improbable, nothing to justify us in having recourse to
critical conjecture.

[1 Chronicles 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 21:24</span></span>

The infinitive העלות is very frequently used in Hebrew as the
continuation of the verb. fin., and is found in all the books of the Old
Testament (cf. the collection of passages illustrative of this peculiar
form of brief expression, which We. gives, 351, c), and that not only
with regard to the infin. absol., but the infin. constr. also. David's
answer to Ornan's offer to give him the place for the altar, and the
cattle, plough, and wheat for the burnt-offering, was therefore: "no, I
will buy it for full price; I will not take what belongs to thee for
Jahve, and bring burnt-offerings without cost," i.e., without having
paid the price for them.

[1 Chronicles 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 21:25</span></span>

As to the different statements of the price, cf. on [Sa2
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#024.md).

[1 Chronicles 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 21:26</span></span>

In [Sa2 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#025.md) the conclusion of this
event is shortly narrated thus: David offered burnt-offerings and
peace-offerings, and Jahve was entreated for the land, and the plague
was stayed from Israel. In the Chronicle we have a fuller statement of
the יהוה יעתר in [Ch1 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026.md). David
called upon Jahve, and He answered with fire from heaven upon the altar
of burnt-offering ([Ch1 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#027).md); and
Jahve spake to the angel, and he returned the sword into its sheath. The
returning of the sword into its sheath is a figurative expression for
the stopping of the pestilence; and the fire which came down from heaven
upon the altar of burnt-offering was the visible sign by which the Lord
assured the king that his prayer had been heard, and his offering
graciously accepted. The reality of this sign of the gracious acceptance
of an offering is placed beyond doubt by the analogous cases, [Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md); [Kg1
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#024.md), [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038.md), and [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md). It was only by this sign of the
divine complacence that David learnt that the altar built upon the
threshing-floor of Araunah had been chosen by the Lord as the place
where Israel should always thereafter offer their burnt-offerings and
sacrifices, as is further recorded in [Ch1
21:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#028.md). and in [Ch1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001.md). From the cessation of the
pestilence in consequence of his prayer and sacrifice, David could only
draw the conclusion that God had forgiven him his transgression, but
could not have known that God had chosen the place where he had built
the altar for the offering demanded by God as a permanent place of
sacrifice. This certainly he obtained only by the divine answer, and
this answer was the fire which came down upon the altar of
burnt-offering and devoured the sacrifice. This [Ch1
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#028.md) states: "At the time when he saw
that Jahve had answered him at the threshing-floor of Ornan, he offered
sacrifice there," i.e., from that time forward; so that we may with
Berth. translate שׁם ויּזבּח, "then he was wont to offer sacrifice
there." In [Ch1 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029.md) and [Ch1
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#030.md) we have still further reasons
given for David's continuing to offer sacrifices at the threshing-floor
of Ornan. The legally sanctioned place of sacrifice for Israel was still
at that time the tabernacle, the Mosaic sanctuary with its altar of
burnt-offering, which then stood on the high place at Gibeon (cf. [Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039).md). Now David had indeed brought
the ark of the covenant, which had been separated from the tabernacle
from the time of Samuel, to Zion, and had there not only erected a tent
for it, but had also built an altar and established a settled worship
there (1 Chron 17), yet without having received any express command of
God regarding it; so that this place of worship was merely provisional,
intended to continue only until the Lord Himself should make known His
will in the matter in some definite way. When therefore David, after the
conquest of his enemies, had obtained rest round about, he had formed
the resolution to make an end of this provisional separation of the ark
from the tabernacle, and the existence of two sacrificial altars, by
building a temple; but the Lord had declared to him by the prophet
Nathan, that not he, but his son and successor on the throne, should
build Him a temple. The altar by the ark in Zion, therefore, continued
to co-exist along with the altar of burnt-offering at the tabernacle in
Gibeon, without being sanctioned by God as the place of sacrifice for
the congregation of Israel. Then when David, by ordering the numbering
of the people, had brought guilt upon the nation, which the Lord so
heavily avenged upon them by the pestilence, he should properly, as
king, have offered a sin-offering and a burnt-offering in the national
sanctuary at Gibeon, and there have sought the divine favour for himself
and for the whole people. But the Lord said unto him by the prophet Gad,
that he should bring his offering neither in Gibeon, nor before the ark
on Zion, but in the threshing-floor of Ornan (Araunah), on the altar
which he was there to erect. This command, however, did not settle the
place where he was afterwards to sacrifice. But David - so it runs, [Ch1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029.md). - sacrificed thenceforward in
the threshing-floor of Ornan, not at Gibeon in the still existent
national sanctuary, because he (according to [Ch1
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#030)) "could not go before it (לפניו.md)
to seek God, for he was terrified before the sword of the angel of
Jahve." This statement does not, however, mean, ex terrore visionis
angelicae infirmitatem corporis contraxerat (J. H. Mich.), nor yet,
"because he, being struck and overwhelmed by the appearance of the
angel, did not venture to offer sacrifices elsewhere" (Berth.), nor,
"because the journey to Gibeon was too long for him" (O. v. Gerl.). None
of these interpretations suit either the words or the context. חרב מפּני
נבעת, terrified before the sword, does indeed signify that the sword of
the angel, or the angel with the sword, hindered him from going to
Gibeon, but not during the pestilence, when the angel stood between
heaven and earth by the threshing-floor of Araunah with the drawn sword,
but - according to the context - afterwards, when the angelophany had
ceased, as it doubtless did simultaneously with the pestilence. The
words וגו נבעת כּי can therefore have no other meaning, than that
David's terror before the sword of the angel caused him to determine to
sacrifice thereafter, not at Gibeon, but at the threshing-floor of
Araunah; or that, since during the pestilence the angel's sword had
prevented him from going to Gibeon, he did not venture ever afterwards
to go. But the fear before the sword of the angel is in substance the
terror of the pestilence; and the pestilence had hindered him from
sacrificing at Gibeon, because Gibeon, notwithstanding the presence of
the sanctuary there, with the Mosaic altar, had not been spared by the
pestilence. David considered this circumstance as normative ever for the
future, and he always afterwards offered his sacrifices in the place
pointed out to him, and said, as we further read in [Ch1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001.md), "Here (הוּא זה, properly this,
mas. or neut.) is the house of Jahve God, and here is the altar for the
burnt-offering of Israel." He calls the site of the altar in the
threshing-floor of Araunah יהוה בּית, because there Jahve had manifested
to him His gracious presence; cf. [Gen
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017.md).
