### [Exodus Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 20:1</span></span>

And God spake all these words, saying, The promulgation of the ten words
of God, containing the fundamental law of the covenant, took place
before Moses ascended the mountain again with Aaron ([Exo
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#024).md). "All these words" are the
words of God contained in vv. 2-17, which are repeated again in [Deu
5:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#006.md), with slight variations that do
not materially affect the sense,

(Note: The discrepancies in the two texts are the following: - In [Deu
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#008) the cop. ו ("or," Eng. Ver..md),
which stands before תּמוּנה כּל (any likeness), is omitted, to give
greater clearness to the meaning; and on the other hand it is added
before שׁלּשׁים על in [Deu 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#009.md) for
rhetorical reasons. In the fourth commandment ([Deu
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#012).md) שׁמור is chosen instead of זכור
in [Exo 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008.md), and זכר is reserved fore
the hortatory clause appended in [Deu
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015.md) : "and remember that thou wast a
servant," etc.; and with this is connected the still further fact, that
instead of the fourth commandment being enforced on the ground of the
creation of the world in six days and the resting of God on the seventh
day, their deliverance from Egypt is adduced as the subjective reason
for their observance of the command. In [Deu
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#014.md), too, the clause "nor thy cattle"
([Exo 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010).md) is amplified
rhetorically, and particularized in the words "thine ox, nor thine ass,
nor any of thy cattle." So again, in [Deu
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016.md), the promise appended to the
fifth commandment, "that thy days may be long in the land," etc., is
amplified by the interpolation of the clause "and that it may go well
with thee," and strengthened by the words "as Jehovah thy God hath
commanded thee." In [Deu 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#017.md), instead
of שׁקר עד ([Exo 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#016).md), the more
comprehensive expression שׁוא עד is chosen. Again, in the tenth
commandment ([Deu 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#018).md), the
"neighbour's wife" is placed first, and then, after the "house," the
field is added before the "man-servant and maid-servant," whereas in
Exodus the "neighbour's house" is mentioned first, and then the "wife"
along with the "man-servant and maid-servant;" and instead of the
repetition of תּחמד, the synonym תּתאוּה is employed. Lastly, in
Deuteronomy all the commandments from תּרצח לא onwards are connected
together by the repetition of the cop. ו before every one, whereas in
Exodus it is not introduced at all. - Now if, after what has been said,
the rhetorical and hortatory intention is patent in all the variations
of the text of Deuteronomy, even down to the transposition of wife and
house in the last commandment, this transposition must also be
attributed to the freedom with which the decalogue was reproduced, and
the text of Exodus be accepted as the original, which is not to be
altered in the interests of any arbitrary exposition of the
commandments.)

and are called the "words of the covenant, the ten words," in [Exo
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028.md), and [Deu
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#013.md); [Deu
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#004.md). God spake these words directly
to the people, and not "through the medium of His finite spirits," as v.
Hoffmann, Kurtz, and others suppose. There is not a word in the Old
Testament about any such mediation. Not only was it Elohim, according to
the chapter before us, who spake these words to the people, and called
Himself Jehovah, who had brought Israel out of Egypt ([Exo
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002).md), but according to [Deu
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#004.md), Jehovah spake these words to
Israel "face to face, in the mount, out of the midst of the fire."

Hence, according to Buxtorf (Dissert. de Decalogo in genere, 1642), the
Jewish commentators almost unanimously affirm that God Himself spake the
words of the decalogue, and that words were formed in the air by the
power of God, and not by the intervention and ministry of angels.

(Note: This also applies to the Targums. Onkelos and Jonathan have יי
וּמלל in [Exo 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md), and the Jerusalem
Targum דיי מימרא מליל. But in the popular Jewish Midrash, the statement
in [Deu 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md) (cf. [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017).md), that Jehovah came down upon
Sinai "out of myriads of His holiness," i.e., attended by myriads of
holy angels, seems to have given rise to the notion that God spake
through angels. Thus Josephus represents King Herod as saying to the
people, "For ourselves, we have learned from God the most excellent of
our doctrines, and the most holy part of our law through angels" (Ant.
15, 5, 3, Whiston's translation).)

And even from the New Testament this cannot be proved to be a doctrine
of the Scriptures. For when Stephen says to the Jews, in [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md), "Ye have received the law" εἰς
διαταγὰς ἀγγέλων (Eng. Ver. "by the disposition of angels"), and Paul
speaks of the law in [Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md) as
διαταγεὶς δι ̓ἀγγελων ("ordained by angels"), these expressions leave it
quite uncertain in what the διατάσσειν of the angels consisted, or what
part they took in connection with the giving of the law.

(Note: That Stephen cannot have meant to say that God spoke through a
number of finite angels, is evident from the fact, that in [Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md) he had spoken just before of the
Angel (in the singular) who spoke to Moses upon Mount Sinai, and had
described him in [Act 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035.md) and [Act
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030.md) as the Angel who appeared to
Moses in the bush, i.e., as no other than the Angel of Jehovah who was
identical with Jehovah. "The Angel of the Lord occupies the same place
in [Act 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md) as Jehovah in Ex 19. The
angels in [Act 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md) and [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md) are taken from Deut 33. And there
the angels do not come in the place of the Lord, but the Lord comes
attended by them" (Hengstenberg).)

So again, in [Heb 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md), where the law,
"the word spoken by angels" (δι ̓ἀγγελων), is placed in contrast with
the "salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord" (διὰ
τοῦ Κυρίου), the antithesis is of so indefinite a nature that it is
impossible to draw the conclusion with any certainty, that the writer of
this epistle supposed the speaking of God at the promulgation of the
decalogue to have been effected through the medium of a number of finite
spirits, especially when we consider that in the Epistle to the Hebrews
speaking is the term applied to the divine revelation generally (see
[Exo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001).md). As his object was not to
describe with precision the manner in which God spake to the Israelites
from Sinai, but only to show the superiority of the Gospel, as the
revelation of salvation, to the revelation of the law; he was at liberty
to select the indefinite expression δι ̓ἀγγελων, and leaven it to the
readers of his epistle to interpret it more fully for themselves from
the Old Testament. According to the Old Testament, however, the law was
given through the medium of angels, only so far as God appeared to
Moses, as He had done to the patriarchs, in the form of the "Angel of
the Lord," and Jehovah came down upon Sinai, according to [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md), surrounded by myriads of holy
angels as His escort.

(Note: Lud. de Dieu, in his commentary on [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md), after citing the parallel
passages [Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md) and [Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md), correctly observes, that "horum
dictorum haec videtur esse ratio et veritas. S. Stephanus supra 5:39
dixit, Angelum locutum esse cum Mose in monte Sina, eundem nempe qui in
rubo ipsa apparuerat, v. 35 qui quamvis in se Deus hic tamen κατ
̓οἰκονομίαν tanquam Angelus Deit caeterorumque angelorum praefectus
consideratus e medio angelorum, qui eum undique stipabant, legem i monte
Mosi dedit.... Atque inde colligi potest causa, cur apostolus [Heb
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md), Legi Evnagelium tantopere
anteferat. Etsi enim utriusque auctor et promulgator fuerit idem Dei
filius, quia tamen legem tulit in forma angeli e senatu angelico et
velatus gloria angelorum, tandem vero caro factus et in carne
manifestatus, gloriam prae se ferens non angelorum sed unigeniti filii
Dei, evangelium ipsemet, humana voce, habitans inter homines
praedicavit, merito lex angelorum sermo, evangelium autem solius filii
Dei dicitur.")

The notion that God spake through the medium of "His finite spirits" can
only be sustained in one of two ways: either by reducing the angels to
personifications of natural phenomena, such as thunder, lightning, and
the sound of a trumpet, a process against which the writer of the
Epistle to the Hebrews enters his protest in [Exo
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#019.md), where he expressly
distinguishes the "voice of words" from these phenomena of nature; or
else by affirming, with v. Hoffmann, that God, the supernatural, cannot
be conceived of without a plurality of spirits collected under Him, or
apart from His active operation in the world of bodies, in distinction
from which these spirits are comprehended with Him and under Him, so
that even the ordinary and regular phenomena of nature would have to be
regarded as the workings of angels; in which case the existence of
angels as created spirits would be called in question, and they would be
reduced to mere personifications of divine powers.

The words of the covenant, or ten words, were written by God upon two
tables of stone ([Exo 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018).md), and are
called the law and the commandment (והמּצוה התּורה) in [Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012.md), as being the kernel and essence
of the law. But the Bible contains neither distinct statements, nor
definite hints, with reference to the numbering and division of the
commandments upon the two tables, - a clear proof that these points do
not possess the importance which has frequently been attributed to them.
The different views have arisen in the course of time. Some divide the
ten commandments into two pentads, one upon each table. Upon the first
they place the commandments concerning (1) other gods, (2) images, (3)
the name of God, (4) the Sabbath, and (5) parents; on the second, those
concerning (1) murder, (2) adultery, (3) stealing, (4) false witness,
and (5) coveting. Others, again, reckon only three to the first table,
and seven to the second. In the first they include the commandments
respecting (1) other gods, (2) the name of God, (3) the Sabbath, or
those which concern the duties towards God; and in the second, those
respecting (1) parents, (2) murder, (3) adultery, (4) stealing, (5)
false witness, (6) coveting a neighbour's house, (7) coveting a
neighbour's wife, servants, cattle, and other possession, or those which
concern the duties towards one's neighbour. The first view, with the
division into two fives, we find in Josephus (Ant. iii. 5, 5) and Philo
(quis rer. divin. haer. 35, de Decal. 12, etc.); it is unanimously
supported by the fathers of the first four centuries,

(Note: They either speak of two tables with five commandments upon each
(Iren. adv. haer. ii. 42), or mention only one commandment against
coveting (Constit. apost. i. 1, vii. 3; Theoph. ad Autol. ii. 50;
Tertull, adv. Marc. ii. 17; Ephr. Syr. ad Ex. 20; Epiphan. haer. ii. 2,
etc.), or else they expressly distinguish the commandment against images
from that against other gods (Origen, homil. 8 in Ex.; Hieron. ad Ephes.
vi. 2; Greg. Naz. carm. i. 1; Sulpicius Sev. hist. sacr. i. 17, etc.).)

and has been retained to the present day by the Eastern and Reformed
Churches. The later Jews agree so far with this view, that they only
adopt one commandment against coveting; but they differ from it in
combining the commandment against images with that against false gods,
and taking the introductory words "I am the Lord thy God" to be the
first commandment. This mode of numbering, of which we find the first
traces in Julian Apostata (in Cyrilli Alex. c. Julian l. V. init.), and
in an allusion made by Jerome (on [Hos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#010).md), is at any rate of more recent
origin, and probably arose simply from opposition to the Christians. It
still prevails, however, among the modern Jews.

(Note: It is adopted by Gemar. Macc. f. 24 a; Targ. Jon. on Ex. and
Deut.; Mechilta on [Exo 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#015.md); Pesikta
on [Deu 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#006.md); and the rabbinical
commentators of the middle ages.)

The second view was brought forward by Augustine, and no one is known to
have supported it previous to him. In his Quaest. 71 on Ex., when
treating of the question how the commandments are to be divided ("utrum
quatuor sint usque ad praeceptum de Sabbatho, quae ad ipsum Deum
pertinent, sex autem reliqua, quorum primum: Honora patrem et matrem,
quae ad hominem pertinent: an potius illa tria sint et ipsa septem"), he
explains the two different views, and adds, "Mihi tamen videntur
congruentius accipi illa tria et ista septem, quoniam Trinitatem
videntur illa, quae ad Deum pertinent, insinuare diligentius
intuentibus." He then proceeds still further to show that the
commandment against images is only a fuller explanation of that against
other gods, but that the commandment not to covet is divided into two
commandments by the repetition of the words, "Thou shalt not covet,"
although "concupiscentia uxoris alienae et concupiscentia domus alienae
tantum in peccando differant." In this division Augustine generally
reckons the commandment against coveting the neighbour's wife as the
ninth, according to the text of Deuteronomy; although in several
instances he places it after the coveting of the house, according to the
text of Exodus. Through the great respect that was felt for Augustine,
this division became the usual one in the Western Church; and it was
adopted even by Luther and the Lutheran Church, with this difference,
however, that both the Catholic and Lutheran Churches regard the
commandment not to covet a neighbour's house as the ninth, whilst only a
few here and there give the preference, as Augustine does, to the order
adopted in Deuteronomy.

Now if we inquire, which of these divisions of the ten commandments is
the correct one, there is nothing to warrant either the assumption of
the Talmud and the Rabbins, that the words, "I am Jehovah thy God,"
etc., form the first commandment, or the preference given by Augustine
to the text of Deuteronomy. The words, "I am the Lord," etc., contain no
independent member of the decalogue, but are merely the preface to the
commandments which follow. "Hic sermo nondum sermo mandati est, sed quis
sit, qui mandat, ostendit" (Origen, homil. 8 in Ex.). But, as we have
already shown, the text of Deuteronomy, in all its deviations from the
text of Exodus, can lay no claim to originality. As to the other two
views which have obtained a footing in the Church, the historical
credentials of priority and majority are not sufficient of themselves to
settle the question in favour of the first, which is generally called
the Philonian view, from its earliest supporter. It must be decided from
the text of the Bible alone. Now in both substance and form this speaks
against the Augustinian, Catholic, and Lutheran view, and in favour of
the Philonian, or Oriental and Reformed. In substance; for whereas no
essential difference can be pointed out in the two clauses which
prohibit coveting, so that even Luther has made but one commandment of
them in his smaller catechism, there was a very essential difference
between the commandment against other gods and that against making an
image of God, so far as the Israelites were concerned, as we may see not
only from the account of the golden calf at Sinai, but also from the
image worship of Gideon ([Jdg 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027).md),
Micah ([Jdg 17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001).md), and Jeroboam
([Kg1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028)..md). In form; for the last
five commandments differ from the first five, not only in the fact that
no reasons are assigned for the former, whereas all the latter are
enforced by reasons, in which the expression "Jehovah thy God" occurs
every time; but still more in the fact, that in the text of Deuteronomy
all the commandments after "Thou shalt do no murder" are connected
together by the copula ו, which is repeated before every sentence, and
from which we may see that Moses connected the commandments which treat
of duties to one's neighbour more closely together, and by thus linking
them together showed that they formed the second half of the decalogue.

The weight of this testimony is not counterbalanced by the division into
parashoth and the double accentuation of the Masoretic text, viz., by
accents both above and below, even if we assume that this was intended
in any way to indicate a logical division of the commandments. In the
Hebrew MSS and editions of the Bible, the decalogue is divided into ten
parashoth, with spaces between them marked either by ס (Setuma) or פ
(Phetucha); and whilst the commandments against other gods and images,
together with the threat and promise appended to them ([Exo
20:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003).md), form one parashah, the
commandment against coveting ([Exo
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#014).md) is divided by a setuma into
two. But according to Kennicott (ad [Exo
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#017.md); [Deu
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#018), and diss. gener. p. 59.md) this
setuma was wanting in 234 of the 694 MSS consulted by him, and in many
exact editions of the Bible as well; so that the testimony is not
unanimous here.It is no argument against this division into parashoth,
that it does not agree either with the Philonian or the rabbinical
division of the ten commandments, or with the Masoretic arrangement of
the verses and the lower accents which correspond to this. For there can
be no doubt that it is older than the Masoretic treatment of the text,
though it is by no means original on that account. Even when the Targum
on the Song of Sol. ([Sol 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#013).md) says
that the tables of stone were written in ten שׁטּים or שׁיטים, i.e.,
rows or strophes, like the rows of a garden full of sweet odours, this
Targum is much too recent to furnish any valid testimony to the original
writing and plan of the decalogue. And the upper accentuation of the
decalogue, which corresponds to the division into parashoth, has must as
little claim to be received as a testimony in favour of "a division of
the verses which was once evidently regarded as very significant"
(Ewald); on the contrary, it was evidently added to the lower
accentuation simply in order that the decalogue might be read in the
synagogues on particular days after the parashoth.

(Note: See Geiger (wissensch. Ztschr. iii. 1, 151). According to the
testimony of a Rabbin who had embraced Christianity, the decalogue was
read in one way, when it occurred as a Sabbath parashah, either in the
middle of January or at the beginning of July, and in another way at the
feast of Pentecost, as the feast of the giving of the law; the lower
accentuation being followed in the former case, and the upper in the
latter. We may compare with this the account given in En Israel, fol.
103, col. 3, that one form of accentuation was intended for ordinary or
private reading, the other for public reading in the synagogue.)

Hence the double accentuation was only so far of importance, as showing
that the Masorites regarded the parashoth as sufficiently important, to
be retained for reading in the synagogue by a system of accentuation
which corresponded to them. But if this division into parashoth had been
regarded by the Jews from time immemorial as original, or Mosaic, in its
origin; it would be impossible to understand either the rise of other
divisions of the decalogue, or the difference between this division and
the Masoretic accentuation and arrangement of the verses. From all this
so much at any rate is clear, that form a very early period there was a
disposition to unite together the two commandments against other gods
and images; but assuredly on no other ground than because of the threat
and promise with which they are followed, and which must refer, as was
correctly assumed, to both commandments. But if these two commandments
were classified as one, there was no other way of bringing out the
number ten, than to divide the commandment against coveting into two.
But as the transposition of the wife and the house in the two texts
could not well be reconciled with this, the setuma which separated them
in [Exo 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#014.md) did not meet with
universal reception.

Lastly, on the division of the ten covenant words upon the two tables of
stone, the text of the Bible contains no other information, than that
"the tables were written on both their sides" ([Exo
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015).md), from which we may infer with
tolerable certainty, what would otherwise have the greatest probability
as being the most natural supposition, viz., that the entire contents of
the "ten words" were engraved upon the tables, and not merely the ten
commandments in the stricter sense, without the accompanying reasons.

(Note: If the whole of the contents stood upon the table, the ten words
cannot have been arranged either according to Philo's two pentads, or
according to Augustine's division into three and seven; for in either
case there would have been far more words upon the first table than upon
the second, and, according to Augustine's arrangement, there would have
been 131 upon one table, and only 41 upon the other. We obtain a much
more suitable result, if the words of [Exo
20:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md), i.e., the first three
commandments according to Philo's reckoning, were engraved upon the one
table, and the other seven from the Sabbath commandment onwards upon the
other; for in that case there would be 96 words upon the first table and
76 upon the second. If the reasons for the commandments were not written
along with them upon the tables, the commandments respecting the name
and nature of God, and the keeping of the Sabbath, together with the
preamble, which could not possibly be left out, would amount to 73 words
in all, the commandment to honour one's parents would contain 5 words,
and the rest of the commandments 26.)

But if neither the numbering of the ten commandments nor their
arrangement on the two tables was indicated in the law as drawn up for
the guidance of the people of Israel, so that it was possible for even
the Israelites to come to different conclusions on the subject; the
Christian Church has all the more a perfect right to handle these
matters with Christian liberty and prudence for the instruction of
congregations in the law, from the fact that it is no longer bound to
the ten commandments, as a part of the law of Moses, which has been
abolished for them through the fulfilment of Christ, but has to receive
them for the regulation of its own doctrine and life, simply as being
the unchangeable norm of the holy will of God which was fulfilled
through Christ.

[Exodus 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 20:2</span></span>

The Ten Words commenced with a declaration of Jehovah concerning
Himself, which served as a practical basis for the obligation on the
part of the people to keep the commandments: "I am Jehovah thy God, who
brought thee," etc. By bringing them out of Egypt, the house of bondage,
Jehovah had proved to the Israelites that He was their God. This
glorious act, to which Israel owed its existence as an independent
nation, was peculiarly fitted, as a distinct and practical manifestation
of unmerited divine love, to kindle in the hearts of the people the
warmest love in return, and to incite them to keep the commandments.
These words are not to be regarded, as Knobel supposes, as either a
confession, or the foundation of the whole of the theocratical law, just
as Saleucus, Plato, and other lawgivers placed a belief in the existence
of the gods at the head of their laws. They were rather the preamble, as
Calvin says, by which God prepared the minds of the people for obeying
them, and in this sense they were frequently repeated to give emphasis
to other laws, sometimes in full, as in [Exo
29:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046.md); [Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036.md); [Lev
23:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#043.md); [Lev
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#038.md), [Lev
25:55](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#055.md); [Lev
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013.md), etc., sometimes in the abridged
form, "I am Jehovah your God," as in [Lev
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044.md); [Lev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#002.md), [Lev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#004.md), [Lev
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#030.md); [Lev
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#004.md), [Lev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#010.md), [Lev
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#025.md), [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031.md), [Lev
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#034.md); [Lev
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#007.md), etc., for which the simple
expression, "I am Jehovah," is now and then substituted, as in [Lev

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 20:3</span></span>

The First Word. - "Let there not be to thee (thou shalt have no) other
gods פּני על פּן," lit., beyond Me (על as in [Gen
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022.md); [Psa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002).md), or in addition to Me (על as in
[Gen 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050.md); [Deu
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#009)), equivalent to πλὴν ἐμοῦ (lxx.md),
"by the side of Me" (Luther). "Before Me," coram me (Vulg., etc.), is
incorrect; also against Me, in opposition to Me. (On פּני see [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014)..md) The singular יהיה does not
require that we should regard Elohim as an abstract noun in the sense of
Deity; and the plural אחרים would not suit this rendering (see [Gen
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014).md). The sentence is quite a general
one, and not only prohibits polytheism and idolatry, the worship of
idols in thought, word, and deed (cf. [Deu
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#011.md), [Deu
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#017.md), [Deu
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#019).md), but also commands the fear,
love, and worship of God the Lord (cf. [Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md), [Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md), [Deu
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#017.md); [Deu
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md), [Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020).md). Nearly all the commandments
are couched in the negative form of prohibition, because they presuppose
the existence of sin and evil desires in the human heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 20:4</span></span>

The Second Word. - To the prohibition of idolatrous worship there is
linked on, as a second word, the prohibition of the worship of images.
"After declaring in the first commandment who was the true God, He
commanded that He alone should be worshipped; and now He defines what is
His lawful worship" (Calvin). "Thou shalt not make to thyself a likeness
and any form of that which is in heaven above," etc. עשׂה is construed
with a double accusative, so that the literal rendering would be "make,
as a likeness and any form, that which is in heaven," etc. פּסל, from
פּסל to carve wood or stone, is a figure made of wood or stone, and is
used in [Jdg 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#003.md). for a figure
representing Jehovah, and in other places for figures of heathen deities
- of Asherah, for example, in [Kg2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007.md). תּמוּנה does not signify an
image made by man, but a form which is seen by him ([Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008.md); [Deu
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#012.md), [Deu
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015.md).; [Job
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#016.md); [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015).md). In [Deu
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#008.md) (cf. [Exo
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#016).md) we find כּל־תּמוּנה פּסל
"likeness of any form:" so that in this passage also וכל־תּמוּנה is to
be taken as in apposition to פּסל, and the ו as vav explic.: "and indeed
any form," viz., of Jehovah, not of heathen gods. That the words should
be so understood, is demanded by [Deu
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015.md)., where Moses lays stress upon
the command, not to make to themselves an image (פסל) in the form of any
sculpture (סמל), and gives this as the reason: "For ye saw no form in
the day when Jehovah spake to you at Horeb." This authoritative
exposition of the divine prohibition on the part of Moses himself proves
undeniably, that פסל and תמונה are to be understood as referring to
symbolical representations of Jehovah. And the words which follow also
receive their authoritative exposition from [Deu
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#017.md) and [Deu
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#018.md). By "that which is in heaven" we
are to understand the birds, not the angels, or at the most, according
to [Deu 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md), the stars as well; by
"that which is in earth," the cattle, reptiles, and the larger or
smaller animals; and by "that which is in the water," fishes and water
animals. "Under the earth" is appended to the "water," to express in a
pictorial manner the idea of its being lower than the solid ground (cf.
[Deu 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#018).md). It is not only evident
from the context that the allusion is not to the making of images
generally, but to the construction of figures of God as objects of
religious reverence or worship, but this is expressly stated in [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md); so that even Calvin observes,
that "there is no necessity to refute what some have foolishly imagined,
that sculpture and painting of every kind are condemned here." With the
same aptness he has just before observed, that "although Moses only
speaks of idols, there is no doubt that by implication he condemns all
the forms of false worship, which men have invented for themselves."

[Exo 20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md)

"Thou shalt not pray to them and serve them." (On the form תּעבדם with
the o-sound under the guttural, see Ewald, 251d.). השׁתּחוה signifies
bending before God in prayer, and invoking His name; עבד, worship by
means of sacrifice and religious ceremonies. The suffixes להם and - ם
(to them, and them) refer to the things in heaven, etc., which are made
into pesel, symbols of Jehovah, as being the principal object of the
previous clause, and not to כּל־תּמוּנה פּסל, although פּסל עבד is
applied in [Psa 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md) and [Kg2
17:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#041.md) to a rude idolatrous worship,
which identifies the image as the symbol of deity with the deity itself,
Still less do they refer to אחרים אלהים in [Exo
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003.md).

The threat and promise, which follow in [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md) and [Exo
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006.md), relate to the first two
commandments, and not to the second alone; because both of them,
although forbidding two forms of idolatry, viz., idolo-latry and
ikono-latry, are combined in a higher unity, by the fact, that whenever
Jehovah, the God who cannot be copied because He reveals His spiritual
nature in no visible form, is worshipped under some visible image, the
glory of the invisible God is changed, or Jehovah changed into a
different God from what He really is. Through either form of idolatry,
therefore, Israel would break its covenant with Jehovah. For this reason
God enforces the two commandments with the solemn declaration: "I,
Jehovah thy God, am קנּא אל a jealous God;" i.e., not only ζηλωτής, a
zealous avenger of sinners, but ζηλοτύπος, a jealous God, who will not
transfer to another the honour that is due to Himself ([Isa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008.md); [Isa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011).md), nor tolerate the worship of
any other god ([Exo 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#014).md), but who
directs the warmth of His anger against those who hate Him ([Deu
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#015).md), with the same energy with which
the warmth of His love ([Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006).md)
embraces those who love Him, except that love in the form of grace
reaches much further than wrath. The sin of the fathers He visits
(punishes) on the children to the third and fourth generation. שׁלּשׁים
third (sc., children) are not grandchildren, but great-grandchildren,
and רבּעים the fourth generation. On the other hand He shows mercy to
the thousandths, i.e., to the thousandth generation (cf. [Deu
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009.md), where דּור לאלף stands for
לאלפים). The cardinal number is used here for the ordinal, for which
there was no special form in the case of אלף. The words לשׂנאי and
לאהבי, in which the punishment and grace are traced to their ultimate
foundation, are of great importance to a correct understanding of this
utterance of God. The ל before שׂנאי does not take up the genitive with
עון again, as Knobel supposes, for no such use of ל can be established
from [Gen 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md); [Gen
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#003.md); [Gen
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018.md); [Gen
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#012.md), or in fact in any way whatever.
In this instance ל signifies "at" or "in relation to;" and לשׂנאי, from
its very position, cannot refer to the fathers alone, but to the fathers
and children to the third and fourth generation. If it referred to the
fathers alone, it would necessarily stand after אבת. וגו לאהבי is to be
taken in the same way. God punishes the sin of the fathers in the
children to the third and fourth generation in relation to those who
hate Him, and shows mercy to the thousandth generation in relation to
those who love Him. The human race is a living organism, in which not
only sin and wickedness are transmitted, but evil as the curse of the
sin and the punishment of the wickedness. As children receive their
nature from their parents, or those who beget them, so they have also to
bear and atone for their fathers' guilt. This truth forced itself upon
the minds even of thoughtful heathen from their own varied experience
(cf. Aeschyl. Sept. 744; Eurip. according to Plutarch de sera num. vind.
12, 21; Cicero de nat. deorum 3, 38; and Baumgarten-Crusius, bibl.
Theol. p. 208). Yet there is no fate in the divine government of the
world, no irresistible necessity in the continuous results of good and
evil; but there reigns in the world a righteous and gracious God, who
not only restrains the course of His penal judgments, as soon as the
sinner is brought to reflection by the punishment and hearkens to the
voice of God, but who also forgives the sin and iniquity of those who
love Him, keeping mercy to the thousandth generation ([Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007).md). The words neither affirm that
sinning fathers remain unpunished, nor that the sins of fathers are
punished in the children and grandchildren without any fault of their
own: they simply say nothing about whether and how the fathers
themselves are punished; and, in order to show the dreadful severity of
the penal righteousness of God, give prominence to the fact, that
punishment is not omitted-that even when, in the long-suffering of God,
it is deferred, it is not therefore neglected, but that the children
have to bear the sins of their fathers, whenever, for example (as
naturally follows from the connection of children with their fathers,
and, as Onkelos has added in his paraphrase of the words), "the children
fill up the sins of their fathers," so that the descendants suffer
punishment for both their own and their forefathers' misdeeds ([Lev
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039.md); [Isa
65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007.md); [Amo
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#017.md); [Jer
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011.md).; [Dan
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#016).md). But when, on the other hand,
the hating ceases, when the children forsake their fathers' evil ways,
the warmth of the divine wrath is turned into the warmth of love, and
God becomes חסד עשׂה ("showing mercy") to them; and this mercy endures
not only to the third and fourth generation, but to the thousandth
generation, though only in relation to those who love God, and manifest
this love by keeping His commandments. "If God continues for a long time
His visitation of sin, He continues to all eternity His manifestation of
mercy, and we cannot have a better proof of this than in the history of
Israel itself" (Schultz).

(Note: On the visitation of the sins of the fathers upon the children,
see also Hengstenberg, Dissertations, vol. ii. p. 446ff.)

[Exodus 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 20:7</span></span>

The Third Word, "Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in
vain," is closely connected with the former two. Although there is no
God beside Jehovah, the absolute One, and His divine essence cannot be
seen or conceived of under any form, He had made known the glory of His
nature in His name ([Exo 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014.md)., [Exo
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#002).md), and this was not to be abused by
His people. שׁם נשׁא does not mean to utter the name (נשׁא never has
this meaning), but in all the passages in which it has been so rendered
it retains its proper meaning, "to take up, life up, raise;" e.g., to
take up or raise (begin) a proverb ([Num
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md); [Job
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001).md), to lift up a song ([Psa
81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003).md), or a prayer ([Isa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#004).md). And it is evident from the
parallel in [Psa 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md), "to lift up his
soul to vanity," that it does not mean "to utter" here. שׁוא does not
signify a lie (שׁקר), but according to its etymon שׁאה, to be waste, it
denotes that which is waste and disorder, hence that which is empty,
vain, and nugatory, for which there is no occasion. The word prohibits
all employment of the name of God for vain and unworthy objects, and
includes not only false swearing, which is condemned in [Lev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012.md) as a profanation of the name of
Jehovah, but trivial swearing in the ordinary intercourse of life, and
every use of the name of God in the service of untruth and lying, for
imprecation, witchcraft, or conjuring; whereas the true employment of
the name of God is confined to "invocation, prayer, praise, and
thanksgiving," which proceeds from a pure, believing heart. The natural
heart is very liable to transgress this command, and therefore it is
solemnly enforced by the threat, "for Jehovah will not hold him
guiltless" (leave him unpunished), etc.

[Exodus 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 20:8</span></span>

The Fourth Word, "Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy,"
presupposes an acquaintance with the Sabbath, as the expression
"remember" is sufficient to show, but not that the Sabbath had been kept
before this. From the history of the creation that had been handed down,
Israel must have known, that after God had created the world in six days
He rested the seventh day, and by His resting sanctified the day ([Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003).md). But hitherto there had been no
commandment given to man to sanctify the day. This was given for the
first time to Israel at Sinai, after preparation had been made for it by
the fact that the manna did not fall on the seventh day of the week
([Exo 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#022).md). Here therefore the mode
of sanctifying it was established for the first time. The seventh day
was to be שׁבּי (a festival-keeper, see [Exo
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023).md), i.e., a day of rest belonging
to the Lord, and to be consecrated to Him by the fact that no work was
performed upon it. The command not to do any (כּל) work applied to both
man and beast without exception. Those who were to rest are divided into
two classes by the omission of the cop. ו before עבדּך ([Exo
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010).md): viz., first, free Israelites
("thou") and their children ("thy son and thy daughter"); and secondly,
their slaves (man-servant and maid-servant), and cattle (beasts of
draught and burden), and their strangers, i.e., foreign labourers who
had settled among the Israelites. "Within thy gates" is equivalent to in
the cities, towns, and villages of thy land, not in thy houses (cf. [Deu
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#014.md); [Deu
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021), etc.). שׁער (a gate.md) is only
applied to the entrances to towns, or large enclosed courts and palaces,
never to the entrances into ordinary houses, huts, and tents. מלאכה work
(cf. [Gen 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002).md), as distinguished from
עבדה labour, is not so much a term denoting a lighter kind of labour, as
a general and comprehensive term applied to the performance of any task,
whether easy or severe. עבדה is the execution of a definite task,
whether in field labour ([Psa 104:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#023).md)
and mechanical employment ([Exo 39:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032).md)
on the one hand, or priestly service and the duties connected with
worship on the other ([Exo 12:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#025.md);
[Num 4:47](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#047).md). On the Sabbath (and also
on the day of atonement, [Lev 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#028.md),
[Lev 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#031).md) every occupation was to
rest; on the other feast-days only laborious occupations (עבדה מלאכת,
[Lev 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007)..md), i.e., such occupations as
came under the denomination of labour, business, or industrial
employment. Consequently, not only were ploughing and reaping ([Exo
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#021).md), pressing wine and carrying
goods ([Neh 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015).md), bearing burdens
([Jer 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021).md), carrying on trade ([Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005).md), and holding markets ([Neh
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015)..md) prohibited, but collecting
manna ([Exo 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#026)..md), gathering wood
([Num 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032)..md), and kindling fire for
the purpose of boiling or baking ([Exo
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#003).md). The intention of this resting
from every occupation on the Sabbath is evident from the foundation upon
which the commandment is based in [Exo
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#011.md), viz., that at the creation of
the heaven and the earth Jehovah rested on the seventh day, and
therefore blessed the Sabbath-day and hallowed it. This does not imply,
however, that "Israel was to follow the Lord by keeping the Sabbath,
and, in imitation of His example, to be active where the Lord was
active, and rest where the Lord rested; to copy the Lord in accordance
with the lofty aim of man, who was created in His likeness, and make the
pulsation of the divine life in a certain sense his own" (Schultz). For
although a parallel is drawn, between the creation of the world by God
in six days and His resting upon the seventh day on the one hand, and
the labour of man for six days and his resting upon the seventh on the
other; the reason for the keeping of the Sabbath is not to be found in
this parallel, but in the fact that God blessed the seventh day and
hallowed it, because He rested upon it. The significance of the Sabbath,
therefore, is to be found in God's blessing and sanctifying the seventh
day of the week at the creation, i.e., in the fact, that after the work
of creation was finished on the seventh day, God blessed and hallowed
the created world, filling it with the powers of peace and good
belonging to His own blessed rest, and raising it to a participation in
the pure light of His holy nature (see [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003).md). For this reason His people
Israel were to keep the Sabbath now, not for the purpose of imitating
what God had done, and enjoying the blessing of God by thus following
God Himself, but that on this day they also might rest from their work;
and that all the more, because their work was no longer the work
appointed to man at the first, when he was created in the likeness of
God, work which did not interrupt his blessedness in God ([Gen
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#015).md), but that hard labour in the
sweat of his brow to which he had been condemned in consequence of the
fall. In order therefore that His people might rest from toil so
oppressive to both body and soul, and be refreshed, God prescribed the
keeping of the Sabbath, that they might thus possess a day for the
repose and elevation of their spirits, and a foretaste of the
blessedness into which the people of God are at last to enter, the
blessedness of the eternal κατάπαυσις ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ ([Heb
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#010).md), the ἀνάπαυσις ἐκ τῶν κόπων
([Rev 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013).md). See my Archaeologie,
77).

But instead of this objective ground for the sabbatical festival, which
furnished the true idea of the Sabbath, when Moses recapitulated the
decalogue, he adduced only the subjective aspect of rest or refreshing
([Deu 5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#014).md), reminding the people,
just as in [Exo 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#012.md), of their
bondage in Egypt and their deliverance from it by the strong arm of
Jehovah, and then adding, "therefore (that thou mightest remember this
deliverance from bondage) Jehovah commanded thee to keep the
Sabbath-day." This is not at variance with the reason given in the
present verse, but simply gives prominence to a subjective aspect, which
was peculiarly adapted to warm the hearts of the people towards the
observance of the Sabbath, and to render the Sabbath rest dear to the
people, since it served to keep the Israelites constantly in mind of the
rest which Jehovah had procured for them from the slave labour of Egypt.
For resting from every work is the basis of the observance of the
Sabbath; but this observance is an institution peculiar to the Old
Testament, and not to be met with in any other nation, though there are
many among whom the division of weeks occurs. The observance of the
Sabbath, by being adopted into the decalogue, was made the foundation of
all the festal times and observances of the Israelites, as they all
culminated in the Sabbath rest. At the same time, as an ἐντολὴ τοῦ
νόμον, an ingredient in the Sinaitic law, it belonged to the "shadow of
(good) things to come" ([Col 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017.md), cf.
[Heb 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001).md), which was to be done away
when the "body" in Christ had come. Christ is Lord of the Sabbath ([Mat
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008).md), and after the completion of His
work, He also rested on the Sabbath. But He rose again on the Sunday;
and through His resurrection, which is the pledge to the world of the
fruits of His redeeming work, He has made this day the κυριακὴ ἡμέρα
(Lord's day) for His Church, to be observed by it till the Captain of
its salvation shall return, and having finished the judgment upon all
His foes to the very last shall lead it to the rest of that eternal
Sabbath, which God prepared for the whole creation through His own
resting after the completion of the heaven and the earth.

[Exodus 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 20:12</span></span>

The Fifth Word, "Honour thy father and thy mother," does not refer to
fellow-men, but to "those who are the representatives (vicarii) of God.
Therefore, as God is to be served with honour and fear, His
representatives are to be so too" (Luther decem. praec.). This is placed
beyond all doubt by [Lev 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#003.md), where
reverence towards parents is placed on an equality with the observance
of the Sabbath, and תּירא (fear) is substituted for כּבּד (honour). It
also follows from כּבּד, which, as Calvin correctly observes, nihil
aliud est quam Deo et hominibus, qui dignitate pollent, justum honorem
deferre. Fellow-men or neighbours (רע) are to be loved ([Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018).md): parents, on the other hand,
are to be honoured and feared; reverence is to be shown to them with
heart, mouth, and hand - in thought, word, and deed. But by father and
mother we are not to understand merely the authors and preservers of our
bodily life, but also the founders, protectors, and promoters of our
spiritual life, such as prophets and teachers, to whom sometimes the
name of father is given ([Kg2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012.md);
[Kg2 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014).md), whilst at other times
paternity is ascribed to them by their scholars being called sons and
daughters ([Psa 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012.md); [Psa
45:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#011.md); [Pro
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008.md), [Pro
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010.md), [Pro
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015), etc..md); also the guardians of our
bodily and spiritual life, the powers ordained of God, to whom the names
of father and mother ([Gen 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#008.md); [Jdg
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#007).md) may justly be applied, since all
government has grown out of the relation of father and child, and draws
its moral weight and stability, upon which the prosperity and well-being
of a nation depends, from the reverence of children towards their
parents.

(Note: "In this demand for reverence to parents, the fifth commandment
lays the foundation for the sanctification of the whole social life,
inasmuch as it thereby teaches us to acknowledge a divine authority in
the same" (Oehler, Dekalog, p. 322).)

And the promise, "that thy days may be long (thou mayest live long) in
the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee," also points to this. There
is a double promise here. So long as the nation rejoiced in the
possession of obedient children, it was assured of a long life or
existence in the land of Canaan; but there is also included the promise
of a long life, i.e., a great age, to individuals (cf. [Deu
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#002.md); [Deu
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#007).md), just as we find in [Kg1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014.md) a good old age referred to as a
special blessing from God. In [Deu
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016.md), the promise of long life is
followed by the words, "and that it may be well with thee," which do not
later the sense, but merely explain it more fully.

As the majesty of God was thus to be honoured and feared in parents, so
the image of God was to be kept sacred in all men. This thought forms
the transition to the rest of the commandments.

[Exodus 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 20:13</span></span>

The other Five Words or commandments, which determine the duties to
one's neighbour, are summed up in [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md) in the one word, "Love thy
neighbour as thyself." The order in which they follow one another is the
following: they first of all secure life, marriage, and property against
active invasion or attack, and then, proceeding from deed to word and
thought, they forbid false witness and coveting.

(Note: Luther has pointed out this mirum et aptum ordinem, and expounds
it thus: Incipit prohibitio a majori usque ad minimum, nam maximum
damnum est occisio hominis, deinde proximum violatio conjugis, tertium
ablatio facultatis. Quod qui in iis nocere non possunt, saltem lingua
nocent, ideo quartum est laesio famae. Quodsi in iis non praevalent
omnibus, saltem corde laedunt proximum, cupiendo quae ejus sunt, in quo
et invidia proprie consistit.)

If, therefore, the first three commandments in this table refer
primarily to deeds; the subsequent advance to the prohibition of desire
is a proof that the deed is not to be separated from the disposition,
and that "the fulfilment of the law is only complete when the heart
itself is sanctified" (Oehler). Accordingly, in the command, "Thou shalt
not kill," not only is the accomplished fact of murder condemned,
whether it proceed from open violence or stratagem ([Exo
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md), [Exo
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014.md), [Exo
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#018).md), but every act that endangers
human life, whether it arise from carelessness ([Deu
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008).md) or wantonness ([Lev
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014).md), or from hatred, anger, and
revenge ([Lev 19:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017).md). Life is
placed at the head of these commandments, not as being the highest
earthly possession, but because it is the basis of human existence, and
in the life the personality is attacked, and in that the image of God
([Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006).md). The omission of the object
still remains to be noticed, as showing that the prohibition includes
not only the killing of a fellow-man, but the destruction of one's own
life, or suicide. - The two following commandments are couched in
equally general terms. Adultery, נאף, which is used in [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md) of both man and woman, signifies
(as distinguished from זנה to commit fornication) the sexual intercourse
of a husband with the wife of another, or of a wife with the husband of
another. This prohibition is not only directed against any assault upon
the husband's dearest possession, for the tenth commandment guards
against that, but upholds the sacredness of marriage as the divine
appointment for the propagation and multiplication of the human race;
and although addressed primarily to the man, like all the commandments
that were given to the whole nation, applies quite as much to the woman
as to the man, just as we find in [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md) that adultery was to be punished
with death in the case of both the man and the woman. - Property was to
be equally inviolable. The command, "Thou shalt not steal," prohibited
not only the secret or open removal of another person's property, but
injury done to it, or fraudulent retention of it, through carelessness
or indifference ([Exo 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#033.md); [Exo
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#013.md); [Exo
23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004.md); [Deu
22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001).md). - But lest these commandments
should be understood as relating merely to the outward act as such, as
they were by the Pharisees, in opposition to whom Christ set forth their
true fulfilment ([Mat 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021)..md), God
added the further prohibition, "Thou shalt not answer as a false witness
against thy neighbour," i.e., give false testimony against him. ענה and
בּ: to answer or give evidence against a person ([Gen
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#033).md). עד is not evidence, but a
witness. Instead of שׁקר עד, a witness of a lie, who consciously gives
utterance to falsehood, we find שׁוא עד in Deuteronomy, one who says
what is vain, worthless, unfounded (שׁוא שׁמע, [Exo
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md); on שׁוא see [Exo
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#007).md). From this it is evident, that
not only is lying prohibited, but false and unfounded evidence in
general; and not only evidence before a judge, but false evidence of
every kind, by which (according to the context) the life, married
relation, or property of a neighbour might be endangered (cf. [Exo
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md); [Num
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#030.md); [Deu
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md); [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md); [Deu
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013)..md). - The last or tenth
commandment is directed against desiring (coveting), as the root from
which every sin against a neighbour springs, whether it be in word or
deed. The חמד, ἐπιθυμεῖν (lxx), coveting, proceeds from the heart ([Pro
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025).md), and brings forth sin, which "is
finished" in the act ([Jam 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014).md).
The repetition of the words, "Thou shalt not covet," does not prove that
there are two different commandments, any more than the substitution of
תּתאוּה in [Deu 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#018.md) for the second
תּחמד. חמד and התאוּה are synonyms, - the only difference between them
being, that "the former denotes the desire as founded upon the
perception of beauty, and therefore excited from without, the latter,
desire originating at the very outset in the person himself, and arising
from his own want or inclination" (Schultz). The repetition merely
serves to strengthen and give the great emphasis to that which
constitutes the very kernel of the command, and is just as much in
harmony with the simple and appropriate language of the law, as the
employment of a synonym in the place of the repetition of the same word
is with the rhetorical character of Deuteronomy. Moreover, the objects
of desire do not point to two different commandments. This is evident at
once from the transposition of the house and wife in Deuteronomy. בּית
(the house) is not merely the dwelling, but the entire household (as in
[Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md); [Job
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#015).md), either including the wife, or
exclusive of her. In the text before us she is included; in Deuteronomy
she is not, but is placed first as the crown of the man, and a
possession more costly than pearls ([Pro
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004.md); [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010).md). In this case, the idea of the
"house" is restricted to the other property belonging to the domestic
economy, which is classified in Deuteronomy as fields, servants, cattle,
and whatever else a man may have; whereas in Exodus the "house" is
divided into wife, servants, cattle, and the rest of the possessions.

[Exodus 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 20:18</span></span>

(cf. [Deu 5:19-33](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#019).md). The terrible
phenomena, amidst which the Lord displayed His majesty, made the
intended impression upon the people who were stationed by the mountain
below, so that they desired that God would not speak to them any more,
and entreated Moses through their elders to act as mediator between
them, promising at the same time that they would hear him (cf. [Exo
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009.md), [Exo
19:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016).md). ראים, perceiving: ראה to
see being frequently used for perceiving, as being the principle sense
by which most of the impressions of the outer world are received (e.g.,
[Gen 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md); [Isa
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#016.md); [Jer
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024).md). לפּידם, fire-torches, are the
vivid flashes of lightning ([Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016).md). "They trembled and stood afar
off:" not daring to come nearer to the mountain, or to ascend it. "And
they said," viz., the heads of the tribes and elders: cf. [Deu
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#020.md), where the words of the people
are more fully given. "Lest we die:" cf. [Deu
5:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#021.md). Though they had discovered
that God speaks with man, and yet man lives; they felt so much that they
were בּשׂר, flesh, i.e., powerless, frail, and alienated by sin from the
holy God, that they were afraid lest they should be consumed by this
great fire, if they listened any longer to the voice of God.

[Exodus 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 20:20</span></span>

To direct the sinner's holy awe in the presence of the holy God, which
was expressed in these words of the people, into the proper course of
healthy and enduring penitence, Moses first of all took away the false
fear of death by the encouraging answer, "Fear not," and then
immediately added, "for God is come to prove you." נסּוּת referred to
the testing of the state of the heart in relation to God, as it is
explained in the exegetical clause which follows: "that His fear may be
before your faces, that ye sin not." By this terrible display of His
glory, God desired to inspire them with the true fear of Himself, that
they might not sin through distrust, disobedience, or resistance to His
guidance and commands.

[Exodus 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 20:21</span></span>

"So the people stood afar off" (as in [Exo
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018).md), not "went far away," although,
according to [Deu 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#030.md), Moses was
directed by God to tell the people to return to their tents. This is
passed over here, and it is merely observed, for the purpose of closing
the first act in the giving the law, and preparing the way for the
second, that the people remained afar off, whereas Moses (and Aaron, cf.
[Exo 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#024).md) drew near to the darkness
where God was, to receive the further commands of the Lord.

[Exodus 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 20:22</span></span>

The General Form of Divine Worship in Israel. - As Jehovah had spoken to
the Israelites from heaven, they were not to make gods of earthly
materials, such as silver and gold, by the side of Him, but simply to
construct an altar of earth or unhewn stones without steps, for the
offering up of His sacrifices at the place where He would reveal
Himself. "From heaven" Jehovah came down upon Sinai enveloped in the
darkness of a cloud; and thereby He made known to the people that His
nature was heavenly, and could not be imitated in any earthly material.
"Ye shall not make with Me," place by the side of, or on a par with Me,"
"gods of silver and gold," - that is to say, idols primarily intended to
represent the nature of God, and therefore meant as symbols of Jehovah,
but which became false gods from the very fact that they were intended
as representations of the purely spiritual God.

[Exodus 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 20:24</span></span>

For the worship of Jehovah, the God of heaven, Israel needed only an
altar, on which to cause its sacrifices to ascend to God. The altar, as
an elevation built up of earth or rough stones, was a symbol of the
elevation of man to God, who is enthroned on high in the heaven; and
because man was to raise himself to God in his sacrifices, Israel also
was to make an altar, though only of earth, or if of stones, not of hewn
stones. "For if thou swingest thy tool (חרב lit., sharpness, then any
edge tool) over it (over the stone), thou defilest it" ([Exo
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#025).md). "Of earth:" i.e., not "of
comparatively simple materials, such as befitted a representation of the
creature" (Schultz on Deut 12); for the altar was not to represent the
creature, but to be the place to which God came to receive man into His
fellowship there. For this reason the altar was to be made of the same
material, which formed the earthly soil for the kingdom of God, either
of earth or else of stones, just as they existed in their natural state;
not, however, "because unpolished stones, which retain their true and
native condition, appear to be endowed with a certain native purity, and
therefore to be most in harmony with the sanctity of an altar" (Spencer
de legg. Hebr. rit. lib. ii. c. 6), for the "native purity" of the earth
does not agree with [Gen 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017.md); but
because the altar was to set forth the nature of the simple earthly
soil, unaltered by the hand of man. The earth, which has been involved
in the curse of sin, is to be renewed and glorified into the kingdom of
God, not by sinful men, but by the gracious hand of God alone. Moreover,
Israel was not to erect the altar for its sacrifices in any place that
it might choose, but only in every place in which Jehovah should bring
His name to remembrance. וגו שׁם הזכּיר does not mean "to make the name
of the Lord remembered," i.e., to cause men to remember it; but to
establish a memorial of His name, i.e., to make a glorious revelation of
His divine nature, and thereby to consecrate the place into a holy soil
(cf. [Exo 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005).md), upon which Jehovah
would come to Israel and bless it. Lastly, the command not to go up to
the altar by steps ([Exo 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026).md) is
followed by the words, "that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon."
It was in the feeling of shame that the consciousness of sin first
manifested itself, and it was in the shame that the sin was chiefly
apparent ([Gen 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#007).md); hence the
nakedness was a disclosure of sin, through which the altar of God would
be desecrated, and for this reason it was forbidden to ascend to the
altar by steps. These directions with reference to the altar to be built
do not refer merely to the altar, which was built for the conclusion of
the covenant, nor are they at variance with the later instructions
respecting the one altar at the tabernacle, upon which all the
sacrifices were to be presented ([Lev
17:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#008.md); [Deu
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005)..md), nor are they merely
"provisional" but they lay the foundation for the future laws with
reference to the places of worship, though without restricting them to
one particular locality on the one hand, or allowing an unlimited number
of altars on the other. Hence "several places and altars are referred to
here, because, whilst the people were wandering in the desert, there
could be no fixed place for the tabernacle" (Riehm). But the erection of
the altar is unquestionably limited to every place which Jehovah
appointed for the purpose by a revelation. We are not to understand the
words, however, as referring merely to those places in which the
tabernacle and its altar were erected, and to the site of the future
temple (Sinai, Shilloh, and Jerusalem), but to all those places also
where altars were built and sacrifices offered on extraordinary
occasions, on account of God, - appearing there such, for example, as
Ebal ([Jos 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md) compared with [Deu
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#005).md), the rock in Ophrah ([Jdg
6:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025).md), and many other places
besides.
