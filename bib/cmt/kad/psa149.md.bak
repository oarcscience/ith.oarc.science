Hallelujah to the God of Victory of His People

This Psalm is also explained, as we have already seen on Psalms 147,
from the time of the restoration under Ezra and Nehemiah. The new song
to which it summons has the supreme power which Israel has attained over
the world of nations for its substance. As in [Psa
148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014.md) the fact that Jahve has raised
up a horn for His people is called תּהלּה לכל־חסדיו, so here in [Psa
149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009.md) the fact that Israel takes
vengeance upon the nations and their rulers is called הדר לכל־חסדיו. The
writer of the two Psalms is one and the same. The fathers are of opinion
that it is the wars and victories of the Maccabees that are here
prophetically spoken of. But the Psalm is sufficiently explicable from
the newly strengthened national self-consciousness of the period after
Cyrus. The stand-point is somewhere about the stand-point of the Book of
Esther. The New Testament spiritual church cannot pray as the Old
Testament national church here prays. Under the illusion that it might
be used as a prayer without any spiritual transmutation, [Psa
149:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md) has become the watchword of
the most horrible errors. It was by means of this Psalm that Caspar
Scloppius in his Classicum Belli Sacri, which, as Bakius says, is
written not with ink, but with blood, inflamed the Roman Catholic
princes to the Thirty Years' religious War. And in the Protestant Church
Thomas M׬nzer stirred up the War of the Peasants by means of this Psalm.
We see that the Christian cannot make such a Psalm directly his own
without disavowing the apostolic warning, "the weapons of our warfare
are not carnal" ([Co2 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004).md). The
praying Christian must there transpose the letter of this Psalm into the
spirit of the New Covenant; the Christian expositor, however, has to
ascertain the literal meaning of this portion of the Scriptures of the
Old Testament in its relation to contemporary history.

[Psalms 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 149:1</span></span>

A period, in which the church is renewing its youth and drawing nearer
to the form it is finally to assume, also of inward necessity puts forth
new songs. Such a new era has now dawned for the church of the saints,
the Israel that has remained faithful to its God and the faith of its
fathers. The Creator of Israel (עשׂיו, plural, with the plural suffix,
like עשׂי in [Job 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010.md), עשׂיך in [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md), cf. עשׂו in [Job
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019.md); according to Hupfeld and
Hitzig, cf. Ew. 256, b, Ges. 93, 9, singular; but aj, ajich, aw, are
always really plural suffixes) has shown that He is also Israel's
Preserver and the King of Zion, that He cannot leave the children of
Zion for any length of time under foreign dominion, and has heard the
sighing of the exiles ([Isa 63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md);
[Isa 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013).md). Therefore the church
newly appropriated by its God and King is to celebrate Him, whose Name
shines forth anew out of its history, with festive dance, timbrel, and
cithern. For (as the occasion, hitherto only hinted at, is now expressly
stated) Jahve takes a pleasure in His people; His wrath in comparison
with His mercy is only like a swiftly passing moment ([Isa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007)..md). The futures that follow state
that which is going on at the present time. ענוים is, as frequently, a
designation of the ecclesia pressa, which has hitherto, amidst patient
endurance of suffering, waited for God's own act of redemption. He now
adorns them with ישׁוּעה, help against the victory over the hostile
world; now the saints, hitherto enslaved and contemned, exult בכבוד, in
honour, or on account of the honour which vindicates them before the
world and is anew bestowed upon them (בּ of the reason, or, which is
more probable in connection with the boldness of the expression, of the
state and mood);

(Note: Such, too (with pomp, not "with an army"), is the meaning of μετὰ
δόξης in 1 Macc. 10:60; 14:4, 5, vid., Grimm in loc.))

they shout for joy upon their beds, upon which they have hitherto poured
forth their complaints over the present (cf. [Hos
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014).md), and ardently longed for a
better future ([Isa 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#008).md); for the bed
is the place of soliloquy ([Psa 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005).md),
and the tears shed there ([Psa 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007).md)
are turned into shouts of joy in the case of Israel.

[Psalms 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 149:6</span></span>

The glance is here directed to the future. The people of the present
have again, in their God, attained to a lofty self-consciousness, the
consciousness of their destiny, viz., to subjugate the whole world of
nations to the God of Israel. In the presence of the re-exaltation which
they have experienced their throat is full of words and songs exalting
Jahve (רוממות, plural of רומם, or, according to another reading, רומם,
[Psa 56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001) :17.md), and as servants of
this God, the rightful Lord of all the heathen ([Psa
82:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#008).md), they hold in their hand a
many-mouthed, i.e., many edged sword (vid., supra, p. 580), in order to
take the field on behalf of the true religion, as the Maccabees actually
did, not long after: ταῖς μὲν χερσὶν ἀγωνιζόμενοι ταῖς δὲ καρδίαις πρὸς
τὸν Θεόν εὐχόμενοι (2 Macc. 15:27). The meaning of [Psa
149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009.md) becomes a different one,
according as we take this line as co-ordinate or subordinate to what
goes before. Subordinated, it would imply the execution of a penal
jurisdiction over those whom they carried away, and כּתוּב would refer
to prescriptive facts such as are recorded in [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md); [Sa1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032). (Hitzig.md). But it would become
the religious lyric poet least of all to entertain such an unconditional
prospect of the execution of the conquered worldly rulers. There is just
as little ground for thinking of the judgment of extermination
pronounced upon the nations of Canaan, which was pronounced upon them
for an especial reason. If [Psa 149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009.md)
is taken as co-ordinate, the "written judgment" (Recht) consists in the
complete carrying out of the subjugation; and this is commended by the
perfectly valid parallel, [Isa 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014.md).
The poet, however, in connection with the expression "written," has
neither this nor that passage of Scripture in his mind, but the
testimony of the Law and of prophecy in general, that all kingdoms shall
become God's and His Christ's. Subjugation (and certainly not without
bloodshed) is the scriptural משׁפּט for the execution of which Jahve
makes use of His own nation. Because the God who thus vindicates Himself
is Israel's God, this subjugation of the world is הדר, splendour and
glory, to all who are in love devoted to Him. The glorifying of Jahve is
also the glorifying of Israel.
