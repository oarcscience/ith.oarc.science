### [2 Chronicles Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 31:1</span></span>

Destruction of the idols and the altars of the high places. Provisions
for the ordering and maintenance of the temple worship, and the
attendants upon it. - [Ch2 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md). At
the conclusion of the festival, all the Israelites who had been present
at the feast (הנּמצאים כּל־שׂראל to be understood as in [Ch2
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#021).md) went into the cities of Judah,
and destroyed all the idols, high places, and altars not only in Judah
and Benjamin (the southern kingdom), but also in Ephraim and Manasseh
(the domain of the ten tribes), utterly (עד־לככּה, cf. [Ch2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#010).md), and only then returned each to
his home; cf. [Kg2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004.md).

[2 Chronicles 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 31:2</span></span>

Restoration of order in the public worship, and of the temple revenues
and those of the priests. - [Ch2 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#002.md).
Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and Levites according to
their courses, each according to the measure of his service (cf. [Num
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#005.md), [Num
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#007).md), viz., the priests and Levites
(ולל לכה are subordinated to אישׁ in apposition by ל), for
burnt-offerings and thank-offerings, to serve (to wait upon the
worship), and to praise and thank (by song and instrumental music) in
the gates of the camp of Jahve, i.e., in the temple and court of the
priests; see on [Ch1 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018.md).

[Ch2 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#003.md)

And the portion of the king from his possession was for the
burnt-offerings, etc.; that is, the material for the burnt-offerings
which are commanded in Num 28 and 29 the king gave from his possessions,
which are enumerated in [Ch2 32:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md).

[Ch2 31:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004.md)

The priests and Levites received their maintenance from the first-fruits
([Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); [Num
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012.md); [Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002).md) and the tithes, which the people
had to pay from the produce of their cattle-breeding and their
agriculture ([Lev 27:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md), cf. with
[Num 18:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021).md). Hezekiah commanded the
people, viz., the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to give this portion to the
Levites and priests, that they might hold themselves firmly to the law
of Jahve, i.e., might devote themselves to the duties laid upon them by
the law, the attendance upon the worship, without being compelled to
labour for their subsistence; cf. [Neh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010.md).

[Ch2 31:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005.md)

When the word (the royal command) went forth (spread abroad), the
Israelites brought in abundance the first-fruits which had been assigned
to the priests ([Ch2 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#012)..md), and the
tithes, which were paid to the whole tribe of Levi ([Num
18:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021).md). ישׂראל בּני, [Ch2
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#006.md), are not the inhabitants of the
northern kingdom, but the Israelites who had emigrated from that kingdom
into Judah (as [Ch2 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#025.md); [Ch2
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016.md); [Ch2
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#017).md). קדשׁים מעשׂר, the tenth from
the holy gifts which were consecrated to Jahve, is surprising, since in
the law, [Num 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008.md)., it is not the
tenth of the consecrated gifts which is spoken of, but only הקּדשׁים
תרוּמות ([Num 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019).md). Proceeding upon
the assumption that all קדשׁים which were consecrated to Jahve were
given over to the tribe of Levi, Bertheau finds no correspondence
between the law and the statement of our verse, that the tenth of the
holy things was given, and points out that the lxx seem to have read
והקּשׁים ועז instead of קדשׁים m\`sr, without, however, himself deciding
in favour of that reading. But the lxx have rendered the words hmqdsym
קדשׁים קדשׁים by ἐπιδέκατα αἰγῶν, καὶ ἡγίασαν, and consequently cannot
have read ועז for מעשׂר, since in their translation epide'kata
corresponds to m\`sr. But the deviation of the statement in our verse
from the law, Num 18, arises partly from an incorrect or inexact
interpretation of the provisions of the law, [Num
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008.md). In the law, קדשׁים as such were
not assigned to the tribe of Levi, or more correctly to the priests
(Aaron and his sons), but only the לכל־קדשׁים תּרוּמות, the
heave-offerings of all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, i.e., the
pieces or parts of the sacrificial gifts of the Israelites which were
not burnt upon the altar, consequently the greater part of the meal, and
oil, and flesh of the oblations, the sin-offerings, the
trespass-offerings, and of the peace-offerings, the wave-breast and
wave-thigh, and whatever else was waved in wave-offerings; see on [Num
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008.md). These Therumoth of the
consecrated gifts are in our verse designated קדשׁים מעשׂר, because they
were only a fragment of that which was consecrated to the Lord, just as
the tenth was a fragment of the whole herd, and of the field produce.
The statement of our verse, therefore, differs only in expression from
the prescription of the law, but in substance it completely agrees with
it. ער ערמות ויּתּנוּ, and they made many heaps, i.e., they brought the
first-fruits and tithes in heaps.

[Ch2 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#007.md)

In the third month, consequently immediately at the end of the grain
harvest, they commenced to found the heaps (to lay the foundation of the
heaps); and in the seventh month, i.e., at the end of the fruit and wine
harvest, they completed them (the heaps). In the third month fell
pentecost, or the harvest feast; in the seventh, the feast of
tabernacles, after the gathering in of all the fruits. ליסּוד has
Daghesh in ס, because this verb in the imperf. assimilates its י like נ
to the second radical, and the infinitive is formed after the imperf.;
cf. Ew. 245, a.

[Ch2 31:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#008.md)

When Hezekiah and the priests saw these heaps, they praised the Lord and
His people Israel.

The employment and storing of these gifts, [Ch2
31:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#009.md). - [Ch2
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#009). Hezekiah questioned (ידרשׁ.md) the
priests and Levites concerning the heaps, i.e., not as to whether they
were sufficient for the support of the priests and Levites, but as to
how it happened that such masses had been heaped up. Thereupon Azariah
the high priest (hardly the Azariah mentioned [Ch2
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017.md), who forty years before tried to
prevent Uzziah from pressing into the holy place), of the house of
Zadok, answered him: Since they began to bring (לביא for להביא) the
heave-offerings into the house of the Lord, we have eaten and satisfied
ourselves, and have left in plenty. The infin. absol. והותר ושׂבוע אכול
stand in animated speech instead of the first pers. plur. perf. From the
same animation arises the construction of את־ההמון with הנּותר; for
"that which is left" signifies, and we have left this quantity here.

[Ch2 31:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#011.md)

Then the king commanded to prepare cells in the house of God for the
storing of the provisions. Whether new cells were built, or cells
already existing were prepared for this purpose, cannot be decided,
since הכין may signify either. Into these cells they brought the
תּרוּמה, which here denotes the first-fruits (cf. [Ch2
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005).md), the tithes, and the dedicated
things, בּאמוּנה, with fidelity, cf. [Ch2
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#009.md). עליהם, over them (the
first-fruits, etc.) the Levite Cononiah was set as ruler (inspector),
and his brother Shimei as second ruler (משׁנה).

[Ch2 31:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#013.md)

To them at their hand, i.e., as subordinate overseers, were given ten
Levites, who are enumerated by name. Of the names, Jehiel and Mahath
occur in [Ch2 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#012.md) and [Ch2
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#014.md). בּמפקד is translated by the
Vulg. ex imperio, better ex mandato Hizkiae. Azariah, the prince of the
house of God, is the high priest mentioned in [Ch2
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#010.md). - To the fourteen Levites named
in [Ch2 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#013.md) and [Ch2
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#014.md) was committed the oversight and
storing of the first-fruits, tithes, and consecrated gifts. Besides
these, there were special officers appointed for the distribution of
them. - In [Ch2 31:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#014.md) these are
treated of; [Ch2 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#014.md) dealing with
the distribution of the voluntary gifts of God, i.e., all which was
offered to God of spontaneous impulse ([Lev
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#038.md); [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017).md), to which the first-fruits and
tithes did not belong, they being assessments prescribed by the law.
Over the freewill offerings the Levite Kore, the doorkeeper towards the
east (see on [Ch1 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018).md), was set. His
duty was to give (distribute) "the heave-offerings of Jahve," i.e., that
portion of the thank-offerings which properly belonged to Jahve, and
which was transferred by Him to the priests ([Lev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#014.md); [Num
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#009).md), and the "most holy," i.e., that
part of the sin and trespass offerings ([Lev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010.md), [Lev
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#022.md); [Lev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006).md) and of the oblations ([Lev
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md), [Lev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#010).md) which was to be eaten by the
priests in the holy place.

[Ch2 31:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015.md)

At his hand (ידו על = מיּד, [Ch2
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#013).md), i.e., under his
superintendence, there were six Levites, enumerated by name, in the
priests' cities, with fidelity, "to give to their brethren in their
courses, as well to the great as to the small" (i.e., to the older and
to the younger), sc. the portion of the gifts received which fell to
each. By the brethren in their courses we are to understand not merely
the Levites dwelling in the priests' cities, who on account of their
youth or old age could not come into the temple, but also those who at
the time were not on duty, since the Levites' courses performed it by
turns, only some courses being on duty in the temple, while the others
were at home in the priests' cities. The object to לתת, [Ch2
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015.md), is not to be taken straightway
from the objects mentioned with לתת in [Ch2
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#014.md). For the most holy gifts could
not be sent to the priests' cities, but were consumed in the holy place,
i.e., in the temple. Nor can we confine לתת to the האלהים נדבות; for
since the gifts of the people, laid up in the cells, consisted in
first-fruits, tithes, and consecrated gifts ([Ch2
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#011).md), and special officers were
appointed for the storing and distribution of them, the business of
distribution could not consist merely in the giving out of freewill
offerings, but must have extended to all the offerings of the people.
When, therefore, it is said of the Levite Kore, in [Ch2
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#014.md), that he was appointed over the
freewill offerings, to distribute the heave-offerings and the most holy,
only his chief function is there mentioned, and the functions of the
officials associated with and subordinated to him in the priests' cities
are not to be confined to that. The object to לתת, [Ch2
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015.md), is consequently to be
determined by the whole context, and the arrangements which are assumed
as known from the law; i.e., we must embrace under that word the
distribution of the first-fruits, tithes, and consecrated gifts, of
which the Levites in the priests' cities were to receive their portion
according to the law. - In [Ch2 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#016.md),
the b

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

מחלקות אחיהם of [Ch2 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015.md) is more
closely defined by an exception: "Besides their catalogue of the men
(i.e., exclusive of those of the male sex catalogued by them) from three
years old and upward, namely, of all those who came into the house of
Jahve to the daily portion, for their service in their offices according
to their courses." בּיומו דּבר־יום signifies, in this connection, the
portion of the holy gifts coming to them for every day; cf. [Neh
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#023.md). The meaning of the verse is:
From those dwelling in the priests' cities were excluded those who had
come to perform service in the temple; and, indeed, not merely those
performing the service, but also their male children, who were
catalogued along with them if they were three years old and upward.
Thence it is clear that those entering upon their service took their
sons with them when they were three years old. These children ate in the
place of the sanctuary of the portion coming to their parents.

[Ch2 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#017.md)

[Ch2 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#017.md) contains a parenthetic
remark as to the catalogues. ואת, as nota accus., serves here to
emphasize the statement which is added as an elucidation (cf. Ew. 277,
d): "But concerning the catalogue of the priests, it was (taken,
prepared) according to the fathers'-houses; and the Levites, they were
from twenty years old and upwards in their offices in their courses."
All the duties were discharged by several courses. On the age fixed on,
see [Ch1 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#027.md).

[Ch2 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#018.md)

The connection and interpretation of this verse is doubtful. If we take
וּלחתיחשׂ as a continuation of ואת־התיהשׁ, [Ch2
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#017.md), it gives us no suitable sense.
The addition, "and also to every priest and Levite was a larger or
smaller portion given according to the catalogue" (Ramb., etc.), is
arbitrary, and does not fully express the בּ before כּל־טפּם. Berth., on
the other hand, correctly remarks, "After the parentheses in [Ch2
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#016.md) and [Ch2
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#017.md), וּלחתיחשׂ may be taken as a
continuation of לתת in [Ch2 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#016.md);"
but the word itself he translates wrongly thus: The men were in the
priests' cities, also to register their children, etc., disregarding the
construction of התיחשׂ with בּ. - From [Ch2
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#019.md), where the same construction
recurs, we learn how to interpret בּכל־ט התיחשׁ: the catalogue = those
registered in (of) all their children. According to this view, ולהתיחשׂ
corresponds to the לאחיהם, [Ch2 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015.md)
: to give to their brethren, ... and to the registered of all their
children, their wives, and their sons and daughters, viz., to the whole
multitude (sc., of the wives, sons, and daughters), i.e., as many of
them as there were. This interpretation of the לכל־קהל seems simpler
than with Schmidt and Ramb. to understand קהל to denote the coroporation
of priests. There was therefore no one forgotten or overlooked; "for
according to their fidelity ([Ch2
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015).md) did they show themselves holy
in regard to the holy," i.e., they acted in a holy manner with the holy
gifts, distributed them disinterestedly and impartially to all who had
any claim to them.

[Ch2 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#019.md)

And for the sons of Aaron, the priests, in the field of the districts of
their cities (cf. [Lev 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#034.md); [Num
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#005).md), in each city were men
(appointed) famous (בשׁמות נקּבוּ אשׁר, as in [Ch2
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015.md); see on [Ch1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#031).md), to give portions to each male
among the priests, and to all that were registered among the Levites. As
for the inhabitants of the priests' cities ([Ch2
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015).md), so also for the priests and
Levites dwelling in the pasture grounds of the priests' cities, were
special officers appointed to distribute the priestly revenues.

[Ch2 31:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#020.md)

The conclusion of this account. Thus did Hezekiah in all Judah, and
wrought in general that which was good and right and האמת before the
Lord his God; and in every work that he commenced for the service of the
house of God, and for the law and the commandment (i.e., for the
restoration of the law and its commands), to seek his God, he did it
with all his heart, and prospered.
