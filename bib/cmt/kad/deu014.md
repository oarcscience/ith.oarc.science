### [Deuteronomy Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 14:1</span></span>

The Israelites were not only to suffer no idolatry to rise up in their
midst, but in all their walk of life to show themselves as a holy nation
of the Lord; and neither to disfigure their bodies by passionate
expressions of sorrow for the dead ([Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md) and [Deu
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002).md), nor to defile themselves by
unclean food (vv. 3-21). Both of these were opposed to their calling. To
bring this to their mind, Moses introduces the laws which follow with
the words, "ye are children to the Lord your God." The divine sonship of
Israel was founded upon its election and calling as the holy nation of
Jehovah, which is regarded in the Old Testament not as generation by the
Spirit of God, but simply as an adoption springing out of the free love
of God, as the manifestation of paternal love on the part of Jehovah to
Israel, which binds the son to obedience, reverence, and childlike trust
towards a Creator and Father, who would train it up into a holy people.
The laws in [Deu 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md) are simply a
repetition of [Lev 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028.md) and [Lev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005.md). למת, with reference to, or on
account of, a dead person, is more expressive than לנפשׁ (for a soul) in
[Lev 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028.md). The reason assigned for
this command in [Deu 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md) (as in [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006).md) is simply an emphatic elucidation
of the first clause of [Deu 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md). (On
the substance of the verse, see [Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md).

[Deuteronomy 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 14:3</span></span>

With reference to food, the Israelites were to eat nothing whatever that
was abominable. In explanation of this prohibition, the laws of Lev 11
relating to clean and unclean animals are repeated in all essential
points in vv. 4-20 (for the exposition, see at Lev 11); also in [Deu
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md) the prohibition against eating
any animal that had fallen down dead (as in [Exo
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030.md) and [Lev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015).md), and against boiling a kid in
its mother's milk (as in [Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019).md).

[Deuteronomy 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 14:22</span></span>

As the Israelites were to sanctify their food, on the one hand,
positively by abstinence from everything unclean, so were they, on the
other hand, to do so negatively by delivering the tithes and firstlings
at the place where the Lord would cause His name to dwell, and by
holding festal meals on the occasion, and rejoicing there before Jehovah
their God. This law is introduced with the general precept, "Thou shalt
tithe all the produce of thy seed which groweth out of the field (יצא
construes with an accusative, as in [Gen
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#010), etc..md) year by year" (שׁנה שׁנה,
i.e., every year; cf. Ewald, 313, a.), which recalls the earlier laws
concerning the tithe ([Lev 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md), and
[Num 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021.md), [Num
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#026)..md), without repeating them one by
one, for the purpose of linking on the injunction to celebrate
sacrificial meals at the sanctuary from the tithes and firstlings. Moses
had already directed ([Deu 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006)..md) that
all the sacrificial meals should take place at the sanctuary, and had
then alluded to the sacrificial meals to be prepared from the tithes,
though only causally, because he intended to speak of them more fully
afterwards. This he does here, and includes the firstlings also,
inasmuch as the presentation of them was generally associated with that
of the tithes, though only causally, as he intends to revert to the
firstlings again, which he does in [Deu
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019.md). The connection between the
tithes of the fruits of the ground and the firstlings of the cattle
which were devoted to the sacrificial meals, and the tithes and
first-fruits which were to be delivered to the Levites and priests, we
have already discussed at Deut 12. The sacrificial meals were to be held
before the Lord, in the place where He caused His name to dwell (see at
[Deu 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005).md), that Israel might learn to
fear Jehovah its God always; not, however, as Schultz supposes, that by
the confession of its dependence upon Him it might accustom itself more
and more to the feeling of dependence. For the fear of the Lord is not
merely a feeling of dependence upon Him, but also includes the notion of
divine blessedness, which is the predominant idea here, as the
sacrificial meals were to furnish the occasion and object of the
rejoicing before the Lord. The true meaning therefore is, that Israel
might rejoice with holy reverence in the fellowship of its God.

[Deuteronomy 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 14:24</span></span>

In the land of Canaan, however, where the people would be scattered over
a great extent of country, there would be many for whom the fulfilment
of this command would be very difficult-would, in fact, appear almost
impossible. To meet this difficulty, permission was given for those who
lived at a great distance from the sanctuary to sell the tithes at home,
provided they could not convey them in kind, and then to spend the money
so obtained in the purchase of the things required for the sacrificial
meals at the place of the sanctuary. ממּך ירבּה כּי, "if the way be too
great (too far) for thee," etc., sc., for the delivery of the tithe. The
parenthetical clause, "if Jehovah thy God shall bless thee," hardly
means "if He shall extend thy territory" (Knobel), but if He shall bless
thee by plentiful produce from the field and the cattle.

[Deuteronomy 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 14:25</span></span>

"Turn it into money," lit., "give it up for silver," sc., the produce of
the tithe; "and bind the silver in thy hand," const. praegnans for "bind
it in a purse and take it in thy hand...and give the silver for all that
thy soul desireth, for oxen and small cattle, for wine and strong
drink," to hold a joyous meal, to which the Levite was also to be
invited (as in [Deu 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md), [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md), and [Deu
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#019).md).

[Deuteronomy 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 14:28</span></span>

Every third year, on the other hand, they were to separate the whole of
the tithe from the year's produce ("bring forth," sc., from the
granary), and leaven it in their gates (i.e., their towns), and feed the
Levites, the strangers, and the widows and orphans with it. They were
not to take it to the sanctuary, therefore; but according to [Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md)., after bringing it out, were to
make confession to the Lord of what they had done, and pray for His
blessing. "At the end of three years:" i.e., when the third year, namely
the civil year, which closed with the harvest (see at [Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016).md), had come to an end. This
regulation as to the time was founded upon the observance of the
sabbatical year, as we may see from [Deu
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md), where the seventh year is no
other than the sabbatical year. Twice, therefore, within the period of a
sabbatical year, namely in the third and sixth years, the tithe set
apart for a sacrificial meal was not to be eaten at the sanctuary, but
to be used in the different towns of the land in providing festal meals
for those who had no possessions, viz., the Levites, strangers, widows,
and orphans. Consequently this tithe cannot properly be called the
"third tithe," as it is by many of the Rabbins, but rather the "poor
tithe," as it was simply in the way of applying it that it differed from
the "second" (see Hottinger, de decimies, exerc. viii. pp. 182ff., and
my Archol. i. p. 339). As an encouragement to carry out these
instructions, Moses closes in [Deu
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#029.md) with an allusion to the divine
blessing which would follow their observance.
