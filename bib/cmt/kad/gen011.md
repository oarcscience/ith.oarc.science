### [Genesis Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 11:1</span></span>

"And the whole earth (i.e., the population of the earth, vid., [Gen
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019).md) was one lip and one kind of
words:" unius labii eorundemque verborum. The unity of language of the
whole human race follows from the unity of its descent from one human
pair (vid., [Gen 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#022).md). But as the
origin and formation of the races of mankind are beyond the limits of
empirical research, so no philology will ever be able to prove or deduce
the original unity of human speech from the languages which have been
historically preserved, however far comparative grammar may proceed in
establishing the genealogical relation of the languages of different
nations.

[Genesis 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 11:2</span></span>

As men multiplied they moved from the land of Ararat "eastward," or more
strictly to the south-east, and settled in a plain. בּקעה does not
denote a valley between mountain ranges, but a broad plain, πεδίον μέγα,
as Herodotus calls the neighbourhood of Babylon. There they resolved to
build an immense tower; and for this purpose they made bricks and burned
them thoroughly (לשׂרפה "to burning" serves to intensify the verb like
the inf. absol.), so that they became stone; whereas in the East
ordinary buildings are constructed of bricks of clay, simply dried in
the sun. For mortar they used asphalt, in which the neighbourhood of
Babylon abounds. From this material, which may still be seen in the
ruins of Babylon, they intended to build a city and a tower, whose top
should be in heaven, i.e., reach to the sky, to make to themselves a
name, that they might not be scattered over the whole earth. שׁם לו עשׂה
denotes, here and everywhere else, to establish a name, or reputation,
to set up a memorial ([Isa 63:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012.md), [Isa
63:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#014.md); [Jer
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#020), etc..md). The real motive
therefore was the desire for renown, and the object was to establish a
noted central point, which might serve to maintain their unity. The one
was just as ungodly as the other. For, according to the divine purpose,
men were to fill the earth, i.e., to spread over the whole earth, not
indeed to separate, but to maintain their inward unity notwithstanding
their dispersion. But the fact that they were afraid of dispersion is a
proof that the inward spiritual bond of unity and fellowship, not only
"the oneness of their God and their worship," but also the unity of
brotherly love, was already broken by sin. Consequently the undertaking,
dictated by pride, to preserve and consolidate by outward means the
unity which was inwardly lost, could not be successful, but could only
bring down the judgment of dispersion.

[Genesis 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 11:5</span></span>

"Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of
men had built" (the perfect בּנוּ refers to the building as one finished
up to a certain point). Jehovah's "coming down" is not the same here as
in [Exo 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#020.md); [Exo
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#005.md); [Num
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025.md); [Num
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#005.md), viz., the descent from heaven of
some visible symbol of His presence, but is an anthropomorphic
description of God's interposition in the actions of men, primarily a
"judicial cognizance of the actual fact," and then, [Gen
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#007.md), a judicial infliction of
punishment. The reason for the judgment is given in the word, i.e., the
sentence, which Jehovah pronounces upon the undertaking ([Gen
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#006).md): "Behold one people (עם lit.,
union, connected whole, from עמם to bind) and one language have they
all, and this (the building of this city and tower) is (only) the
beginning of their deeds; and now (sc., when they have finished this)
nothing will be impossible to them (מהם יבּצר לא lit., cut off from
them, prevented) which they purpose to do" (יזמוּ for יזמּוּ from זמם,
see [Gen 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#019).md). By the firm
establishment of an ungodly unity, the wickedness and audacity of men
would have led to fearful enterprises. But God determined, by confusing
their language, to prevent the heightening of sin through ungodly
association, and to frustrate their design. "Up" (הבה "go to," an
ironical imitation of the same expression in [Gen
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#003.md) and [Gen
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#004).md), "We will go down, and there
confound their language (on the plural, see [Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md); נבלה for נבלּה, Kal from בּלל,
like יזמו in [Gen 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006).md), that they may
not understand one another's speech." The execution of this divine
purpose is given in [Gen 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#008.md), in a
description of its consequences: "Jehovah scattered them abroad from
thence upon the face of all the earth, and they left off building the
city." We must not conclude from this, however, that the differences in
language were simply the result of the separation of the various tribes,
and that the latter arose from discord and strife; in which case the
confusion of tongues would be nothing more than "dissensio animorum, per
quam factum sit, ut qui turrem struebant distracti sint in contraria
studia et consilia" (Bitringa). Such a view not only does violence to
the words "that one may not discern (understand) the lip (language) of
the other," but is also at variance with the object of the narrative.
When it is stated, first of all, that God resolved to destroy the unity
of lips and words by a confusion of the lips, and then that He scattered
the men abroad, this act of divine judgment cannot be understood in any
other way, than that God deprived them of the ability to comprehend one
another, and thus effected their dispersion. The event itself cannot
have consisted merely in a change of the organs of speech, produced by
the omnipotence of God, whereby speakers were turned into stammerers who
were unintelligible to one another. This opinion, which is held by
Bitringa and Hoffmann, is neither reconcilable with the text, nor
tenable as a matter of fact. The differences, to which this event gave
rise, consisted not merely in variations of sound, such as might be
attributed to differences in the formation in the organs of speech (the
lip or tongue), but had a much deeper foundation in the human mind. If
language is the audible expression of emotions, conceptions, and
thoughts of the mind, the cause of the confusion or division of the one
human language into different national dialects must be sought in an
effect produced upon the human mind, by which the original unity of
emotion, conception, thought, and will was broken up. This inward unity
had no doubt been already disturbed by sin, but the disturbance had not
yet amounted to a perfect breach. This happened first of all in the
event recorded here, through a direct manifestation of divine power,
which caused the disturbance produced by sin in the unity of emotion,
thought, and will to issue in a diversity of language, and thus by a
miraculous suspension of mutual understanding frustrated the enterprise
by which men hoped to render dispersion and estrangement impossible.
More we cannot say in explanation of this miracle, which lies before us
in the great multiplicity and variety of tongues, since even those
languages which are genealogically related - for example, the Semitic
and Indo-Germanic - were no longer intelligible to the same people even
in the dim primeval age, whilst others are so fundamentally different
from one another, that hardly a trace remains of their original unity.
With the disappearance of unity the one original language was also lost,
so that neither in the Hebrew nor in any other language of history has
enough been preserved to enable us to form the least conception of its
character.

(Note: The opinion of the Rabbins and earlier theologians, that the
Hebrew was the primitive language, has been generally abandoned in
consequence of modern philological researches. The fact that the
biblical names handed down from the earliest times are of Hebrew
extraction proves nothing. With the gradual development and change of
language, the traditions with their names were cast into the mould of
existing dialects, without thereby affecting the truth of the tradition.
For as Drechster has said, "it makes no difference whether I say that
Adam's eldest son had a name corresponding to the name Cain from קנה, or
to the name Ctesias from κτᾶσθαι; the truth of the Thorah, which
presents us with the tradition handed down from the sons of Noah through
Shem to Abraham and Israel, is not a verbal, but a living tradition - is
not in the letter, but in the spirit.")

The primitive language is extinct, buried in the materials of the
languages of the nations, to rise again one day to eternal life in the
glorified form of the καιναὶ γλῶσσαι intelligible to all the redeemed,
when sin with its consequences is overcome and extinguished by the power
of grace. A type of pledge of this hope was given in the gift of tongues
on the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the Church on the first
Christian day of Pentecost, when the apostles, filled with the Holy
Ghost, spoke with other or new tongues of "the wonderful works of God,"
so that the people of every nation under heaven understood in their own
language ([Act 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001).md).

From the confusion of tongues the city received the name Babel (בּבל
i.e., confusion, contracted from בּלבּל from בּלל to confuse), according
to divine direction, though without any such intention on the part of
those who first gave the name, as a standing memorial of the judgment of
God which follows all the ungodly enterprises of the power of the world.

(Note: Such explanations of the name as "gate, or house, or fortress of
Bel," are all the less worthy of notice, because the derivation ἀπὸ τοῦ
Βήλου in the Etymol. magn., and in Persian and Nabatean works, is
founded upon the myth, that Bel was the founder of the city. And as this
myth is destitute of historical worth, so is also the legend that the
city was built by Semiramis, which may possibly have so much of history
as its basis, that this half-mythical queen extended and beautified the
city, just as Nebuchadnezzar added a new quarter, and a second fortress,
and strongly fortified it.)

Of this city considerable ruins still remain, including the remains of
an enormous tower, Birs Nimrud, which is regarded by the Arabs as the
tower of Babel that was destroyed by fire from heaven. Whether these
ruins have any historical connection with the tower of the confusion of
tongues, must remain, at least for the present, a matter of uncertainty.
With regard to the date of the event, we find from [Gen
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#010.md) that the division of the human
race occurred in the days of Peleg, who was born 100 years after the
flood. In 150 or 180 years, with a rapid succession of births, the
descendants of the three sons of Noah, who were already 100 years old
and married at the time of the flood, might have become quite numerous
enough to proceed to the erection of such a building. If we reckon, for
example, only four male and four female births as the average number to
each marriage, since it is evident from [Gen
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#012.md). that children were born as
early as the 30th or 35th year of their parent's age, the sixth
generation would be born by 150 years after the flood, and the human
race would number 12,288 males and as many females. Consequently there
would be at least about 30,000 people in the world at this time.

[Genesis 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 11:10</span></span>

After describing the division of the one family which sprang from the
three sons of Noah, into many nations scattered over the earth and
speaking different languages, the narrative returns to Shem, and traces
his descendants in a direct line to Terah the father of Abraham. The
first five members of this pedigree have already been given in the
genealogy of the Shemites; and in that case the object was to point out
the connection in which all the descendants of Eber stood to one
another. They are repeated here to show the direct descent of the
Terahites through Peleg from Shem, but more especially to follow the
chronological thread of the family line, which could not be given in the
genealogical tree without disturbing the uniformity of its plan. By the
statement in [Gen 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#010.md), that "Shem, a
hundred years old, begat Arphaxad two years after the flood," the
chronological date already given of Noah's age at the birth of his sons
([Gen 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#032).md) and at the commencement of
the flood ([Gen 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011).md) are made still
more definite. As the expression "after the flood" refers to the
commencement of the flood ([Gen 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#028).md),
and according to [Gen 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md) the flood
began in the second month, or near the beginning of the six hundredth
year of Noah's life, though the year 600 is given in [Gen
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#006.md) in round numbers, it is not
necessary to assume, as some do, in order to reconcile the difference
between our verse and [Gen 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#032.md), that
the number 500 in [Gen 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#032.md) stands as
a round number for 502. On the other hand, there can be no objection to
such an assumption. The different statements may be easily reconciled by
placing the birth of Shem at the end of the five hundredth year of
Noah's life, and the birth of Arphaxad at the end of the hundredth year
of that of Shem; in which case Shem would be just 99 years old when the
flood began, and would be fully 100 years old "two years after the
flood," that is to say, in the second year from the commencement of the
flood, when he begat Arphaxad. In this case the "two years after the
flood" are not to be added to the sum-total of the chronological data,
but are included in it. The table given here forms in a chronological
and material respect the direct continuation of the one in Gen 5, and
differs from it only in form, viz., by giving merely the length of life
of the different fathers before and after the birth of their sons,
without also summing up the whole number of their years as is the case
there, since this is superfluous for chronological purposes. But on
comparing the chronological data of the two tables, we find this very
important difference in the duration of life before and after the flood,
that the patriarchs after the flood lived upon an average only half the
number of years of those before it, and that with Peleg the average
duration of life was again reduced by one half. Whilst Noah with his 950
years belonged entirely to the old world, and Shem, who was born before
the flood, reached the age of 600, Arphaxad lived only 438 years, Salah
433, and Eber 464; and again, with Peleg the duration of life fell to
239 years, Reu also lived only 239 years, Serug 230, and Nahor not more
than 148. Here, then, we see that the two catastrophes, the flood and
the separation of the human race into nations, exerted a powerful
influence in shortening the duration of life; the former by altering the
climate of the earth, the latter by changing the habits of men. But
while the length of life diminished, the children were born
proportionally earlier. Shem begat his first-born in his hundredth year,
Arphaxad in the thirty-fifth, Salah in the thirtieth, and so on to
Terah, who had no children till his seventieth year; consequently the
human race, notwithstanding the shortening of life, increased with
sufficient rapidity to people the earth very soon after their
dispersion. There is nothing astonishing, therefore, in the
circumstance, that wherever Abraham went he found tribes, towns, and
kingdoms, though only 365 years had elapsed since the flood, when we
consider that eleven generations would have followed one another in that
time, and that, supposing every marriage to have been blessed with eight
children on an average (four male and four female), the eleventh
generation would contain 12,582,912 couples, or 25,165,824 individuals.
And is we reckon ten children as the average number, the eleventh
generation would contain 146,484,375 pairs, or 292,968,750 individuals.
In neither of these cases have we included such of the earlier
generations as would be still living, although their number would be by
no means inconsiderable, since nearly all the patriarchs from Shem to
Terah were alive at the time of Abram's migration. In [Gen
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#026.md) the genealogy closes, like that
in [Gen 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#032.md), with the names of three
sons of Terah, all of whom sustained an important relation to the
subsequent history, viz., Abram as the father of the chosen family,
Nahor as the ancestor of Rebekah (cf. [Gen
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#029.md) with [Gen
22:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#020).md), and Haran as the father of
Lot ([Gen 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#027).md).

[Genesis 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 11:27</span></span>

The genealogical data in [Gen 11:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#027.md)
prepare the way for the history of the patriarchs. The heading, "These
are the generations of Terah," belongs not merely to [Gen
11:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#027.md), but to the whole of the
following account of Abram, since it corresponds to "the generations" of
Ishmael and of Isaac in [Gen 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#012.md) and
[Gen 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#019.md). Of the three sons of
Terah, who are mentioned again in [Gen
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#027.md) to complete the plan of the
different Toledoth, such genealogical notices are given as are of
importance to the history of Abram and his family. According to the
regular plan of Genesis, the fact that Haran the youngest son of Terah
begat Lot, is mentioned first of all, because the latter went with Abram
to Canaan; and then the fact that he died before his father Terah,
because the link which would have connected Lot with his native land was
broken in consequence. "Before his father," פּני על lit., upon the face
of his father, so that he saw and survived his death. Ur of the Chaldees
is to be sought either in the "Ur nomine persicum castellum" of Ammian
(25, 8), between Hatra and Nisibis, near Arrapachitis, or in Orhoi,
Armenian Urrhai, the old name for Edessa, the modern Urfa. - [Gen
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#029.md). Abram and Nahor took wives from
their kindred. Abram married Sarai, his half-sister ([Gen
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012).md), of whom it is already related,
in anticipation of what follows, that she was barren. Nahor married
Milcah, the daughter of his brother Haran, who bore to him Bethuel, the
father of Rebekah ([Gen 22:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#022).md). The
reason why Iscah is mentioned is doubtful. For the rabbinical notion,
that Iscah is another name for Sarai, is irreconcilable with [Gen
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012.md), where Abram calls Sarai his
sister, daughter of his father, though not of his mother; on the other
hand, the circumstance that Sarai is introduced in [Gen
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md) merely as the daughter-in-law of
Terah, may be explained on the ground that she left Ur, not as his
daughter, but as the wife of his son Abram. A better hypothesis is that
of Ewald, that Iscah is mentioned because she was the wife of Lot; but
this is pure conjecture. According to [Gen
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md), Terah already prepared to leave
Ur of the Chaldees with Abram and Lot, and to remove to Canaan. In the
phrase "they went forth with them," the subject cannot be the
unmentioned members of the family, such as Nahor and his children;
though Nahor must also have gone to Haran, since it is called in [Gen
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md) the city of Nahor. For if he
accompanied them at this time, there is no perceptible reason why he
should not have been mentioned along with the rest. The nominative to
the verb must be Lot and Sarai, who went with Terah and Abram; so that
although Terah is placed at the head, Abram must have taken an active
part in the removal, or the resolution to remove. This does not,
however, necessitate the conclusion, that he had already been called by
God in Ur. Nor does [Gen 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007.md) require
any such assumption. For it is not stated there that God called Abram in
Ur, but only that He brought him out. But the simple fact of removing
from Ur might also be called a leading out, as a work of divine
superintendence and guidance, without a special call from God. It was in
Haran that Abram first received the divine call to go to Canaan ([Gen
12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001).md), when he left not only his
country and kindred, but also his father's house. Terah did not carry
out his intention to proceed to Canaan, but remained in Haran, in his
native country Mesopotamia, probably because he found there what he was
going to look for in the land of Canaan. Haran, more properly Charan,
חרן, is a place in north-western Mesopotamia, the ruins of which may
still be seen, a full day's journey to the south of Edessa (Gr. Κάῤῥαι,
Lat. Carrae), where Crassus fell when defeated by the Parthians. It was
a leading settlement of the Ssabians, who had a temple there dedicated
to the moon, which they traced back to Abraham. There Terah died at the
age of 205, or sixty years after the departure of Abram for Canaan; for,
according to [Gen 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#026.md), Terah was
seventy years old when Abram was born, and Abram was seventy-five years
old when he arrived in Canaan. When Stephen, therefore, placed the
removal of Abram from Haran to Canaan after the death of his father, he
merely inferred this from the fact, that the call of Abram (Gen 12) was
not mentioned till after the death of Terah had been noticed, taking the
order of the narrative as the order of events; whereas, according to the
plan of Genesis, the death of Terah is introduced here, because Abram
never met with his father again after leaving Haran, and there was
consequently nothing more to be related concerning him.

Character of the Patriarchal History

The dispersion of the descendants of the sons of Noah, who had now grown
into numerous families, was necessarily followed on the one hand by the
rise of a variety of nations, differing in language, manners, and
customs, and more and more estranged from one another; and on the other
by the expansion of the germs of idolatry, contained in the different
attitudes of these nations towards God, into the polytheistic religions
of heathenism, in which the glory of the immortal God was changed into
an image made like to mortal man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts,
and creeping things ([Rom 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023.md) cf.
Wis. 13-15). If God therefore would fulfil His promise, no more to smite
the earth with the curse of the destruction of every living thing
because of the sin of man ([Gen
8:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021).md), and yet would prevent the
moral corruption which worketh death from sweeping all before it; it was
necessary that by the side of these self-formed nations He should form a
nation for Himself, to be the recipient and preserver of His salvation,
and that in opposition to the rising kingdoms of the world He should
establish a kingdom for the living, saving fellowship of man with
Himself. The foundation for this was laid by God in the call and
separation of Abram from his people and his country, to make him, by
special guidance, the father of a nation from which the salvation of the
world should come. With the choice of Abram and revelation of God to man
assumed a select character, inasmuch as God manifested Himself
henceforth to Abram and his posterity alone as the author of salvation
and the guide to true life; whilst other nations were left to follow
their own course according to the powers conferred upon them, in order
that they might learn that in their way, and without fellowship with the
living God, it was impossible to find peace to the soul, and the true
blessedness of life (cf. [Act 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027).md).
But this exclusiveness contained from the very first the germ of
universalism. Abram was called, that through him all the families of the
earth might be blessed ([Gen 12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001).md).
Hence the new form which the divine guidance of the human race assumed
in the call of Abram was connected with the general development of the
world, - in the one hand, by the fact that Abram belonged to the family
of Shem, which Jehovah had blessed, and on the other, by his not being
called alone, but as a married man with his wife. But whilst, regarded
in this light, the continuity of the divine revelation was guaranteed,
as well as the plan of human development established in the creation
itself, the call of Abram introduced so far the commencement of a new
period, that to carry out the designs of God their very foundations
required to be renewed. Although, for example, the knowledge and worship
of the true God had been preserved in the families of Shem in a purer
form than among the remaining descendants of Noah, even in the house of
Terah and worship of God was corrupted by idolatry ([Jos
24:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002).md); and although Abram was to
become the father of the nation which God was about to form, yet his
wife was barren, and therefore, in the way of nature, a new family could
not be expected to spring from him.

As a perfectly new beginning, therefore, the patriarchal history assumed
the form of a family history, in which the grace of God prepared the
ground for the coming Israel. For the nation was to grow out of the
family, and in the lives of the patriarchs its character was to be
determined and its development foreshadowed. The early history consists
of three stages, which are indicated by the three patriarchs, peculiarly
so called, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and in the sons of Jacob the unity
of the chosen family was expanded into the twelve immediate fathers of
the nation. In the triple number of the patriarchs, the divine election
of the nation on the one hand, and the entire formation of the character
and guidance of the life of Israel on the other, were to attain to their
fullest typical manifestation. These two were the pivots, upon which all
the divine revelations made to the patriarchs, and all the guidance they
received, were made to turn. The revelations consisted almost
exclusively of promises; and so far as these promises were fulfilled in
the lives of the patriarchs, the fulfilments themselves were predictions
and pledges of the ultimate and complete fulfilment, reserved for a
distant, or for the most remote futurity. And the guidance vouchsafed
had for its object the calling forth of faith in response to the
promise, which should maintain itself amidst all the changes of this
earthly life. "A faith, which laid hold of the word of promise, and on
the strength of that word gave up the visible and present for the
invisible and future, was the fundamental characteristic of the
patriarchs" (Delitzsch). This faith Abram manifested and sustained by
great sacrifices, by enduring patience, and by self-denying by great
sacrifices, by enduring patience, and by self-denying obedience of such
a kind, that he thereby became the father of believers (πατὴρ πάντων τῶν
πιστευόντων, [Rom 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011).md). Isaac also
was strong in patience and hope; and Jacob wrestled in faith amidst
painful circumstances of various kinds, until he had secured the
blessing of the promise. "Abraham was a man of faith that works; Isaac,
of faith that endures; Jacob, of faith that wrestles" (Baumgarten). -
Thus, walking in faith, the patriarchs were types of faith for all the
families that should spring from them, and be blessed through them, and
ancestors of a nation which God had resolved to form according to the
election of His grace. For the election of God was not restricted to the
separation of Abram from the family of Shem, to be the father of the
nation which was destined to be the vehicle of salvation; it was also
manifest in the exclusion of Ishmael, whom Abram had begotten by the
will of man, through Hagar the handmaid of his wife, for the purpose of
securing the promised seed, and in the new life imparted to the womb of
the barren Sarai, and her consequent conception and birth of Isaac, the
son of promise. And lastly, it appeared still more manifestly in the
twin sons born by Rebekah to Isaac, of whom the first-born, Esau, was
rejected, and the younger, Jacob, chosen to be the heir of the promise;
and this choice, which was announced before their birth, was maintained
in spite of Isaac's plans, or that Jacob, and not Esau, received the
blessing of the promise. - All this occurred as a type for the future,
that Israel might know and lay to heart the fact, that bodily descent
from Abraham did not make a man a child of God, but that they alone were
children of God who laid hold of the divine promise in faith, and walked
in the steps of their forefather's faith (cf. [Rom
9:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006).md).

If we fix our eyes upon the method of the divine revelation, we find a
new beginning in this respect, that as soon as Abram is called, we read
of the appearing of God. It is true that from the very beginning God had
manifested Himself visibly to men; but in the olden time we read nothing
of appearances, because before the flood God had not withdrawn His
presence from the earth. Even to Noah He revealed Himself before the
flood as one who was present on the earth. But when He had established a
covenant with him after the flood, and thereby had assured the
continuance of the earth and of the human race, the direct
manifestations ceased, for God withdrew His visible presence from the
world; so that it was from heaven that the judgment fell upon the tower
of Babel, and even the call to Abram in his home in Haran was issued
through His word, that is to say, no doubt, through an inward monition.
But as soon as Abram had gone to Canaan, in obedience to the call of
God, Jehovah appeared to him there ([Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007).md). These appearances, which were
constantly repeated from that time forward, must have taken place from
heaven; for we read that Jehovah, after speaking with Abram and the
other patriarchs, "went away" ([Gen
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#033).md), or "went up" ([Gen
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#022.md); [Gen
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#013).md); and the patriarchs saw them,
sometimes while in a waking condition, in a form discernible to the
bodily senses, sometimes in visions, in a state of mental ecstasy, and
at other times in the form of a dream ([Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012)..md). On the form in which God
appeared, in most instances, nothing is related. But in [Gen
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md). it is stated that three men came
to Abram, one of whom is introduced as Jehovah, whilst the other two are
called angels ([Gen 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001).md). Beside
this, we frequently read of appearances of the "angel of Jehovah" ([Gen
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007.md); [Gen
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#011), etc..md), or of "Elohim," and the
"angel of Elohim" ([Gen 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017.md); [Gen
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#011), etc..md), which were repeated
throughout the whole of the Old Testament, and even occurred, though
only in vision, in the case of the prophet Zechariah. The appearances of
the angel of Jehovah (or Elohim) cannot have been essentially different
from those of Jehovah (or Elohim) Himself; for Jacob describes the
appearances of Jehovah at Bethel ([Gen
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013)..md) as an appearance of "the angel
of Elohim," and of "the God of Bethel" ([Gen
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#011.md), [Gen
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#013).md); and in his blessing on the
sons of Joseph ([Gen 48:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015).md), "The
God (Elohim) before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God
(Elohim) which fed me all my life long unto this day, the angel which
redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads," he places the angel of God
on a perfect equality with God, not only regarding Him as the Being to
whom he has been indebted for protection all his life long, but
entreating from Him a blessing upon his descendants.

The question arises, therefore, whether the angel of Jehovah, or of God,
was God Himself in one particular phase of His self-manifestation, or a
created angel of whom God made use as the organ of His self-revelation.

(Note: In the old Jewish synagogue the Angel of Jehovah was regarded as
the Shechinah, the indwelling of God in the world, i.e., the only
Mediator between God and the world, who bears in the Jewish theology the
name Metatron. The early Church regarded Him as the Logos, the second
person of the Deity; and only a few of the fathers, such as Augustine
and Jerome, thought of a created angel (vid., Hengstenberg, Christol.
vol. 3, app.). This view was adopted by many Romish theologians, by the
Socinians, Arminians, and others, and has been defended recently by
Hoffmann, whom Delitzsch, Kurtz, and others follow. But the opinion of
the early Church has been vindicated most thoroughly by Hengstenberg in
his Christology.)

The former appears to us to be the only scriptural view. For the
essential unity of the Angel of Jehovah with Jehovah Himself follows
indisputably from the following facts. In the first place, the Angel of
God identifies Himself with Jehovah and Elohim, by attributing to
Himself divine attributes and performing divine works: e.g., [Gen
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012.md), "Now I know that thou fearest
God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me"
(i.e., hast been willing to offer him up as a burnt sacrifice to God);
again (to Hagar) [Gen 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#010.md), "I will
multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for
multitude;" Gen 21, "I will make him a great nation,"-the very words
used by Elohim in [Gen 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020.md) with
reference to Ishmael, and by Jehovah in [Gen
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016.md); [Gen
15:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#004.md), with regard to Isaac; also
[Exo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md)., "I am the God of thy
father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: I
have surely seen the affliction of My people which are in Egypt, and
have heard their cry, and I am come down to deliver them" (cf. [Jdg
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001).md). In addition to this, He performs
miracles, consuming with fire the offering placed before Him by Gideon,
and the sacrifice prepared by Manoah, and ascending to haven in the
flame of the burnt-offering ([Jdg
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#021.md); [Jdg
13:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019).md).

Secondly, the Angel of God was recognised as God by those to whom He
appeared, on the one hand by their addressing Him as Adonai (i.e., the
Lord God; [Jdg 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015).md), declaring that
they had seen God, and fearing that they should die ([Gen
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013.md); [Exo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md); [Jdg
6:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022.md); [Jdg
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#022).md), and on the other hand by their
paying Him divine honour, offering sacrifices which He accepted, and
worshipping Him ([Jdg 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#020.md); [Jdg
13:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019.md), cf. [Gen
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005).md). The force of these facts has
been met by the assertion, that the ambassador perfectly represents the
person of the sender; and evidence of this is adduced not only from
Grecian literature, but from the Old Testament also, where the addresses
of the prophets often glide imperceptibly into the words of Jehovah,
whose instrument they are. But even if the address in [Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md), where the oath of the Angel of
Jehovah is accompanied by the words, "saith the Lord," and the words and
deeds of the Angel of God in certain other cases, might be explained in
this way, a created angel sent by God could never say, "I am the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," or by the acceptance of sacrifices and
adoration, encourage the presentation of divine honours to himself. How
utterly irreconcilable this fact is with the opinion that the Angel of
Jehovah was a created angel, is conclusively proved by [Rev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009.md), which is generally regarded as
perfectly corresponding to the account of the "Angel of Jehovah" of the
Old Testament. The angel of God, who shows the sacred seer the heavenly
Jerusalem, and who is supposed to say, "Behold, I come quickly" ([Rev
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#007).md), and "I am Alpha and Omega"
([Rev 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#013).md), refuses in the most
decided way the worship which John is about to present, and exclaims,
"See I am thy fellow-servant: worship God."

Thirdly, the Angel of Jehovah is also identified with Jehovah by the
sacred writers themselves, who call the Angel Jehovah without the least
reserve (cf. [Exo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md) and [Exo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#004.md), [Jdg
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#012.md) and [Jdg
6:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#014.md), but especially [Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019.md), where the Angel of Jehovah goes
before the host of the Israelites, just as Jehovah is said to do in [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021).md). - On the other hand, the
objection is raised, that ἄγγελος κυρίου in the New Testament, which is
confessedly the Greek rendering of יהוה מלאך, is always a created angel,
and for that reason cannot be the uncreated Logos or Son of God, since
the latter could not possibly have announced His own birth to the
shepherds at Bethlehem. But this important difference has been
overlooked, that according to Greek usage, ἄγγελος κυρίου denotes an
(any) angel of the Lord, whereas according to the rules of the Hebrew
language יהוה מלאך means the angel of the Lord; that in the New
Testament the angel who appears is always described as ἄγγελος κυρίου
without the article, and the definite article is only introduced in the
further course of the narrative to denote the angel whose appearance has
been already mentioned, whereas in the Old Testament it is always "the
Angel of Jehovah" who appears, and whenever the appearance of a created
angel is referred to, he is introduced first of all as "an angel" (vid.,
[Kg1 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#005.md) and [Kg1
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#007).md).

(Note: The force of this difference cannot be set aside by the objection
that the New Testament writers follow the usage of the Septuagint, where
יהוה מלאך is rendered ἄγγελος κυρίου. For neither in the New Testament
nor in the Alex. version of the Old is ἄγγελος κυρίου used as a proper
name; it is a simple appellative, as is apparent from the fact that in
every instance, in which further reference is made to an angel who has
appeared, he is called ὀ ἄγγελος, with or without κυρίου. All that the
Septuagint rendering proves, is that the translators supposed "the angel
of the Lord" to be a created angel; but it by no means follows that
their supposition is correct.)

At the same time, it does not follow from this use of the expression
Maleach Jehovah, that the (particular) angel of Jehovah was essentially
one with God, or that Maleach Jehovah always has the same signification;
for in [Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md) the priest is called
Maleach Jehovah, i.e., the messenger of the Lord. Who the messenger or
angel of Jehovah was, must be determined in each particular instance
from the connection of the passage; and where the context furnishes no
criterion, it must remain undecided. Consequently such passages as [Psa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md); [Psa
35:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md), etc., where the angel of
Jehovah is not more particularly described, or [Num
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#016.md), where the general term angel is
intentionally employed, or [Act 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030.md);
[Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md), and [Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md), where the words are general and
indefinite, furnish no evidence that the Angel of Jehovah, who
proclaimed Himself in His appearances as one with God, was not in
reality equal with God, unless we are to adopt as the rule for
interpreting Scripture the inverted principle, that clear and definite
statements are to be explained by those that are indefinite and obscure.

In attempting now to determine the connection between the appearance of
the Angel of Jehovah (or Elohim) and the appearance of Jehovah or Elohim
Himself, and to fix the precise meaning of the expression Maleach
Jehovah, we cannot make use, as recent opponents of the old Church view
have done, of the manifestation of God in Gen 18 and 19, and the
allusion to the great prince Michael in [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md), [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); just because neither the
appearance of Jehovah in the former instance, nor that of the archangel
Michael in the latter, is represented as an appearance of the Angel of
Jehovah. We must confine ourselves to the passages in which "the Angel
of Jehovah" is actually referred to. We will examine these, first of
all, for the purpose of obtaining a clear conception of the form in
which the Angel of Jehovah appeared. Gen 16, where He is mentioned for
the first time, contains no distinct statement as to His shape, but
produces on the whole the impression that He appeared to Hagar in a
human form, or one resembling that of man; since it was not till after
His departure that she drew the inference from His words, that Jehovah
had spoken with her. He came in the same form to Gideon, and sat under
the terebinth at Ophrah with a staff in His hand ([Jdg
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md) and [Jdg
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#021).md); also to Manoah's wife, for she
took Him to be a man of God, i.e., a prophet, whose appearance was like
that of the Angel of Jehovah ([Jdg
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006).md); and lastly, to Manoah himself,
who did not recognise Him at first, but discovered afterwards, from the
miracle which He wrought before his eyes, and from His miraculous ascent
in the flame of the altar, that He was the Angel of Jehovah ([Jdg
13:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#009).md). In other cases He revealed
Himself merely by calling and speaking from heaven, without those who
heard His voice perceiving any form at all; e.g., to Hagar, in [Gen
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017.md)., and to Abraham, [Gen
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#011.md). On the other hand, He appeared
to Moses ([Exo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002).md) in a flame of
fire, speaking to him from the burning bush, and to the people of Israel
in a pillar of cloud and fire ([Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019.md), cf. [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021)..md), without any angelic form
being visible in either case. Balaam He met in a human or angelic form,
with a drawn sword in His hand ([Num
22:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022).md). David saw Him by the
threshing-floor of Araunah, standing between heaven and earth, with the
sword drawn in His hand and stretched out over Jerusalem ([Ch1
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016).md); and He appeared to Zechariah
in a vision as a rider upon a red horse ([Zac
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009)..md). - From these varying forms of
appearance it is evident that the opinion that the Angel of the Lord was
a real angel, a divine manifestation, "not in the disguise of angel, but
through the actual appearance of an angel," is not in harmony with all
the statements of the Bible. The form of the Angel of Jehovah, which was
discernible by the senses, varied according to the purpose of the
appearance; and, apart from [Gen 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017.md)
and [Gen 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#011.md), we have a sufficient
proof that it was not a real angelic appearance, or the appearance of a
created angel, in the fact that in two instances it was not really an
angel at all, but a flame of fire and a shining cloud which formed the
earthly substratum of the revelation of God in the Angel of Jehovah
([Exo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md); [Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019).md), unless indeed we are to regard
natural phenomena as angels, without any scriptural warrant for doing
so.

(Note: The only passage that could be adduced in support of this, viz.,
[Psa 104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004.md), does not prove that God
makes natural objects, winds and flaming fire, into forms in which
heavenly spirits appear, or that He creates spirits out of them. Even if
we render this passage, with Delitzsch, "making His messengers of winds,
His servants of flaming fire," the allusion, as Delitzsch himself
observes, is not to the creation of angels; nor can the meaning be, that
God gives wind and fire to His angels as the material of their
appearance, and as it were of their self-incorporation. For עה,
constructed with two accusatives, the second of which expresses the
materia ex qua, is never met with in this sense, not even in [Ch2
4:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#018.md). For the greater part of the
temple furniture summed up in this passage, of which it is stated that
Solomon made them of gold, was composed of pure gold; and if some of the
things were merely covered with gold, the writer might easily apply the
same expression to this, because he had already given a more minute
account of their construction (e.g., [Gen
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#007).md). But we neither regard this
rendering of the psalm as in harmony with the context, nor assent to the
assertion that עשׂה with a double accusative, in the sense of making
into anything, is ungrammatical.)

These earthly substrata of the manifestation of the "Angel of Jehovah"
perfectly suffice to establish the conclusion, that the Angel of Jehovah
was only a peculiar form in which Jehovah Himself appeared, and which
differed from the manifestations of God described as appearances of
Jehovah simply in this, that in "the Angel of Jehovah," God or Jehovah
revealed Himself in a mode which was more easily discernible by human
senses, and exhibited in a guise of symbolical significance the design
of each particular manifestation. In the appearances of Jehovah no
reference is made to any form visible to the bodily eye, unless they
were through the medium of a vision or a dream, excepting in one
instance (Gen 18), where Jehovah and two angels come to Abraham in the
form of three men, and are entertained by him-a form of appearance
perfectly resembling the appearances of the Angel of Jehovah, but which
is not so described by the author, because in this case Jehovah does not
appear alone, but in the company of two angels, that "the Angel of
Jehovah" might not be regarded as a created angel.

But although there was no essential difference, but only a formal one,
between the appearing of Jehovah and the appearing of the Angel of
Jehovah, the distinction between Jehovah and the Angel of Jehovah points
to a distinction in the divine nature, to which even the Old Testament
contains several obvious allusions. The very name indicates such a
difference. יהוה מלאך (from לאך to work, from which come מלאכה the work,
opus, and מלאך, lit., he through whom a work is executed, but in
ordinary usage restricted to the idea of a messenger) denotes the person
through whom God works and appears. Beside these passages which
represent "the Angel of Jehovah" as one with Jehovah, there are others
in which the Angel distinguishes Himself from Jehovah; e.g., when He
gives emphasis to the oath by Himself as an oath by Jehovah, by adding
"said Jehovah" ([Gen 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016).md); when He
greets Gideon with the words, "Jehovah with thee, thou brave hero" ([Jdg
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#012).md); when He says to Manoah, "Though
thou constrainedst me, I would not eat of thy food; but if thou wilt
offer a burnt-offering to Jehovah, thou mayest offer it" ([Jdg
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016).md); for when He prays, in [Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md), "Jehovah Sabaoth, how long wilt
Thou not have mercy on Jerusalem?" (Compare also [Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md), where Jehovah is distinguished
from Jehovah.) Just as in these passages the Angel of Jehovah
distinguishes Himself personally from Jehovah, there are others in which
a distinction is drawn between a self-revealing side of the divine
nature, visible to men, and a hidden side, invisible to men, i.e.,
between the self-revealing and the hidden God. Thus, for example, not
only does Jehovah say of the Angel, whom He sends before Israel in the
pillar of cloud and fire, "My name is in Him," i.e., he reveals My
nature ([Exo 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021).md), but He also calls
Him פּני, "My face" ([Exo 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014).md); and
in reply to Moses' request to see His glory, He says "Thou canst not see
My face, for there shall no man see Me and live," and then causes His
glory to pass by Moses in such a way that he only sees His back, but not
His face ([Exo 33:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018).md). On the
strength of these expression, He in whom Jehovah manifested Himself to
His people as a Saviour is called in [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md), "the Angel of His face," and all
the guidance and protection of Israel are ascribed to Him. In accordance
with this, Malachi, the last prophet of the Old Testament, proclaims to
the people waiting for the manifestation of Jehovah, that is to say, for
the appearance of the Messiah predicted by former prophets, that the
Lord (האדון, i.e., God), the Angel of the covenant, will come to His
temple ([Gen 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001).md). This "Angel of the
covenant," or "Angel of the face," has appeared in Christ. The Angel of
Jehovah, therefore, was no other than the Logos, which not only "was
with God," but "was God," and in Jesus Christ "was made flesh" and "came
unto His own" ([Joh 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), [Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011).md); the only-begotten Son of God,
who was sent by the Father into the world, who, though one with the
Father, prayed to the Father (John 17), and who is even called "the
Apostle," ὀ ἀπόστολος, in [Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md).
From all this it is sufficiently obvious, that neither the title Angel
or Messenger of Jehovah, nor the fact that the Angel of Jehovah prayed
to Jehovah Sabaoth, furnishes any evidence against His essential unity
with Jehovah. That which is unfolded in perfect clearness in the New
Testament through the incarnation of the Son of God, was still veiled in
the Old Testament according to the wisdom apparent in the divine
training. The difference between Jehovah and the Angel of Jehovah is
generally hidden behind the unity of the two, and for the most part
Jehovah is referred to as He who chose Israel as His nation and kingdom,
and who would reveal Himself at some future time to His people in all
His glory; so that in the New Testament nearly all the manifestations of
Jehovah under the Old Covenant are referred to Christ, and regarded as
fulfilled through Him.

(Note: This is not a mere accommodation of Scripture, but the correct
interpretation of the obscure hints of the Old Testament by the light of
the fulfilment of the New. For not only is the Maleach Jehovah the
revealer of God, but Jehovah Himself is the revealed God and Saviour.
Just as in the history of the Old Testament there are not only
revelations of the Maleach Jehovah, but revelations of Jehovah also; so
in the prophecies the announcement of the Messiah, the sprout of David
and servant of Jehovah, is intermingled with the announcement of the
coming of Jehovah to glorify His people and perfect His kingdom.)
