Hallelujah to Him Who Raiseth Out of Low Estate

With this Psalm begins the Hallel, which is recited at the three great
feasts, at the feast of the Dedication (Chanucca) and at the new moons,
and not on New Year's day and the day of Atonement, because a cheerful
song of praise does not harmonize with the mournful solemnity of these
days. And they are recited only in fragments during the last days of the
Passover, for "my creatures, saith the Holy One, blessed be He, were
drowned in the sea, and ought ye to break out into songs of rejoicing?"
In the family celebration of the Passover night it is divided into two
parts, the one half, [Psa 113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md),
[Psa 114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md), being sung before the
repast, before the emptying of the second festal cup, and the other
half, [Psa 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md), after the repast,
after the filling of the fourth cup, to which the humnee'santes ([Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030.md); [Mar
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026).md) after the institution of the
Lord's Supper, which was connected with the fourth festal cup, may
refer. Paulus Burgensis styles [Psa
113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md) Alleluja Judaeorum magnum. This
designation is also frequently found elsewhere. But according to the
prevailing custom, [Psa 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md), and
more particularly [Psa 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md), are
called only Hallel, and Ps 136, with its "for His mercy endureth for
ever" repeated twenty-six times, bears the name of "the Great Hallel"
(הלּל הגּדול).

(Note: Vid., the tractate Sofrim, xviii. 2. Apart from the new moons, at
which the recitation of the Hallel κατ ̓ ἐξοχήν, i.e., Psalms 113-118,
is only according to custom (מנהג), not according to the law, the Hallel
was recited eighteen times a year during the continuance of the Temple
(and in Palestine even in the present day), viz., once at the Passover,
once at Shabuoth, eight times at Succoth, eight times at Chanucca (the
feast of the Dedication); and now in the Exile twenty-one times, because
the Passover and Succoth have received two feast-days and Shabuoth one
as an addition, viz., twice at the Passover, twice at Shabuoth, nine
times at Succoth. Instead of Hallel absolutely we also find the
appellation "the Egyptian Hallel" (הלּל המּצרי) for Psalms 113-118. The
ancient ritual only makes a distinction between this (Egyptian) Hallel
and the Great Hallel, Ps 136 (see there).)

A heaping up, without example elsewhere, of the so-called Chirek
compaginis is peculiar to [Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md). Gesenius and others call the
connecting vowels i and o (in proper names also u) the remains of old
case terminations; with the former the Arabic genitive termination is
compared, and with the latter the Arabic nominative termination. But in
opposition to this it has been rightly observed, that this i and o are
not attached to the dependent word (the genitive), but to the governing
word. According to the more probable view of Ewald, 211, i and o are
equivalent connecting vowels which mark the relation of the genitive
case, and are to be explained from the original oneness of the Semitic
and Indo-Germanic languages.

The i is found most frequently appended to the first member of the stat.
constr., and both to the masc., viz., in [Deu
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#016.md); [Zac
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017.md) (perhaps twice, vid., Khler in
loc.), and to the femin., viz., in [Gen
31:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#039.md); [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md); [Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md). [Lev
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042.md); [Psa
116:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001.md) hardly belong here. Then this i
is also frequently found when the second member of the stat. constr. has
a preposition, and this preposition is consequently in process of being
resolved: [Gen 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md); [Exo
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#006.md), [Oba
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003.md) ([Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016).md), [Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md); [Lam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md); [Psa
123:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md), and perhaps [Sol
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md). Also in the Chethb, [Jer
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023.md); [Jer
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md); [Eze
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#003.md). Thirdly, where a word stands
between the two notions that belong together according to the genitival
relation, and the stat. construct. is consequently really resolved: [Psa
101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005.md); [Isa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#016.md); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md). It is the same i which is found
in a great many proper names, both Israelitish, e.g., Gamaliel (benefit
of God), and Phoenician, e.g., Melchizedek, Hanniba‛al (the favour of
Baal), and is also added to many Hebrew prepositions, like בּלתּי (where
the i however can, according to the context, also be a pronominal
suffix), זוּלתי (where i can likewise be a suffix), מנּי (poetical). In
אפסי, on the other hand, the i is always a suffix. The tone of the i
only retreats in accordance with rhythmical rule (vid., [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004).md), otherwise i is always
accented. [Psa 112:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#008.md) shows how our
[Psa 113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md) in particular delights in
this ancient i, where it is even affixed to the infinitive as an
ornament, a thing which occurs nowhere else, so that להושׁיבי excites
the suspicion of being written in error for להושׁיבו.

Among those things which make God worthy to be praised the Psalm gives
prominence to the condescension of the infinitely exalted One towards
the lowly one. It is the lowliness of God lowering itself fro the
exaltation of the lowly which performs its utmost in the work of
redemption. Thus it becomes explicable that Mary in her Magnificat
breaks forth into the same strain with the song of Hannah (1 Sam. 2) and
this Psalm.

[Psalms 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 113:1</span></span>

The call, not limited by any addition as in [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md), or eve, after the manner of
[Psa 103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020.md)., extended over the earth,
is given to the whole of the true Israel that corresponds to its
election by grace and is faithful to its mission; and its designation by
"servants of Jahve" (Ps 69:37, cf. Ps 34:23), or even "servant of Jahve"
([Psa 136:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#022).md), has come into vogue
more especially through the second part of Isaiah. This Israel is called
upon to praise Jahve; for the praise and celebration of His Name, i.e.,
of His nature, which is disclosed by means of its manifestation, is a
principal element, yea, the proper ground and aim, of the service, and
shall finally become that which fills all time and all space. מהלּל
laudatum (est), is equivalent to ἀινετόν, laudabile (lxx, Vulgate), and
this does not differ greatly from laudetur. The predictive
interpretation laudabitur is opposed to the context (cf. moreover Kφhler
on [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 113:4</span></span>

This praiseworthiness is now confirmed. The opening reminds one of [Psa
99:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#002.md). Pasek stands between גוים and
יהוה in order to keep them apart. The totality of the nations is great,
but Jahve is raised above it; the heavens are glorious, but Jahve's
glory is exalted above them. It is not to be explained according to [Psa
148:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#013.md); but according to [Psa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md), 12, רם belongs to [Psa
113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004.md) too as predicate. He is the
incomparable One who has set up His throne in the height, but at the
same time directs His gaze deep downwards (expression according to Ges.
֗142, rem. 1) in the heavens and upon earth, i.e., nothing in all the
realm of the creatures that are beneath Him escapes His sight, and
nothing is so low that it remains unnoticed by Him; on the contrary, it
is just that which is lowly, as the following strophe presents to us in
a series of portraits so to speak, that is the special object of His
regard. The structure of [Psa 113:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md)
militates against the construction of "in the heavens and upon the
earth" with the interrogatory "who is like unto Jahve our God?" after
[Deu 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#024.md).

[Psalms 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 113:7</span></span>

The thoughts of [Psa 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md) and [Psa
113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md) are transplanted from the song
of Hannah. עפר, according to [Kg1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002.md), cf. [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md), is an emblem of lowly estate
(Hitzig), and אשׁפּת (from שׁפת) an emblem of the deepest poverty and
desertion; for in Syria and Palestine the man who is shut out from
society lies upon the mezbele (the dunghill or heap of ashes), by day
calling upon the passers-by for alms, and by night hiding himself in the
ashes that have been warmed by the sun (Job, ii. 152). The movement of
the thoughts in [Psa 113:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#008.md), as in [Psa
113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md), follows the model of the
epizeuxis. Together with the song of Hannah the poet has before his eye
Hannah's exaltation out of sorrow and reproach. He does not, however,
repeat the words of her song which have reference to this ([Sa1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005).md), but clothes his generalization
of her experience in his own language. If he intended that עקרת should
be understood out of the genitival relation after the form עטרת, why did
he not write מושׁיבי הבּית עקרה? הבּית would then be equivalent to
בּיתה, [Psa 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md). עקרת הבּית is the
expression for a woman who is a wife, and therefore housewife, הבּית
(בּעלת) נות, but yet not a mother. Such an one has no settled position
in the house of the husband, the firm bond is wanting in her
relationship to her husband. If God gives her children, He thereby makes
her then thoroughly at home and rooted-in in her position. In the
predicate notion אם הבּנים שׂמחה the definiteness attaches to the second
member of the string of words, as in [Gen
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#019.md); [Sa2
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030.md) (cf. the reverse instance in
[Jer 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#026.md), נבּאי השּׁקר, those
prophesying that which is false), therefore: a mother of the children.
The poet brings the matter so vividly before him, that he points as it
were with his finger to the children with which God blesses her.
