[Genesis 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 2:1</span></span>

The Sabbath of Creation. - "Thus the heavens and the earth were
finished, and all the host of them." צבא here denotes the totality of
the beings that fill the heaven and the earth: in other places (see
especially [Neh 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006).md) it is applied to
the host of heaven, i.e., the stars ([Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md); [Deu
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003).md), and according to a still later
representation, to the angels also ([Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019.md); [Isa
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021.md); [Neh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006.md); [Psa
148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002).md). These words of [Gen
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001.md) introduce the completion of the
work of creation, and give a greater definiteness to the announcement in
[Gen 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002.md), [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003.md), that on the seventh day God ended
the work which He had made, by ceasing to create, and blessing the day
and sanctifying it. The completion or finishing (כּלּה) of the work of
creation on the seventh day (not on the sixth, as the lxx, Sam., and
Syr. erroneously render it) can only be understood by regarding the
clauses [Gen 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002.md) and [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003.md), which are connected with ויכל by
ו consec. as containing the actual completion, i.e., by supposing the
completion to consist, negatively in the cessation of the work of
creation, and positively in the blessing and sanctifying of the seventh
day. The cessation itself formed part of the completion of the work (for
this meaning of שׁבת vid., [Gen 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022.md);
[Job 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001), etc..md). As a human artificer
completes his work just when he has brought it up to his ideal and
ceases to work upon it, so in an infinitely higher sense, God completed
the creation of the world with all its inhabitants by ceasing to produce
anything new, and entering into the rest of His all-sufficient eternal
Being, from which He had come forth, as it were, at and in the creation
of a world distinct from His own essence. Hence ceasing to create is
called resting (נוּח) in [Exo 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#011.md),
and being refreshed (ינּפשׁ) in [Exo
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#017.md). The rest into which God entered
after the creation was complete, had its own reality "in the reality of
the work of creation, in contrast with which the preservation of the
world, when once created, had the appearance of rest, though really a
continuous creation" (Ziegler, p. 27). This rest of the Creator was
indeed "the consequence of His self-satisfaction in the now united and
harmonious, though manifold whole;" but this self-satisfaction of God in
His creation, which we call His pleasure in His work, was also a
spiritual power, which streamed forth as a blessing upon the creation
itself, bringing it into the blessedness of the rest of God and filling
it with His peace. This constitutes the positive element in the
completion which God gave to the work of creation, by blessing and
sanctifying the seventh day, because on it He found rest from the work
which He by making (לעשׂות faciendo: cf. Ewald, 280d) had created. The
divine act of blessing was a real communication of powers of salvation,
grace, and peace; and sanctifying was not merely declaring holy, but
"communicating the attribute of holy," "placing in a living relation to
God, the Holy One, raising to a participation in the pure clear light of
the holiness of God." On קדושׁ see [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md). The blessing and sanctifying of
the seventh day had regard, no doubt, to the Sabbath, which Israel as
the people of God was afterwards to keep; but we are not to suppose that
the theocratic Sabbath was instituted here, or that the institution of
that Sabbath was transferred to the history of the creation. On the
contrary, the Sabbath of the Israelites had a deeper meaning, founded in
the nature and development of the created world, not for Israel only,
but for all mankind, or rather for the whole creation. As the whole
earthly creation is subject to the changes of time and the law of
temporal motion and development; so all creatures not only stand in need
of definite recurring periods of rest, for the sake of recruiting their
strength and gaining new power for further development, but they also
look forward to a time when all restlessness shall give place to the
blessed rest of the perfect consummation. To this rest the resting of
God (ἡ κατάπαυσις) points forward; and to this rest, this divine
σαββατισός ([Heb 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009).md), shall the whole
world, especially man, the head of the earthly creation, eventually
come. For this God ended His work by blessing and sanctifying the day
when the whole creation was complete. In connection with Heb. 4, some of
the fathers have called attention to the fact, that the account of the
seventh day is not summed up, like the others, with the formula "evening
was and morning was;" thus, e.g., Augustine writes at the close of his
confessions: dies septimus sine vespera est nec habet occasum, quia
sanctificasti eum ad permansionem sempiternam. But true as it is that
the Sabbath of God has no evening, and that the σαββατισμός, to which
the creature is to attain at the end of his course, will be bounded by
no evening, but last for ever; we must not, without further ground,
introduce this true and profound idea into the seventh creation-day. We
could only be warranted in adopting such an interpretation, and
understanding by the concluding day of the work of creation a period of
endless duration, on the supposition that the six preceding days were so
many periods in the world's history, which embraced the time from the
beginning of the creation to the final completion of its development.
But as the six creation-days, according to the words of the text, were
earthly days of ordinary duration, we must understand the seventh in the
same way; and that all the more, because in every passage, in which it
is mentioned as the foundation of the theocratic Sabbath, it is regarded
as an ordinary day ([Exo 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#011.md); [Exo
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#017).md). We must conclude, therefore,
that on the seventh day, on which God rested from His work, the world
also, with all its inhabitants, attained to the sacred rest of God; that
the κατάπαυσις and σαββατισμός of God were made a rest and sabbatic
festival for His creatures, especially for man; and that this day of
rest of the new created world, which the forefathers of our race
observed in paradise, as long as they continued in a state of innocence
and lived in blessed peace with their God and Creator, was the beginning
and type of the rest to which the creation, after it had fallen from
fellowship with God through the sin of man, received a promise that it
should once more be restored through redemption, at its final
consummation.

[Genesis 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 2:4</span></span>

The historical account of the world, which commences at the completion
of the work of creation, is introduced as the "History of the heavens
and the earth," and treats in three sections, (a) of the original
condition of man in paradise (Gen 2:5-25); (b) of the fall (Gen 3); (c)
of the division of the human race into two widely different families, so
far as concerns their relation to God (Gen 4).

The words, "these are the tholedoth of the heavens and the earth when
they were created," form the heading to what follows. This would never
have been disputed, had not preconceived opinions as to the composition
of Genesis obscured the vision of commentators. The fact that in every
other passage, in which the formula "these (and these) are the
tholedoth" occurs (viz., ten times in Genesis; also in [Num
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md); [Rut
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018.md); [Ch1
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#029).md), it is used as a heading, and
that in this passage the true meaning of תולדות precludes the
possibility of its being an appendix to what precedes, fully decides the
question. The word תולדות, which is only used in the plural, and never
occurs except in the construct state or with suffixes, is a Hiphil noun
from הוליד, and signifies literally the generation or posterity of any
one, then the development of these generations or of his descendants; in
other words, the history of those who are begotten or the account of
what happened to them and what they performed. In no instance whatever
is it the history of the birth or origin of the person named in the
genitive, but always the account of his family and life. According to
this use of the word, we cannot understand by the tholedoth of the
heavens and the earth the account of the origin of the universe, since
according to the biblical view the different things which make up the
heavens and the earth can neither be regarded as generations or products
of cosmogonic and geogonic evolutions, nor be classed together as the
posterity of the heavens and the earth. All the creatures in the heavens
and on earth were made by God, and called into being by His word,
notwithstanding the fact that He caused some of them to come forth from
the earth. Again, as the completion of the heavens and the earth with
all their host has already been described in [Gen
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001.md), we cannot understand by "the
heavens and the earth," in [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md),
the primary material of the universe in its elementary condition (in
which case the literal meaning of הוליד would be completely
relinquished, and the "tholedoth of the heavens and the earth" be
regarded as indicating this chaotic beginning as the first stage in a
series of productions), but the universe itself after the completion of
the creation, at the commencement of the historical development which is
subsequently described. This places its resemblance to the other
sections, commencing with "these are the generations," beyond dispute.
Just as the tholedoth of Noah, for example, do not mention his birth,
but contain his history and the birth of his sons; so the tholedoth of
the heavens and the earth do not describe the origin of the universe,
but what happened to the heavens and the earth after their creation.
בּהבּראם does not preclude this, though we cannot render it "after they
were created." For even if it were grammatically allowable to resolve
the participle into a pluperfect, the parallel expressions in [Gen
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md), would prevent our doing so. As
"the day of their creation" mentioned there, is not a day after the
creation of Adam, but the day on which he was created; the same words,
when occurring here, must also refer to a time when the heavens and the
earth were already created: and just as in [Gen
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md) the creation of the universe forms
the starting-point to the account of the development of the human race
through the generations of Adam, and is recapitulated for that reason;
so here the creation of the universe is mentioned as the starting-point
to the account of its historical development, because this account looks
back to particular points in the creation itself, and describes them
more minutely as the preliminaries to the subsequent course of the
world. הבראם is explained by the clause, "in the day that Jehovah God
created the earth and the heavens." Although this clause is closely
related to what follows, the simplicity of the account prevents our
regarding it as the protasis of a period, the apodosis of which does not
follow till [Gen 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005.md) or even [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md). The former is grammatically
impossible, because in [Gen 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005.md) the
noun stands first, and not the verb, as we should expect in such a case
(cf. [Gen 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#005).md). The latter is
grammatically tenable indeed, since [Gen
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005.md), [Gen
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#006.md), might be introduced into the main
sentence as conditional clauses; but it is not probable, inasmuch as we
should then have a parenthesis of most unnatural length. The clause must
therefore be regarded as forming part of the heading. There are two
points here that are worthy of notice: first, the unusual combination,
"earth and heaven," which only occurs in [Psa
148:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#013.md), and shows that the earth is
the scene of the history about to commence, which was of such momentous
importance to the whole world; and secondly, the introduction of the
name Jehovah in connection with Elohim. That the hypothesis, which
traces the interchange in the two names in Genesis to different
documents, does not suffice to explain the occurrence of Jehovah Elohim
in Gen 2:4-3:24, even the supporters of this hypothesis cannot possibly
deny. Not only is God called Elohim alone in the middle of this section,
viz., in the address to the serpent, a clear proof that the interchange
of the names has reference to their different significations; but the
use of the double name, which occurs here twenty times though rarely met
with elsewhere, is always significant. In the Pentateuch we only find it
in [Exo 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#030.md); in the other books of
the Old Testament, in [Sa2 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#022.md), [Sa2
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#025.md); [Ch1
17:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#016.md); [Ch2
6:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041.md); [Psa
84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md), [Psa
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md); and [Psa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md), where the order is reversed; and
in every instance it is used with peculiar emphasis, to give prominence
to the fact that Jehovah is truly Elohim, whilst in [Psa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md) the Psalmist advances from the
general name El and Elohim to Jehovah, as the personal name of the God
of Israel. In this section the combination Jehovah Elohim is expressive
of the fact, that Jehovah is God, or one with Elohim. Hence Elohim is
placed after Jehovah. For the constant use of the double name is not
intended to teach that Elohim who created the world was Jehovah, but
that Jehovah, who visited man in paradise, who punished him for the
transgression of His command, but gave him a promise of victory over the
tempter, was Elohim, the same God, who created the heavens and the
earth.

The two names may be distinguished thus: Elohim, the plural of אלוהּ,
which is only used in the loftier style of poetry, is an infinitive noun
from אלהּ to fear, and signifies awe, fear, then the object of fear, the
highest Being to be feared, like פּחד, which is used interchangeably
with it in [Gen 31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md), [Gen
31:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#053.md), and מורא in [Psa
76:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012.md) (cf. [Isa
8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012).md). The plural is not used for
the abstract, in the sense of divinity, but to express the notion of God
in the fulness and multiplicity of the divine powers. It is employed
both in a numerical, and also in an intensive sense, so that Elohim is
applied to the (many) gods of the heathen as well as to the one true
God, in whom the highest and absolute fulness of the divine essence is
contained. In this intensive sense Elohim depicts the one true God as
the infinitely great and exalted One, who created the heavens and the
earth, and who preserves and governs every creature. According to its
derivation, however, it is object rather than subject, so that in the
plural form the concrete unity of the personal God falls back behind the
wealth of the divine potencies which His being contains. In this sense,
indeed, both in Genesis and the later, poetical, books, Elohim is used
without the article, as a proper name for the true God, even in the
mouth of the heathen ([Sa1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#007).md); but
in other places, and here and there in Genesis, it occurs as an
appellative with the article, by which prominence is given to the
absoluteness of personality of God ([Gen
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md); [Gen
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009), etc..md).

The name Jehovah, on the other hand, was originally a proper name, and
according to the explanation given by God Himself to Moses ([Exo
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014).md), was formed from the
imperfect of the verb הוה = היה. God calls Himself אהיח אשׁר אהיה, then
more briefly אהיה, and then again, by changing the first person into the
third, יהוה. From the derivation of this name from the imperfect, it
follows that it was either pronounced יהוה or יהוה, and had come down
from the pre-Mosaic age; for the form הוה had been forced out of the
spoken language by היה even in Moses' time. The Masoretic pointing יהוה
belongs to a time when the Jews had long been afraid to utter this name
at all, and substituted אדני, the vowels of which therefore were placed
as Keri, the word to be read, under the Kethib יהוה, unless יהוה stood
in apposition to אדני, in which case the word was read אלהים and pointed
יהוה (a pure monstrosity.)

(Note: For a fuller discussion of the meaning and pronunciation of the
name Jehovah vid., Hengstenberg, Dissertations on the Pentateuch i. p.
213ff.; Oehler in Herzog's Cyclopaedia; and Hlemann in his Bibelstudien.
The last, in common with Stier and others, decides in favour of the
Masoretic pointing יהוה as giving the original pronunciation, chiefly on
the ground of [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md) and [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md), [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008.md); but the theological expansion ὁ
ὤν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος cannot be regarded as a philological proof
of the formation of יהוה by the fusion of הוה, הוה, יהי into one word.)

This custom, which sprang from a misinterpretation of [Lev
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016.md), appears to have originated
shortly after the captivity. Even in the canonical writings of this age
the name Jehovah was less and less employed, and in the Apocrypha and
the Septuagint version ὁ Κύριος (the Lord) is invariably substituted, a
custom in which the New Testament writers follow the lxx (vid., Oehler).

If we seek for the meaning of יהוה, the expression אהיה אשׁר אהיה, in
[Exo 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014.md), is neither to be rendered
ἔσομαι ὃς ἔσοαι (Aq., Theodt.), "I shall be that I shall be" (Luther),
nor "I shall be that which I will or am to be" (M. Baumgarten). Nor does
it mean, "He who will be because He is Himself, the God of the future"
(Hoffmann). For in names formed from the third person imperfect, the
imperfect is not a future, but an aorist. According to the fundamental
signification of the imperfect, names so formed point out a person as
distinguished by a frequently or constantly manifested quality, in other
words, they express a distinctive characteristic (vid., Ewald, 136; [Gen
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026.md); [Gen
27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036.md), also [Gen
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#011.md) and [Gen
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#006).md). The Vulgate gives it correctly:
ego sum qui sum, "I am who I am." "The repetition of the verb in the
same form, and connected only by the relative, signifies that the being
or act of the subject expressed in the verb is determined only by the
subject itself" (Hoffmann). The verb היה signifies "to be, to happen, to
become;" but as neither happening nor becoming is applicable to God, the
unchangeable, since the pantheistic idea of a becoming God is altogether
foreign to the Scriptures, we must retain the meaning "to be;" not
forgetting, however, that as the Divine Being is not a resting, or, so
to speak, a dead being, but is essentially living, displaying itself as
living, working upon creation, and moving in the world, the formation of
יהוה from the imperfect precludes the idea of abstract existence, and
points out the Divine Being as moving, pervading history, and
manifesting Himself in the world. So far then as the words אהיה אשר אהיה
are condensed into a proper name in יהוה, and God, therefore, "is He who
is," inasmuch as in His being, as historically manifested, He is the
self-determining one, the name Jehovah, which we have retained as being
naturalized in the ecclesiastical phraseology, though we are quite in
ignorance of its correct pronunciation, "includes both the absolute
independence of God in His historical movements," and "the absolute
constancy of God, or the fact that in everything, in both words and
deeds, He is essentially in harmony with Himself, remaining always
consistent" (Oehler). The "I am who am," therefore, is the absolute I,
the absolute personality, moving with unlimited freedom; and in
distinction from Elohim (the Being to be feared), He is the personal God
in His historical manifestation, in which the fulness of the Divine
Being unfolds itself to the world. This movement of the person God in
history, however, has reference to the realization of the great purpose
of the creation, viz., the salvation of man. Jehovah therefore is the
God of the history of salvation. This is not shown in the etymology of
the name, but in its historical expansion. It was as Jehovah that God
manifested Himself to Abram ([Gen
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007).md), when He made the covenant with
him; and as this name was neither derived from an attribute of God, nor
from a divine manifestation, we must trace its origin to a revelation
from God, and seek it in the declaration to Abram, "I am Jehovah." Just
as Jehovah here revealed Himself to Abram as the God who led him out of
Ur of the Chaldees, to give him the land of Canaan for a possession, and
thereby described Himself as the author of all the promises which Abram
received at his call, and which were renewed to him and to his
descendants, Isaac and Jacob; so did He reveal Himself to Moses (Ex 3)
as the God of his fathers, to fulfil His promise to their seed, the
people of Israel. Through these revelations Jehovah became a proper name
for the God, who was working out the salvation of fallen humanity; and
in this sense, not only is it used proleptically at the call of Abram
(Gen 12), but transferred to the primeval times, and applied to all the
manifestations and acts of God which had for their object the rescue of
the human race from its fall, as well as to the special plan inaugurated
in the call of Abram. The preparation commenced in paradise. To show
this, Moses has introduced the name Jehovah into the history in the
present chapter, and has indicated the identity of Jehovah with Elohim,
not only by the constant association of the two names, but also by the
fact that in the heading ([Exo 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#004).md) he
speaks of the creation described in Gen 1 as the work of Jehovah Elohim.

[Genesis 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 2:5</span></span>

The account in vv. 5-25 is not a second, complete and independent
history of the creation, nor does it contain mere appendices to the
account in Gen 1; but it describes the commencement of the history of
the human race. This commencement includes not only a complete account
of the creation of the first human pair, but a description of the place
which God prepared for their abode, the latter being of the highest
importance in relation to the self-determination of man, with its
momentous consequences to both earth and heaven. Even in the history of
the creation man takes precedence of all other creatures, as being
created in the image of God and appointed lord of all the earth, though
he is simply mentioned there as the last and highest link in the
creation. To this our present account is attached, describing with
greater minuteness the position of man in the creation, and explaining
the circumstances which exerted the greatest influence upon his
subsequent career. These circumstances were-the formation of man from
the dust of the earth and the divine breath of life; the tree of
knowledge in paradise; the formation of the woman, and the relation of
the woman to the man. Of these three elements, the first forms the
substratum to the other two. Hence the more exact account of the
creation of Adam is subordinated to, and inserted in, the description of
paradise ([Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md). In [Gen
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005.md) and [Gen
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#006.md), with which the narrative
commences, there is an evident allusion to paradise: "And as yet there
was (arose, grew) no shrub of the field upon the earth, and no herb of
the field sprouted; for Jehovah El had not caused it to rain upon the
earth, and there was no man to till the ground; and a mist arose from
the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground." היה in
parallelism with צמח means to become, to arise, to proceed. Although the
growth of the shrubs and sprouting of the herbs are represented here as
dependent upon the rain and the cultivation of the earth by man, we must
not understand the words as meaning that there was neither shrub nor
herb before the rain and dew, or before the creation of man, and so draw
the conclusion that the creation of the plants occurred either after or
contemporaneously with the creation of man, in direct contradiction to
[Gen 1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011.md). The creation of the
plants is not alluded to here at all, but simply the planting of the
garden in Eden. The growing of the shrubs and sprouting of the herbs is
different from the creation or first production of the vegetable
kingdom, and relates to the growing and sprouting of the plants and
germs which were called into existence by the creation, the natural
development of the plants as it had steadily proceeded ever since the
creation. This was dependent upon rain and human culture; their creation
was not. Moreover, the shrub and herb of the field do not embrace the
whole of the vegetable productions of the earth. It is not a fact that
the field is used in the second section in the same sense as the earth
in the first." שׂדה is not "the widespread plain of the earth, the broad
expanse of land," but a field of arable land, soil fit for cultivation,
which forms only a part of the "earth" or "ground." Even the "beast of
the field" in [Gen 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019.md) and [Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001.md) is not synonymous with the "beast
of the earth" in [Gen 1:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024.md), but is
a more restricted term, denoting only such animals as live upon the
field and are supported by its produce, whereas the "beast of the earth"
denotes all wild beasts as distinguished from tame cattle and reptiles.
In the same way, the "shrub of the field" consists of such shrubs and
tree-like productions of the cultivated land as man raises for the sake
of their fruit, and the "herb of the field," all seed-producing plants,
both corn and vegetables, which serve as food for man and beast. - The
mist (אד, vapour, which falls as rain, [Job
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#027).md) is correctly regarded by
Delitzsch as the creative beginning of the rain (המטיר) itself, from
which we may infer, therefore, that it rained before the flood.

[Genesis 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 2:7</span></span>

"Then Jehovah God formed man from dust of the ground." עפר is the
accusative of the material employed (Ewald and Gesenius). The Vav
consec. imperf. in [Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md), [Gen
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008.md), [Gen
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009.md), does not indicate the order of
time, or of thought; so that the meaning is not that God planted the
garden in Eden after He had created Adam, nor that He caused the trees
to grow after He had planted the garden and placed the man there. The
latter is opposed to [Gen 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#015.md); the
former is utterly improbable. The process of man's creation is described
minutely here, because it serves to explain his relation to God and to
the surrounding world. He was formed from dust (not de limo terrae, from
a clod of the earth, for עפר is not a solid mass, but the finest part of
the material of the earth), and into his nostril a breath of life was
breathed, by which he became an animated being. Hence the nature of man
consists of a material substance and an immaterial principle of life.
"The breath of life," i.e., breath producing life, does not denote the
spirit by which man is distinguished form the animals, or the soul of
man from that of the beasts, but only the life-breath (vid., [Kg1
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017).md). It is true, נשׁמה generally
signifies the human soul, but in [Gen
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#022.md) חיּים נשׁמת־רוּח is used of men
and animals both; and should any one explain this, on the ground that
the allusion is chiefly to men, and the animals are connected per
zeugma, or should he press the ruach attached, and deduce from this the
use of neshamah in relation to men and animals, there are several
passages in which neshamah is synonymous with ruach (e.g., [Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005.md); [Job
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md); [Job
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004).md), or חיים רוח applied to animals
([Gen 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#017.md); [Gen
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#015).md), or again neshamah used as
equivalent to nephesh (e.g., ([Jos
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040.md), cf. [Jos
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md), [Jos
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#030.md), [Jos
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#032).md). For neshamah, the breathing,
πνοή, is "the ruach in action" (Auberlen). Beside this, the man formed
from the dust became, through the breathing of the "breath of life," a
חיּה נפשׁ, an animated, and as such a living being; an expression which
is also applied to fishes, birds, and land animals ([Gen
1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020.md), [Gen
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024.md), [Gen
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#030).md), and there is no proof of
pre-eminence on the part of man. As חיּה נפשׁ, ψυχὴ ζῶσα, does not refer
to the soul merely, but to the whole man as an animated being, so נשׁמה
does not denote the spirit of man as distinguished from body and soul.
On the relation of the soul to the spirit of man nothing can be gathered
from this passage; the words, correctly interpreted, neither show that
the soul is an emanation, an exhalation of the human spirit, nor that
the soul was created before the spirit and merely received its life from
the latter. The formation of man from dust and the breathing of the
breath of life we must not understand in a mechanical sense, as if God
first of all constructed a human figure from dust, and then, by
breathing His breath of life into the clod of earth which he had shaped
into the form of a man, made it into a living being. The words are to be
understood θεοπρεπῶς. By an act of divine omnipotence man arose from the
dust; and in the same moment in which the dust, by virtue of creative
omnipotence, shaped itself into a human form, it was pervaded by the
divine breath of life, and created a living being, so that we cannot say
the body was earlier than the soul. The dust of the earth is merely the
earthly substratum, which was formed by the breath of life from God into
an animated, living, self-existent being. When it is said, "God breathed
into his nostril the breath of life," it is evident that this
description merely gives prominence to the peculiar sign of life, viz.,
breathing; since it is obvious, that what God breathed into man could
not be the air which man breathes; for it is not that which breathes,
but simply that which is breathed. Consequently, breathing into the
nostril can only mean, that "God, through His own breath, produced and
combined with the bodily form that principle of life, which was the
origin of all human life, and which constantly manifests its existence
in the breath inhaled and exhaled through the nose" (Delitzsch, Psychol.
p. 62). Breathing, however, is common to both man and beast; so that
this cannot be the sensuous analogon of the supersensuous spiritual
life, but simply the principle of the physical life of the soul.
Nevertheless the vital principle in man is different from that in the
animal, and the human soul from the soul of the beast. This difference
is indicated by the way in which man received the breath of life from
God, and so became a living soul. "The beasts arose at the creative word
of God, and no communication of the spirit is mentioned even in [Gen
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019.md); the origin of their soul was
coincident with that of their corporeality, and their life was merely
the individualization of the universal life, with which all matter was
filled in the beginning by the Spirit of God.

On the other hand, the human spirit is not a mere individualization of
the divine breath which breathed upon the material of the world, or of
the universal spirit of nature; nor is his body merely a production of
the earth when stimulated by the creative word of God. The earth does
not bring forth his body, but God Himself puts His hand to the work and
forms him; nor does the life already imparted to the world by the Spirit
of God individualize itself in him, but God breathes directly into the
nostrils of the one man, in the whole fulness of His personality, the
breath of life, that in a manner corresponding to the personality of God
he may become a living soul" (Delitzsch). This was the foundation of the
pre-eminence of man, of his likeness to God and his immortality; for by
this he was formed into a personal being, whose immaterial part was not
merely soul, but a soul breathed entirely by God, since spirit and soul
were created together through the inspiration of God. As the spiritual
nature of man is described simply by the act of breathing, which is
discernible by the senses, so the name which God gives him ([Gen
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#002).md) is founded upon the earthly side
of his being: Adam, from אדמה (adamah), earth, the earthly element, like
homo from humus, or from χαμά, χαμαί, χαμᾶθεν, to guard him from
self-exaltation, not from the red colour of his body, since this is not
a distinctive characteristic of man, but common to him and to many other
creatures. The name man (Mensch), on the other hand, from the Sanskrit
mânuscha, manuschja, from man to think, manas = mens, expresses the
spiritual inwardness of our nature.

[Genesis 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 2:8</span></span>

The abode, which God prepared for the first man, was a "garden in Eden,"
also called "the garden of Eden" ([Gen
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#015.md); [Gen
3:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#023.md); [Joe
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003).md), or Eden ([Isa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003.md); [Eze
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013.md); [Eze
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009)). Eden (עדן, i.e., delight.md) is
the proper name of a particular district, the situation of which is
described in [Gen 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010.md).; but it must
not be confounded with the Eden of Assyria ([Kg2
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#012), etc..md) and Coelesyria ([Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005).md), which is written with double
seghol. The garden (lit., a place hedged round) was to the east, i.e.,
in the eastern portion, and is generally called Paradise from the
Septuagint version, in which the word is rendered παράδεισος. This word,
according to Spiegel, was derived from the Zendic pairi-daêza, a hedging
round, and passed into the Hebrew in the form פּרדּס ([Sol
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013.md); [Ecc
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md); [Neh
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008).md), a park, probably through the
commercial relations which Solomon established with distant countries.
In the garden itself God caused all kinds of trees to grow out of the
earth; and among them were tow, which were called "the tree of life" and
"the tree of knowledge of good and evil," on account of their peculiar
significance in relation to man (see [Gen
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#016.md) and [Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022).md). הדּעת, an infinitive, as [Jer
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016.md) shows, has the article here
because the phrase ורע טוב דעת is regarded as one word, and in Jeremiah
from the nature of the predicate.

[Genesis 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 2:10</span></span>

"And there was a river going out of Eden, to water the garden; and from
thence it divided itself, and became four heads;" i.e., the stream took
its rise in Eden, flowed through the garden to water it, and on leaving
the garden was divided into four heads or beginnings of rivers, that is,
into four arms or separate streams. For this meaning of ראשׁים see [Eze
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#025.md); [Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019.md). Of the four rivers whose names
are given to show the geographical situation of paradise, the last two
are unquestionably Tigris and Euphrates. Hiddekel occurs in [Dan
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004.md) as the Hebrew name for Tigris; in
the inscriptions of Darius it is called Tigrâ (or the arrow, according
to Strabo, Pliny, and Curtius), from the Zendic tighra, pointed, sharp,
from which probably the meaning stormy (rapidus Tigris, Hor. Carm. 4,
14, 46) was derived. It flows before (קדמת), in front of, Assyria, not
to the east of Assyria; for the province of Assyria, which must be
intended here, was on the eastern side of the Tigris: moreover, neither
the meaning, "to the east of," nor the identity of קדמת and מקדם has
been, or can be, established from [Gen
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016.md); [Sa1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005.md), or [Eze
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011.md), which are the only other
passages in which the word occurs, as Ewald himself acknowledges.
P'rath, which was not more minutely described because it was so
generally known, is the Euphrates; in old Persian, Ufrâtu, according to
Delitzsch, or the good and fertile stream; Ufrâtu, according to
Spiegler, or the well-progressing stream. According to the present
condition of the soil, the sources of the Euphrates and Tigris are not
so closely connected that they could be regarded as the commencements of
a common stream which has ceased to exist. The main sources of the
Tigris, it is true, are only 2000 paces from the Euphrates, but they are
to the north of Diarbekr, in a range of mountains which is skirted on
three sides by the upper course of the Euphrates, and separates them
from this river. We must also look in the same country, the highlands of
Armenia, for the other two rivers, if the description of paradise
actually rests upon an ancient tradition, and is to be regarded as
something more than a mythical invention of the fancy. The name Phishon
sounds like the Phasis of the ancients, with which Reland supposed it to
be identical; and Chavilah like Cholchis, the well-known gold country of
the ancients. But the Φάσις ὁ Κόλχος (Herod. 4, 37, 45) takes its rise
in the Caucasus, and not in Armenia. A more probable conjecture,
therefore, points to the Cyrus of the ancients, which rises in Armenia,
flows northwards to a point not far from the eastern border of Colchis,
and then turns eastward in Iberia, from which it flows in a
south-easterly direction to the Caspian Sea. The expression, "which
compasseth the whole land of Chavilah," would apply very well to the
course of this river from the eastern border of Colchis; for סבב does
not necessarily signify to surround, but to pass through with different
turns, or to skirt in a semi-circular form, and Chavilah may have been
larger than modern Colchis. It is not a valid objection to this
explanation, that in every other place Chavilah is a district of
Southern Arabia. The identity of this Chavilah with the Chavilah of the
Joktanites ([Gen 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#029.md); [Gen
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#018.md); [Sa1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007).md) or of the Cushites ([Gen
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md); [Ch1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#009).md) is disproved not only by the
article used here, which distinguishes it from the other, but also by
the description of it as land where gold, bdolach, and the shohamstone
are found; a description neither requisite nor suitable in the case of
the Arabian Chavilah, since there productions are not to be met with
there. This characteristic evidently shows that the Chavilah mentioned
here was entirely distinct from the other, and a land altogether unknown
to the Iraelites.

What we are to understand by הבּדלח is uncertain. There is no certain
ground for the meaning "pearls," given in Saad. and the later Rabbins,
and adopted by Bochart and others. The rendering βδέλλα or βδέλλιον,
bdellium, a vegetable gum, of which Cioscorus says, οἱ δὲ μάδελκον οἱ δὲ
βολχὸν καλχὸν, and Pliny, "alii brochon appellant, alii malacham, alii
maldacon," is favoured by the similarity in the name; but, on the other
side, there is the fact that Pliny describes this gum as nigrum and
hadrobolon, and Dioscorus as ὑποπέλιον (blackish), which does not agree
with [Num 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#007.md), where the appearance
of the white grains of the manna is compared to that of bdolach. - The
stone shoham, according to most of the early versions, is probably the
beryl, which is most likely the stone intended by the lxx (ὁ λίθος ὁ
πράσινος, the leek-green stone), as Pliny, when speaking of beryls,
describes those as probatissimi, qui viriditatem puri maris imitantur;
but according to others it is the onyx or sardonyx (vid., Ges. s.v.).

(Note: The two productions furnish no proof that the Phishon is to be
sought for in India. The assertion that the name bdolach is Indian, is
quite unfounded, for it cannot be proved that madâlaka in Sanscrit is a
vegetable gum; nor has this been proved of madâra, which is possibly
related to it (cf. Lassen's indische Althk. 1, 290 note). Moreover,
Pliny speaks of Bactriana as the land "in qua Bdellium est
nominatissimum," although he adds, "nascitur et in Arabia Indiaque, et
Media ac Babylone;" and Isidorus says of the Bdella which comes from
India, "Sordida est et nigra et majori gleba," which, again, does not
agree with [Num 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#007.md). - The
Shoham-stone also is not necessarily associated with India; for although
Pliny says of the beryls, "India eos gignit, raro alibi repertos," he
also observes, "in nostro orbe aliquando circa Pontum inveniri
putantur.")

The Gihon (from גּוּח to break forth) is the Araxes, which rises in the
neighbourhood of the Euphrates, flows from west to east, joins the
Cyrus, and falls with it into the Caspian Sea. The name corresponds to
the Arabic Jaihun, a name given by the Arabians and Persians to several
large rivers. The land of Cush cannot, of course, be the later Cush, or
Ethiopia, but must be connected with the Asiatic Κοσσαία, which reached
to the Caucasus, and to which the Jews (of Shirwan) still give this
name. But even though these four streams do not now spring from one
source, but on the contrary their sources are separated by mountain
ranges, this fact does not prove that the narrative before us is a myth.
Along with or since the disappearance of paradise, that part of the
earth may have undergone such changes that the precise locality can no
longer be determined with certainty.

(Note: That the continents of our globe have undergone great changes
since the creation of the human race, is a truth sustained by the facts
of natural history and the earliest national traditions, and admitted by
the most celebrated naturalists. (See the collection of proofs made by
Keerl.) These changes must not be all attributed to the flood; many may
have occurred before and many after, like the catastrophe in which the
Dead Sea originated, without being recorded in history as this has been.
Still less must we interpret [Gen 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)
(compared with [Gen 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#025).md), as Fabri
and Keerl have done, as indicating a complete revolution of the globe,
or a geogonic process, by which the continents of the old world were
divided, and assumed their present physignomy.)

[Genesis 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 2:15</span></span>

After the preparation of the garden in Eden God placed the man there, to
dress it and to keep it. ינּיחהוּ not merely expresses removal thither,
but the fact that the man was placed there to lead a life of repose, not
indeed in inactivity, but in fulfilment of the course assigned him,
which was very different from the trouble and restlessness of the weary
toil into which he was plunged by sin. In paradise he was to dress
(colere) the garden; for the earth was meant to be tended and cultivated
by man, so that without human culture, plants and even the different
varieties of corn degenerate and grow wild. Cultivation therefore
preserved (שׁמר to keep) the divine plantation, not merely from injury
on the part of any evil power, either penetrating into, or already
existing in the creation, but also from running wild through natural
degeneracy. As nature was created for man, it was his vocation not only
to ennoble it by his work, to make it subservient to himself, but also
to raise it into the sphere of the spirit and further its glorification.
This applied not merely to the soil beyond the limits of paradise, but
to the garden itself, which, although the most perfect portion of the
terrestrial creation, was nevertheless susceptible of development, and
which was allotted to man, in order that by his care and culture he
might make it into a transparent mirror of the glory of the Creator. -
Here too the man was to commence his own spiritual development. To this
end God had planted two trees in the midst of the garden of Eden; the
one to train his spirit through the exercise of obedience to the word of
God, the other to transform his earthly nature into the spiritual
essence of eternal life. These trees received their names from their
relation to man, that is to say, from the effect which the eating of
their fruit was destined to produce upon human life and its development.
The fruit of the tree of life conferred the power of eternal, immortal
life; and the tree of knowledge was planted, to lead men to the
knowledge of good and evil. The knowledge of good and evil was no mere
experience of good and ill, but a moral element in that spiritual
development, through which the man created in the image of God was to
attain to the filling out of that nature, which had already been planned
in the likeness of God. For not to know what good and evil are, is a
sign of either the immaturity of infancy ([Deu
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#039).md), or the imbecility of age ([Sa2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#035).md); whereas the power to
distinguish good and evil is commended as the gift of a king ([Kg1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009).md) and the wisdom of angels ([Sa2
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#017).md), and in the highest sense is
ascribed to God Himself ([Gen 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#005.md),
[Gen 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022).md). Why then did God prohibit
man from eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, with the
threat that, as soon as he ate thereof, he would surely die? (The inf.
abs. before the finite verb intensifies the latter: vid., Ewald, 312a).
Are we to regard the tree as poisonous, and suppose that some fatal
property resided in the fruit? A supposition which so completely ignores
the ethical nature of sin is neither warranted by the antithesis, nor by
what is said in [Gen 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022.md) of the tree
of life, nor by the fact that the eating of the forbidden fruit was
actually the cause of death. Even in the case of the tree of life, the
power is not to be sought in the physical character of the fruit. No
earthly fruit possesses the power to give immortality to the life which
it helps to sustain. Life is not rooted in man's corporeal nature; it
was in his spiritual nature that it had its origin, and from this it
derives its stability and permanence also. It may, indeed, be brought to
an end through the destruction of the body; but it cannot be exalted to
perpetual duration, i.e., to immortality, through its preservation and
sustenance. And this applies quite as much to the original nature of
man, as to man after the fall. A body formed from earthly materials
could not be essentially immortal: it would of necessity either be
turned to earth, and fall into dust again, or be transformed by the
spirit into the immortality of the soul. The power which transforms
corporeality into immortality is spiritual in its nature, and could only
be imparted to the earthly tree or its fruit through the word of God,
through a special operation of the Spirit of God, an operation which we
can only picture to ourselves as sacramental in its character, rendering
earthly elements the receptacles and vehicles of celestial powers. God
had given such a sacramental nature and significance to the two trees in
the midst of the garden, that their fruit could and would produce
supersensual, mental, and spiritual effects upon the nature of the first
human pair. The tree of life was to impart the power of transformation
into eternal life. The tree of knowledge was to lead man to the
knowledge of good and evil; and, according to the divine intention, this
was to be attained through his not eating of its fruit. This end was to
be accomplished, not only by his discerning in the limit imposed by the
prohibition the difference between that which accorded with the will of
God and that which opposed it, but also by his coming eventually,
through obedience to the prohibition, to recognise the fact that all
that is opposed to the will of God is an evil to be avoided, and,
through voluntary resistance to such evil, to the full development of
the freedom of choice originally imparted to him into the actual freedom
of a deliberate and self-conscious choice of good. By obedience to the
divine will he would have attained to a godlike knowledge of good and
evil, i.e., to one in accordance with his own likeness to God. He would
have detected the evil in the approaching tempter; but instead of
yielding to it, he would have resisted it, and thus have made good his
own property acquired with consciousness and of his own free-will, and
in this way by proper self-determination would gradually have advanced
to the possession of the truest liberty. But as he failed to keep this
divinely appointed way, and ate the forbidden fruit in opposition to the
command of God, the power imparted by God to the fruit was manifested in
a different way. He learned the difference between good and evil from
his own guilty experience, and by receiving the evil into his own soul,
fell a victim to the threatened death. Thus through his own fault the
tree, which should have helped him to attain true freedom, brought
nothing but the sham liberty of sin, and with it death, and that without
any demoniacal power of destruction being conjured into the tree itself,
or any fatal poison being hidden in its fruit.

[Genesis 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 2:18</span></span>

Creation of the Woman. - As the creation of the man is introduced in
[Gen 1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md), with a divine decree, so
here that of the woman is preceded by the divine declaration, It is not
good that the man should be alone; I will make him כּנגדּו עזר, a help
of his like: "i.e., a helping being, in which, as soon as he sees it, he
may recognise himself" (Delitzsch). Of such a help the man stood in
need, in order that he might fulfil his calling, not only to perpetuate
and multiply his race, but to cultivate and govern the earth. To
indicate this, the general word כנגדו עזר is chosen, in which there is
an allusion to the relation of the sexes. To call out this want, God
brought the larger quadrupeds and birds to the man, "to see what he
would call them (לו lit., each one); and whatsoever the man might call
every living being should be its name." The time when this took place
must have been the sixth day, on which, according to [Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027.md), the man and woman were created:
and there is no difficulty in this, since it would not have required
much time to bring the animals to Adam to see what he would call them,
as the animals of paradise are all we have to think of; and the deep
sleep into which God caused the man to fall, till he had formed the
woman from his rib, need not have continued long. In [Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027.md) the creation of the woman is
linked with that of the man; but here the order of sequence is given,
because the creation of the woman formed a chronological incident in the
history of the human race, which commences with the creation of Adam.
The circumstance that in [Gen 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019.md) the
formation of the beasts and birds is connected with the creation of Adam
by the imperf. c. ו consec., constitutes to objection to the plan of
creation given in Gen 1. The arrangement may be explained on the
supposition, that the writer, who was about to describe the relation of
man to the beasts, went back to their creation, in the simple method of
the early Semitic historians, and placed this first instead of making it
subordinate; so that our modern style of expressing the same thought
would be simply this: "God brought to Adam the beasts which He had
formed."

(Note: A striking example of this style of narrative we find in [Kg1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013.md). First of all, the building and
completion of the temple are noticed several times in 1 Kings 6, and the
last time in connection with the year and month ([Kg1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009.md), [Kg1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#014.md), [Kg1
6:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#037).md); after that, the fact is
stated, that the royal palace was thirteen years in building; and then
the writer proceeds thus: "And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram from
Tyre...and he came to king Solomon, and did all his work; and made the
two pillars," etc. Now, if we were to understand the historical
preterite with consec., here, as giving the order of sequence, Solomon
would be made to send for the Tyrian artist, thirteen years after the
temple was finished, to come and prepare the pillars for the porch, and
all the vessels needed for the temple. But the writer merely expresses
in Semitic style the simple thought, that "Hiram, whom Solomon fetched
from Tyre, made the vessels," etc. Another instance we find in [Jdg
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#006)..md)

Moreover, the allusion is not to the creation of all the beasts, but
simply to that of the beasts living in the field (game and tame cattle),
and of the fowls of the air-to beasts, therefore, which had been formed
like man from the earth, and thus stood in a closer relation to him than
water animals or reptiles. For God brought the animals to Adam, to show
him the creatures which were formed to serve him, that He might see what
he would call them. Calling or naming presupposes acquaintance. Adam is
to become acquainted with the creatures, to learn their relation to him,
and by giving them names to prove himself their lord. God does not order
him to name them; but by bringing the beasts He gives him an opportunity
of developing that intellectual capacity which constitutes his
superiority to the animal world. "The man sees the animals, and thinks
of what they are and how they look; and these thoughts, in themselves
already inward words, take the form involuntarily of audible names,
which he utters to the beasts, and by which he places the impersonal
creatures in the first spiritual relation to himself, the personal
being" (Delitzsch). Language, as W. v. Humboldt says, is "the organ of
the inner being, or rather the inner being itself as it gradually
attains to inward knowledge and expression." It is merely thought cast
into articulate sounds or words. The thoughts of Adam with regard to the
animals, to which he gave expression in the names that he gave them, we
are not to regard as the mere results of reflection, or of abstraction
from merely outward peculiarities which affected the senses; but as a
deep and direct mental insight into the nature of the animals, which
penetrated far deeper than such knowledge as is the simple result of
reflecting and abstracting thought. The naming of the animals,
therefore, led to this result, that there was not found a help meet for
man. Before the creation of the woman we must regard the man (Adam) as
being "neither male, in the sense of complete sexual distinction, nor
androgynous as though both sexes were combined in the one individual
created at the first, but as created in anticipation of the future, with
a preponderant tendency, a male in simple potentiality, out of which
state he passed, the moment the woman stood by his side, when the mere
potentia became an actual antithesis" (Ziegler).

Then God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man ([Gen
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021).md). תּרדּמּה, a deep sleep, in
which all consciousness of the outer world and of one's own existence
vanishes. Sleep is an essential element in the nature of man as ordained
by God, and is quite as necessary for man as the interchange of day and
night for all nature besides. But this deep sleep was different from
natural sleep, and God caused it to fall upon the man by day, that He
might create the woman out of him. "Everything out of which something
new is to spring, sinks first of all into such a sleep" (Ziegler). צלע
means the side, and, as a portion of the human body, the rib. The
correctness of this meaning, which is given by all the ancient versions,
is evident from the words, "God took one of his צלעות," which show that
the man had several of them. "And closed up flesh in the place thereof;"
i.e., closed the gap which had been made, with flesh which He put in the
place of the rib. The woman was created, not of dust of the earth, but
from a rib of Adam, because she was formed for an inseparable unity and
fellowship of life with the man, and the mode of her creation was to lay
the actual foundation for the moral ordinance of marriage. As the moral
idea of the unity of the human race required that man should not be
created as a genus or plurality,

(Note: Natural science can only demonstrate the unity of the human race,
not the descent of all men from one pair, though many naturalists
question and deny even the former, but without any warrant from
anthropological facts. For every thorough investigation leads to the
conclusion arrived at by the latest inquirer in this department, Th.
Waitz, that not only are there no facts in natural history which
preclude the unity of the various races of men, and fewer difficulties
in the way of this assumption than in that of the opposite theory of
specific diversities; but even in mental respects there are no specific
differences within the limits of the race. Delitzsch has given an
admirable summary of the proofs of unity. "That the races of men," he
says, "are not species of one genus, but varieties of one species, is
confirmed by the agreement in the physiological and pathological
phenomena in them all, by the similarity in the anatomical structure, in
the fundamental powers and traits of the mind, in the limits to the
duration of life, in the normal temperature of the body and the average
rate of pulsation, in the duration of pregnancy, and in the unrestricted
fruitfulness of marriages between the various races.")

so the moral relation of the two persons establishing the unity of the
race required that man should be created first, and then the woman from
the body of the man. By this the priority and superiority of the man,
and the dependence of the woman upon the man, are established as an
ordinance of divine creation. This ordinance of God forms the root of
that tender love with which the man loves the woman as himself, and by
which marriage becomes a type of the fellowship of love and life, which
exists between the Lord and His Church ([Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032).md). If the fact that the woman was
formed from a rib, and not from any other part of the man, is
significant; all that we can find in this is, that the woman was made to
stand as a helpmate by the side of the man, not that there was any
allusion to conjugal love as founded in the heart; for the text does not
speak of the rib as one which was next the heart. The word בּנה is
worthy of note: from the rib of the man God builds the female, through
whom the human race is to be built up by the male ([Gen
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#002.md); [Gen
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#003).md).

[Genesis 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023.md)

The design of God in the creation of the woman is perceived by Adam, as
soon as he awakes, when the woman is brought to him by God. Without a
revelation from God, he discovers in the woman "bone of his bones and
flesh of his flesh." The words, "this is now (הפּעם lit., this time)
bone of my bones," etc., are expressive of joyous astonishment at the
suitable helpmate, whose relation to himself he describes in the words,
"she shall be called Woman, for she is taken out of man." אשּׁה is well
rendered by Luther, "Mnnin" (a female man), like the old Latin vira from
vir. The words which follow, "therefore shall a man leave his father and
his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall become one
flesh," are not to be regarded as Adam's, first on account of the
על־כּן, which is always used in Genesis, with the exception of [Gen
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#006.md); [Gen
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021.md), to introduce remarks of the
writer, either of an archaeological or of a historical character, and
secondly, because, even if Adam on seeing the woman had given prophetic
utterance to his perception of the mystery of marriage, he could not
with propriety have spoken of father and mother. They are the words of
Moses, written to bring out the truth embodied in the fact recorded as a
divinely appointed result, to exhibit marriage as the deepest corporeal
and spiritual unity of man and woman, and to hold up monogamy before the
eyes of the people of Israel as the form of marriage ordained by God.
But as the words of Moses, they are the utterance of divine revelation;
and Christ could quote them, therefore, as the word of God ([Mat
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005).md). By the leaving of father and
mother, which applies to the woman as well as to the man, the conjugal
union is shown to be a spiritual oneness, a vital communion of heart as
well as of body, in which it finds its consummation. This union is of a
totally different nature from that of parents and children; hence
marriage between parents and children is entirely opposed to the
ordinance of God. Marriage itself, notwithstanding the fact that it
demands the leaving of father and mother, is a holy appointment of God;
hence celibacy is not a higher or holier state, and the relation of the
sexes for a pure and holy man is a pure and holy relation. This is shown
in [Gen 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#025.md) : "They were both naked
ערוּמּים, with dagesh in the מ, is an abbreviated form of עירמּים [Gen
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#007), from עוּר to strip.md), the man and
his wife, and were not ashamed." Their bodies were sanctified by the
spirit, which animated them. Shame entered first with sin, which
destroyed the normal relation of the spirit to the body, exciting
tendencies and lusts which warred against the soul, and turning the
sacred ordinance of God into sensual impulses and the lust of the flesh.
