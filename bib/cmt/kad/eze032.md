### [Ezekiel Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 32:0</span></span>

Lamentations over the Ruin of Pharaoh and His People

The chapter contains two lamentations composed at different times: the
first, in vv. 1-16, relating to the fall of Pharaoh, which rests upon
the prophecy contained in Ezekiel 29:1-16 and [Eze
30:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020.md); the second, in vv. 17-32, in
which the prophecy concerning the casting down of this imperial power
into hell ([Eze 31:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014).md) is worked
out in elegiac form.

[Ezekiel 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md)

Lamentation over the King of Egypt

Pharaoh, a sea-monster, is drawn by the nations out of his waters with
the net of God, and cast out upon the earth. His flesh is given to the
birds and beasts of prey to devour, and the earth is saturated with his
blood ([Eze 32:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002).md). At his
destruction the lights of heaven lose their brightness, and all the
nations will be amazed thereat ([Eze
32:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007).md). The king of Babel will come
upon Egypt, will destroy both man and beast, and will make the land a
desert ([Eze 32:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#011).md). - The date
given in [Eze 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md) - "In the twelfth
year, in the twelfth month, on the first of the month, the word of
Jehovah came to me, saying" - agrees entirely with the relation in which
the substance of the ode itself stands to the prophecies belonging to
the tenth and eleventh years in Ezekiel 29:1-16 and [Eze
30:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020.md); whereas the different date
found in the Septuagint cannot come into consideration for a moment.

[Eze 32:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md)

The destruction of Pharoah. - [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md). Son of man, raise a lamentation
over Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and say to him, Thou wast compared to a
young lion among the nations, and yet wast like a dragon in the sea;
thou didst break forth in thy streams, and didst trouble the waters with
thy feet, and didst tread their streams. [Eze
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#003.md). Thus saith the Lord Jehovah,
Therefore will I spread out my net over thee in the midst of many
nations, that they may draw thee up in my yarn; [Eze
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#004.md). And will cast thee upon the
land, hurl thee upon the surface of the field, and will cause all the
birds of the heaven to settle upon thee, and the beasts of the whole
earth to satisfy themselves with thee. [Eze
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#005.md). Thy flesh will I put upon the
mountains, and fill the valleys with thy funeral heap. [Eze
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#006.md). I will saturate the earth with
thine outflow of thy blood even to the mountains, and the low places
shall become full of thee. - This lamentation begins, like others, with
a picture of the glory of the fallen king. Hitzig objects to the
ordinary explanation of the words כּפיר גּוים נדמיתה, λέοντι ἐθνῶν
ὡμοιώθης (lxx), leoni gentium assimilatus es (Vulg.), on the ground that
the frequently recurring נדמה would only have this meaning in the
present passage, and that נמשׁל, which would then be synonymous, is
construed in three other ways, but not with the nominative. For these
reasons he adopts the rendering, "lion of the nations, thou belongest to
death." But it would be contrary to the analogy of all the קינות to
commence the lamentation with such a threat; and Hitzig's objections to
the ordinary rendering of the words will not bear examination. The
circumstance that the Niphal נדמה is only met with here in the sense of
ὁμοιοῦσθαι, proves nothing; for דּמה has this meaning in the Kal, Piel,
and Hithpael, and the construction of the Niphal with the accusative
(not nominative, as Hitzig says) may be derived without difficulty from
the construction of the synonymous נמשׁל with כ. But what is decisive in
favour of this rendering is the fact that the following clause is
connected by means of the adversative ואתּה (but thou), which shows that
the comparison of Pharaoh to a תּנּים forms an antithesis to the clause
in which he is compared to a young lion. If נדמית 'כּפיר ג contained a
declaration of destruction, not only would this antithesis be lost, but
the words addressed to it as a lion of the nations would float in the
air and be used without any intelligible meaning. The lion is a
figurative representation of a powerful and victorious ruler; and כּפיר
גּוים is really equivalent to אל גּוים in [Eze
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md).

Pharaoh was regarded as a mighty conqueror of the nations, "though he
was rather to be compared to the crocodile, which stirs up the streams,
the fresh waters, and life-giving springs of the nations most
perniciously with mouth and feet, and renders turbid all that is pure"
(Ewald). תּנּים, as in [Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md).
Ewald and Hitzig have taken offence at the words תּגח בּנהרתיך, "thou
didst break forth in thy streams," and alter בּנהרתיך retla d into
בּנחרתיך, with thy nostrils ([Job
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#012).md); but they have not considered
that תּגח would be quite out of place with such an alteration, as גּיח
in both the Kal and Hiphil ([Jdg
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#033).md) has only the intransitive
meaning to break out. The thought is simply this: the crocodile lies in
the sea, then breaks occasionally forth in its streams, and makes the
waters and their streams turbid with its feet. Therefore shall Pharaoh
also end like such a monster ([Eze
32:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#003).md). The guilt of Pharaoh did not
consist in the fact that he had assumed the position of a ruler among
the nations (Kliefoth); but in his polluting the water-streams, stirring
up and disturbing the life-giving streams of the nations. God will take
him in His net by a gathering of nations, and cause him to be drawn out
of his element upon the dry land, where he shall become food to the
birds and beasts of prey (cf. [Eze
29:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004.md); [Eze
31:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012).md). The words 'בּקהל עמּים ר
are not to be understood as referring to the nations, as spectators of
the event (Hvernick); but ב denotes the instrument, or medium employed,
here the persons by whom God causes the net to be thrown, as is evident
from the והעלוּך which follows. According to the parallelismus
membrorum, the ἁπ. λεγ. רמוּת can only refer to the carcase of the
beast, although the source from which this meaning of the word is
derived has not yet been traced. There is no worth to be attached to the
reading rimowt in some of the codices, as רמּה does not yield a suitable
meaning either in the sense of reptile, or in that of putrefaction or
decomposed bodies, which has been attributed to it from the Arabic.
Under these circumstances we adhere to the derivation from רוּם, to be
high, according to which רמוּת may signify a height or a heap, which the
context defines as a funeral-pile. צפה, strictly speaking, a participle
from צוּף, to flow, that which flows out, the outflow (Hitzig), is not
to be taken in connection with ארץ, but is a second object to השׁקיתי;
and the appended word מדּמך indicates the source whence the flowing
takes place, and of what the outflow consists. אל ההרים, to the
mountains, i.e., up to the top of the mountains. The thought in these
verses is probably simply this, that the fall of Pharaoh would bring
destruction upon the whole of the land of Egypt, and that many nations
would derive advantage from his fall.

[Eze 32:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md)

His overthrow fills the whole world with mourning and terror. - [Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md). When I extinguish thee, I will
cover the sky and darken its stars; I will cover the sun with cloud, and
the moon will not cause its light to shine. [Eze
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#008.md). All the shining lights in the
sky do I darken because of thee, and I bring darkness over thy land, is
the saying of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#009.md). And I will trouble the heart of
many nations when I bring out thine overthrow among the nations into
lands which thou knowest not, [Eze
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010.md). And I will make many nations
amazed at thee, and their kings shall shudder at thee when I brandish my
sword before their face; and they shall tremble every moment, every one
for his life on the day of his fall. - The thought of [Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md) and [Eze
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#008.md) is not exhausted by the
paraphrase, "when thou art extinguished, all light will be extinguished,
so far as Egypt is concerned," accompanied with the remark, that the
darkness consequent thereupon is a figurative representation of utterly
hopeless circumstances (Schmieder). The thought on which the figure
rests is that of the day of the Lord, the day of God's judgment, on
which the lights of heaven lose their brightness (cf. [Eze
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003.md) and [Joe
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010), etc..md). This day bursts upon
Egypt with the fall of Pharaoh, and on it the shining stars of heaven
are darkened, so that the land of Pharaoh becomes dark. Egypt is a
world-power represented by Pharaoh, which collapses with his fall. But
the overthrow of this world-power is an omen and prelude of the
overthrow of every ungodly world-power on the day of the last judgment,
when the present heaven and the present earth will perish in the
judgment-fire. Compare the remarks to be found in the commentary on [Joe
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004.md) upon the connection between the
phenomena of the heavens and great catastrophes on earth. The contents
of both verses may be fully explained from the biblical idea of the day
of the Lord and the accompanying phenomena; and for the explanation of
בּכבּותך, there is no necessity to assume, as Dereser and Hitzig have
done, that the sea-dragon of Egypt is presented here under the
constellation of a dragon; for there is no connection between the
comparison of Egypt to a tannim or sea-dragon, in [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md) and [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md) (=רהב, [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009).md), and the constellation of the
dragon (see the comm. on [Isa 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md) and
[Isa 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007).md). In בּכבּותך Pharaoh is no
doubt regarded as a star of the first magnitude in the sky; but in this
conception Ezekiel rests upon [Isa
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md), where the king of Babylon is
designated as a bright morning-star. That this passage was in the
prophet's mind, is evident at once from the fact that [Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md) coincides almost verbatim with
[Isa 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md). - The extinction and
obscuration of the stars are not merely a figurative representation of
the mourning occasioned by the fall of Pharaoh; still less can [Eze
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#009.md) and [Eze
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010.md) be taken as an interpretation in
literal phraseology of the figurative words in [Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md) and [Eze
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#008.md). For [Eze
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#009.md) and [Eze
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010.md) do not relate to the mourning of
the nations, but to anxiety and terror into which they are plunged by
God through the fall of Pharaoh and his might. הכעיס , to afflict the
heart, does not mean to make it sorrowful, but to fill it with anxiety,
to deprive it of its peace and cheerfulness. "When I bring thy fall
among the nations" is equivalent to "spread the report of thy fall."
Consequently there is no need for either the arbitrary alteration of
שׁברך into שׂברך, which Ewald proposes, with the imaginary rendering
announcement or report; nor for the marvellous assumption of Hvernick,
that שׁברך describes the prisoners scattered among the heathen as the
ruins of the ancient glory of Egypt, in support of which he adduces the
rendering of the lxx αἰχμαλωσίαν σου, which is founded upon the change
of שׁברך into שׁביך. For [Eze 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010.md)
compare [Eze 27:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#035.md). עופף, to cause to
fly, to brandish. The sword is brandished before their face when it
falls time after time upon their brother the king of Egypt, whereby they
are thrown into alarm for their own lives. לרגעים, by moments = every
moment (see the comm. on [Isa 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003).md).

[Eze 32:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#011.md)

The judgment upon Egypt will be executed by the king of Babylon. - [Eze
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#011.md). For thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon thee. [Eze
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#012.md). By swords of heroes will I
cause thy tumult to fall, violent ones of the nations are they all, and
will lay waste the pride of Egypt, and all its tumult will be destroyed.
[Eze 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#013.md). And I will cut off all its
cattle from the great waters, that no foot of man may disturb them any
more, nor any hoof of cattle disturb them. [Eze
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014.md). Then will I cause their waters
to settle and their streams to flow like oil, is the saying of the Lord
Jehovah, [Eze 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#015.md). When I make the
land of Egypt a desert, and the land is made desolate of its fulness,
because I smite all the inhabitants therein, and they shall know that I
am Jehovah. [Eze 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#016.md). A lamentatoin
(mournful ode) is this, and they will sing it mournfully; the daughters
of the nations will sing it mournfully, over Egypt and over all its
tumult will they sing it mournfully, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.
- In this concluding strophe the figurative announcement of the
preceding one is summed up briefly in literal terms; and toward the
close ([Eze 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014).md) there is a slight
intimation of a better future. The destruction of the proud might of
Egypt will be effected through the king of Babylon and his brave and
violent hosts. עריצי גּוים, as in [Eze
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md) (see the comm. on [Eze
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007).md). המון in [Eze
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#012.md) and [Eze
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#013.md) must not be restricted to the
multitude of people. It signifies tumult, and embraces everything in
Egypt by which noise and confusion were made (as in [Eze
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#002.md) and [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018).md); although the idea of a
multitude of people undoubtedly predominates in the use of המון in [Eze
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#012.md). גּאון , the pride of Egypt, is
not that of which Egypt is proud, but whatever is proud or exalts itself
in Egypt. The utter devastation of Egypt includes the destruction of the
cattle, i.e., of the numerous herds which fed on the grassy banks of the
Nile and were driven to the Nile to drink (cf. [Gen
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#006.md); [Gen
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#002.md).; [Exo
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#003).md); and this is therefore specially
mentioned in [Eze 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#013.md), with an
allusion to the consequence thereof, namely, that the waters of the Nile
would not be disturbed any more either by the foot of man or hoof of
beast (compare [Eze 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#013.md) with [Eze
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#011).md). The disturbing of the water is
mentioned with evident reference to [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md), where Pharaoh is depicted as a
sea-monster, which disturbs the streams of water. The disturbance of the
water is therefore a figurative representation of the wild driving of
the imperial power of Egypt, by which the life-giving streams of the
nations were stirred up.

[Eze 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014.md). Then will God cause the
waters of Egypt to sink. Hitzig and Kliefoth understand this as
signifying the diminution of the abundance of water in the Nile, which
had previously overflowed the land and rendered it fertile, but for
which there was no further purpose now. According to this explanation,
the words would contain a continued picture of the devastation of the
land. But this is evidently a mistake, for the simple reason that it is
irreconcilable with the אז, by which the thought is introduced. אז,
tunc, is more precisely defined by 'בּתתּי וגו in [Eze
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#015.md) as the time when the devastation
has taken place; whereas Kliefoth takes the 15th verse, in opposition
both to the words and the usage of the language, as the sequel to [Eze
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014.md), or in other words, regards
בּתתּי as synonymous with ונתתּי. The verse contains a promise, as most
of the commentators, led by the Chaldee and Jerome, have correctly
assumed.

(Note: The explanation of Jerome is the following: "Then will purest
waters, which had been disturbed by the sway of the dragon, be restored
not by another, but by the Lord Himself; so that their streams flow like
oil, and are the nutriment of true light.")

השׁקיע, to make the water sink, might no doubt signify in itself a
diminution of the abundance of water. But if we consider the context, in
which reference is made to the disturbance of the water through its
being trodden with the feet ([Eze
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#013).md), השׁקיע can only signify to
settle, i.e., to become clear through the sinking to the bottom of the
slime which had been stirred up (cf. [Eze
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#018).md). The correctness of this
explanation is confirmed by the parallel clause, to make their streams
flow with oil. To understand this as signifying the slow and gentle flow
of the diminished water, would introduce a figure of which there is no
trace in Hebrew. Oil is used throughout the Scriptures as a figurative
representation of the divine blessing, or the power of the divine
Spirit. כּשׁמן, like oil, according to Hebrew phraseology, is equivalent
to "like rivers of oil." And oil-rivers are not rivers which flow
quietly like oil, but rivers which contain oil instead of water (cf.
[Job 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006).md), and are symbolical of the
rich blessing of God (cf. [Deu 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013).md).
The figure is a very appropriate one for Egypt, as the land is indebted
to the Nile for all its fertility. Whereas its water had been stirred up
and rendered turbid by Pharaoh; after the fall of Pharaoh the Lord will
cause the waters of the stream, which pours its blessings upon the land,
to purify themselves, and will make its streams flow with oil. The
clarified water and flowing oil are figures of the life-giving power of
the word and Spirit of God. But this blessing will not flow to Egypt
till its natural power is destroyed. Ewald has therefore given the
following as the precise meaning of [Eze
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014.md) : "The Messianic times will then
for the first time dawn on Egypt, when the waters no more become
devastating and turbid, that is to say, through the true knowledge to
which the chastisement leads." [Eze
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#016.md) "rounds off the passage by
turning back to [Eze 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002)" (Hitzig.md).
The daughters of the nations are mentioned as the singers, because
mourning for the dead was for the most part the business of women (cf.
[Jer 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016).md). The words do not contain a
summons to the daughters of the nations to sing the lamentation, but the
declaration that they will do it, in which the thought is implied that
the predicted devastation of Egypt will certainly occur.

[Ezekiel 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 32:17</span></span>

Funeral-Dirge for the Destruction of the Might of Egypt

This second lamentation or mourning ode, according to the heading in
[Eze 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#017.md), belongs to the same year
as the preceding, and to the 15th of the month, no doubt the 12th month;
in which case it was composed only fourteen days after the first. The
statement of the month is omitted here, as in [Eze
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001.md); and the omission is, no doubt,
to be attributed to a copyist in this instance also. In the ode, which
Ewald aptly describes as a "dull, heavy lamentation," we have six
regular strophes, preserving the uniform and monotonous character of the
lamentations for the dead, in which the thought is worked out, that
Egypt, like other great nations, is cast down to the nether world. The
whole of it is simply an elegiac expansion of the closing thought of the
previous chapter (Ezekiel 31).

[Eze 32:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018.md)

Introduction and first strophe. - [Eze
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018.md). Son of man, lament over the
tumult of Egypt, and hurl it down, her, like the daughters of glorious
nations, into the nether world, to those who go into the pit! [Eze
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#019.md). Whom dost thou surpass in
loveliness? Go down and lay thyself with the uncircumcised. [Eze
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#020.md). Among those slain with the
sword will they fall; the sword is handed, draw her down and all her
tumult. [Eze 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021.md). The strong ones of
the heroes say of it out of the midst of hell with its helpers: they are
gone down, they lie there, the uncircumcised, slain with the sword. -
נהה, utter a lamentation, and והורדהוּ, thrust it (the tumult of Egypt)
down, are co-ordinate. With the lamentation, or by means thereof, is
Ezekiel to thrust down the tumult of Egypt into hell. The lamentation is
God's word; and as such it has the power to accomplish what it utters.
אותהּ is not intended as a repetition of the suffix ־הוּ, but resumes
the principal idea contained in the object already named, viz., מצרים,
Egypt, i.e., its population. אותהּ and the daughters of glorious nations
are co-ordinate. בּנות, as in the expression, daughter of Tyre, daughter
Babel, denotes the population of powerful heathen nations. The גּוים
אדּרם can only be the nations enumerated in [Eze
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022.md), [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md)., which, according to these
verses, are already in Sheol, not about to be thrust down, but thrust
down already. Consequently the copula ו before בּנות is to be taken in
the sense of a comparison, as in [Sa1
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#015) (cf. Ewald, 340b.md). All these
glorious nations have also been hurled down by the word of God; and
Egypt is to be associated with them. By thus placing Egypt on a level
with all the fallen nations, the enumeration of which fills the middle
strophes of the ode, the lamentation over Egypt is extended into a
funeral-dirge on the fall of all the heathen powers of the world. For
ארץ תּחתּיּות and יורדי , compare Ezekiel 276:20. The ode itself
commences in [Eze 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#019.md), by giving
prominence to the glory of the falling kingdom. But this prominence
consists in the brief inquiry ממּי נעמתּ, before whom art thou lovely?
i.e., art thou more lovely than any one else? The words are addressed
either to המון מצרים ([Eze 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018).md), or
what is more probable, to Pharaoh with all his tumult (cf. [Eze
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#032).md), i.e., to the world-power,
Egypt, as embodied in the person of Pharaoh; and the meaning of the
question is the following: - Thou, Egypt, art indeed lovely; but thou
art not better or more lovely than other mighty heathen nations;
therefore thou canst not expect any better fate than to go down into
Sheol, and there lie with the uncircumcised. ערלים, as in [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md). This is carried out still
further in [Eze 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#020.md), and the ground
thereof assigned. The subject to יפּלוּ is the Egyptians, or Pharaoh and
his tumult. They fall in the midst of those pierced with the sword. The
sword is already handed to the executor of the judgment, the king of
Babel ([Eze 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011).md). Their destruction
is so certain, that the words are addressed to the bearers of the sword:
"Draw Egypt and all its tumult down into Sheol" (משׁכוּ is imperative
for משׁכוּ in [Exo 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#021).md), and,
according to [Eze 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021.md), the heathen
already in Sheol are speaking of his destruction. ידבּרוּ לו is rendered
by many, "there speak to him, address him, greet him," with an allusion
to [Isa 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md)., where the king of
Babel, when descending into Sheol, is greeted with malicious pleasure by
the kings already there. But however obvious the fact may be that
Ezekiel has this passage in mind, there is no address in the verse
before us as in [Isa 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#010.md), but simply
a statement concerning the Egyptians, made in the third person.
Moreover, את־עזריו could hardly be made to harmonize with ידבּרוּ לו, if
לו signified ad eum. For it is not allowable to connect עת־עזריו (taken
in the sense of along with their helpers) with אלי גבּורים as a noun in
apposition, for the simple reason that the two are separated by מתּוך
שׁאול. Consequently את־עזריו can only belong to ידבּרוּ: they talk (of
him) with his helpers. עזריו, his (Pharaoh's) helpers are his allies,
who have already gone down before him into hell (cf. [Eze
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#008).md). The singular suffix, which has
offended Hitzig, is quite in order as corresponding to לו. The words,
"they have gone down, lie there," etc., point once more to the fact that
the same fate has happened to the Egyptians as to all the rest of the
rulers and nations of the world whom God has judged. For אלי גבּורים,
strong ones of the heroes, compare the comm. on [Eze
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md). שׁאול, hell = the nether world,
the gathering-place of the dead; not the place of punishment for the
damned. חללי without the article is a predicate, and not in apposition
to הערלים. On the application of this epithet to the Egyptians, Kliefoth
has correctly observed that "the question whether the Egyptians received
circumcision is one that has no bearing upon this passage; for in the
sense in which Ezekiel understands circumcision, the Egyptians were
uncircumcised, even if they were accustomed to circumcise their flesh."

In the four following strophes ([Eze
32:22-30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022).md) a series of heathen nations
is enumerated, whom the Egyptian finds already in hell, and with whom he
will share the same fate. There are six of these - namely, Asshur, Elam,
Meshech-Tubal, Edom, the princes of the north, and Sidon. The six are
divisible into two classes - three great and remote world-powers, and
three smaller neighbouring nations. In this no regard is paid to the
time of destruction. With the empire of Asshur, which had already
fallen, there are associated Elam and Meshech-Tubal, two nations, which
only rose to the rank of world-powers in the more immediate and more
remote future; and among the neighbouring nations, the Sidonians and
princes of the north, i.e., The Syrian kings, are grouped with Edom,
although the Sidonians had long ago given up their supremacy to Tyre,
and the Aramean kings, who had once so grievously oppressed the kingdom
of Israel, had already been swallowed up in the Assyrian and Chaldean
empire. It may, indeed, be said that "in any case, at the time when
Ezekiel prophesied, princes enough had already descended into Sheol both
of the Assyrians and Elamites, etc., to welcome the Egyptians as soon as
they came" (Kliefoth); but with the same justice may it also be said
that many of the rulers and countrymen of Egypt had also descended into
Sheol already, at the time when Pharaoh, reigning in Ezekiel's day, was
to share the same fate. It is evident, therefore, that "any such
reflection upon chronological relations is out of place in connection
with our text, the intention of which is merely to furnish an
exemplification" (Kliefoth), and that Ezekiel looks upon Egypt more in
the light of a world-power, discerning in its fall the overthrow of all
the heathen power of the world, and predicting it under the prophetic
picture, that Pharaoh and his tumult are expected and welcomed by the
princes and nations that have already descended into Sheol, as coming to
share their fate with them.

[Eze 32:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022.md)

Second strophe. - [Eze 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022.md). There is
Asshur and all its multitude, round about it their graves, all of them
slain, fallen by the sword [Eze 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023.md).
Whose graves are made in the deepest pit, and its multitude is round
about its grave; all slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in
the land of the living. - The enumeration commences with Asshur, the
world-power, which had already been overthrown by the Chaldeans. It is
important to notice here, that אשּׁוּר, like עילם in [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md), and משׁך in [Eze
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md), is construed as a feminine, as
המונהּ which follows in every case plainly shows. It is obvious,
therefore, that the predominant idea is not that of the king or people,
but that of the kingdom or world-power. It is true that in the suffixes
attached to סביבותיו קברתיו in [Eze
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022.md), and סביבותיו in [Eze
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#025.md) and [Eze
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md), the masculine alternates with
the feminine, and Hitzig therefore proposes to erase these words; but
the alternation may be very simply explained, on the ground that the
ideas of the kingdom and its king are not kept strictly separate, but
that the words oscillate from one idea to the other. It is affirmed of
Asshur, that as a world-power it lies in Sheol, and the gravers of its
countrymen are round about the graves of its ruler. They all lie there
as those who have fallen by the sword, i.e., who have been swept away by
a judgment of God. To this is added in [Eze
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023.md) the declaration that the graves
of Asshur lie in the utmost sides, i.e., the utmost or deepest extremity
of Sheol; whereas so long as this power together with its people was in
the land of the living, i.e., so long as they ruled on earth, they
spread terror all around them by their violent deeds. From the loftiest
height of earthly might and greatness, they are hurled down to the
lowest hell. The higher on earth, the deeper in the nether world.
Hvernick has entirely misunderstood the words "round about Asshur are
its graves" ([Eze 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022).md), and "its
multitude is round about its grave" (the grave of this world-power),
when he finds therein the thought that the graves and corpses are to be
regarded as separated, so that the dead are waiting near their graves in
deepest sorrow, looking for the honour of burial, but looking in vain.
There is not a word of this in the text, but simply that the graves of
the people lie round about the grave of their ruler.

[Eze 32:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md)

Third strophe. - [Eze 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md). There is
Elam, and all its multitude round about its grave; all of them slain,
fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised into the nether world,
who spread terror before them in the land of the living, and bear their
shame with those who went into the pit. [Eze
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#025.md). In the midst of the slain have
they made it a bed with all its multitude, round about it are their
graves; all of them uncircumcised, pierced with the sword; because
terror was spread before them in the land of the living, they bear their
shame with those who have gone into the pit. In the midst of slain ones
is he laid. - Asshur is followed by עילם, Elam, the warlike people of
Elymais, i.e., Susiana, the modern Chusistan, whose archers served in
the Assyrian army ([Isa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006).md), and
which is mentioned along with the Medes as one of the conquerors of
Babylon ([Isa 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002).md), whereas Jeremiah
prophesied its destruction at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign ([Jer
49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034)..md). Ezekiel says just the same of
Elam as he has already said of Asshur, and almost in the same words. The
only difference is, that his description is more copious, and that he
expresses more distinctly the thought of shameful destruction which is
implied in the fact of lying in Sheol among the slain, and repeats it a
second time, and that he also sets the bearing of shame into Sheol in
contrast with the terror which Elam had spread around it during its life
on earth. נשׂא , as in [Eze 16:52](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#052.md). The
ב in בּכל־המונהּ is either the "with of association," or the fact of
being in the midst of a crowd. להּ refers to עילם; and נתנוּ has an
indefinite subject, "they gave" = there was given. משׁכּב, the
resting-place of the dead, as in [Ch2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014.md). The last clause in [Eze
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#025.md) is an emphatic repetition of the
leading thought: he (Elam) is brought or laid in the midst of the slain.

[Eze 32:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md)

Fourth strophe. - [Eze 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md). There is
Meshech-Tubal and all its multitude, its graves round about it; all of
them uncircumcised, slain in with the sword, because they spread terror
before them in the land of the living. [Eze
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027.md). They lie not with the fallen
heroes of uncircumcised men, who went down into hell with their weapons
of war, whose swords they laid under their heads; their iniquities have
come upon their bones, because they were a terror of the heroes in the
land of the living. [Eze 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#028.md). Thou
also wilt be dashed to pieces among uncircumcised men, and lie with
those slain with the sword. - משׁך and תּבל, the Moschi and Tibareni of
the Greeks (see the comm. on [Eze
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#013).md), are joined together ἀσυνδετῶς
here as one people or heathen power; and Ewald, Hitzig, and others
suppose that the reference is to the Scythians, who invaded the land in
the time of Josiah, and the majority of whom had miserably perished not
very long before (Herod. i. 106). But apart from the fact that the
prophets of the Old Testament make no allusion to any invasion of
Palestine by the Scythians (see Minor Prophets, vol. ii. p. 124, Eng.
transl.), this view is founded entirely upon the erroneous supposition
that in this funeral-dirge Ezekiel mentions only such peoples as had
sustained great defeats a longer or shorter time before. Meshech-Tubal
comes into consideration here, as in Ezekiel 38, as a northern power,
which is overcome in its conflict with the kingdom of God, and is
prophetically exhibited by the prophet as having already fallen under
the judgment of death. In [Eze 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md)
Ezekiel makes the same announcement as he has already made concerning
Asshur in [Eze 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022.md), [Eze
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023.md), and with regard to Elam in [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md), [Eze
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#025.md). But the announcement in [Eze
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027.md) is obscure. Rosenmller, Ewald,
Hvernick, and others, regard this verse as a question (ולא in the sense
of הלא): "and should they not lie with (rest with) other fallen heroes
of the uncircumcised, who...?" i.e., they do lie with them, and could
not possibly expect a better fate. But although the interrogation is
merely indicated by the tone where the language is excited, and
therefore ולא might stand for הלא, as in [Exo
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#022.md), there is not the slightest
indication of such excitement in the description given here as could
render this assumption a probable one. On the contrary, ולא at the
commencement of the sentence suggests the supposition that an antithesis
is intended to the preceding verse. And the probability of this
conjecture is heightened by the allusion made to heroes, who have
descended into the nether world with their weapons of war; inasmuch as,
at all events, something is therein affirmed which does not apply to all
the heroes who have gone down into hell. The custom of placing the
weapons of fallen heroes along with them in the grave is attested by
Diod. Sic. xviii. 26; Arrian, i. 5; Virgil, Ane. vi. 233 (cf. Dougtaei
Analectt. ss. i. pp. 281, 282); and, according to the ideas prevailing
in ancient times, it was a mark of great respect to the dead. But the
last place in which we should expect to meet with any allusion to the
payment of such honour to the dead would be in connection with Meshech
and Tubal, those wild hordes of the north, who were only known to Israel
by hearsay. We therefore follow the Vulgate, the Rabbins, and many of
the earlier commentators, and regard the verse before us as containing a
declaration that the slain of Meshech-Tubal would not receive the honour
of resting in the nether world along with those fallen heroes whose
weapons were buried with them in the grave, because they fell with
honour.

(Note: C. a Lapide has already given the true meaning: "He compares
them, therefore, not with the righteous, but with the heathen, who,
although uncircumcised, had met with a glorious death, i.e., they will
be more wretched than these; for the latter went down to the shades with
glory, but they with ignominy, as if conquered and slain.")

כּלי מלחמה, instruments of war, weapons, as in [Deu
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#041.md). The text leaves it uncertain who
they were who had been buried with such honours. The Seventy have
confounded מערלים with מעולם, and rendered ,נפלים τῶν πεπτωκότων ἀπ
̓αἰῶνος possibly thinking of the gibborim of [Gen
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md). Dathe and Hitzig propose to alter
the text to this; and even Hvernick imagines that the prophet may
possibly have had such passages as [Gen
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md) and [Gen
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009.md). floating before his mind. But
there is not sufficient ground to warrant an alteration of the text; and
if Ezekiel had had [Gen 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md) in his
mind, he would no doubt have written הגבּורים. The clause ותּהי עונותם
is regarded by the more recent commentators as a continuation of the
preceding 'ויּתּנוּ וגו, which is a very natural conclusion, if we
simply take notice of the construction. But if we consider the sense of
the words, this combination can hardly be sustained. The words, "and so
were their iniquities upon their bones" (or they came upon them), can
well be understood as an explanation of the reason for their descending
into Sheol with their weapons, and lying upon their swords. We must
therefore regard ותּהי עונותם as a continuation of ישׁכּבוּ, so that
their not resting with those who were buried with their weapons of war
furnishes the proof that their guilt lay upon their bones. The words,
therefore, have no other meaning than the phrase ישׂאוּ כלמּתם in [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md) and [Eze
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#030.md). Sin comes upon the bones when
the punishment consequent upon it falls upon the bones of the sinner. In
the last clause we connect גבּורים with חתּית, terror of the heroes,
i.e., terrible even to heroes on account of their savage and cruel
nature. In [Eze 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#028.md) we cannot take
אתּה as referring to Meshech-Tubal, as many of the commentators propose.
A direct address to that people would be at variance with the whole plan
of the ode. Moreover, the declaration contained in the verse would
contradict what precedes. As Meshech-Tubal is already lying in Sheol
among the slain, according to [Eze
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md), the announcement cannot be made
to it for the first time here, that it is to be dashed in pieces and
laid with those who are slain with the sword. It is the Egyptian who is
addressed, and he is told that this fate will also fall upon him. And
through this announcement, occurring in the midst of the list of peoples
that have already gone down to Sheol, the design of that list is once
more called to mind.

[Eze 32:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029.md)

Fifth strophe. - [Eze 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029.md). There are
Edom, its kings and all its princes, who in spite of their bravery are
associated with those that are pierced with the sword; they lie with the
uncircumcised and with those that have gone down into the pit. [Eze
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#030.md). There are princes of the north,
all of them, and all the Sidonians who have gone down to the slain, been
put to shame in spite of the dread of them because of their bravery;
they lie there as uncircumcised, and bear their shame with those who
have gone into the pit. - In this strophe Ezekiel groups together the
rest of the heathen nations in the neighbourhood of Israel; and in doing
so, he changes the שׁם of the preceding list for שׁמּה, thither. This
might be taken prophetically: thither will they come, "to these they
also belong" (Hvernick), only such nations being mentioned here as are
still awaiting their destruction. But, in the first place, the perfects
אשׁר נתנוּ, אשׁר ירדוּ, in [Eze 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029.md),
[Eze 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#030.md), do not favour this
explanation, inasmuch as they are used as preterites in [Eze
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022.md), [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md), [Eze
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#025.md), [Eze
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md), [Eze
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027.md); and, secondly, even in the
previous strophes, not only are such peoples mentioned as have already
perished, but some, like Elam and Meshech-Tubal, which did not rise into
historical importance, or exert any influence upon the development of
the kingdom of God till after Ezekiel's time, whereas the Edomites and
Sidonians were already approaching destruction. We therefore regard
שׁמּה as simply a variation of expression in the sense of "thither have
they come," without discovering any allusion to the future. - In the
case of Edom, kings and נשׂיאים, i.e., tribe-princes, are mentioned. The
allusion is to the 'alluphim or phylarchs, literally chiliarchs, the
heads of the leading families ([Gen
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015)..md), in whose hands the government
of the people lay, inasmuch as the kings were elective, and were
probably chosen by the phylarchs (see the comm. on [Gen
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031)..md). בּגבוּרתם, in, or with their
bravery, i.e., in spite of it. There is something remarkable in the
allusion to princes of the north (נסיכי, lit., persons enfeoffed,
vassal-princes; see the comm. on [Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md) and [Mic
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004).md) in connection with the Sidonians,
and after Meshech-Tubal the representative of the northern nations. The
association with the Sidonians renders the conjecture a very natural
one, that allusion is made to the north of Palestine, and more
especially to the Aram of Scripture, with its many separate states and
princes (Hvernick); although [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md), "the kings of the north, both
far and near," does not furnish a conclusive proof of this. So much, at
any rate, is certain, that the princes of the north are not to be
identified with the Sidonians. For, as Kliefoth has correctly observed,
"there are six heathen nations mentioned, viz., Asshur, Elam,
Meshech-Tubal, Edom, the princes of the north, and Sidon; and if we add
Egypt to the list, we shall have seven, which would be thoroughly
adapted, as it was eminently intended, to depict the fate of universal
heathenism." A principle is also clearly discernible in the mode in
which they are grouped. Asshur, Elam, and Meshech-Tubal represent the
greater and more distant world-powers; Edom the princes of the north,
and Sidon the neighbouring nations of Israel on both south and north.
בּחתּיתם מגּבוּרתם, literally, in dread of them, (which proceeded) from
their bravery, i.e., which their bravery inspired. 'ויּשׂאוּ וגו, as in
[Eze 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md).

[Eze 32:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#031.md)

Sixth and last strophe. - [Eze 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#031.md).
Pharaoh will see them, and comfort himself over all his multitude.
Pharaoh and all his army are slain with the sword, is the saying of the
Lord Jehovah. [Eze 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#032.md). For I caused
him to spread terror in the land of the living, therefore is he laid in
the midst of uncircumcised, those slain with the sword. Pharaoh and all
his multitude, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - In these verses the
application to Egypt follows. Pharaoh will see in the nether world all
the greater and smaller heathen nations with their rulers; and when he
sees them all given up to the judgment of death, he will comfort himself
over the fate which has fallen upon himself and his army, as he will
perceive that he could not expect any better lot than that of the other
rulers of the world. נחם על, to comfort oneself, as in [Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md) and [Eze
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022.md). Hitzig's assertion, that נחם
never signifies to comfort oneself, is incorrect (see the comm. on [Eze
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022).md). נתתּי את־חתּיתו, I have given
terror of him, i.e., I have made him an instrument of terror. The Keri
חתּיתי arose from a misunderstanding. The Chetib is confirmed by [Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md) and [Eze
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md). In [Eze
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#032.md) the ode is brought to a close by
returning even in expression to [Eze
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#019.md) and [Eze
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#020.md).

If, now, we close with a review of the whole of the contents of the
words of God directed against Egypt, in all of them is the destruction
of the might of Pharaoh and Egypt as a world-power foretold. And this
prophecy has been completely fulfilled. As Kliefoth has most truly
observed, "one only needs to enter the pyramids of Egypt and its
catacombs to see that the glory of the Pharaohs has gone down into
Sheol. And it is equally certain that this destruction of the glory of
ancient Egypt dates from the times of the Babylonio-Persian empire.
Moreover, this destruction was so thorough, that even to the New Egypt
of the Ptolemies the character of the Old Egypt was a perfect enigma, a
thing forgotten and incomprehensible." But if Ezekiel repeatedly speaks
of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon as executing this judgment upon
Egypt, we must bear in mind that here, as in the case of Tyre (see the
comm. on Ezekiel 28:1-19), Ezekiel regards Nebuchadnezzar as the
instrument of the righteous punishment of God in general, and discerns
in what he accomplishes the sum of all that in the course of ages has
been gradually fulfilling itself in history. At the same time, it is
equally certain that this view of the prophet would have no foundation
in truth unless Nebuchadnezzar really did conquer Egypt and lay it
waste, and the might and glory of this ancient empire were so shattered
thereby, that it never could recover its former greatness, but even
after the turning of its captivity, i.e., after its recovery from the
deadly wounds which the imperial monarchy of Babylonia and afterwards of
Persia inflicted upon it, still remained a lowly kingdom, which could
"no more rule over the nations" ([Eze
29:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013).md). Volney, however, in his
Recherch. nouv. sur l'hist. anc. (III pp. 151ff.), and Hitzig (Ezekiel
p. 231), dispute the conquest and devastation of Egypt by
Nebuchadnezzar, because the Greek historians, with Herodotus (ii.
161ff.) at their head, make no allusion whatever to an invasion of
Egypt; and their statements are even opposed to such an occurrence. But
the silence of Greek historians, especially of Herodotus, is a most
"miserable" argument. The same historians do not say a word about the
defeat of Necho by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish; and yet even Hitzig
accepts this as an indisputable fact. Herodotus and his successors
derived their accounts of Egypt from the communications of Egyptian
priests, who suppressed everything that was humiliating to the pride of
Egypt, and endeavoured to cover it up with their accounts of glorious
deeds which the Pharaohs had performed. But Hitzig has by no means
proved that the statements of the Greeks are at variance with the
assumption of a Chaldean invasion of Egypt, whilst he has simply
rejected but not refuted the attempts of Perizonius, Vitringa, Hvernick,
and others, to reconcile the biblical narrative of the conquest of Egypt
by Nebuchadnezzar with the accounts given by Herodotus, Diodorus
Siculus, and other Greeks, concerning the mighty feats of Necho, and his
being slain by Amasis. The remark that, in the description given by
Herodotus, Amasis appears as an independent king by the side of
Cambyses, only less powerful than the Persian monarch, proves nothing
more, even assuming the correctness of the fact, than that Amasis had
made Egypt once more independent of Babylonia on the sudden overthrow of
the Chaldean monarchy.

The conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, after the attitude which
Pharaoh Necho assumed towards the Babylonian empire, and even attempted
to maintain in the time of Zedekiah by sending an army to the relief of
Jerusalem when besieged by the Chaldeans, is not only extremely probable
in itself, but confirmed by testimony outside the Bible. Even if no
great importance can be attached to the notice of Megasthenes, handed
down by Strabo (xv. 1. 6) and Josephus (c. Ap. i. 20): "he says that he
(Nebuchadnezzar) conquered the greater part of Libya and Iberia;"
Josephus not only quotes from Berosus (l.c. i. 19) to the effect that
"the Babylonian got possession of Egypt, Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia," but,
on the ground of such statements, relates the complete fulfilment of the
prophecies of Scripture, saying, in Antt. x. 9. 7, with reference to
Nebuchadnezzar, "he fell upon Egypt to conquer it. And the reigning king
he slew; and having appointed another in his place, made those Jews
prisoners who had hitherto resided there, and led them into Babylon."
And even if Josephus does not give his authority in this case, the
assertion that he gathered this from the prophecies of Jeremiah is
untrue; because, immediately before the words we have quoted, he says
that what Jeremiah had prophesied ([Jer
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010) and Jer 44.md) had thus come to
pass; making a distinction, therefore, between prophecy and history. And
suspicion is not to be cast upon this testimony by such objections as
that Josephus does not mention the name of the Egyptian king, or state
precisely the time when Egypt was conquered, but merely affirms in
general terms that it was after the war with the Ammonites and Moabites.
