### [Joshua Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 19:1</span></span>

The Inheritance of Simeon fell within the inheritance of the children of
Judah, because the land allotted to them at Gilgal was larger than they
required ([Jos 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#009).md). Thus the curse
pronounced upon Simeon by Jacob of dispersion in Israel ([Gen
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007).md) was fulfilled upon this tribe in
a very peculiar manner, and in a different manner from that pronounced
upon Levi. The towns allotted to the tribe of Simeon are divided into
two groups, the first ([Jos 19:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002).md)
consisting of thirteen or fourteen towns, all situated in the Negeb (or
south country); the second ([Jos 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007).md)
of four towns, two of which were in the Negeb and two in the shephelah.
All these eighteen towns have already been enumerated among the towns of
Judah ([Jos 15:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#026.md), [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042).md), and are mentioned again in
[Ch1 4:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#028.md), in just the same order,
and with only slight differences in the spelling of some of the names.
If the classification of the names in two groups might seem to indicate
that Simeon received a connected portion of land in Judah, this idea is
overthrown at once by the circumstance that two of the four towns in the
second group were in the south land and two in the lowland, and, judging
from [Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md), [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042.md), at a great distance from one
another. At the same time, we cannot decide this point with any
certainty, as the situation of several of the towns is still unknown.

[Jos 19:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002.md)

Beersheba: see at [Jos 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#028.md). Sheba is
wanting in the Chronicles, but has no doubt been omitted through a
copyist's error, as Shema answers to it in [Jos
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#026.md), where it stands before Moladah
just as Sheba does here. - On the names in [Jos
19:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#003.md), see the exposition of [Jos
15:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#028.md). - The sum total given in
[Jos 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#006.md), viz., thirteen towns, does
not tally, as there are fourteen names. On these differences, see the
remarks on [Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md).

[Jos 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007.md)

Ain and Rimmon were in the south land ([Jos
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032).md), Ether and Ashan in the
lowlands ([Jos 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042).md).

[Jos 19:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#008.md)

In addition to the towns mentioned, the Simeonites received all the
villages round about the towns to Baalath-beer, the Ramah of the south.
This place, up to which the territory of the Simeonites extended, though
without its being actually assigned to the Simeonites, is simply called
Baal in [Ch1 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#033.md), and is probably the
same as Bealoth in [Jos 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024.md), though
its situation has not yet been determined (see at [Jos
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024).md). It cannot be identified,
however, with Ramet el Khulil, an hour to the north of Hebron, which
Roediger supposes to be the Ramah of the south, since the territory of
Simeon, which was situated in the Negeb, and had only two towns in the
shephelah, cannot possibly have extended into the mountains to a point
on the north of Hebron. So far as the situation is concerned, V. de
Velde would be more likely to be correct, when he identifies Rama of the
south with Tell Lekiyeh on the north of Beersheba, if this conjecture
only rested upon a better foundation than the untenable assumption, that
Baalath-beer is the same as the Baalath of Dan in [Jos
19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044.md).

[Joshua 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 19:10</span></span>

The Inheritance of Zebulun fell above the plain of Jezreel, between this
plain and the mountains of Naphtali, so that it was bounded by Asher on
the west and north-west ([Jos 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027).md),
by Naphtali on the north and north-east ([Jos
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034).md), and by Issachar on the
south-east and south, and touched neither the Mediterranean Sea nor the
Jordan. It embraced a very fertile country, however, with the fine broad
plain of el Buttauf, the μέγα πεδίον above Nazareth called Asochis in
Joseph. vita, 41, 45 (see Rob. iii. p. 189, Bibl. Res. pp. 105ff.;
Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 742, 758-9).

[Jos 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md)

"And the boundary (the territory) of their inheritance was (went) to
Sarid." This is no doubt the centre of the southern boundary, from which
it is traced in a westerly direction in [Jos
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011.md), and in an easterly direction in
[Jos 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012.md), in the same manner as in
[Jos 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006.md). Unfortunately, Sarid cannot
be determined with certainty. Knobel's opinion, is, that the name, which
signifies "hole" or "incision," after the analogy of שׂרד, perforavit,
and שׂרט, incidit, does not refer to a town, but to some other locality,
probably the southern opening of the deep and narrow wady which comes
down from the basin of Nazareth, and is about an hour to the south-east
of Nazareth, between two steep mountains (Seetzen, ii. pp. 151-2; Rob.
iii. p. 183). This locality appears suitable enough. But it is also
possible that Sarid may be found in one of the two heaps of ruins on the
south side of the Mons praecipitii upon V. de Velde's map (so called
from [Luk 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#029).md).

[Jos 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011.md)

From this point "the border went up westwards, namely to Mar'ala, and
touched Dabbasheth, and still farther to the brook of Jokneam." If
Jokneam of Carmel has been preserved in the Tell Kaimn (see at [Jos
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022).md), the brook before Jokneam is
probably the Wady el Milh, on the eastern side of which, near the point
where it opens into the plain, stands Kaimn, and through which the road
runs from Acca to Ramleh, as this wady separates Carmel from the small
round hills which run to the south-east (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 114, and
V. de Velde, i. p. 249). Here the boundaries of Zebulun and Asher met
([Jos 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027).md). Mar'ala and Dabbasheth
are to be sought for between Kaimn and Sarid. The Cod. Vat. has Μαγελδά
instead of Μαριλά. Now, however, little importance we can attach to the
readings of the lxx on account of the senseless way in which its
renderings are made-as, for example, in this very passage, where ועלה
עד־שׂריד׃ is rendered Ἐσεδεκγώλα, - the name Magelda might suggest a
Hebrew reading Magedlah or Mageldah, and thus lead one to connect the
place with the village of Mejeidil (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 114), or Mshedil
(Seetzen, ii. p. 143), on the west of Mons praecipitii, though neither
of these travellers visited the place, or has given us any minute
description of it. Its situation upon a mountain would suit Mar'ala, to
which the boundary went up from Sarid. In the case of Dabbasheth, the
name, which signifies "lump" (see [Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006).md), points to a mountain. Upon this
Knobel has founded the conjecture that Gibeah or Gibeath took the place
of this uncommon word, and that this is connected with the Gabathon of
the Onom. (juxta campum Legionis), the present Jebta between Mejeidil
and Kaimn, upon an isolated height on the edge of the mountains which
skirt the plain of Jezreel, where there are signs of a remote antiquity
(Rob. iii. p. 201, and Bibl. Res. p. 113; Ritter, Erdk. xvi. p. 700);
although Tell Thureh (i.e., mountain) might be intended, a village upon
a low and isolated hill a little farther south (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p.
116, and Ritter, ut sup.).

[Jos 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012.md)

"And from Sarid the boundary turned eastwards toward the sun-rising to
the territory of Chisloth-tabor, and went out to Dabrath, and went up to
Japhia." Chisloth-tabor, i.e., according to Kimchi's explanation lumbi
Taboris (French, les flancs), was at any rate a place on the side of
Tabor, possibly the same as Kesulloth in [Jos
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018.md), as Masius and others suppose,
and probably the same place as the Xaloth of Josephus (Bell. Jud. iii.
3, 1), which was situated in the "great plain," and the vicus Chasalus
of the Onom. (juxta montem Thabor in campestribus), i.e., the present
village of Iksl or Ksl, upon a rocky height on the west of Thabor, with
many tombs in the rocks (Rob. iii. p. 182). Dabrath, a place in the
tribe of Issachar that was given up to the Levites ([Jos
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#028.md); [Ch1
6:57](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#057).md), called Dabaritta in Josephus
(Bell. Jud. ii. 21, 3) and Dabira in the Onom. (villula in monte
Thabor), the present Deburieh, an insignificant village which stands in
a very picturesque manner upon a stratum of rock at the western foot of
Tabor (Rob. iii. p. 210; V. de Velde, R. ii. p. 324). Japhia certainly
cannot be the present Hepha or Haifa (Khaifa) on the Mediterranean, and
near to Carmel (Rel. Pal. p. 826, and Ges. Thes. s. v.); but it is just
as certain that it cannot be the present Jafa, a place half an hour to
the south-west of Nazareth, as Robinson (Pal. iii. p. 200) and Knobel
suppose, since the boundary was running eastwards, and cannot possibly
have turned back again towards the west, and run from Deburieh beyond
Sarid. If the positions assigned to Chisloth-tabor and Dabrath are
correct, Japhia must be sought for on the east of Deburieh.

[Jos 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013.md)

"From thence it went over towards the east to the sun-rising to
Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and went out to Rimmon, which is marked off
to Neah." Gath-hepher, the home of the prophet Jonah ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md), was "haud grandis viculus
Geth" in the time of Jerome (see prol. ad Jon.). It was about two miles
from Sephoris on the road to Tiberias, and the tomb of the prophet was
shown there. It is the present village of Meshed, a place about an hour
and a quarter to the north of Nazareth (Rob. iii. p. 209; V. de Velde,
Mem. p. 312). Eth-kazin is unknown. Rimmon, a Levitical town ([Jos
21:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#035.md); [Ch1
6:62](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#062).md), has probably been preserved in
the village of Rummaneh, about two hours and a half to the north of
Nazareth (Rob. iii. p. 195). Ham-methoar is not a proper name, but the
participle of תּאר, with the article in the place of the relative
pronoun, "bounded off," or pricked off. Neah is unknown; it is possibly
the same place as Neiel in the tribe of Asher ([Jos
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027).md), as Knobel supposes.

[Jos 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#014.md)

"And the boundary turned round it (round Rimmon), on the north to
Channathon, and the outgoings thereof were the valley of Jiphtah-el."
Judging from the words נסב and מצּפון, this verse apparently gives the
north-west boundary, since the last definition in [Jos
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013.md), "to Gath-hepher," etc., points
to the eastern boundary. Jiphtah-el answers no doubt to the present
Jeft, two hours and a half to the north of Sefurieh, and is the Jotapata
which was obstinately defended by Josephus (Bell. Jud. iii. 7, 9: see
Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 104ff.). Consequently the valley of Jiphtah-el, at
which Zebulun touched Asher ([Jos
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027).md), is probably "no other than the
large Wady Abiln, which takes its rise in the hills in the neighbourhood
of Jeft" (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 107). And if this be correct, Channathon
(lxx Ἐνναθώθ) is probably Cana of Galilee, the home of Nathanael ([Joh
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md), [Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md); [Joh
4:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#046.md); [Joh
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#002).md), the present Kana el Jelil,
between Rummaneh and Yeft, on the northern edge of the plain of Buttauf,
upon a Tell, from which you overlook the plain, fully two hours and a
half in a straight line from Nazareth, and directly north of that place,
where there are many ruins found (see Rob. iii. p. 204; Bibl. Res. p.
108).

[Jos 19:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md)

The towns of Zebulun were the following. Kattath, probably the same as
Kitron, which is mentioned in [Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md) in connection with Nahalol, but
which is still unknown. Nehalal, or Nahalol ([Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030).md), is supposed by V. de Velde
(Mem. p. 335), who follows Rabbi Schwartz, to be the present village of
Maalul, a place with ruins on the south-west of Nazareth (see Seetzen,
ii. p. 143; Rob. iii. App.; and Ritter, Erdk. xvi. p. 700). Simron is
supposed by Knobel to be the village of Semunieh (see at [Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001).md). But neither of these is very
probable. Idalah is supposed by V. de Velde to be the village of Jeda or
Jeida, on the west of Semunieh, where are a few relics of antiquity,
though Robinson (Bibl. Res. p. 113) states the very opposite. Bethlehem
(of Zebulun), which many regard as the home of the judge Ibzan ([Jdg
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008).md), has been preserved under the
old name in a miserable village on the north of Jeida and Semunieh (see
Seetzen, ii. p. 139; Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 113). The number of the towns is
given as twelve, though only five are mentioned by name. It is true that
some commentators have found the missing names in the border places
mentioned in [Jos 19:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011.md), as, after
deducting Chisloth-tabor and Dabrath, which belonged to Issachar, the
names Sarid, Maralah, Dabbasheth, Japhia, Gittah-hepher, Eth-kazin, and
Channathon give just seven towns. Nevertheless there is very little
probability in this conjecture. For, in the first place, not only would
it be a surprising thing to find the places mentioned as boundaries
included among the towns of the territory belonging to the tribe,
especially as some of the places so mentioned did not belong to Zebulun
at all; but the copula vav, with which the enumeration of the towns
commences, is equally surprising, since this is introduced in other
cases with הארים והיוּ (ויּהיוּ), e.g., [Jos
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021.md); [Jos
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md). And, in the second place, it is
not a probable thing in itself, that, with the exception of the five
towns mentioned in [Jos 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md), the
other towns of Zebulun should all be situated upon the border. And
lastly, the towns of Kartah and Dimnah, which Zebulun gave up to the
Levites ([Jos 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034).md), are actually
wanting. Under these circumstances, it is a natural conclusion that
there is a gap in the text here, just as in [Jos
15:59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#059.md) and [Jos
21:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036.md).

[Joshua 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 19:17</span></span>

The Inheritance of Issachar. - In this instance only towns are given,
and the boundaries are not delineated, with the exception of the eastern
portion of the northern boundary and the boundary line; at the same
time, they may easily be traced from the boundaries of the surrounding
tribes. Issachar received for the most part the large and very fertile
plain of Jezreel (see at [Jos 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016.md),
and Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 689ff.), and was bounded on the south by
Manasseh, on the west by Manasseh and Asher, on the north by Zebulun,
and farther east by Naphtali also, and on the east by the Jordan.

[Jos 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018.md)

"And their boundary was towards Jezreel," i.e., their territory extended
beyond Jezreel. Jezreel, the summer residence of Ahab and his house
([Kg1 18:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045), etc..md), was situated
upon a mountain, with an extensive and splendid prospect over the large
plain that was called by its name. It was afterwards called Esdraela, a
place described in the Onom. (s. v. Jezreel) as standing between
Scythopolis and Legio; it is the present Zern, on the north-west of the
mountains of Gilboa (see Seetzen, ii. pp. 155-6; Rob. iii. pp. 161ff.;
Van de Velde, R. ii. pp. 320ff.). Chesulloth, possibly the same as
Chisloth-tabor (see at [Jos 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012).md).
Sunem, the home of Abishag ([Kg1
1:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#003), etc..md), also mentioned in [Sa1
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#004.md) and [Kg2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md), was situated, according to the
Onom., five Roman miles (two hours) to the south of Tabor; it is the
present Solam or Sulem, at the south-western foot of the Duhy or Little
Hermon, an hour and a half to the north of Jezreel (see Rob. iii. pp.
170ff.; Van de Velde, R. ii. p. 323).

[Jos 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#019.md)

Haphraim, according to the Onom. (s. v. Aphraim) villa Affaraea, six
Roman miles to the north of Legio, is identified by Knobel with the
village of Afuleh, on the west of Sulem, and more than two hours to the
north-east of Legun (Rob. iii. pp. 163, 181). Sion, according to the
Onom. villa juxta montem Thabor, has not yet been discovered. Anaharath
is supposed by Knobel to be Na'urah, on the eastern side of the Little
Hermon (Bibl. Res. p. 337); but he regards the text as corrupt, and
following the Cod. Al. of the lxx, which has Ῥενάθ and Ἀῤῥανέθ,
maintains that the reading should be Archanath, to which Arneh on the
north of Jenin in the plain corresponds (Seetzen, ii. p. 156; Rob. iii.
p. 157). But the circumstance that the Cod. Al. has two names instead of
one makes its reading very suspicious.

[Jos 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#020.md)

Harabbit is supposed by Knobel to be Araboneh, on the north-east of
Arneh, at the southern foot of Gilboa (Rob. iii. p. 157). Kishion, which
was given up to the Levites ([Jos
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#028).md) and is erroneously written
Kedesh in [Ch1 6:57](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#057.md), is unknown. This
also applies to Abez or Ebez, which is never mentioned again.

[Jos 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#021.md)

Remeth, for which Jarmuth stands in the list of Levitical towns in [Jos
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#029.md), and Ramoth in [Ch1
6:58](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#058.md), is also unknown.

(Note: Knobel imagines Remeth, whose name signifies height, to be the
village of Wezar, on one of the western peaks of Gilboa (Seetzen, ii. p.
156; Rob. iii. p. 166, and Bibl. Res. p. 339), as the name also
signifies "a lofty, inaccessible mountain, or a castle situated upon a
mountain." This is certainly not impossible, but it is improbable. For
this Mahometan village evidently derived its name from the fact that it
has the appearance of a fortification when seen from a distance (see
Ritter, Erdk. xv. p. 422). The name has nothing in common therefore with
the Hebrew Remeth, and the travellers quoted by him say nothing at all
about the ruins which he mentions in connection with Wezar (Wusar).)

En-gannim, which was also allotted to the Levites ([Jos
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#029.md); also [Ch1
6:73](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#073), where it is called Anem.md), has
been associated by Robinson (iii. p. 155) with the Γιναία of Josephus,
the present Jenin. The name En-gannim signifies fountain of gardens, and
Jenin stands at the southern side of the plain of Jezreel in the midst
of gardens and orchards, which are watered by a copious spring (see
Seetzen, ii. pp. 156ff.); "unless perhaps the place referred to is the
heap of ruins called Um el Ghanim, on the south-east of Tabor, mentioned
by Berggren, ii. p. 240, and Van de Velde, Mem. p. 142" (Knobel).
En-chadda and Beth-pazzez are only mentioned here, and have not yet been
discovered. According to Knobel, the former of the two may possibly be
either the place by Gilboa called Judeideh, with a fountain named Ain
Judeideh (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 337), or else Beit-kad or Kadd near Gilboa,
mentioned by Seetzen (ii. p. 159) and Robinson (iii. p. 157).

[Jos 19:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#022.md)

"And the boundary touched Tabor, Sahazim, and Beth-shemesh." Tabor is
not the mountain of that name, but a town upon the mountain, which was
given to the Levites, though not by Issachar but by Zebulun ([Ch1
6:62](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#062).md), and was fortified afresh in the
Jewish wars (Josephus, Bell. Jud. iv. 1, 8). In this passage, however,
it appears to be reckoned as belonging to Issachar, since otherwise
there are not sixteen cities named. At the same time, as there are
several discrepancies between the numbers given and the names actually
mentioned, it is quite possible that in this instance also the number
sixteen is incorrect. In any case, Tabor was upon the border of Zebulun
([Jos 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012).md), so that it might have
been allotted to this tribe. There are still the remains of old walls
and ruins or arches, houses, and other buildings to be seen upon Mount
Tabor; and round the summit there are the foundations of a thick wall
built of large and to a great extent fluted stones (see Rob. iii. pp.
453ff.; Seetzen, ii. p. 148; Buckingham, Syr. i. pp. 83ff.). The places
which follow are to be sought for on the east of Tabor towards the
Jordan, as the boundary terminated at the Jordan. Sachazim (Shahazimah)
Knobel connects with el Hazetheh, as the name, which signifies heights,
points to a town situated upon hills; and el Hezetheh stands upon the
range of hills, bounding the low-lying land of Ard el Hamma, which
belonged to Naphtali. The reason is a weak one, though the situation
would suit. There is more probability in the conjecture that
Beth-shemesh, which remained in the hands of the Canaanites ([Jdg
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#033).md), has been preserved in the
ruined village of Bessum (Rob. iii. p. 237), and that this new name is
only a corruption of the old one, like Beth-shean and Beisan. It is
probable that the eastern portion of the northern boundary of Issachar,
towards Naphtali, ran in a north-easterly direction from Tabor through
the plain to Kefr Sabt, and thence to the Jordan along the Wady Bessum.
It is not stated how far the territory of Issachar ran down the valley
of the Jordan (see the remarks on [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011).md).

[Joshua 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 19:24</span></span>

The Inheritance of Asher. - Asher received its territory along the
Mediterranean Sea from Carmel to the northern boundary of Canaan itself.
The description commences with the central portion, viz., the
neighbourhood of Acco ([Jos 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#025).md),
going first of all towards the south ([Jos
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026.md), [Jos
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027).md), and then to the north ([Jos
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md), [Jos
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030).md).

[Jos 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#025.md)

The territory of the Asherites was as follows. Helkath, which was given
up to the Levites ([Jos 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#031.md), and
[Ch1 6:75](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#075.md), where Hukok is an old
copyist's error), is the present Jelka, three hours to the east of Acco
(Akka: Scholz, Reise, p. 257), or Jerka, a Druse village situated upon
an eminence, and judging from the remains, an ancient place (Van de
Velde, R. i. p. 214; Rob. iii. App.). Hali, according to Knobel possibly
Julis, between Jerka and Akka, in which case the present name arose from
the form Halit, and t was changed into s. Beten, according to the Onom.
(s. v. Βατναι%: Bathne) as vicus Bethbeten, eight Roman miles to the
east of Ptolemais, has not yet been found. Achshaph is also unknown (see
at [Jos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001).md). The Onom. (s. v.
Achsaph) says nothing more about its situation than that it was in tribu
Aser, whilst the statement made s. v. Acsaph (Ἀκσάφ), that it was
villula Chasalus (κώμη Ἐξάδους), eight Roman miles from Diocaesarea ad
radicem montis Thabor, leads into the territory of Zebulun.

[Jos 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026.md)

Alammalech has been preserved, so far as the name is concerned, in the
Wady Malek or Malik (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 110), which runs into the
Kishon, since in all probability the wady was named after a place either
near it or within it. Amad is supposed by Knobel to be the present
Haifa, about three hours to the south of Acre, on the sea, and this he
identifies with the sycamore city mentioned by Strabo (xvi. 758),
Ptolemy (v. 15, 5), and Pliny (h. n. v. 17), which was called Epha in
the time of the Fathers (see Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 722ff.). In support
of this he adduces the fact that the Hebrew name resembles the Arabic
noun for sycamore-an argument the weakness of which does not need to be
pointed out. Misheal was assigned to the Levites ([Jos
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#030.md), and [Ch1
6:74](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#074), where it is called Mashal.md).
According to the Onom. (s. v. Masan) it was on the sea-coast near to
Carmel, which is in harmony with the next clause, "and reacheth to
Carmel westwards, and to Shihor-libnath." Carmel (i.e., fruit-field),
which has acquired celebrity from the history of Elijah ([Kg1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#017)..md), is a wooded mountain ridge
which stretches in a north-westerly direction on the southern side of
the Kishon, and projects as a promontory into the sea. Its name,
"fruit-field," is well chosen; for whilst the lower part is covered with
laurels and olive trees, the upper abounds in figs and oaks, and the
whole mountain is full of the most beautiful flowers. There are also
many caves about it (vid., v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 43ff.; and Ritter, Erdk.
xvi. pp. 705-6). The Shihor-libnath is not the Belus, or glass-river, in
the neighbourhood of Acre, but is to be sought for on the south of
Carmel, where Asher was bounded by Manasseh ([Jos
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010).md), i.e., to the south of Dor,
which the Manassites received in the territory of Asher ([Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011).md); it is therefore in all
probability the Nahr Zerka, possibly the crocodile river of Pliny
(Reland, Pal. p. 730), which is three hours to the south of Dor, and
whose name (blue) might answer both to shihor (black) and libnath
(white).

[Jos 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027.md)

From this point the boundary "turned towards the east," probably
following the river Libnath for a short distance upwards, "to
Beth-dagon," which has not yet been discovered, and must not be
identified with Beit Dejan between Yafa and Ludd (Diospolis), "and
touched Zebulun and the valley of Jiphtah-el on the north of Beth-emek,
and Nehil, and went out on the left of Cabul," i.e., on the northern
side of it. The north-west boundary went from Zebulun into the valley of
Jiphtah-el, i.e., the upper part of the Wady Abiln ([Jos
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#014).md). Here therefore the eastern
boundary of Asher, which ran northwards from Wady Zerka past the western
side of Issachar and Zebulun, touched the north-west corner of Zebulun.
The two places, Beth-emek and Nehil (the latter possibly the same as
Neah in [Jos 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013).md), which were
situated at the south of the valley of Jiphtah-el, have not been
discovered; they may, however, have been upon the border of Zebulun and
yet have belonged to Ashwer. Cabul, the κώμη Χαβωλώ of Josephus (Vit.
43), in the district of Ptolemais, has been preserved in the village of
Kabul, four hours to the south-east of Acre (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 88, and
Van de Velde, R. i. p. 218).

[Jos 19:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md)

In [Jos 19:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md) the towns and
boundaries in the northern part of the territory of Asher, on the
Phoenician frontier, are given, and the Phoenician cities Sidon, Tyre,
and Achzib are mentioned as marking the boundary. First of all we have
four towns in [Jos 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md), reaching as
far as Sidon, no doubt in the northern district of Asher. Ebron has not
yet been traced. As Abdon occurs among the towns which Asher gave up to
the Levites ([Jos 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#030.md); [Ch1
6:59](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#059).md), and in this verse also twenty
MSS have the reading Abdon, many writers, like Reland (Pal. p. 514),
regard Ebron as a copyist's error for Abdon. This is possible enough,
but it is by no means certain. As the towns of Asher are not all given
in this list, since Acco, Achlab, and Helba ([Jdg
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031).md) are wanting, Abdon may also have
been omitted. But we cannot attach any importance to the reading of the
twenty MSS, as it may easily have arisen from [Jos
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#030.md); and in addition to the
Masoretic text, it has against it the authority of all the ancient
versions, in which the reading Ebron is adopted. But even Abdon cannot
be traced with certainty. On the supposition that Abdon is to be read
for Ebron, Knobel connects it with the present Abbadiyeh, on the east of
Beirut (Rob. iii. App.; Ritter, Erdk. xvii. pp. 477 and 710), or with
Abidat, on the east (not the north) of Jobail (Byblus), mentioned by
Burckhardt (Syr. p. 296) and Robinson (iii. App.); though he cannot
adduce any other argument in support of the identity of Abdon with these
two places, which are only known by name at present, except the
resemblance in their names. On the supposition, however, that Abdon is
not the same as Ebron, Van de Velde's conjecture is a much more natural
one; namely, that it is to be found in the ruins of Abdeh, on the Wady
Kurn, to the north of Acca. Rehob cannot be traced. The name occurs
again in [Jos 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030.md), from which it is
evident that there were two towns of this name in the territory of Asher
(see at [Jos 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030).md). Schultz and Van
de Velde connect it with the village of Haml by the wady of that name,
between Ras el Abyad and Ras en Nakura; but this is too far south to be
included in the district which reached to great Sidon. Knobel's
suggestion would be a more probable one, namely, that it is connected
with the village of Hammana, on the east of Beirut, in the district of
el Metn, on the heights of Lebanon, where there is now a Maronite
monastery (vid., Seetzen, i. p. 260; Rob. iii. App.; and Ritter, xvii.
pp. 676 and 710), if it could only be shown that the territory of Asher
reached as far to the east as this. Kanah cannot be the village of Kna,
not far from Tyre (Rob. iii. p. 384), but must have been farther north,
and near to Sidon, though it has not yet been discovered. For the
supposition that it is connected with the existing place called Ain
Kanieh (Rob. iii. App.; Ritter, xvii. pp. 94 and 703), on the north of
Jezzin, is overthrown by the fact that that place is too far to the east
to be thought of in this connection; and neither Robinson nor Ritter
makes any allusion to "Ain Kana, in the neighbourhood of Jurjera, six
hours to the south-east of Sidon," which Knobel mentions without quoting
his authority, so that the existence of such a place is very
questionable. On Sidon, now Saida, see at [Jos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008.md).

[Jos 19:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029.md)

"And the boundary turned (probably from the territory of Sidon) to
Ramah, to the fortified town of Zor." Robinson supposes that Rama is to
be found in the village of Rameh, on the south-east of Tyre, where
several ancient sarcophagi are to be seen (Bibl. Res. p. 63). "The
fortified town of Zor," i.e., Tyre, is not the insular Tyre, but the
town of Tyre, which was on the mainland, the present Sur, which is
situated by the sea-coast, in a beautiful and fertile plain (see Ritter,
Erdk. xvii. p. 320, and Movers, Phnizier, ii. 1, pp. 118ff.). "And the
boundary turned to Hosah, and the outgoings thereof were at the sea, by
the side of the district of Achzib." Hosah is unknown, as the situation
of Kausah, near to the Rameh already mentioned (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 61),
does not suit in this connection. מחבל, lit. from the district, i.e., by
the side of it. Achzib, where the Asherites dwelt with the Canaanites
([Jdg 1:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031).md), is the Ekdippa of the
Greeks and Romans, according to the Onom. (s. v. Achziph) nine Roman
miles, or according to the Itiner. Hieros. p. 584, twelve miles to the
north of Acco by the sea, the present Zib, a very large village, three
good hours to the north of Acre, - a place on the sea-coast, with
considerable ruins of antiquity (see Ges. Thes. p. 674; Seetzen, ii. p.
109; Ritter, xvi. pp. 811-12). - In [Jos
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030.md) three separate towns are
mentioned, which were probably situated in the eastern part of the
northern district of Asher, whereas the border towns mentioned in [Jos
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md) and [Jos
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029.md) describe this district in its
western half. Ummah (lxx Ἀμμά) may perhaps have been preserved in Kefr
Ammeih, upon the Lebanon, to the south of Hammana, in the district of
Jurd (Rob. iii. App.; Ritter, xvii. p. 710). Aphek is the present Afka
(see at [Jos 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004).md). Rehob cannot be
traced with certainty. If it is Hub, as Knobel supposes, and the name
Hub, which is borne by a Maronite monastery upon Lebanon, in the diocese
of el-Jebail (to the north-east of Jebail), is a corruption of Rehob,
this would be the northernmost town of Asher (see Seetzen, i. pp.
187ff., and Ritter, xvii. p. 791). The number "twenty-two towns and
their villages" does not tally, as there are twenty-three towns
mentioned in [Jos 19:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026.md), if we
include Sidon, Tyre, and Achzib, according to [Jdg
1:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031.md). The only way in which the
numbers can be made to agree is to reckon Nehiel ([Jos
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027).md) as identical with Neah ([Jos
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013).md). But this point cannot be
determined with certainty, as the Asherites received other towns, such
as Acco and Aclaph, which are wanting in this list, and may possibly
have simply fallen out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jos 19:32</span></span>

The Inheritance of Naphtali. - This fell between Asher and the upper
Jordan. It reached northwards to the northern boundary of Canaan, and
touched Zebulun and Issachar on the south. In [Jos
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033.md) and [Jos
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034.md) the boundary lines are given:
viz., in [Jos 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033.md) the western
boundary towards Asher, with the northern and eastern boundaries: in
[Jos 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034.md) the southern boundary; but
with the uncertainty which exists as to several of the places named, it
cannot be traced with certainty.

[Jos 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033.md)

"Its boundary was (its territory reached) from Heleph, from the
oak-forest at Zaanannim, and Adami Nekeb and Jabneel to Lakkum; and its
outgoings were the Jordan." Heleph is unknown, though in all probability
it was to the south of Zaanannim, and not very far distant. According to
[Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md), the oak-forest (allon: see
the remarks on [Gen 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006).md) at Zaanannim
was near Kedesh, on the north-west of Lake Huleh. There are still many
oaks in that neighbourhood (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 386); and on the south of
Bint Jebail Robinson crossed a low mountain-range which was covered with
small oak trees (Pal. iii. p. 372). Adami hannekeb, i.e., Adami of the
pass (Nekeb, judging from the analogy of the Arabic, signifying foramen,
via inter montes), is supposed by Knobel to be Deir-el-ahmar, i.e., red
cloister, a place which is still inhabited, three hours to the
north-west of Baalbek, on the pass from the cedars to Baalbek (Seetzen,
i. pp. 181, 185; Burckhardt, Syr. p. 60; and Ritter, Erdk. xvii. p.
150), so called from the reddish colour of the soil in the
neighbourhood, which would explain the name Adami. Knobel also connects
Jabneel with the lake Jemun, Jemuni, or Jammune, some hours to the
north-west of Baalbek, on the eastern side of the western Lebanon range
(Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 548; Ritter, xvii. pp. 304ff.), where there are
still considerable ruins of a very early date to be found, especially
the ruins of an ancient temple and a celebrated place of pilgrimage,
with which the name "god's building" agrees. And lastly, he associates
Lakkum with the mountains of Lokham, as the northern part of Lebanon on
the Syrian mountains, from the latitude of Laodicea to that of Antioch
on the western side of the Orontes, is called by the Arabian geographers
Isztachri, Abulfeda, and others. So far as the names are concerned,
these combinations seem appropriate enough, but they are hardly tenable.
The resemblance between the names Lakkum and Lokham is only in
appearance, as the Hebrew name is written with ק and the Arabic with כ.
Moreover, the mountains of Lokham are much too far north for the name to
be adduced as an explanation of Lakkum. The interpretation of Adami
Nekeb and Jabneel is also irreconcilable with the circumstance that the
lake Jamun was two hours to the west of the red convent, so that the
boundary, which starts from the west, and is drawn first of all towards
the north, and then to the north-east and east, must have run last of
all from the red convent, and not from the Jamun lake to the Jordan. As
Jabneel is mentioned after Adami Nekeb, it must be sought for to the
east of Adami Nekeb, whereas the Jamun lake lies in the very opposite
direction, namely, directly to the west of the red convent. The three
places mentioned, therefore, cannot be precisely determined at present.
The Jordan, where the boundary of Asher terminated, was no doubt the
upper Jordan, or rather the Nahr Hasbany, one of the sources of the
Jordan, which formed, together with the Huleh lake and the Jordan
itself, between Lake Huleh and the Sea of Tiberias, and down to the
point where it issues from the latter, the eastern boundary of Asher.

[Jos 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034.md)

From the Jordan below the Lake of Tiberias, or speaking more exactly,
from the point at which the Wady Bessum enters the Jordan, "the boundary
(of Asher) turned westwards to Asnoth-tabor, and went thence out to
Hukkok." This boundary, i.e., the southern boundary of Asher, probably
followed the course of the Wady Bessum from the Jordan, which wady was
the boundary of Issachar on the north-east, and then ran most likely
from Kefr Sabt (see at [Jos 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#022).md) to
Asnoth-tabor, i.e., according to the Onom. (s. v. Azanoth), a vicus ad
regionem Diocaesareae pertinens in campestribus, probably on the
south-east of Diocaesarea, i.e., Sepphoris, not far from Tabor, to which
the boundary of Issachar extended ([Jos
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#022).md). Hukkok has not yet been
traced. Robinson (Bibl. Res. p. 82) and Van de Velde (Mem. p. 322) are
inclined to follow Rabbi Parchi of the fourteenth century, and identify
this place with the village of Yakk, on the north-west of the Lake of
Gennesareth; but this village is too far to the north-east to have
formed the terminal point of the southern boundary of Naphtali, as it
ran westwards from the Jordan. After this Naphtali touched "Zebulun on
the south, Asher on the west, and Judah by the Jordan toward the
sun-rising or east." "The Jordan" is in apposition to "Judah," in the
sense of "Judah of the Jordan," like "Jordan of Jericho" in [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001.md); [Num
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#003.md), etc. The Masoretic pointing,
which separates these two words, was founded upon some false notion
respecting this definition of the boundary, and caused the commentators
great perplexity, until C. v. Raumer succeeded in removing the
difficulty, by showing that the district of the sixty towns of Jair,
which was upon the eastern side of the Jordan, is called Judah here, or
reckoned as belonging to Judah, because Jair, the possessor of these
towns, was a descendant of Judah on the father's side through Hezron
([Ch1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#005.md), [Ch1
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021).md); whereas in [Jos
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#030.md), and [Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md), he is reckoned contra morem,
i.e., against the rule laid down in [Num
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#007.md), as a descendant of Manasseh, on
account of his descent from Machir the Manassite, on his mother's side.

(Note: See C. v. Raumer's article on "Judaea on the east of Jordan," in
Tholuck's litt. Anz. 1834, Nos. 1 and 2, and his Palstina, pp. 233ff.
ed. 4; and for the arbitrary attempts that had been made to explain the
passage by alterations of the text and in other ways, see Rosenmller's
Bibl. Alterthk. ii. 1, pp. 301-2; and Keil's Comm. on Joshua, pp.
438-9.)

[Jos 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035.md)

The fortified towns of Naphtali were the following. Ziddim: unknown,
though Knobel suggests that "it may possibly be preserved in Chirbet es
Saudeh, to the west of the southern extremity of the Lake of Tiberias
(Rob. iii. App.);" but this place is to the west of the Wady Bessum,
i.e., in the territory of Issachar. Zer is also unknown. As the lxx and
Syriac give the name as Zor, Knobel connects it with Kerak, which
signifies fortress as well as Zor (= מצור), a heap of ruins at the
southern end of the lake (Rob. iii. p. 263), the place which Josephus
calls Taricheae (see Reland, p. 1026), - a very doubtful combination!
Hammath (i.e., thermae), a Levitical town called Hammaoth-dor in [Jos
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032.md), and Hammon in [Ch1
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md), was situated, according to
statements in the Talmud, somewhere near the later city of Tiberias, on
the western shore of the Lake of Gennesareth, and was no doubt identical
with the κώμεε Αμμαούς in the neighbourhood of Tiberias, a place with
warm baths (Jos. Ant. xviii. 2, 3; Bell. Judg. iv. 1, 3). There are warm
springs still to be found half an hour to the south of Tabaria, which
are used as baths (Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 573-4; Rob. iii. pp. 258ff.).
Rakkath (according to the Talm. and Rabb. ripa littus) was situated,
according to rabbinical accounts, in the immediate neighbourhood of
Hammath, and was the same place as Tiberias; but the account given by
Josephus (Ant. xviii. 2, 3; cf. Bell. Judg. ii. 9, 1) respecting the
founding of Tiberias by Herod the tetrarch is at variance with this; so
that the rabbinical statements appear to have no other foundation than
the etymology of the name Rakkath. Chinnereth is given in the Targums as
גניסר, גינוסר, גּנּוסר, i.e., Γεννησάρ. According to Josephus (Bell.
Jud. iii. 10, 8), this name was given to a strip of land on the shore of
the Sea of Galilee, which was distinguished for its natural beauty, its
climate, and its fertility, namely the long plain, about twenty minutes
broad and an hour long, which stretches along the western shore of this
lake, from el-Mejdel on the south to Khan Minyeh on the north
(Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 558-9; Rob. iii. pp. 279, 290). It must have been
in this plain that the town of Chinnereth stood, from which the plain
and lake together derived the name of Chinnereth ([Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017).md) or Chinneroth ([Jos
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002).md), and the lake alone the name of
"Sea of Chinnereth," or "Sea of Chinneroth" ([Jos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003.md); [Jos
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027.md); [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011).md).

[Jos 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#036.md)

Adamah is unknown. Knobel is of opinion, that as Adamah signifies red,
the place referred to may possibly be Ras el Ahmar, i.e., red-head, on
the north of Safed (Rob. iii. p. 370; Bibl. Res. p. 69). Ramah is the
present Rameh (Ramea), a large well-built village, inhabited by
Christians and Druses, surrounded by extensive olive plantations, and
provided with an excellent well. It stands upon the slope of a mountain,
in a beautiful plain on the south-west of Safed, but without any relics
of antiquity (see Seetzen, ii. p. 129; Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 78-9). Hazor
has not yet been traced with certainty (see at [Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001).md).

[Jos 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#037.md)

Kedesh (see at [Jos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002).md). Edrei, a
different place from the town of the same name in Bashan ([Jos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002.md), [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004).md), is still unknown. En-hazor is
probably to be sought for in Bell Hazur and Ain Hazur, which is not very
far distant, on the south-west of Rameh, though the ruins upon Tell
Hazur are merely the ruins of an ordinary village, with one single
cistern that has fallen to pieces (Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 80, 81).

[Jos 19:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#038.md)

Jireon (Iron) is probably the present village of Jarn, an hour to the
south-east of Bint-Jebeil, with the ruins of an ancient Christian church
(Seetzen, ii. pp. 123-4; Van de Velde, R. i. p. 133). Migdal-el, so far
as the name is concerned, might be Magdala ([Mat
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#039).md), on the western shore of the
Lake of Gennesareth, between Capernaum and Tiberias (Rob. iii. pp.
279ff.); the only difficulty is, that the towns upon this lake have
already been mentioned in [Jos 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035.md).
Knobel connects Migdal-el with Chorem, so as to form one name, and finds
Migdal el Chorem in the present Mejdel Kerum, on the west of Rameh
(Seetzen, ii. p. 130; Van de Velde, i. p. 215), a common Mahometan
village. But there is nothing to favour this combination, except the
similarity in sound between the two names; whereas it has against it not
only the situation of the village, which was so far to the west, being
not more than three hours from Acca, that the territory of Naphtali can
hardly have reached so far, but also the very small resemblance between
Chorem and Kerum, not to mention the fact that the accents separate
Chorem from Migdal-el, whilst the omission of the copula (vav) before
Chorem cannot have any weight, as the copula is also wanting before Zer
and Rakkath. Chorem and Beth-anath have not yet been discovered. From
the latter place Naphtali was unable to expel the Canaanites ([Jdg
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#033).md). Beth-shemesh, a different place
from the town of the same name in Issachar ([Jos
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#022).md), is also still unknown. The
total number of towns is given as nineteen, whereas only sixteen are
mentioned by name. It is hardly correct to seek for the missing places
among the border towns mentioned in [Jos
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033.md) and [Jos
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034.md), as the enumeration of the towns
themselves is introduced by מבצר וערי in [Jos
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035.md), and in this way the list of
towns is separated from the description of the boundaries. To this we
may add, that the town of Karthan or Kirjathaim, which Naphtali gave up
to the Levites ([Jos 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032.md); [Ch1
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061).md), does not occur either among the
border towns or in the list of towns, from which we may see that the
list of towns is an imperfect one.

[Joshua 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jos 19:40</span></span>

The Inheritance of the Tribe of Dan. - This fell to the west of
Benjamin, between Judah and Ephraim, and was formed by Judah giving up
some of its northern towns, and Ephraim some of its southern towns, to
the Danites, so as to furnish them with a territory proportionate to
their number. It was situated for the most part in the lowland
(shephelah), including, however, the hill country between the
Mediterranean and the mountains, and extended over a portion of the
plain of Sharon, so that it belonged to one of the most fruitful
portions of Palestine. The boundaries are not given, because they could
be traced from those of the adjoining territories.

[Jos 19:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#041.md)

From Judah the families of Dan received Zorea and Eshtaol (see at [Jos
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).md), and Ir-shemesh, also called
Beth-shemesh ([Kg1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#009).md), on the border
of Judah (see [Jos 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010).md); but of
these the Danites did not take possession, as they were given up by
Judah to the Levites ([Jos 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#016.md) : see
at [Jos 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010).md). Saalabbin, or Saalbim,
which remained in the hands of the Canaanites ([Jdg
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#035).md), is frequently mentioned in the
history of David and Solomon ([Sa2
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#032.md); [Ch1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#033.md); [Kg1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#009).md). It may possibly be the present
Selbt (Rob. iii. App.; Bibl. Res. p. 144), some distance to the north of
the three places mentioned (Knobel). Ajalon, which was also not taken
from the Canaanites ([Jdg 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#035).md), was
assigned to the Levites ([Jos 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#024.md);
[Ch1 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054).md). It is mentioned in the
wars with the Philistines ([Sa1 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#031.md);
[Ch1 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013).md), was fortified by Rehoboam
([Ch2 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#010).md), and was taken by the
Philistines from King Ahaz ([Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018).md). It has been preserved in the
village of Yalo (see at [Jos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012).md).
Jethlah is only mentioned here, and has not yet been discovered. So far
as the name is concerned, it may possibly be preserved in the Wady
Atallah, on the west of Yalo (Bibl. Res. pp. 143-4).

[Jos 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#043.md)

Elon, which is mentioned again in [Kg1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#009.md), with the addition of Beth-hanan,
has not yet been traced; according to Knobel, it "may possibly be Ellin,
near Timnath and Beth-shemesh, mentioned by Robinson in his Pal. vol.
iii. App." Thimna (Thimnathah) and Ekron, on the boundary of Judah (see
at [Jos 15:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010).md).

[Jos 19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044.md)

Eltekeh and Gibbethon, which were allotted to the Levites ([Jos
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#023).md), have not yet been discovered.
Under the earliest kings of Israel, Gibbethon was in the hands of the
Philistines ([Kg1 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#027.md); [Kg1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md), [Kg1
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#017).md). Baalath was fortified by
Solomon ([Kg1 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#018).md). According to
Josephus (Ant. 8:6, 1), it was "Baleth in the neighbourhood of Geser;"
probably the same place as Baalah, on the border of Judah ([Jos
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#011).md).

[Jos 19:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#045.md)

Jehud has probably been preserved in the village of Jehudieh (Hudieh),
two hours to the north of Ludd (Diospolis), in a splendidly cultivated
plain (Berggren, R. iii. p. 162; Rob. iii. p. 45, and App.). Bene-berak,
the present Ibn Abrak, an hour from Jehud (Scholz, R. p. 256).
Gath-rimmon, which was given to the Levites ([Jos
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#024.md); [Ch1
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054).md), is described in the Onom. (s.
v.) as villa praegrandis in duodecimo milliario Diospoleos pergentibus
Eleutheropolin, - a statement which points to the neighbourhood of
Thimnah, though it has not yet been discovered.

[Jos 19:46](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#046.md)

Me-jarkon, i.e., aquae flavedinis, and Rakkon, are unknown; but from the
clause which follows, "with the territory before Japho," it must have
been in the neighbourhood of Joppa (Jaffa). "The territory before Japho"
includes the places in the environs of Joppa. Consequently Joppa itself
does not appear to have belonged to the territory of Dan, although,
according to [Jdg 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017.md), the Danites
must have had possession of this town. Japho, the well-known port of
Palestine ([Ch2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#015.md); [Ezr
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007.md); [Jon
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003).md), which the Greeks called Ἰόππη
(Joppa), the present Jaffa (see v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 204-5, and Ritter,
Erdk. xvi. pp. 574ff.).

[Jos 19:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047.md)

Besides this inheritance, the Danites of Zorea and Eshtaol went, after
Joshua's death, and conquered the town of Leshem or Laish, on the
northern boundary of Canaan, and gave it the name of Dan, as the
territory which was allotted to them under Joshua was too small for
them, on account of their inability to drive out the Amorites from
several of their towns ([Jdg 1:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034.md);
[Jdg 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#002).md). For further particulars
concerning this conquest, see Judg 18. Leshem or Laish ([Jdg
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md), [Jdg
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027).md), i.e., Dan, which the Onom.
describes as viculus quarto a Paneade milliario euntibus Tyrum, was the
present Tell el Kadi, or el Leddan, the central source of the Jordan, to
the west of Banjas, a place with ancient ruins (see Rob. iii. p. 351;
Bibl. Res. pp. 390, 393). It was there that Jeroboam set up the golden
calves ([Kg1 12:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029), etc..md); and it
is frequently mentioned as the northernmost city of the Israelites, in
contrast with Beersheba, which was in the extreme south of the land
([Jdg 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md); [Sa1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#020.md); [Sa2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#010.md) : see also Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp.
207ff.).

[Joshua 19:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">jos 19:49</span></span>

Conclusion of the Distribution of the Land. - [Jos
19:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#049.md), [Jos
19:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050.md). When the land was distributed
among the tribes according to its territories, the Israelites gave
Joshua an inheritance in the midst of them, according to the command of
Jehovah, namely the town of Timnath-serah, upon the mountains of
Ephraim, for which he asked, and which he finished building; and there
he dwelt until the time of his death ([Jos
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#030.md); [Jdg
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#009).md). "According to the word of the
Lord" (lit. "at the mouth of Jehovah") does not refer to a divine oracle
communicated through the high priest, but to a promise which Joshua had
probably received from God at the same time as Caleb, viz., in Kadesh,
but which, like the promise given to Caleb, is not mentioned in the
Pentateuch (see at [Jos 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md); [Jos
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#009).md). Timnath-serah, called
Timnath-heres in [Jdg 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#009.md), must not be
confounded with Timnah in the tribe of Dan ([Jos
19:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#043.md); [Jos
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010).md), as is the case in the Onom. It
has been preserved in the present ruins and foundation walls of a place
called Tibneh, which was once a large town, about seven hours to the
north of Jerusalem, and two hours to the west of Jiljilia, standing upon
two mountains, with many caverns that have been used as graves (see Eli
Smith in Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 562ff., and Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 141).

[Joshua 19:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">jos 19:51</span></span>

Closing formula to the account of the distribution of the land, which
refers primarily to [Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md)., as the
expression "in Shiloh" shows, but which also includes Josh 14-17.
