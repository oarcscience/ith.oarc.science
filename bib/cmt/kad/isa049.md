### [Isaiah Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 49:1</span></span>

The very same person who was introduced by Jehovah in [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md). here speaks for himself,
commencing thus in [Isa 49:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md) :
"Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye nations afar off: Jehovah
hath called me from the womb; from my mother's lap hath He remembered my
name. And He made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of His hand
hath He hid me, and made me into a polished shaft; in His quiver hath He
concealed me. And He said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, thou in
whom I glorify myself." Although the speaker is called Israel in [Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md), he must not be regarded as
either a collective person representing all Israel, or as the collective
personality of the kernel of Israel, which answered to its true idea. It
is not the former, because in [Isa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md) he is expressly distinguished
from the nation itself, which is the immediate object of his special
work as restorer and (according to [Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md) and [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006).md) covenant-mediator also; not the
latter, because the nation, whose restoration he effects, according to
[Isa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md), was not something distinct
from the collective personality of the "servant of Jehovah" in a
national sense, but rather the entire body of the "servants of Jehovah"
or remnant of Israel (see, for example, [Isa
65:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008).md). Moreover, it cannot be
either of these, because what he affirms of himself is expressed in such
terms of individuality, that they cannot be understood as employed in a
collective sense at all, more especially where he speaks of his mother's
womb. In every other case in which Israel is spoken of in this way, we
find only "from the womb" (mibbeten, [Isa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002.md), [Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024.md); [Isa
56:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003.md), along with minnı̄-racham; also
[Isa 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008).md), without the addition of אם
(mother), which is quite unsuitable to the collective body of the nation
(except in such allegorical connections as [Isa
51:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md), and [Eze
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003).md). Is it then possibly the
prophet, who is here speaking of himself and refers in [Isa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md) to his own mother (compare אמּי
in [Jer 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010.md); [Jer
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md), [Jer
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#017).md)? This is very improbable, if
only because the prophet, who is the medium of the word of God in these
prophecies, has never placed himself in the foreground before. In [Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md) he merely speaks of himself
indirectly; in [Isa 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026.md), even if he
refer to himself at all (which we greatly doubt), it is only
objectively; and in [Isa 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md), the
other person, into whose words the words of Jehovah pass, cannot be the
prophet, for the simple reason that the transition of the words of
Jehovah into those of His messenger is essentially different in this
instance from the otherwise frequent interchange of the words of Jehovah
and those of His prophet, and also because the messenger of Jehovah
speaks of himself there, after the "former things" have come to pass, as
the mediator (either in word or deed) of the "new things" which were
never heard of before, but are to be expected now; whereas the author of
these addresses was also the prophet of the "former things," and
therefore the messenger referred to rises up within the course of sacred
history predicted by the author of these prophecies. Moreover, what the
speaker in this case ([Isa 49:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001).md)
says of himself is so unique, so glorious, that it reaches far beyond
the vocation and performance of any single prophet, or, in fact, of any
individual man subject to the limitations of human life and human
strength.

There is nothing else left, therefore, than to suppose that the idea
implied in the expression "servant of Jehovah" is condensed in this
instance, as in [Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md)., into that
of a single person. When it is expanded to its widest circumference, the
"servant of Jehovah" is all Israel; when it only covers its smaller and
inner circle, it is the true people of Jehovah contained within the
entire nation, like the kernel in the shell (see the definition of this
at [Isa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007.md); [Isa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010.md); [Psa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md); [Psa
73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015).md); but here it goes back to its
very centre. The "servant of Jehovah," in this central sense, is the
heart of Israel. From this heart of Israel the stream of salvation flows
out, first of all through the veins of the people of God, and thence
through the veins of the nations generally. Just as Cyrus is the
world-power in person, as made subservient to the people of God, so the
servant of Jehovah, who is speaking here, is Israel in person, as
promoting the glorification of Jehovah in all Israel, and in all the
world of nations: in other words, it is He in whom the true nature of
Israel is concentrated like a sun, in whom the history of Israel is
coiled up as into a knot for a further and final development, in whom
Israel's world-wide calling to be the Saviour of mankind, including
Israel itself, is fully carried out; the very same who took up the word
of Jehovah in [Isa 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md), in the full
consciousness of His fellowship with Him, declaring Himself to be His
messenger who had now appeared. It must not be forgotten, moreover, that
throughout these prophecies the breaking forth of salvation, not for
Israel only, but for all mankind, is regarded as bound up with the
termination of the captivity; and from this its basis, the restoration
of the people who were then in exile, it is never separated. This fact
is of great importance in relation to the question of authorship, and
favours the conclusion that they emanated from a prophet who lived
before the captivity, and not in the midst of it. Just as in chapter 7
Isaiah sees the son of the virgin grow up in the time of the Assyrian
oppressions, and then sees his kingdom rising up on the ruins of the
Assyrian; so does he here behold the servant of Jehovah rising up in the
second half of the captivity, as if born in exile, in the midst of the
punishment borne by his people, to effect the restoration of Israel. At
the present time, when he begins to speak, coming forward without any
further introduction, and speaking in his own name (a unique instance of
dramatic style, which goes beyond even [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001).md), he has already left behind
him the commencement of his work, which was directed towards the
salvation of mankind. His appeal is addressed to the "isles," which had
been frequently mentioned already when the evangelization of the heathen
was spoken of ([Isa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md), [Isa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010.md), [Isa
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#012.md); cf., [Isa
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#015).md), and to the "nations from
afar," i.e., the distant nations (as in [Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md); compare, on the other hand, [Jer
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023).md). They are to hear what he says,
not merely what he says in the words that follow, but what he says
generally. What follows is rather a vindication of his right to demand a
hearing and obedience, then the discourse itself, which is to be
received with the obedience of faith; at the same time, the two are most
intimately connected. Jehovah has called him ab utero, has thought of
his name from the bowels of his mother (מעי as in [Psa
71:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#006).md), i.e., even before he was born;
ever since his conception has Jehovah assigned to him his calling, viz.,
his saving calling. We call to mind here [Jer
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005.md); [Luk
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#041.md); [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md), but above all the name Immanuel,
which is given by anticipation to the Coming One in [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md), and the name Jesus, which God
appointed through the mouth of angels, when the human life of Him who
was to bear that name was still ripening in the womb of the Virgin ([Mat
1:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020).md). It is worthy of notice,
however, that the great Coming One, though he is described in the Old
Testament as one who is to be looked for "from the seed of David," is
also spoken of as "born of a woman," whenever his entrance into the
world is directly referred to. In the Protevangelium he is called,
though not in an individual sense, "the seed of the woman;" Isaiah, in
the time of Ahaz, mentions "the virgin" as his mother; Micah ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002).md) speaks of his יולדה; even the
typical psalms, as in [Psa 22:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010.md),
give prominence to the mother. And is not this a sign that prophecy is a
work of the Spirit, who searches out the deep things of the counsel of
God?

In [Isa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002.md) the speaker says still
further, that Jehovah has made his mouth kecherebh chaddâh (like a sharp
sword), namely, that he may overcome everything that resists him as if
with a sharp sword, and sever asunder things that are bound up together
in a pernicious bond ([Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md); [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012).md); also that He has made him into
chēts bârūr (not βέλος εκλεκτόν, lxx, but, as in [Jer
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md), cleaned,

(Note: The comparison to purus is one that naturally suggests itself;
but this, like putus, is derived from a root pū.)

polished, sharpened, pointed), namely, to pierce the hearts ([Psa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006).md), and inflict upon them the most
wholesome wounds; and again, that Jehovah has hidden him under the
shadow of His almighty hand, and kept him concealed in the quiver of His
loving counsel, just girt as men keep their swords and arrows in sheaths
and quivers ready for the time when they want to use them, in order that
in the fulness of time He might draw out this His sword, and put this
His arrow to the bow. The question whether the allusion here is to the
time preceding the foreknown period of his coming, or whether it is to
eternity that the words refer, does not present any great dilemma; at
the same time, the prophecy in this instance only traces back the being
of the person, who now appears, to the remotest point of his historical
coming. [Isa 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md) describes, without
any figure, what Jehovah has made him. He has said to him (cf., [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007).md): Thou art my servant; thou art
Israel, in whom (in quo, as in [Isa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023).md) I glorify myself. Schenkel's
exposition is grammatically impossible: "(It is) in Israel that I will
glorify myself through thee." The servant himself is called Israel. We
call to mind here the expression in [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md), "Thou art Peter;" and the use
of the name "Israel," as the individuation of a generic name, reminds us
of the fact that the kings of a nation are sometimes called by the name
of the nation itself (e.g., Asshur, [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005)..md). But Israel was from the very
first the God-given name of an individual. Just as the name Israel was
first of all given to a man, and then after that to a nation, so the
name which sprang from a personal root has also a personal crown. The
servant of Jehovah is Israel in person, inasmuch as the purpose of
mercy, upon the basis of which and for the accomplishment of which
Jehovah made Jacob the father of the twelve-tribed nation, is brought by
him into full and final realization. We have already seen that Israel,
as an entire nation, formed the basis of the idea contained in the term
"servant of Jehovah;" Israel, regarded as a people faithful to its
calling, the centre; and the personal servant of Jehovah its apex. In
the present instance, where he is called distinctly "Israel," the fact
is clearly expressed, that the servant of Jehovah in these prophecies is
regarded as the kernel of the kernel of Israel, as Israel's inmost
centre, as Israel's highest head. He it is in whom (i.e., on whom and
through whom) Jehovah glorifies Himself, inasmuch as He carried out
through him the counsels of His love, which are the self-glorification
of His holy love, its glory and its triumph.

[Isaiah 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 49:4</span></span>

In the next v. the speaker meets the words of divine calling and promise
with a complaint, which immediately silences itself, however. "And I, I
said, I have wearied myself in vain, and thrown away my strength for
nothing and to no purpose; yet my right is with Jehovah, and my reward
with my God." The Vav with which the v. opens introduces the apparent
discrepancy between the calling he had received, and the apparent
failure of his work. אכן, however, denotes the conclusion which might be
drawn from this, that there was neither reality nor truth in his call.
The relation between the clauses is exactly the same as that in [Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md) and [Jon
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#005.md) (where we find אך, which is more
rarely used in this adversative sense); compare also [Psa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007) (but I said.md), and the psalm of
Hezekiah in [Isa 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010.md) with the
antithesis in [Psa 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#015.md). In the midst
of his activity no fruit was to be seen, and the thought came upon him,
that it was a failure; but this disturbance of his rejoicing in his
calling was soon quieted in the confident assurance that his mishpât
(i.e., his good right in opposition to all contradiction and resistance)
and his "work" (i.e., the result and fruit of the work, which is
apparently in vain) are with Jehovah, and laid up with Him until the
time when He will vindicate His servant's right, and crown his labour
with success. We must not allow ourselves to be led astray by such
parallels as [Isa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010.md); [Isa
62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011.md). The words are not spoken in a
collective capacity any more than in the former part of the verse; the
lamentation of Israel as a people, in [Isa
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#027.md), is expressed very differently.

[Isaiah 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 49:5</span></span>

The expression "and now" (ועתּה), which follows, evidently indicates a
fresh turn in the official life of the person speaking here. At the same
time, it is evident that it is the failure of his labours within his own
people, which has forced out the lamentation in [Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md). For his reason for addressing
his summons in [Isa 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md) to the world
of nations, is that Jehovah has not guaranteed to him, the undaunted
one, success to his labours among his own people, but has assigned him a
mission extending far beyond and reaching to all mankind. "And now,
saith Jehovah, that formed me from the womb to be His servant, to bring
back Jacob to Him, and that Israel may be gathered together to Him; and
I am honoured in the eyes of Jehovah, and my God has become my strength.
He saith, It is only a small thing that thou becomest my servant, to set
up the tribes of Jacob, and to bring back the preserved of Israel. I
have set thee for the light of the Gentiles, to become my salvation to
the end of the earth." Both shōbhēbh and hâshı̄bh unite within themselves
the meanings reducere ([Jer 50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019).md) and
restituere. On לא = לו generally, see at [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md); [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md). Jerome is wrong in his
rendering, et Israel qui non congregabitur (what could a prophecy of the
rejection of the Jews do here?); so also is Hitzig's rendering, "since
Israel is not swept away;" and Hofmann's, "Israel, which is not swept
away." In the present instance, where the restoration of Israel is the
event referred to, אצף must signify "the gathering together of Israel,"
as in [Isa 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012). לו (parallel אליו.md)
points to Jehovah as the author of the gathering, and as the object of
it also. The transition from the infinitive of design to the finite verb
of desire, is the same as in [Isa
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md); [Isa
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025.md). The attributive clause, added
to the name Jehovah, expresses the lofty mission of the servant of God
with regard to Israel. The parenthesis, "I have honour in the eyes of
Jehovah, and my God has become my strength, i.e., has become mighty in
me, the apparently weak one," looks beyond to the still loftier mission,
by which the former lofty one is far surpassed. On account of this
parenthetically inserted praise of Jehovah, the אמר is resumed in
ויּאמר. Instead of נקל היותך (compare [Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031).md), i.e., it is a small thing that
thou shouldst be, we have it here, as in [Eze
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017.md), with a comparative min, which
must not, however, be logically pressed: "It is smaller than that,"
i.e., it is too small a thing that thou shouldst be. The netsı̄rē (Keri,
netsūrē) of Israel are those who have been preserved in exile ([Eze
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#012).md); in other cases, we find שׁאר,
שׁארית, or פּלטה. Not only is the restoration of the remnant of Israel
the work of the servant of Jehovah; but Jehovah has appointed him for
something higher than this. He has given or set him for the light of the
heathen ("a light to lighten the Gentiles," [Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032).md), to become His salvation to the
end of the earth (lxx: τοῦ εἶναι σε εἰς σωτηρίαν ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς).
Those who regard Israel as a nation as speaking here (e.g., Hitzig,
Ewald, Umbreit, etc.) go right away from this, which is the most natural
sense of the words, and explain them as meaning, "that my salvation may
be, reach, or penetrate to the end of the earth." But inasmuch as the
servant of Jehovah is the light of the world, he is through that very
fact the salvation of the world; and he is both of these through
Jehovah, whose counsels of ישׁוּעה are brought by him into historical
realization and visible manifestation.

[Isaiah 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 49:7</span></span>

The words of the servant of God, in which he enforces his claim upon the
nations, are now lost in words of Jehovah to him, which are no longer
reported by him, but are appended as an independent address. His present
condition is one of the deepest humiliation. "Thus saith Jehovah, the
Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, to him of contemptible soul, to the
abhorrence of the people, to the servant of tyrants: kings shall see and
arise; princes, and prostrate themselves for the sake of Jehovah, who is
faithful, the Holy One of Israel, that He hath chosen thee." As bâzōh
with a changeable kamtez (cf., châmōts, [Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017).md) has, if not exactly a passive
force, yet something very like a passive circumstantial meaning,
בּזה־נפשׁ must mean the man who is contemptible as regards his soul,
i.e., held in contempt, or, as Hofmann explains it, whom men do not
think worthy to live (though he follows Ewald, and takes bezōh as an
infinitive treated as a substantive). Accordingly מתעב is also to be
taken personally. The meaning abhorring is unsuitable; but תּעב is also
used in a causative sense, to cause to abhor, i.e., to make a thing an
abomination ([Eze 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#025).md), or to excite
abhorrence: hence, "to him who excites the people's abhorrence," which
is the same, so far as the sense is concerned, as "to the object of
their abhorrence." But even as a participial substantive מתעב would
literally mean the thing exciting abhorrence, i.e., the abhorrence, just
as mekhasseh in [Isa 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md) signifies
the thing covering, i.e., the covering. All these participial
substantives of the piel indicate the thing, place, or instrument
accomplishing that which the piel affirms. We need not raise the
question whether gōi refers to Israel or to the heathen. It signifies
the mass of men, the people, like ‛âm in [Psa
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009.md), and in those passages in which
it is used by our prophet for the human race generally. The mōsheilim,
of whom the person here addressed is the servant or enslaved one, are
obviously heathen tyrants. What is here affirmed of the "one servant of
Jehovah" was no doubt also applicable to the nation generally, and more
especially to that portion of the nation which was true to its calling
and confession. He in whom Israel's relation of servant to Jehovah was
fully realized, did indeed spring out of His own nation, when it was
under the oppression of the powers of this world; and all the shame and
persecution which those who remained faithful among His people had to
endure from the heathen oppressors, and also from the ungodly among
their own countrymen (see, for example, [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005).md), discharge their force like a
violent storm upon Him as an individual. When, therefore, we find the
sufferings of the people and the glory of which they became partakers
described in other passages in just the same terms, we must not infer
from this that "servant of Jehovah" is a collective epithet in the
passage before us. The person addressed here is the Restorer of Israel,
the Light of the Gentiles, the Salvation of Jehovah for all mankind.
When kings and princes shall behold Him who was once brought so low,
delivered from His humiliation, and exalted to the glorious height of
the work to which He has been called, they will rise up with reverence
from their thrones, and prostrate themselves upon the ground in worship
for the sake of Jehovah, as before Him who (אשׁר emphatic, utpote qui)
is faithful, showing Himself sincere in His promises, and for the sake
of the Holy One of Israel, in that, as is now made manifest, "He hath
chosen thee." The fut. consec. particularizes the general motive
assigned, and carries it still further.

[Isaiah 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 49:8</span></span>

The next two vv. describe (though only with reference to Israel, the
immediate circle) what is the glory of the vocation to which Jehovah, in
accordance with His promise, exalts His chosen One. "Thus saith Jehovah,
In a time of favour have I heard thee, and in the day of salvation have
I helped thee: and I form thee, and set thee for a covenant of the
people, to raise up the land, to apportion again desolate inheritances,
saying to prisoners, Go ye out: to those who are in darkness, Come ye to
the light." Jehovah heard His servant, and came to his help when he
prayed to Him out of the condition of bondage to the world, which he
shared with his people. He did it at the time for the active display of
His good pleasure, and for the realizing of salvation, which had been
foreseen by Him, and had now arrived. The futures which follow are to be
taken as such. The fact that Jehovah makes His servant "a covenant of
the people," i.e., the personal bond which unites Israel and its God in
a new fellowship (see [Isa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006).md), is
the fruit of his being heard and helped. The infinitives with Lamed
affirm in what way the new covenant relation will be made manifest. The
land that has fallen into decay rises into prosperity again, and the
desolate possessions return to their former owners. This manifestation
of the covenant grace, that has been restored to the nation again, is
effected through the medium of the servant of Jehovah. The rendering of
the lxx is quite correct: τοῦ καταστῆσαι τὴν γῆν καὶ κληρονομῆσαι
κληρονομίας ἐρήμους λέγοντα לאמר is a dicendo governed by both
infinitives. The prisoners in the darkness of the prison and of
affliction are the exiles ([Isa
42:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#022).md). The mighty word of the servant
of Jehovah brings to them the light of liberty, in connection with which
(as has been already more than once observed) the fact should be
noticed, that the redemption is viewed in connection with the
termination of the captivity, and, in accordance with the peculiar
character of the Old Testament, is regarded as possessing a national
character, and therefore is purely external.

The person of the servant of Jehovah now falls into the background
again, and the prophecy proceeds with a description of the return of the
redeemed. "They shall feed by the ways, and there is pasture for them
upon all field-hills. They shall not hunger nor thirst, and the mirage
and sun shall not blind them: for He that hath mercy on them shall lead
them, and guide them by bubbling water-springs. And I make all my
mountains ways, and my roads are exalted. Behold these, they come from
afar; and, behold, these from the north and from the sea; and these from
the land of the Sinese." The people returning home are represented as a
flock. By the roads that they take to their homes, they are able to
obtain sufficient pasture, without being obliged to go a long way round
in order to find a sufficient supply; and even upon bare sandy hills
([Isa 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018).md) there is pasture found
for them. Nothing is wanting; even the shârâb (see [Isa
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#007).md) and the sun do not hurt them,
the former by deceiving and leading astray, the latter by wearying them
with its oppressive heat: for He whose compassion has been excited by
their long pining misery ([Isa
41:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017).md) is leading them, and
bringing them along in comfort by bubbling springs of real and
refreshing water (ינחל, as Petrarch once says of shepherds, Move la
schira sua soavemente). Jehovah also makes all the mountains into roads
for those who are returning home, and the paths of the desert are lifted
up, as it were, into well-made roads (yerumūn, Ges. 47, Anm. 4). They
are called my mountains and my highways (differently from [Isa
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025).md), because they are His creation;
and therefore He is also able to change them, and now really does change
them for the good of His people, who are returning to the land of their
forefathers out of every quarter of the globe. Although in [Psa
107:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#003) yâm (the sea.md) appears to stand
for the south, as referring to the southern part of the Mediterranean,
which washes the coast of Egypt, there is no ground at all in the
present instance for regarding it as employed in any other than its
usual sense, namely the west; mērâchōq (from far) is therefore either
the south (cf., [Isa 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006).md) or the
east, according to the interpretation that we give to 'erets Sı̄nı̄m, as
signifying a land to the east or to the south.

The Phoenician Sinim (Ges. [Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017).md), the inhabitants of a fortified
town in the neighbourhood of Area, which has now disappeared, but which
was seen not only by Jerome, but also by Mariono Sanuto (de castro
Arachas ad dimidiam leucam est oppidum Sin), cannot be thought of, for
the simple reason that this Sin was too near, and was situated to the
west of Babylon and to the north of Jerusalem; whilst Sin (= Pelusium)
in Egypt, to which Ewald refers, did not give its name to either a tribe
or a land. Arias Montanus was among the first to suggest that the Sinim
are the Sinese (Chinese); and since the question has been so thoroughly
discussed by Gesenius (in his Commentary and Thesaursu), most of the
commentators, and also such Orientalists as Langles (in his Recherches
asiatiques), Movers (in his Phoenicians), Lassen (in his Indische
Alterthumskunde, i. 856-7), have decided in favour of this opinion. The
objection brought against the supposition, that the name of the Chinese
was known to the nations of the west at so early a period as this, viz.,
that this could not have been the case till after the reign of the
emperor Shi-hoang-ti, of the dynasty of Thsin, who restored the empire
that had been broken up into seven smaller kingdoms (in the year 247
b.c.), and through whose celebrated reign the name of his dynasty came
to be employed in the western nations as the name of China generally, is
met by Lassen with the simple fact that the name occurs at a much
earlier period than this, and in many different forms, as the name of
smaller states into which the empire was broken up after the reign of
Wu-wang (1122-1115 b.c.). "The name Θῖναι (Strabo), Σῖναι (Ptol.),
Τζίνιτζα (Kosmas), says the Sinologist Neumann, did not obtain currency
for the first time from the founder of the great dynasty of Tsin; but
long before this, Tsin was the name of a feudal kingdom of some
importance in Shen-si, one of the western provinces of the Sinese land,
and Fei-tse, the first feudal king of Tsin, began to reign as early as
897 b.c." It is quite possible, therefore, that the prophet, whether he
were Isaiah or any other, may have heard of the land of the Sinese in
the far east, and this is all that we need assume; not that Sinese
merchants visited the market of the world on the Euphrates (Movers and
Lassen), but only that information concerning the strange people who
were so wealthy in rare productions, had reached the remote parts of the
East through the medium of commerce, possibly from Ophir, and through
the Phoenicians. But Egli replies: "The seer on the streams of Babel
certainly could not have described any exiles as returning home from
China, if he had not known that some of his countrymen were pining there
in misery, and I most positively affirm that this was not the case."
What is here assumed - namely, that there must have been a Chinese
diaspora in the prophet's own time - is overthrown by what has been
already observed in [Isa 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md); and we
may also see that it is to purely by accident that the land of the
Sinese is given as the farthest point to the east, from my
communications concerning the Jews of China in the History of the
Post-biblical Poetry of the Jews (1836, pp. 58-62, cf., p. 21). I have
not yet seen Sionnet's work, which has appeared since, viz., Essai sur
les Juifs de la Chine et sur l'influence, qu'ils ont eue sur la
litrature de ce vaste empire, avant l're chrtienne; but I have read the
Mission of Enquiry to the Jews in China in the Jewish Intelligence, May
1851, where a facsimile of their thorah is given. The immigration took
place from Persia (cf., ‛Elâm, [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011).md), at the latest, under the Han
dynasty (205 b.c.-220 a.d.), and certainly before the Christian era.

[Isaiah 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 49:13</span></span>

In this return of the exiles from every quarter of the globe to their
fatherland, and for this mighty work of God on behalf of His church,
which has been scattered in all directions, the whole creation is to
praise Him. "Sing, O heavens; and shout, O earth; and break out into
singing, O mountains! for Jehovah hath comforted His people, and He hath
compassion upon His afflicted ones." The phrase רנּה פּצח, like ורנּן
פּצח (which occurs in [Psa 98:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004.md) as
well as in Isaiah), is peculiarly Isaiah's ([Isa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007.md), and several times in chapters
40-66). "The afflicted ones" (‛ăniyyı̄m) is the usual Old Testament name
for the ecclesia militans. The future alternates with the perfect: the
act of consolation takes place once for all, but the compassion lasts
for ever. Here again the glorious liberty of the children of God appears
as the focus from which the whole world is glorified. The joy of the
Israel of God becomes the joy of heaven and earth. With the summons to
this joy the first half of the prophecy closes; for the word תאמר, which
follows, shows clearly enough that the prophecy has merely reached a
resting-point here, since this word is unsuitable for commencing a fresh
prophecy.

[Isaiah 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 49:14</span></span>

The prophet, looking back at the period of suffering from the standpoint
of the deliverance, exclaims from the midst of this train of thought:
[Isa 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014.md) "Zion said, Jehovah hath
forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me." The period of suffering
which forces out this lamentation still continues. What follows,
therefore, applies to the church of the present, i.e., of the captivity.
[Isa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015.md), [Isa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016.md) "Does a woman forget her sucking
child, so as not to have compassion upon the child of her womb? Even
though mothers should forget, I will not forget thee. Behold, I have
graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls stand continually
before me." In reply to the complaining church, which knows that her
home is in Zion-Jerusalem, and which has been kept so long away from her
home, Jehovah sets forth His love, which is as inalienable as a mother's
love, yea, far greater than even maternal love. On עוּל, the min in
mērachēm is equivalent to ὥστε μή, as in [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md); [Isa
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#010.md); [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md), etc. גּם, so far as the actual
sense is concerned, is equivalent to גּם־כּי (Ewald, 362, b): "granted
that such (mothers) should forget, i.e., disown, their love." The
picture of Zion (not merely the name, as [Isa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016) clearly shows.md) is drawn in the
inside of Jehovah's hands, just as men are accustomed to burn or
puncture ornamental figures and mementoes upon the hand, the arm, and
the forehead, and to colour the punctures with alhenna or indigo (see
Tafel, xii., in vol. ii. pp. 33-35 of Lane's Manners and Customs of the
Modern Egyptians). There is the figure of Zion, unapproachable to every
creature, as close to Him as He is to Himself, and facing Him amidst all
the emotions of His divine life. There has He the walls of Zion
constantly before Him (on neged, see at [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md); [Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023).md); and even if for a time they
are broken down here below, with Him they have an eternal ideal
existence, which must be realized again and again in an increasingly
glorious form.

[Isaiah 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 49:17</span></span>

It is this fact of a renewed glorification which presents itself afresh
to the prophet's mind. "Thy children make haste, thy destroyers and
masters draw out from thee. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all
these assemble themselves together, and come to thee. As truly as I
live, saith Jehovah, thou wilt put them all on like jewellery, and gird
them round thee like a bride." The pointing adopted by the lxx, Targ.,
Jer. and Saad., is בּניך. The antithesis favours this reading; but בּניך
suits [Isa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md), [Isa
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#019.md) better; and the thought that
Zion's children come and restore her fallen walls, follows of itself
from the very antithesis: her children come; and those who destroyed
their maternal home, and made it a desolate ruin, have to depart from
both city and land. Zion is to lift up her eyes, that have been cast
down till now, yea, to lift them up round about; for on all sides those
whom she thought she had lost are coming in dense crowds לך (cf., לא =
לו with אליו, [Isa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005).md), to her,
i.e., henceforth to belong to her again. Jehovah pledges His life (chai
'ănı̄, ζῶν ἐγώ, Ewald, 329, a) that a time of glory is coming for Zion
and her children. כּי in the affirmative sense, springing out of the
confirmative after an affirming oath, equivalent to אם־לא elsewhere
(e.g., [Isa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009).md). The population which
Zion recovers once more, will be to her like the ornaments which a woman
puts on, like the ornamental girdle ([Isa
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020).md) which a bride fastens round her
wedding dress.

[Isaiah 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 49:19</span></span>

Thus will Zion shine forth once more with the multitude of her children
as with a festal adorning. "For thy ruins and thy waste places and thy
land full of ruin - yea, now thou wilt be too narrow for the
inhabitants, and thy devourers are far away. Thy children, that were
formerly taken from thee, shall say in thine ears, The space is too
narrow for me; give way for me, that I may have room." The word "for"
(kı̄) introduces the explanatory reason for the figures just employed of
jewellery and a bridal girdle. Instead of the three subjects, "thy
ruins," etc., the comprehensive "thou" is employed permutatively, and
the sentence commenced afresh. כּי is repeated emphatically in עתּה כּי
(for now, or yea now); this has essentially the same meaning as in the
apodosis of hypothetical protasis (e.g., [Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md); [Gen
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#010).md), except that the sense is more
decidedly affirmative than in the present instance, where one sees it
spring out of the confirmative. Zion, that has been hitherto desolate,
now becomes too small to hold her inhabitants; and her devourers are far
away, i.e., those who took forcible possession of the land and cities,
and made them untenable. עוד is to be understood in accordance with [Psa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md), and בעזניך in accordance with
[Psa 54:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#002.md) (see at [Isa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009).md). It will even come to this, that
the children of which Zion was formerly robbed will call to one another,
so that she becomes a witness with her ears to that which they have so
clearly seen: the space is too narrow, give way (geshâh, from nâgash, to
advance, then to move generally, also to move in an opposite direction,
i.e., to fall back, as in [Gen 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#009).md)
for me, that I may be able to settle down.

[Isaiah 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 49:21</span></span>

The words that sound in the ears of Zion are now followed by the thought
of astonishment and surprise, that rises up in her heart. "And thou wilt
say in thy heart, Who hath borne me these, seeing I was robbed of
children, and barren, banished, and thrust away; and these, who hath
brought them up? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?" She
sees herself suddenly surrounded by a great multitude of children, and
yet she was robbed of children, and galmūdâh (lit. hard, stony, Arab.
'galmad, 'gulmūd, e.g., es-sachr el'gulmūd, the hardest stone, mostly as
a sugstantive, stone or rock, from gâlam, from which comes the Syriac
gelomo, stony ground, related to châlam, whence challâmı̄sh, gravel, root
gal, gam, to press together, or heap up in a lump or mass), i.e., one
who seemed utterly incapacitated for bearing children any more. She
therefore asks, Who hath borne me these (not, who hath begotten, and
which is an absurd question)? She cannot believe that they are the
children of her body, and her children's children. As a tree, whose
foliage is all faded away, is called nōbheleth itself in [Isa
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#030.md), so she calls herself gōlâh
vesūrâh, extorris et remota (sūr = mūsâr, like sūg in [Pro
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#014) = nâsōg or mussâg.md), because her
children have been carried away into exile. In the second question, the
thought has dawned upon her mind, that those by whom she finds herself
surrounded are her own children; but as she was left alone, whilst they
went forth, as she thought to die in a foreign land, she cannot
comprehend where they have been hitherto concealed, or where they have
grown up into so numerous a people.

[Isaiah 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 49:22</span></span>

The prophecy now takes a step backward in the domain of the future, and
describes the manner in which the children of Zion get back to their
home. "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I lift up my hand to
nations, and set up my standard to peoples: and they bring thy sons in
their bosom; and thy daughters, upon shoulders are they carried." The
setting up of a standard ([Isa 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md);
[Isa 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md); [Isa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003.md), cf., [Isa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010).md) is a favourite figure with
Isaiah, as well as swaying the hand. Jehovah gives a sign to the heathen
nations with His hand, and points out to them the mark that they are to
keep in view, with a signal pole which is set up. They understand it,
and carry out His instructions, and bring Zion's sons and daughters
thither, and that as a foster-father ('ōmēn) carries an infant in the
bosom of his dress (chōtsen, as in [Neh
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#013.md); Arabic as in [Psa
129:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#007.md), hidn, from hadana, to embrace,
to press tenderly to one's self; vid., [Num
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012).md), or upon his arms, so that it
reclines upon his shoulder (‛al-kâthēph; cf., ‛al-tsad, [Isa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004.md); [Isa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 49:23</span></span>

Such affectionate treatment does the church receive, which is assembling
once more upon its native soil, whilst kings and their consorts hasten
to serve the re-assembled community. "And kings become thy
foster-fathers, and their princesses they nurses: they bow down their
face to thee to the earth, and they lick the dust of thy feet; and thou
learnest that I am Jehovah, He whose hoping ones are not put to shame."
As foster-fathers devote all their strength and care to those entrusted
to them, and nurses nourish children from the very marrow of their own
life, so will kings become the shelterers of Zion, and princesses the
sustainers of her growth. All that is true in the regal headship of the
church will be realized, and all that is false in regal territorialism
will condemn itself: "vultu in terram demisso adorabunt te et pulverem
pedum tuorum lingent" (Jerome). They do homage to the church, and kiss
the ground upon which she stands and walks. According to [Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014.md), this adoration belongs to the
God who is present in the church, and points the church itself away from
all thought of her own merits to Jehovah, the God of salvation, cui qui
confidunt non pudefient (וידעתּ with an auxiliary pathach, like יגעתּ in
[Isa 47:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#015.md); Ges. 65, 2: אשׁר with the
first person made into a relative as in [Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008); Ges. 123, 1, Anm. 1.md). Observe,
however, that the state will not be swallowed up by the church - a thing
which never will occur, and is never meant to occur; but by the state
becoming serviceable to the church, there is realized a prelude of the
perfected kingdom of God, in which the dualism of the state and the
church is entirely abolished.

[Isaiah 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 49:24</span></span>

There follows now a sceptical question prompted by weakness of faith;
and the divine reply. The question, [Isa
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024.md) : "Can the booty indeed be
wrested from a giant, or will the captive host of the righteous escape?"
The question is logically one, and only divided rhetorically into two
(Ges. 153, 2). The giant, or gigantically strong one, is the Chaldean.
Knobel, in opposition to Hitzig, who supposes the Persian to be referred
to, points very properly to [Isa
51:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md), and [Isa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md). He is mistaken, however, in
thinking that we must read עריץ שׁבי in [Isa
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024.md), as Ewald does after the Syriac
and Jerome, on account of the parallelism. The exiles are called shebhı̄
tsaddı̄q, not, however, as captives wrested from the righteous (the
congregation of the righteous), as Meier thinks, taking tsaddı̄q as the
gen. obj.; still less as captives carried off by the righteous one,
i.e., the Chaldean, for the Chaldean, even regarded as the accomplisher
of the righteous judgment of God, is not tsaddı̄q, but "wicked" ([Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013).md); but merely as a host of
captives consisting of righteous men (Hitzig). The divine answer, [Isa
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025.md), [Isa
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026.md) : "Yea, thus saith Jehovah, Even
the captive hosts of a giant are wrested from him, and the booty of a
tyrant escapes: and I will make war upon him that warreth with thee, and
I will bring salvation to thy children. And I feed them that pain thee
with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as
if with new wine; and all flesh sees that I Jehovah am thy Saviour, and
that thy Redeemer is the Mighty One of Jacob." We might take the kı̄ in
[Isa 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025.md) as a simple affirmative,
but it is really to be taken as preceded by a tacit intermediate
thought. Rosenmller's explanation is the correct one: "that which is
hardly credible shall take place, for thus hath Jehovah said." He has
also given the true interpretation of gam: "although this really seems
incredible, yet I will give it effect." Ewald, on the contrary, has
quite missed the sense of [Isa 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024.md),
[Isa 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025.md), which he gives as follows:
"The booty in men which a hero has taken in war, may indeed be taken
from him again; but Jehovah will never let the booty that He takes from
the Chaldean (viz., Israel) be wrested from Him again." This is
inadmissible, for the simple reason that it presupposes the emendation
עריץ שׁבי עריץ noita; and this 'ârı̄ts is quite unsuitable, partly
because it would be Jehovah to whom the case supposed referred, and
still more, because the correspondence in character between [Isa
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024.md) and [Isa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014.md) is thereby destroyed. The gibbōr
and 'ârı̄ts is called יריבך in [Isa
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025.md), with direct reference to Zion.
This is a noun formed from the future, like Jareb in [Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md) and [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006.md) - a name chosen as the
distinctive epithet of the Asiatic emperor (probably a name signifying
"king Fighting-cock"). The self-laceration threatened against the
Chaldean empire recals to mind [Isa
9:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#019.md), and [Zac
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#009.md), and has as revolting a sound as
[Num 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024.md) and [Zac
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#015.md) -passages which Daumer and
Ghillany understand in the cannibal sense which they appear to have,
whereas what they understand literally is merely a hyperbolical figure.
Moreover, it must not be forgotten that the Old Testament church was a
nation, and that the spirit of revelation in the Old Testament assumed
the national form, which it afterwards shattered to pieces. Knobel
points to the revolt of the Hyrcanians and several satraps, who fought
on the side of Cyrus against their former rulers (Cyrop. iv 2, 6, v.
1-3). All this will be subservient to that salvation and redemption,
which form the historical aim of Jehovah and the irresistible work of
the Mighty One of Jacob. The name of God which we meet with here, viz.,
the Mighty One of Jacob, only occurs again in [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024.md), and shows who is the author of
the prophecy which is concluded here. The first half set forth, in the
servant of Jehovah, the mediator of Israel's restoration and of the
conversion of the heathen, and closed with an appeal to the heaven and
the earth to rejoice with the ransomed church. The second half ([Isa
49:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014).md) rebukes the despondency of
Zion, which fancies itself forgotten of Jehovah, by pointing to
Jehovah's more than maternal love, and the superabundant blessing to be
expected from Him. It also rebukes the doubts of Zion as to the
possibility of such a redemption, by pointing to the faithfulness and
omnipotence of the God of Israel, who will cause the exiles to be
wrested from the Chaldean, and their tormentors to devour one another.
The following chapter commences a fresh train of ideas.
