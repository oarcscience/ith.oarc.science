### [Amos Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 4:0</span></span>

The Impenitence of Israel - [Amo
4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md)

The voluptuous and wanton women of Samaria will be overtaken by a
shameful captivity ([Amo 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001).md). Let
the Israelites only continue their idolatry with zeal ([Amo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md), [Amo
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005).md), the Lord has already visited
them with many punishments without their having turned to Him ([Amo
4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006).md); and therefore He must inflict
still further chastisements, to see whether they will not at length
learn to fear Him as their God ([Amo
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#012.md), [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013).md).

[Amos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 4:1</span></span>

"Hear this word, ye cows of Bashan, that are upon the mountain of
Samaria, that oppress there the humble and crush the poor, that say to
their lords, Bring hither, that we may drink. [Amo
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002.md). The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by
His holiness: behold, days come upon you, that they drag you away with
hooks, and your last one with fish-hooks. [Amo
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#003.md). And ye will go out through
breaches in the wall, every one before him, and be cast away to Harmon,
is the saying of Jehovah." The commencement of this chapter is closely
connected, so far as the contents are concerned, with the chapter
immediately preceding. The prophet having there predicted, that when the
kingdom was conquered by its enemies, the voluptuous grandees would
perish, with the exception of a very few who would hardly succeed in
saving their lives, turns now to the voluptuous women of Samaria, to
predict in their case a shameful transportation into exile. The
introduction, "Hear this word," does not point therefore to a new
prophecy, but simply to a fresh stage in the prophecy, so that we cannot
even agree with Ewald in taking [Amo
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md) as the conclusion of the
previous prophecy ([Amo 3:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001).md). The
cows of Bashan are well-fed, fat cows, βόες εὔτροφοι, vaccae pingues
(Symm., Jer.), as Bashan had fat pastures, and for that reason the
tribes that were richest in flocks and herds had asked for it as their
inheritance (Numbers 32). The fuller definitions which follow show very
clearly that by the cows of Bashan, Amos meant the rich, voluptuous, and
violent inhabitants of Samaria. It is doubtful, however, whether he
meant the rich and wanton wives of the great, as most of the modern
commentators follow Theodor., Theodoret, and others, in assuming; or
"the rulers of Israel, and all the leading men of the ten tribes, who
spent their time in pleasure and robbery" (Jerome); or "those rich,
luxurious, and lascivious inhabitants of the palace of whom he had
spoken in [Amo 3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009)" (Maurer.md), as
the Chald., Luther, Calvin, and others suppose, and whom he calls cows,
not oxen, to denote their effeminacy and their unbridled licentiousness.
In support of the latter opinion we might adduce not only [Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md), where Ephraim is compared to a
young heifer, but also the circumstance that from [Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004.md) onwards the prophecy refers to the
Israelites as a whole. But neither of these arguments proves very much.
The simile in [Hos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md) applies to
Ephraim as a kingdom of people, and the natural personification as a
woman prepares the way for the comparison to an ‛eglâh; whereas
voluptuous and tyrannical grandees would be more likely to be compared
to the bulls of Bashan ([Psa 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013).md).
And so, again, the transition in [Hos
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md) to the Israelites as a whole
furnishes no help in determining more precisely who are addressed in
[Hos 10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md). By the cows of Bashan,
therefore, we understand the voluptuous women of Samaria, after the
analogy of [Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md). and [Isa
32:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009.md), more especially because it is
only by forcing the last clause of [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md) that it can be understood as
referring to men. שׁמעוּ for שׁמענה, because the verb stands first
(compare [Isa 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011).md). The mountain of
Samaria is mentioned in the place of the city built upon the mountain
(see at [Amo 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009).md). The sin of these
women consisted in the tyrannical oppression of the poor, whilst they
asked their lords, i.e., their husbands, to procure them the means of
debauchery. For עשׁק and רצץ, compare [Deu
28:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033.md) and [Sa1
12:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003.md), where the two words are
already connected. הביאה stands in the singular, because every wife
speaks in this way to her husband.

The announcement of the punishment for such conduct is introduced with a
solemn oath, to make an impression, if possible, upon the hardened
hearts. Jehovah swears by His holiness, i.e., as the Holy One, who
cannot tolerate unrighteousness. כּי (for) before הנּה introduces the
oath. Hitzig takes ונשּׂא as a niphal, as in the similar formula in [Kg2
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#017.md); but he takes it as a passive
used impersonally with an accusative, after [Gen
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#026.md) and other passages (though not
[Exo 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#007).md). But as נשּׂא
unquestionably occurs as a piel in [Kg1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011.md), it is more natural to take the
same form as a piel in this instance also, and whilst interpreting it
impersonally, to think of the enemy as understood. Tsinnōth = tsinnı̄m,
[Pro 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005.md); [Job
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#005.md), צנּה = צּן, thorns, hence hooks;
so also sı̄rōth = sı̄rı̄m, thorns, [Isa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013.md); [Hos
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008.md). Dūgâh, fishery; hence sı̄rōth
dūgâh, fish-hooks. 'Achărı̄th does not mean posterity, or the young brood
that has grown up under the instruction and example of the parents
(Hitzig), but simply "the end," the opposite of rē'shı̄th, the beginning.
It is "end," however, in different senses. Here it signifies the remnant
(Chaldee), i.e., those who remain and are not dragged away with
tsinnōth; so that the thought expressed is "all, even to the very last"
(compare Hengstenberg, Christology, i. p. 368). אחריתכן has a feminine
suffix, whereas masculine suffixes were used before (אתכם, עליכם); the
universal gender, out of which the feminine was first formed. The figure
is not taken from animals, into whose noses hooks and rings are inserted
to tame them, or from large fishes that are let down into the water
again by nose-hooks; for the technical terms applied to these hooks are
חח, חוח, and חכּה (cf. [Eze 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004.md); [Job
41:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001).md); but from the catching of
fishes, that are drawn out of the fish-pond with hooks. Thus shall the
voluptuous, wanton women be violently torn away or carried off from the
midst of the superfluity and debauchery in which they lived as in their
proper element. פּרצים תּצאנה, to go out of rents in the wall, יצא being
construed, as it frequently is, with the accusative of the place; we
should say, "though rents in the wall," i.e., through breaches made in
the wall at the taking of the city, not out at the gates, because they
had been destroyed or choked up with rubbish at the storming of the
city. "Every one before her," i.e., without looking round to the right
or to the left (cf. [Jos 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005.md), [Jos
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#020).md). The words והשּׁלכתּנה ההרמונה
are difficult, on account of the ἁπ. λεγ. ההרמונה, and have not yet been
satisfactorily explained. The form השׁלכתּנה for השׁלכתּן is probably
chosen simply for the purpose of obtaining a resemblance in sound to
תּצאנה, and is sustained by אתּנה for אתּן in [Gen
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#006.md) and [Eze
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011.md). השׁליך is applied to thrusting
into exile, as in [Deu 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#027.md).

The ἁπ. λεγ. ההרמונה with ה htiw loc. appears to indicate the place to
which they were to be carried away or cast out. But the hiphil השׁלכתּנה
does not suit this, and consequently nearly all the earlier translators
have rendered it as a passive, ἀποῤῥι-φήσεσθε (lxx), projiciemini
(Jerome); so also the Syr. and Chald. ויגלון יתהון, "men will carry them
away captive." One Hebrew codex actually gives the hophal. And to this
reading we must adhere; for the hiphil furnishes no sense at all, since
the intransitive or reflective meaning, to plunge, or cast one's self,
cannot be sustained, and is not supported at all by the passages quoted
by Hitzig, viz., [Kg2 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025.md) and [Job
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#022.md); and still less does haharmōnâh
denote the object cast away by the women when they go into captivity.

(Note: The Masoretic pointing probably originated in the idea that
harmōnâh, corresponding to the talmudic harmânâ', signifies royal power
or dominion, and so Rashi interprets it: "ye will cast away the
authority, i.e., the almost regal authority, or that pride and arrogance
with which you bear yourselves to-day" (Ros.). This explanation would be
admissible, if it were not that the use of a word which never occurs
again in the old Hebrew for a thing so frequently mentioned in the Old
Testament, rendered it very improbable. At any rate, it is more
admissible than the different conjectures of the most recent
commentators. Thus Hitzig, for example (Comm. ed. 3), would resolve
haharmōnâh into hâhâr and mōnâh = meōnâh ("and ye will plunge headlong
to the mountain as a place of refuge"). The objections to this are, (1)
that hishlı̄kh does not mean to plunge headlong; (2) the improbability of
meōnâh being contracted into mōnâh, when Amos has meōnâh in [Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004.md); and lastly, the fact that meōnâh
means simply a dwelling, not a place of refuge. Ewald would read hâhâr
rimmōnâh after the lxx, and renders it, "ye will cast Rimmonah to the
mountain," understanding by Rimmonah a female deity of the Syrians. But
antiquity knows nothing of any such female deity; and from the reference
to a deity called Rimmon in [Kg2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018.md),
you cannot possibly infer the existence of a goddess Rimmonah. The
explanation given by Schlottmann (Hiob, p. 132) and Paul Btticher
(Rudimenta mythologiae semit. 1848, p. 10) - namely, that harmōnâh as
the Phoenician goddess Chusarthis, called by the Greeks Ἁρμονία - is
still more untenable, since Ἁρμονία is no more derived from the talmudic
harmân than this is from the Sanscrit pramāna (Btticher, l.c. p. 40); on
the contrary, harmân signifies loftiness, from the Semitic root הרם, to
be high, and it cannot be shown that there was a goddess called Harman
or Harmonia in the Phoenician worship. Lastly, the fanciful idea of
Btticher, that harmōnâh is contracted from hâhar rimmōnâh, and that the
meaning is, "and then ye throw, i.e., remove, the mountain (your
Samaria) to Rimmon, that ancient place of refuge for expelled tribes"
([Jdg 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#045).), needs no refutation..md)

The literal meaning of harmōnâh or harmōn still remains uncertain.
According to the etymology of הרם, to be high, it apparently denotes a
high land: at the same time, it can neither be taken as an appellative,
as Hesselberg and Maurer suppose, "the high land;" nor in the sense of
'armōn, a citadel or palace, as Kimchi and Gesenius maintain. The former
interpretation is open to the objection, that we cannot possibly imagine
why Amos should have formed a word of his own, and one which never
occurs again in the Hebrew language, to express the simple idea of a
mountain or high land; and the second to this objection, that "the
citadel" would require something to designate it as a citadel or
fortress in the land of the enemy. The unusual word certainly points to
the name of a land or district, though we have no means of determining
it more precisely.

(Note: Even the early translators have simply rendered haharmōnâh
according to the most uncertain conjectures. Thus lxx, εἰς τὸὄρος τὸ
Ῥομμάν (al. Ῥεμμάν); Aq., mons Armona; Theod., mons Mona; the Quinta:
excelsus mons (according to Jerome); and Theodoret attributes to
Theodot. ὑψηλὸν ὄρος. The Chaldee paraphrases it thus: להלאה מן טוּרי
הרמיני, "far beyond the mountains of Armenia." Symmachus also had
Armenia, according to the statement of Theodoret and Jerome. But this
explanation is probably merely an inference drawn from [Kg2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023.md), and cannot be justified, as
Bochart supposes, on the ground that mōnâh or mōn is identical with
minnı̄.)

[Amos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 4:4</span></span>

After this threat directed against the voluptuous women of the capital,
the prophecy turns again to all the people. In bitter irony, Amos tells
them to go on with zeal in their idolatrous sacrifices, and to multiply
their sin. But they will not keep back the divine judgment by so doing.
[Amo 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md). "Go to Bethel, and sin; to
Gilgal, multiply sinning; and offer your slain-offerings in the morning,
your tithes every three days. [Amo
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005.md). And kindle praise-offerings of
that which is leavened, and cry out freewill-offerings, proclaim it; for
so ye love it, O sons of Israel, is the saying of the Lord, of Jehovah."
"Amos here describes how zealously the people of Israel went on
pilgrimage to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Beersheba, those places of sacred
associations; with what superabundant diligence they offered sacrifice
and paid tithes; who they would rather do too much than too little, so
that they even burnt upon the altar a portion of the leavened loaves of
the praise-offering, which were only intended for the sacrificial meals,
although none but unleavened bread was allowed to be offered; and
lastly, how in their pure zeal for multiplying the works of piety, they
so completely mistook their nature, as to summon by a public
proclamation to the presentation of freewill-offerings, the very
peculiarity of which consisted in the fact that they had no other
prompting than the will of the offerer" (v. Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, ii.
2, p. 373). The irony of the summons to maintain their worship comes out
very distinctly in the words וּפשׁעוּ, and sin, or fall away from God.
הגּלגּל is not a nominative absolute, "as for Gilgal," but an
accusative, and בּאוּ is to be repeated from the first clause. The
absence of the copula before הרבּוּ does not compel us to reject the
Masoretic accentuation, and connect הגּלגּל with פּלשׁעוּ, as Hitzig
does, so as to obtain the unnatural thought, "sin ye towards Gilgal." On
Gilgal mentioned along with Bethel as a place of idolatrous worship
(here and [Amo 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md), as in [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md), and [Hos
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012).md), see at [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md). Offer your slain-offerings
labbōqer, for the morning, i.e., every morning, like layyōm in [Jer
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021.md). This is required by the
parallel lishlōsheth yâmı̄m, on the three of days, i.e., every three
days. זבחים ... הביאוּ does not refer to the morning sacrifice
prescribed in the law ([Num 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003).md) -
for that is always called ‛ōlâh, not zebach - but to slain sacrifices
that were offered every morning, although the offering of zebhâchı̄m
every morning presupposes the presentation of the daily morning
burnt-offering. What is said concerning the tithe rests upon the Mosaic
law of the second tithe, which was to be brought every three years ([Deu
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md); [Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md); compare my Bibl. Archol. 71,
Anm. 7). The two clauses, however, are not to be understood as implying
that the Israelites had offered slain sacrifices every morning, and
tithe every three days. Amos is speaking hyperbolically, to depict the
great zeal displayed in their worship; and the thought is simply this:
"If ye would offer slain sacrifices every morning, and tithe every three
days, ye would only thereby increase your apostasy from the living God."
The words, "kindle praise-offerings of that which is leavened," have
been misinterpreted in various ways. קטּר, an inf. absol. used instead
of the imperative (see Ges. 131, 4, b). According to [Lev
7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012), the praise-offering (tōdâh.md)
was to consist not only of unleavened cakes and pancakes with oil poured
upon them, but also of cakes of leavened bread. The latter, however,
were not to be placed upon the altar, but one of them was to be assigned
to the priest who sprinkled the blood, and the rest to be eaten at the
sacrificial meal. Amos now charges the people with having offered that
which was leavened instead of unleavened cakes and pancakes, and with
having burned it upon the altar, contrary to the express prohibition of
the law in [Lev 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011.md). His words are
not to be understood as signifying that, although outwardly the
praise-offerings consisted of that which was unleavened, according to
the command of the law, yet inwardly they were so base that they
resembled unleavened cakes, inasmuch as whilst the material of the
leaven was absent, the true nature of the leaven - namely, malice and
wickedness - was there in all the greater quantity (Hengstenberg,
Dissertations, vol. i. p. 143 translation). The meaning is rather this,
that they were not content with burning upon the altar unleavened cakes
made from the materials provided for the sacrifice, but that they burned
some of the leavened loaves as well, in order to offer as much as
possible to God. What follows answers to this: call out nedâbhōth, i.e.,
call out that men are to present freewill-offerings. The emphasis is
laid upon קראוּ, which is therefore still further strengthened by
השׁמעוּ. Their calling out nedâbhōth, i.e., their ordering
freewill-offerings to be presented, was an exaggerated act of zeal,
inasmuch as the sacrifices which ought to have been brought out of
purely spontaneous impulse (cf. [Lev
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#018.md).; [Deu
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006).md), were turned into a matter of
moral compulsion, or rather of legal command. The words, "for so ye love
it," show how this zeal in the worship lay at the heart of the nation.
It is also evident from the whole account, that the worship in the
kingdom of the ten tribes was conducted generally according to the
precepts of the Mosaic law.

[Amos 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 4:6</span></span>

But as Israel would not desist from its idolatrous worship, Jehovah
would also continue to visit the people with judgments, as He had
already done, though without effecting any conversion to their God. This
last thought is explained in [Amo
4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md) in a series of instances, in
which the expression ולא שׁבתּם עדי (and ye have not returned to me),
which is repeated five times, depicts in the most thorough manner the
unwearied love of the Lord to His rebellious children.

[Amo 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md)

"And I have also given you cleanness of teeth in all your towns, and
want of bread in all your places: and ye have not returned to me, is the
saying of Jehovah." The strongly adversative וגם אני forms the
antithesis to כן אהבתּם: Ye love to persist in your idolatry, and yet I
have tried all means of turning you to me. Cleanness of teeth is
explained by the parallel "want of bread." The first chastisement,
therefore, consisted in famine, with which God visited the nation, as He
had threatened the transgressors that He would do in the law ([Deu
28:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048.md), [Deu
28:57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#057).md). For שׁוּב עד, compare [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md).

[Amo 4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007.md)

"And I have also withholden the rain from you, in yet three months to
the harvest; and have caused it to rain upon one city, and I do not
cause it to rain upon another. One field is rained upon, and the field
upon which it does not rain withers. [Amo
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#008.md). And two, three towns stagger to
one town to drink water, and are not satisfied: and ye have not returned
to me, is the saying of Jehovah." The second punishment mentioned is the
withholding of rain, or drought, which was followed by the failure of
the harvest and the scarcity of water (cf. [Lev
26:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md); [Deu
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023).md). The rain "in yet (i.e., at the
time when there were yet) three months to the harvest" is the so-called
latter rain, which falls in the latter half of February and the first
half of March, and is of the greatest importance to the vigorous
development of the ears of corn and also of the grains. In southern
Palestine the harvest commences in the latter half of April (Nisan), and
falls for the most part in May and June; but in the northern part of the
land it is from two to four weeks later (see my Archologie, i. pp. 33,
34, ii. pp. 113, 114), so that in round numbers we may reckon three
months from the latter rain to the harvest. But in order to show the
people more clearly that the sending and withholding of rain belonged to
Him, God caused it to rain here and there, upon one town and one field,
and not upon others (the imperfects from 'amtı̄r onwards express the
repetition of a thing, what generally happens, and timmâtēr, third pers.
fem., is used impersonally). This occasioned such distress, that the
inhabitants of the places in which it had not rained were obliged to go
to a great distance for the necessary supply of water to drink, and yet
could not get enough to satisfy them. נוּע, to stagger, to totter,
expresses the insecure and trembling walk of a man almost fainting with
thirst.

[Amo 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009.md)

"I have smitten you with blight and yellowness; many of your gardens,
and of your vineyards, and of your fig-trees, and of your olive-trees,
the locust devoured; and ye have not returned to me, is the saying of
Jehovah." The third chastisement consisted in the perishing of the corn
by blight, and by the ears turning yellow, and also in the destruction
of the produce of the gardens and the fruits of the trees by locusts.
The first is threatened in [Deu 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#022.md),
against despisers of the commandments of God; the second points to the
threatenings in [Deu 28:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#039.md), [Deu
28:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#042.md). The infin. constr. harbōth is
used as a substantive, and stands as a noun in the construct state
before the following words; so that it is not to be taken adverbially in
the sense of many times, or often, as though used instead of harbēh (cf.
Ewald, 280, c). On gâzâm, see at [Joe
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md). The juxtaposition of these two
plagues is not to be understood as implying that they occurred
simultaneously, or that the second was the consequence of the first;
still less are the two to be placed in causal connection with the
drought mentioned in [Amo 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007.md), [Amo
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#008.md). For although such combinations do
take place in the course of nature, there is no allusion to this in the
present instance, where Amos is simply enumerating a series of
judgments, through which Jehovah had already endeavoured to bring the
people to repentance, without any regard to the time when they occurred.

[Amo 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#010.md)

The same thing may be said of the fourth chastisement mentioned in [Amo
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#010.md), "I have sent pestilence among
you in the manner of Egypt, have slain your young men with the sword,
together with the booty of your horses, and caused the stench of your
camps to ascend, and that into your nose; and ye have not returned to
me, is the saying of Jehovah." In the combination of pestilence and
sword (war), the allusion to [Lev
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#025.md) is unmistakeable (compare [Deu
28:60](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#060.md), where the rebellious are
threatened with all the diseases of Egypt). בּדרך מצרים, in the manner
(not in the road) of Egypt (compare [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md), [Isa
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026.md); [Eze
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#030).md), because pestilence is epidemic
in Egypt. The idea that there is any allusion to the pestilence with
which God visited Egypt ([Exo 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#003)..md),
is overthrown by the circumstance that it is only a dreadful murrain
that is mentioned there. The slaying of the youths or young men points
to overthrow in war, which the Israelites endured most grievously in the
wars with the Syrians (compare [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md); [Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md), [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007).md). עם שׁבי סוּסילם does not mean
together with, or by the side of, the carrying away of your horses,
i.e., along with the fact that your horses were carried away; for שׁבי
does not mean carrying away captive, but the captivity, or the whole
body of captives. The words are still dependent upon הרגתּי, and affirm
that even the horses that had been taken perished, - a fact which is
also referred to in [Kg2 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md). From
the slain men and animals forming the camp the stench ascended, and that
into their noses, "as it were, as an 'azkârâh of their sins" (Hitzig),
but without their turning to their God.

[Amo 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011.md)

"I have destroyed among you, like the destruction of God upon Sodom and
Gomorrah, and ye were like a brand plucked out of the fire; and ye have
not returned to me, is the saying of Jehovah." Proceeding from the
smaller to the greater chastisements, Amos mentions last of all the
destruction similar to that of Sodom and Gomorrah, i.e., the utter
confusion of the state, by which Israel was brought to the verge of
ruin, so that it had only been saved like a firebrand out of the fire.
הפכתּי does not refer to an earthquake, which had laid waste cities and
hamlets, or a part of the land, say that mentioned in [Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md), as Kimchi and others suppose; but
it denotes the desolation of the whole land in consequence of
devastating wars, more especially the Syrian ([Kg2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#004.md), [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007).md), and other calamities, which had
undermined the stability of the kingdom, as in [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md). The words כּמהפּכת אלהים וגו are
taken from [Deu 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md), where the
complete desolation of the land, after the driving away of the people
into exile on account of their obstinate apostasy, is compared to the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. By thus playing upon this terrible
threat uttered by Moses, the prophet seeks to show to the people what
has already happened to them, and what still awaits them if they do not
eventually turn to their God. They have again been rescued from the
threatening destruction like a firebrand out of the fire ([Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002).md) by the deliverer whom the Lord
gave to them, so that they escaped from the power of the Syrians ([Kg2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#005).md). But inasmuch as all these
chastisements have produced no fruit of repentance, the Lord will now
proceed to judgment with His people.

[Amos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 4:12</span></span>

"Therefore thus will I do to thee, O Israel; because I will do this to
thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013.md). For, behold, He that formeth the
mountains, and createth the wind, and maketh known to man what is his
thought; who maketh dawn, darkness, and goeth over the high places of
the earth, Jehovah God of hosts is His name." The punishment which God
is now about to inflict is introduced with lâkhēn (therefore). כּה אעשׁה
cannot point back to the punishment threatened in [Amo
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002.md), [Amo
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#003.md), and still less to the
chastisements mentioned in [Amo
4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md); for lâkhēn kōh is always used
by Amos to introduce what is about to ensue, and any retrospective
allusion to [Amo 4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md) is precluded
by the future אעשׂה. What Jehovah is now about to do is not expressed
here more iratorum, but may clearly be discerned from what follows.
"When He has said, 'This will I do to thee,' He is silent as to what He
will do, in order that, whilst Israel is left in uncertainty as to the
particular kind of punishment (which is all the more terrible because
all kinds of things are imagined), it may repent of its sins, and so
avert the things which God threatens here" (Jerome). Instead of an
announcement of the punishment, there follows in the words, "Because I
will do this to thee (זאת pointing back to כּה), prepare to meet thy
God," a summons to hold themselves in readiness liqra'th 'ĕlōhı̄m (in
occursum Dei), i.e., to stand before God thy judge. The meaning of this
summons has been correctly explained by Calvin thus: "When thou seest
that thou hast resorted in vain to all kinds of subterfuges, since thou
never wilt be able to escape from the hand of thy judge; see now at
length that thou dost avert this last destruction which is hanging over
thee." But this can only be effected "by true renewal of heart, in which
men are dissatisfied with themselves, and submit with changed heart to
God, and come as suppliants, praying for forgiveness." For if we judge
ourselves, we shall not be judged by the Lord ([Co1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031).md). This view is shown to be the
correct one, by the repeated admonitions to seek the Lord and live ([Amo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md), [Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006.md); cf. [Amo
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014).md). To give all the greater
emphasis to this command, Amos depicts God in [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013.md) as the Almighty and Omniscient,
who creates prosperity and adversity. The predicates applied to God are
to be regarded as explanations of אלהיך, prepare to meet thy God; for it
is He who formeth mountains, etc., i.e., the Almighty, and also He who
maketh known to man מה־שּׂחו, what man thinketh, not what God thinketh,
since שׂח = שׂיח is not applicable to God, and is only used ironically
of Baal in [Kg1 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#027.md). The thought is
this: God is the searcher of the heart ([Jer
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md); [Psa
139:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002).md), and reveals to men by prophets
the state of their heart, since He judges not only the outward actions,
but the inmost emotions of the heart (cf. [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012).md). עשׂה שׁחר עיפה might mean, He
turns morning dawn into darkness, since עשׂה may be construed with the
accusative of that into which anything is made (compare [Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025.md), and the similar thought in [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md), that God darkens the day into
night). But both of these arguments simply prove the possibility of this
explanation, not that it is either necessary or correct. As a rule,
where עשׂה occurs, the thing into which anything is made is introduced
with ל (cf. [Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md); [Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010).md). Here, therefore, ל may be
omitted, simply to avoid ambiguity. For these reasons we agree with
Calvin and others, who take the words as asyndeton. God makes
morning-dawn and darkness, which is more suitable to a description of
the creative omnipotence of God; and the omission of the Vav may be
explained very simply from the oratorical character of the prophecy. To
this there is appended the last statement: He passes along over the high
places of the earth, i.e., He rules the earth with unlimited omnipotence
(see at [Deu 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013).md), and manifests
Himself thereby as the God of the universe, or God of hosts.
