The Oracle Concerning the Valley of Vision (Jerusalem) - [Isa
22:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001.md)

The châzūth concerning Babylon, and the no less visionary prophecies
concerning Edom and Arabia, are now followed by a massâ, the object of
which is "the valley of vision" (gē' chizzâyōn) itself. Of course these
four prophecies were not composed in the tetralogical form in which they
are grouped together here, but were joined together at a later period in
a group of this kind on account of their close affinity. The internal
arrangement of the group was suggested, not by the date of their
composition (they stand rather in the opposite relation to one another),
but by the idea of a storm coming from a distance, and bursting at last
over Jerusalem; for there can be no doubt that the "valley of vision" is
a general name for Jerusalem as a whole, and not the name given to one
particular valley of Jerusalem. It is true that the epithet applied to
the position of Jerusalem does not seem to be in harmony with this; for,
according to Josephus, "the city was built upon two hills, which are
opposite to one another and have a valley to divide them asunder, at
which valley the corresponding rows of houses on both hills end" (Wars
of the Jews, v. 4, 1; Whiston). But the epithet is so far allowable,
that there are mountains round Jerusalem ([Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002).md); and the same city which is on
an eminence in relation to the land generally, appears to stand on low
ground when contrasted with the mountains in the immediate neighbourhood
(πρὸς δὲ τὰ ἐχόμενα ταύθς γηόλοφα χθαμαλίζεται, as Phocas says).
According to this twofold aspect, Jerusalem is called the "inhabitant of
the valley" in [Jer 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md), and
directly afterwards the "rock of the plain;" just as in [Jer
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003.md) it is called the mountain in the
fields, whereas Zephaniah ([Zep 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#011).md)
applies the epithet mactēsh (the mortar or cauldron) not to all
Jerusalem, but to one portion of it (probably the ravine of the
Tyropaeum). And if we add to this the fact that Isaiah's house was
situated in the lower town - and therefore the standpoint of the epithet
is really there - it is appropriate in other respects still; for the
prophet had there the temple-hill and the Mount of Olives, which is
three hundred feet higher, on the east, and Mount Zion before him
towards the south; so that Jerusalem appeared like a city in a valley in
relation to the mountains inside, quite as much as to those outside. But
the epithet is intended to be something more than geographical. A valley
is a deep, still, solitary place, but off and shut in by mountains. And
thus Jerusalem was an enclosed place, hidden and shut off from the
world, which Jehovah had chosen as the place in which to show to His
prophets the mysteries of His government of the world. And upon this
sacred prophets' city the judgment of Jehovah was about to fall; and the
announcement of the judgment upon it is placed among the oracles
concerning the nations of the world! We may see from this, that at the
time when this prophecy was uttered, the attitude of Jerusalem was so
worldly and heathenish, that it called forth this dark, nocturnal
threat, which is penetrated by not a single glimmer of promise. But
neither the prophecies of the time of Ahaz relating to the Assyrian age
of judgment, nor those which were uttered in the midst of the Assyrian
calamities, are so destitute of promise and so peremptory as this. The
massa therefore falls in the intermediate time, probably the time when
the people were seized with the mania for liberty, and the way was
prepared for their breaking away from Assyria by their hope of an
alliance with Egypt (vid., Delitzsch-Caspari, Studien, ii. 173-4).

[Isaiah 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 22:1</span></span>

The prophet exposes the nature and worthlessness of their confidence in
[Isa 22:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001.md) : "What aileth thee, then,
that thou art wholly ascended upon the house-tops? O full of tumult,
thou noisy city, shouting castle, thy slain men are not slain with the
sword, nor slaughtered in battle. All thy rulers departing together are
fettered without bow; all thy captured ones are fettered together,
fleeing far away." From the flat house-tops they all look out together
at the approaching army of the foe, longing for battle, and sure of
victory (cullâk is for cullēk, [Isa
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029.md), [Isa
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031).md). They have no suspicion of what
is threatening them; therefore are they so sure, so contented, and so
defiant. מלאה תּשׂאות is inverted, and stands for תּשׁאות מלאת, like
מנדּח אפלה in [Isa 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md). עלּיזה is
used to denote self-confident rejoicing, as in [Zep
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md). How terribly they deceive
themselves! Not even the honour of falling upon the battle-field is
allowed them. Their rulers (kâtzin, a judge, and then any person of
rank) depart one and all out of the city, and are fettered outside
"without bow" (mikkesheth), i.e., without there being any necessity for
the bow to be drawn (min, as in [Job
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009.md); [Sa2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022); cf., Ewald, 217, b.md). All,
without exception, of those who are attacked in Jerusalem by the
advancing foe (nimzâ'aik, thy captured ones, as in [Isa
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#015).md), fall helplessly into
captivity, as they are attempting to flee far away (see at [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013.md); the perf. de conatu answers to
the classical praesens de conatu). Hence (what is here affirmed
indirectly) the city is besieged, and in consequence of the long siege
hunger and pestilence destroy the inhabitants, and every one who
attempts to get away falls into the hands of the enemy, without
venturing to defend himself, on account of his emaciation and exhaustion
from hunger. Whilst the prophet thus pictures to himself the fate of
Jerusalem and Judah, through their infatuation, he is seized with
inconsolable anguish.

[Isaiah 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 22:4</span></span>

"Therefore I say, Look away from me, that I may weep bitterly; press me
not with consolations for the destruction of the daughter of my people!
For a day of noise, and of treading down, and of confusion, cometh from
the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of vision, breaking down
walls; and a cry of woe echoes against the mountains." The note struck
by Isaiah here is the note of the kinah that is continued in the
Lamentations of Jeremiah. Jeremiah says sheber for shod ([Lam
3:48](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#048).md), and bath-ammi (daughter of my
people) is varied with batḣZion (daughter of Zion) and bath-yehudah
(daughter of Judah). Mērēr babbeci (weep bitterly) is more than bâcâh
mar ([Isa 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007).md): it signifies to give
one's self thoroughly up to bitter weeping, to exhaust one's self with
weeping. The two similar sounds which occur in [Isa
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#005.md), in imitation of echoes, can
hardly be translated. The day of divine judgment is called a day in
which masses of men crowd together with great noise (mehūmâh), in which
Jerusalem and its inhabitants are trodden down by foes (mebūsâh) and are
thrown into wild confusion (mebūcâh). This is one play upon words. The
other makes the crashing of the walls audible, as they are hurled down
by the siege-artillery (mekarkar kir). Kirkēr is not a denom. of kı̄r, as
Kimchi and Ewald suppose (unwalling walls), but is to be explained in
accordance with [Num 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md), "he
undermines," i.e., throws down by removing the supports, in other words,
"to the very foundations" (kur, to dig, hence karkârâh, the bottom of a
vessel, Kelim ii. 2; kurkoreth, the bottom of a net, ib. xxviii. 10, or
of a cask, Ahaloth ix. 16). When this takes place, then a cry of woe
echoes against the mountain (shōa‛, like shūa‛, sheva‛), i.e., strikes
against the mountains that surround Jerusalem, and is echoed back again.
Knobel understands it as signifying a cry for help addressed to the
mountain where Jehovah dwells; but this feature is altogether unsuitable
to the God - forgetting worldly state in which Jerusalem is found. It is
also to be observed, in opposition to Knobel, that the description does
not move on in the same natural and literal way as in a historical
narrative. The prophet is not relating, but looking; and in [Isa
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#005.md) he depicts the day of Jehovah
according to both its ultimate intention and its ultimate result.

[Isaiah 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 22:6</span></span>

The advance of the besiegers, which leads to the destruction of the
walls, is first described in [Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006.md), [Isa
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#007.md). "And Elam has taken the quiver,
together with chariots with men, horsemen; and Kir has drawn out the
shield. And then it comes to pass, that thy choicest valleys are filled
with chariots, and the horsemen plant a firm foot towards the gate." Of
the nations composing the Assyrian army, the two mentioned are Elam, the
Semitic nation of Susiana (Chuzistan), whose original settlements were
the row of valleys between the Zagros chain and the chain of advanced
mountains bounding the Assyrian plains on the east, and who were greatly
dreaded as bowmen ([Eze 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md); [Jer
49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035).md), and Kir, the inhabitants of
the country of the Cyrus river, which was an Assyrian province,
according to [Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md) and [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md), and still retained its dependent
position even in the time of the Achaemenides, when Armenia, at any
rate, is expressly described in the arrowheaded writings as a Persian
province, though a rebellious one. The readiness for battle of this
people of Kur, who represent, in combination with Elam, the whole extent
of the Assyrian empire from south to north,

(Note: The name Gurgistan (= Georgia) has nothing to do with the river
Kur; and it is a suspicious fact that Kir has k at the commencement, and
i in the middle, whereas the name of the river which joins the Araxes,
and flows into the Caspian sea, is pronounced Kur, and is written in
Persian with k (answering to the Armenian and old Persian, in which Kuru
is equivalent to Κῦρος). Wetzstein considers Kir a portion of
Mesopotamia.)

is attested by their "drawing out the shield" (‛ērâh mâgēn), which
Caesar calls scutis tegimenta detrahere (bell. gall. ii. 21); for the
Talmudic meaning applicare cannot be thought of for a moment (Buxtorf,
lex. col. 1664). These nations that fought on foot were accompanied
(Beth, as in [Kg1 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002).md) by chariots
filled with men (receb 'âdâm), i.e., war-chariots (as distinguished from
‛agâloth), and, as is added ἀσυνδέτως, by pârâshim, riders (i.e.,
horsemen trained to arms). The historical tense is introduced with ויהי
in [Isa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#007.md), but in a purely future
sense. It is only for the sake of the favourite arrangement of the words
that the passage does not proceed with Vav relat. וּמלאוּ. "Thy valleys"
(‛amâkaik) are the valleys by which Jerusalem was encircled on the east,
the west, and the south, viz., the valley of Kidron on the east; the
valley of Gihon on the west; the valley of Rephaim, stretching away from
the road to Bethlehem, on the south-west ([Isa
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#005).md); the valley of Hinnom, which
joins the Tyropaeum, and then runs on into a south-eastern angle; and
possibly also the valley of Jehoshaphat, which ran on the north-east of
the city above the valley of Kidron. These valleys, more especially the
finest of them towards the south, are now cut up by the wheels and hoofs
of the enemies' chariots and horses; and the enemies' horsemen have
already taken a firm position gatewards, ready to ride full speed
against the gates at a given signal, and force their way into the city
(shı̄th with a shoth to strengthen it, as in [Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md); also sı̄m in [Kg1
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#012.md), compare [Sa1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 22:8</span></span>

When Judah, after being for a long time intoxicated with hope, shall
become aware of the extreme danger in which it is standing, it will
adopt prudent measures, but without God. "Then he takes away the
covering of Judah, and thou lookest in that day to the store of arms of
the forest-house; and ye see the breaches of the city of David, that
there are many of them; and ye collect together the waters of the lower
pool. And ye number the houses of Jerusalem, and pull down the houses,
to fortify the wall. And ye make a basin between the two walls for the
waters of the old pool; and ye do not look to Him who made it, neither
do ye have regard to Him who fashioned it long ago." Mâsâk is the
curtain or covering which made Judah blind to the threatening danger.
Their looks are now directed first of all to the forest-house, built by
Solomon upon Zion for the storing and display of valuable arms and
utensils (nēshĕk, or rather, according to the Masora on [Job
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md), and the older editions,
nĕshĕk), and so called because it rested upon four rows of cedar columns
that ran all round (it was in the centre of the fore-court of the royal
palace; see Thenius, das vorexil. Jerusalem, p. 13). They also noticed
in the city of David, the southern and highest portion of the city of
Jerusalem, the bad state of the walls, and began to think of repairing
them. To this end they numbered the houses of the city, to obtain
building materials for strengthening the walls and repairing the
breaches, by pulling down such houses as were suitable for the purpose,
and could be dispensed with (vattithtzu, from nâthatz, with the removal
of the recompensative reduplication). The lower pool and the old pool,
probably the upper, i.e., the lower and upper Gihon, were upon the
western side of the city, the lower (Birket es-Sultan) to the west of
Sion, the upper (Birket el-Mamilla) farther up to the west of Akra
(Robinson, i. 483-486; V. Raumer, Pal. pp. 305-6). Kibbētz either means
to collect in the pool by stopping up the outflow, or to gather together
in the reservoirs and wells of the city by means of artificial canals.
The latter, however, would most probably be expressed by אסף; so that
the meaning that most naturally suggests itself is, that they
concentrate the water, so as to be able before the siege to provide the
city as rapidly as possible with a large supply. The word sâtham, which
is used in the account of the actual measures adopted by Hezekiah when
he was threatened with siege ([Ch2
32:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#002).md), is a somewhat different one,
and indicates the stopping up, not of the outflow but of the springs,
and therefore of the influx. But in all essential points the measures
adopted agree with those indicated here in the prophecy. The chronicler
closes the account of Hezekiah's reign by still further observing that
"Hezekiah also stopped the outflow of the upper Gihon, and carried the
water westwards underground to the city of David" ([Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md), explanatory of [Kg2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#020).md). If the upper Gihon is the same
as the upper pool, there was a conduit (teeâlâh), connected with the
upper Gihon as early as the time of Ahaz, [Isa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md). And Hezekiah's peculiar work
consisted in carrying the water of the upper pool "into the city of
David." The mikvâh between the two walls, which is here prospectively
described by Isaiah, is connected with this water supply, which Hezekiah
really carried out. There is still a pool of Hezekiah (also called
Birket el-Batrak, pool of the patriarchs, the Amygdalon of Josephus) on
the western side of the city, to the east of the Joppa gate. During the
rainy season this pool is supplied by the small conduit which runs from
the upper pool along the surface of the ground, and then under the wall
against or near the Joppa gate. It also lies between two walls, viz.,
the wall to the north of Zion, and the one which runs to the north-east
round the Akra (Robinson, i. 487-489). How it came to pass that Isaiah's
words concerning "a basin between the two walls" were so exactly carried
out, as though they had furnished a hydraulic plan, we do not know. But
we will offer a conjecture at the close of the exposition. It stands
here as one of those prudent measures which would be resorted to in
Jerusalem in the anticipation of the coming siege; but it would be
thought of too late, and in self-reliant alienation from God, with no
look directed to Him who had wrought and fashioned that very calamity
which they were now seeking to avert by all these precautions, and by
whom it had been projected long, long before the actual realization.
עשׂיה might be a plural, according to [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md); but the parallel יצרהּ favours
the singular (on the form itself, from עשׂי = עשׂה, see [Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005.md), and at [Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md); [Isa
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#030).md). We have here, and at [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026.md), i.e., within the first part of
the book of Isaiah, the same doctrine of "ideas" that forms so universal
a key-note of the second part, the authenticity of which has been
denied. That which is realized in time has existed long before as a
spiritual pattern, i.e., as an idea in God. God shows this to His
prophets; and so far as prophecy foretells the future, whenever the
event predicted is fulfilled, the prophecy becomes a proof that the
event is the work of God, and was long ago the predetermined counsel of
God. The whole of the Scripture presupposes this pre-existence of the
divine idea before the historical realization, and Isaiah in Israel
(like Plato in the heathen world) was the assiduous interpreter of this
supposition. Thus, in the case before us, the fate of Jerusalem is said
to have been fashioned "long ago" in God. But Jerusalem might have
averted its realization, for it was no decretum absolutum. If Jerusalem
repented, the realization would be arrested.

[Isaiah 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 22:12</span></span>

And so far as it had proceeded already, it was a call from Jehovah to
repentance. "The Lord, Jehovah of hosts, calls in that day to weeping,
and to mourning, and to the pulling out of hair, and to girding with
sackcloth; and behold joy and gladness, slaughtering of oxen and killing
of sheep, eating of flesh and drinking of wine, eating and drinking, for
'tomorrow we die.' And Jehovah of hosts hath revealed in mine ears,
Surely this iniquity shall not be expiated for you until ye die, saith
the Lord, Jehovah of hosts." The first condition of repentance is a
feeling of pain produced by the punishments of God. But upon Jerusalem
they produce the opposite effect. The more threatening the future, the
more insensibly and madly do they give themselves up to the rude,
sensual enjoyment of the present. Shâthoth is interchanged with shâthō
(which is only another form of שׁתה, as in [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md); [Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019).md), to ring with shâchōt (compare
[Hos 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004).md). There are other passages
in which we meet with unusual forms introduced for the sake of the play
upon the words (vid., [Isa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md); [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md); [Isa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md), and compare [Eze
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#011.md), and the keri of [Sa2
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#025).md). The words of the rioters
themselves, whose conduct is sketched by the inf. abs., which are all
governed by hinnēh, are simply "for tomorrow we shall die." This does
not imply that they feel any pleasure in the thought of death, but
indicates a love of life which scoffs at death. Then the unalterable
will of the all-commanding God is audibly and distinctly revealed to the
prophet. Such scoffing as this, which defies the chastisements of God,
will not be expiated in any other way than by the death of the scoffer
(cuppar, from câphar, tegere, means to be covered over, i.e., expiated).
This is done in the case of sin either by the justice of God, as in the
present instance, or by the mercy of God ([Isa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#007).md), or by both justice and mercy
combined (as in [Isa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009).md). In all
three cases the expiation is demanded by the divine holiness, which
requires a covering between itself and sin, by which sin becomes as
though it were not. In this instance the expunging act consists in
punishment. The sin of Jerusalem is expiated by the giving up of the
sinners themselves to death. The verb temūthūn (ye shall die) is written
absolutely, and therefore is all the more dreadful. The Targum renders
it "till ye die the second (eternal) death" (mōthâh thinyânâh). So far
as they prophecy threatened the destruction of Jerusalem by Assyria, it
was never actually fulfilled; but the very opposite occurred. Asshur
itself met with destruction in front of Jerusalem. But this was by no
means opposed to the prophecy; and it was with this conviction that
Isaiah, nevertheless, included the prophecy in the collection which he
made at a time when the non-fulfilment was perfectly apparent. It stands
here in a double capacity. In the first place, it is a memorial of the
mercy of God, which withdraws, or at all events modifies, the threatened
judgment as soon as repentance intervenes. The falling away from Assyria
did take place; but on the part of Hezekiah and many others, who had
taken to heart the prophet's announcement, it did so simply as an affair
that was surrendered into the hands of the God of Israel, through
distrust of either their own strength or Egyptian assistance. Hezekiah
carried out the measures of defence described by the prophet; but he did
this for the good of Jerusalem, and with totally different feelings from
those which the prophet had condemned. These measures of defence
probably included the reservoir between the two walls, which the
chronicler does not mention till the close of the history of his reign,
inasmuch as he follows the thread of the book of Kings, to which his
book stands, as it were, in the relation of a commentary, like the
midrash, from which extracts are made. The king regulated his actions
carefully by the prophecy, inasmuch as after the threats had produced
repentance, [Isa 22:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008.md) still
remained as good and wise counsels. In the second place, the oracle
stands here as the proclamation of a judgment deferred but not repealed.
Even if the danger of destruction which threatened Jerusalem on the part
of Assyria had been mercifully caused to pass away, the threatening word
of Jehovah had not fallen to the ground. The counsel of God contained in
the word of prophecy still remained; and as it was the counsel of the
Omniscient, the time would surely come when it would pass out of the
sphere of ideality into that of actual fact. It remained hovering over
Jerusalem like an eagle, and Jerusalem would eventually become its
carrion. We have only to compare the temūthūn of this passage with the
ἀποθανείσθε of [Joh 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021.md), to see when
the eventual fulfilment took place. Thus the "massa of the valley of
vision" became a memorial of mercy to Israel when it looked back to its
past history: but when it looked into the future, it was still a mirror
of wrath.

[Isaiah 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 22:15</span></span>

"Thus spake the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Go, get thee to that steward
there, to Shebna the house-mayor. What has thou here, and whom hast thou
here, that thou hast hewn thyself out a sepulchre here, hewing out his
sepulchre high up, digging himself a dwelling in rocks? Behold, Jehovah
hurleth thee, hurling with a man's throw, and graspeth thee grasping.
Coiling, He coileth thee a coil, a ball into a land far and wide; there
shalt thou die, and thither the chariots of thy glory, thou shame of the
house of thy lord! And I thrust thee from thy post, and from thy
standing-place he pulleth thee down." לך־בּ, go, take thyself in - not
into the house, however, but into the present halting-place. It is
possible, at the same time, that the expression may simply mean "take
thyself away," as in [Gen 45:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#017.md) and
[Eze 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#004.md). The preposition אל is
interchanged with על, which more commonly denotes the coming of a
stronger man upon a weaker one ([Sa1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012).md), and is here used to designate
the overwhelming power of the prophet's word. "That steward there:" this
expression points contemptuously to the position of the minister of the
court as one which, however high, was a subordinate one after all. We
feel at once, as we read this introduction to the divine address, that
insatiable ambition was one of the leading traits in Shebna's character.
What Isaiah is to say to Shebna follows somewhat abruptly. The words
"and say to him," which are added in the Septuagint, naturally suggest
themselves. The question, What hast thou to do here, and whom hast thou
to bury here? is put with a glance at Shebna's approaching fate. This
building of a sepulchre was quite unnecessary; Shebna himself would
never lie there, nor would he be able to bury his relations there. The
threefold repetition of the word "here" (poh) is of very incisive force:
it is not here that he will stay - here, where he is even now placing
himself on a bier, as if it were his home. The participles חצבי and חקקי
(with chirek compaginis: see on [Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001).md) are also part of the address.
The third person which is introduced here is syntactically regular,
although the second person is used as well ([Isa
23:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md); [Hab
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015).md). Rock-tombs, i.e., a collection
of tombs in the form of chambers in the rocks, were indeed to be found
to the east of Jerusalem, on the western slope of the Mount of Olives,
and in the wall of rock to the west of Jerusalem; but the word mârom
("high up"), in connection with the threefold "here" (poh), and the
contemptuous "that administrator there," warrants us in assuming that
mârom refers to "the height of the sepulchres of the sons of David"
([Ch2 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#033).md), i.e., the eastern slope
of Zion, where the tombs of the kings were excavated in the rocks.

So high did Shebna stand, and so great did he think himself, that he
helped after his death to rest among kings, and by no means down at the
bottom. But how he deceived himself! Jehovah would hurl him far away
(tūl, to be long; pilpel, to throw or stretch out to a distance),

(Note: In the later form of the language, this verbal stem signifies
generally to move onward; hence tiyyūl, motion, or a walk, and
metaltelı̄n, furniture, i.e., moveable goods.)

גּבר טלטלה. This is either equivalent to גּבר טלטלת טלטלה, with a man's
throw (Rosenmller), or גּבר is in apposition to Jehovah (Gesenius and
Knobel). As taltēlah stands too baldly if the latter be adopted, for
which reason the vocative rendering "O man," which is found in the
Syriac, does not commend itself, and as such an elliptical combination
of the absolute with the genitive is by no means unusual (e.g., [Pro
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#021.md); [Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010).md), we give the preference to the
former. Jerome's rendering, "as they carry off a cock," which he
obtained from the mouth of his Hebraeus, cannot be taken into
consideration at all; although it has been retained by Schegg (see
Geiger, Lesestcke aus der Mischna, p. 106). The verb עטה does not give a
suitable sense as used in [Jer 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012.md),
where it merely signifies to cover one's self, not to wrap up; nor can
we obtain one from [Sa1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#019.md); [Sa1
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#014.md); [Sa1
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#032.md), since the verbal forms which we
find there, and which are to be traced to עיט (from which comes עיט, a
bird of prey), and not to עטה, signify "to rush upon anything" (when
construed with either בּ or אל). It is better, therefore, to take it, as
Michaelis, Rosenmller, Knobel, and others do, in the sense of grasping
or laying hold of. On the other hand, tzânaph, which is applied in other
instances to the twisting of a turban, also signifies to wrap up, make
up into a bundle, or coil up. And caddūr, like tzenēphâh, signifies that
into which Shebna would be coiled up; for the Caph is not to be taken in
a comparative sense, since the use of caddūr in the sense of globus or
sphaera is established by the Talmud (see at [Job
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#024).md), whereas the Arabic daur only
means gyrus, periodus. Shebna is made into a round coil, or ball, which
is hurled into a land stretching out on both sides, i.e., over the broad
surface of Mesopotamia, where he flies on farther and farther, without
meeting with any obstacle whatever.

(Note: Compare the old saying, "The heart of man is an apple driven by a
tempest over an open plain.")

He comes thither to die - he who, by his exaggeration and abuse of his
position, has not only dishonoured his office, but the Davidic court as
well; and thither do his state carriages also come. There can be no
doubt that it was by the positive command of Jehovah that Isaiah
apostrophized the proud and wealthy Shebna with such boldness and
freedom as this. And such freedom was tolerated too. The murder or
incarceration of a prophet was a thing of rare occurrence in the kingdom
of Judah before the time of Manasseh. In order to pave the way for the
institution of another in Shebna's office, the punishment of deposition,
which cannot be understood in any other way than as preceding the
punishment of banishment, is placed at the close of the first half of
the prophecy. The subject in [Isa
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#019.md) is not the king, as Luzzatto
supposes, but Jehovah, as in [Isa
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#019.md) (compare [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 22:20</span></span>

Jehovah first of all gives him the blow which makes him tremble in his
post, and then pulls him completely down from this his lofty station,

(Note: וּממּעמדך has not only the metheg required by the kametz on
account of the long vowel, and the metheg required by the patach on
account of the following chateph patach (the latter of which also takes
the place of the metheg, as the sign of a subordinate tone), but also a
third metheg with the chirek, which only assists the emphatic
pronunciation of the preposition, out which would not stand there at all
unless the word had had a disjunctive accent (compare [Isa
55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009.md); [Psa
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045.md); [Hos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006))..md)

in order that another worthier man may take his place. "And it will come
to pass in that day, that I call to my servant Eliakim the son of
Hilkiah, and invest him with thy coat, and I throw thy sash firmly round
him, and place they government in his hand; and he will become a father
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. And I place
the key of David upon his shoulder: and when he opens, no man shuts; and
when he shuts, no man opens. And I fasten him as a plug in a fast place,
and he becomes the seat of honour to his father's house. And the whole
mass of his father's house hangs upon him, the offshoots and
side-shoots, every small vessel, from the vessel of the basins even to
every vessel of the pitchers." Eliakim is called the "servant of
Jehovah," as one who was already a servant of God in his heart and
conduct; the official service is added for the first time here. This
title of honour generally embraces both kinds of service ([Isa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003).md). It is quite in accordance with
oriental custom, that this transfer of the office is effected by means
of investiture (compare [Kg1 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019).md):
chizzēk, with a double accusative, viz., that of the person and that of
the official girdle, is used here according to its radical
signification, in the sense of girding tightly or girding round, putting
the girdle round him so as to cause the whole dress to sit firmly,
without hanging loose. The word memshaltekâ (thy government) shows how
very closely the office forfeited by Shebna was connected with that of
the king. This is also proved by the word "father," which is applied in
other cases to the king as the father of the land ([Isa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005).md). The "key" signifies the power of
the keys; and for this reason it is not given into Eliakim's hand, but
placed upon his shoulder ([Isa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005).md).
This key was properly handled by the king ([Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007).md), and therefore by the
"house-mayor" only in his stead. The power of the keys consisted not
only in the supervision of the royal chambers, but also in the decision
who was and who was not to be received into the king's service. There is
a resemblance, therefore, to the giving of the keys of the kingdom of
heaven to Peter under the New Testament. But there the "binding" and
"loosing" introduce another figure, though one similar in sense; whereas
here, in the "opening" and "shutting," the figure of the key is
retained. The comparison of the institution of Eliakim in his office to
the fastening of a tent-peg was all the more natural, that yâthēd was
also used as a general designation for national rulers ([Zac
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004).md), who stand in the same relation
to the commonwealth as a tent-peg to the tent which it holds firmly and
keeps upright. As the tent-peg is rammed into the ground, so that a
person could easily sit upon it, the figure is changed, and the tent-peg
becomes a seat of honour. As a splendid chair is an ornament to a room,
so Eliakim would be an honour to his hitherto undistinguished family.
The thought that naturally suggests itself - namely, that the members of
the family would sit upon this chair, for the purpose of raising
themselves to honour - is expressed by a different figure. Eliakim is
once more depicted as a yâthed, but it is as a still higher one this
time - namely, as the rod of a wardrobe, or a peg driven high up into
the wall. Upon this rod or peg they hang (thâlu, i.e., one hangs, or
there hangs) all the câbōd of the house of Eliakim, i.e., not every one
who wished to be honoured and attained to honour in this way (cf., [Isa
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013).md), but the whole weight of his
family (as in [Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007).md). This family
is then subdivided into its separate parts, and, as we may infer from
the juxtaposition of the masculine and feminine nouns, according to its
male and female constituents. In צאצאים (offshoots) and צפעות
("side-shoots," from צפע, to push out; compare צפיע, dung, with צאה,
mire) there is contained the idea of a widely ramifying and
undistinguished family connection. The numerous rabble consisted of
nothing but vessels of a small kind (hakkâtân), at the best of basons
(aggânoth) like those used by the priests for the blood ([Exo
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#006).md), or in the house for mixing wine
([Sol 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003.md); Aram. aggono, Ar. iggâne,
ingân, a washing bason), but chiefly of nebâlim, i.e., leather bottles
or earthenware pitchers ([Isa 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014).md).
The whole of this large but hitherto ignoble family of relations would
fasten upon Eliakim, and climb through him to honour. Thus all at once
the prophecy, which seemed so full of promise of Eliakim, assumes a
satirical tone. We get an impression of the favouring of nephews and
cousins, and cannot help asking how this could be a suitable prophecy
for Shebna to hear.

[Isaiah 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 22:25</span></span>

We will refer to this again. But in the meantime the impression is an
irresistible one; and the Targum, Jerome, Hitzig, and others, are
therefore right in assuming that Eliakim is the peg which, however
glorious its beginning may have been, comes at last to the shameful end
described in [Isa 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#025.md) : "In that
day, saith Jehovah of hosts, will the peg that is fastened in a sure
place be removed, and be cast down, and fall; and the burden that it
bore falls to the ground: for Jehovah hath spoken." The prophet could
not express in clearer terms the identity of the peg threatened here
with Eliakim himself; for how is it conceivable that the prophet could
turn all that he has predicated of Eliakim in [Isa
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023.md), [Isa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024.md), into predicates of Shebna? What
Umbreit says - namely, that common sense must refer [Isa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#025.md) to Shebna - is the very reverse
of correct. Eliakim himself is also brought down at last by the
greatness of his power, on account of the nepotism to which he has given
way. His family makes a wrong use of him; and he is more yielding than
he ought to be, and makes a wrong use of his office to favour them! He
therefore falls, and brings down with him all that hung upon the peg,
i.e., all his relations, who have brought him to ruin through the
rapacity with which they have grasped at prosperity.

Hitzig maintains that [Isa 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024.md), [Isa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#025.md) form a later addition. But it is
much better to assume that the prophet wrote down [Isa
22:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015.md) at one sitting, after the
predicted fate of the two great ministers of state, which had been
revealed to him at two different times, had been actually fulfilled. We
know nothing more about them than this, that in the fourteenth year of
Hezekiah it was not Shebna, but Eliakim, "who was over the house" ([Isa
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#003.md), [Isa
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#022.md); [Isa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#002).md). But Shebna also filled another
office of importance, namely that of sōpher. Was he really taken
prisoner and carried away (a thing which is perfectly conceivable even
without an Assyrian captivity of the nation generally)? Or did he
anticipate the threatened judgment, and avert it by a penitential
self-abasement? To this and other questions we can give no reply. One
thing alone is certain - namely, that the threefold prediction of
Shebna's fall, of Eliakim's elevation, and of Eliakim's fall, would not
stand where it does, if there were any reason whatever to be ashamed of
comparing the prophecy with its fulfilment.
