### [Jeremiah Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 38:1</span></span>

In this chapter two events are mentioned which took place in the last
period of the siege of Jerusalem, shortly before the capture of the city
by the Chaldeans. According to [Jer
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004.md), the number of fighting men had
now very much decreased; and according to [Jer
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019.md), the number of deserters to the
Chaldeans had become large. Moreover, according to [Jer
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#009.md), famine had already begun to
prevail; this hastened the fall of the city.

[Jer 38:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md)

Jeremiah is cast into a miry pit, but drawn out again by Ebedmelech the
Cushite. [Jer 38:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md). Being confined
in the court of the guard attached to the royal palace, Jeremiah had
opportunities of conversing with the soldiers stationed there and the
people of Judah who came thither (cf. [Jer
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md) with [Jer
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#008.md), [Jer
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012).md), and of declaring, in
opposition to them, his conviction (which he had indeed expressed from
the beginning of the siege) that all resistance to the Chaldeans would
be fruitless, and only bring destruction (cf. [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009)..md). On this account, the princes
who were of a hostile disposition towards him were so embittered, that
they resolved on his death, and obtain from the king permission to cast
him into a deep pit with mire at the bottom. In v. 1 four of these
princes are named, two of whom, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur
the son of Malchiah, are known, from [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md) and [Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md), as confidants of the king; the
other two, Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur,
are not mentioned elsewhere. Gedaliah was probably a son of the Pashur
who had once put Jeremiah in the stocks ([Jer
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001).md). The words of the prophet,
[Jer 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002.md), [Jer
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#003.md), are substantially the same as he
had already uttered at the beginning of the siege, [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009.md) (יחיה as in [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009).md). [Jer
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004.md). The princes said to the king,
"Let this man, we beseech thee, be put to death for the construction,
see on [Jer 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014.md); for therefore i.e.,
because no one puts him out of existence - על־כּן as in [Jer
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028.md) he weakens the hands of the men
of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by
speaking words like these to them; for this man does not seek the
welfare of this people, but their ill." מרפּא for מרפּא, to cause the
hands of any one to be relaxed, i.e., to make him dispirited; cf. [Ezr
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#004.md); [Isa
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003.md). דּרשׁ with ל htiw , as [Job
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#006.md); [Deu
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#030.md); [Ch1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#019.md), etc., elsewhere with the
accusatival את; cf. [Jer 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md) et
passim. On this point cf. [Jer 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md).
The allegation which the princes made against Jeremiah was possibly
correct. The constancy with which Jeremiah declared that resistance was
useless, since, in accordance with the divine decree, Jerusalem was to
be taken and burnt by the Chaldeans, could not but make the soldiers and
the people unwilling any longer to sacrifice their lives in defending
the city. Nevertheless the complaint was unjust, because Jeremiah was
not expressing his own personal opinion, but was declaring the word of
the Lord, and that, too, not from any want of patriotism or through
personal cowardice, but in the conviction, derived from the divine
revelation, that it was only by voluntary submission that the fate of
the besieged could be mitigated; hence he acted from a deep feeling of
love to the people, and in order to avert complete destruction from
them. The courage of the people which he sought to weaken was not a
heroic courage founded on genuine trust in God, but carnal obstinacy,
which could not but lead to ruin.

[Jer 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#005.md)

The king said, "Behold, he is in your hand, for the king can do nothing
alongside of you." This reply indicates not merely the weakness and
powerlessness of the king against his princes, but also his inward
aversion to the testimony of the man of God. "That he would like to save
him, just as he afterwards does ([Jer
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#010).md)," is not implied in what he
says, with which he delivers up the prophet to the spite of his enemies.
Though the princes had at once put Jeremiah to death, the king would not
even have been able to reproach them. The want of courage vigorously to
oppose the demand of the princes did not spring from any kindly feeling
towards the prophet, but partly from moral weakness of character, partly
from inward repugnance to the word of God proclaimed by Jeremiah. On the
construction אין וּיכל instead of the participle from יכול, which does
not occur, cf. Ewald, 321, a. אתכם is certainly in form an accusative;
but it cannot be such, since דּבר follows as the accusative: it is
therefore either to be pointed אתּכם or to be considered as standing for
it, just as אותך often occurs for אתּך, "with," i.e., "along with you."

[Jer 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006.md)

The princes (שׂרים) now cast Jeremiah into the pit of the king's son
(בּן־מלך, see on [Jer 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026).md) Malchiah,
which was in the court of the prison, letting him down with ropes into
the pit, in which there was no water, but mud; into this Jeremiah sank.
The act is first mentioned in a general way in the words, "they cast him
into the pit;" then the mode of proceeding is particularized in the
words, "and they let him down," etc. On the expression הבּור מלכּיּהוּ,
"the pit of Malchiah," cf. Ewald, 290, d: the article stands here before
the nomen regens, because the nomen rectum, from being a proper name,
cannot take it; and yet the pit must be pointed out as one well known
and definite. That it was very deep, and that Jeremiah must have
perished in it if he were not soon taken out again, is evident from the
very fact that they were obliged to use ropes in letting him down, and
still more so from the trouble caused in pulling him out ([Jer
38:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#010).md). That the princes did not at
once put the prophet to death with the sword was not owing to any
feeling of respect for the king, because the latter had not pronounced
sentence of death on him, but because they sought to put the prophet to
a final death, and yet at the same time wished to silence the voice of
conscience with the excuse that they had not shed his blood.

[Jer 38:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#007.md)

The deliverance of Jeremiah. Ebedmelech the Cushite, a eunuch, heard of
what had happened to Jeremiah. אישׁ סריס .haimer signifies a eunuch: the
אישׁ shows that סריס is here to be taken in its proper meaning, not in
the metaphorical sense of an officer of the court. Since the king had
many wives ([Jer 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#022)..md), the presence
of a eunuch at the court, as overseer of the harem, cannot seem strange.
The law of Moses, indeed, prohibited castration ([Deu
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002).md); but the man was a foreigner,
and had been taken by the king into his service as one castrated. עבד
מלך is a proper name (otherwise it must have been written המּלך); the
name is a genuine Hebrew one, and probably may have been assumed when
the man entered the service of Zedekiah. - On hearing of what had
occurred, the Ethiopian went to the king, who was sitting in the gate of
Benjamin, on the north wall of the city, which was probably the point
most threatened by the besiegers, and said to him, [Jer
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#009.md), "My lord, O king, these men have
acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom
they have cast into the pit; and he is dying of hunger on the spot, for
there is no more bread in the city." הרעוּ את־א, lit.,: "they have done
wickedly what they have done." ויּמת cannot be translated, "and he died
on the spot," for Ebedmelech wishes to save him before he dies of
hunger. But neither does it stand for וימת, "so that he must die." The
imperfect with Vav consecutive expresses the consequence of a preceding
act, and usually stands in the narrative as a historic tense; but it may
also declare what necessarily follows or will follow from what precedes;
cf. Ewald, 342, a. Thus ויּמת stands here in the sense, "and so he is
dying," i.e., "he must die of hunger." תּחתּיו, "on his spot," i.e., on
the place where he is; cf. [Sa2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#023.md).
The reason, "for there is no longer any bread (הלחם with the article,
the necessary bread) in the city," is not to be taken in the exact sense
of the words, but merely expresses the greatest deficiency in
provisions. As long as Jeremiah was in the court of the prison, he
received, like the officers of the court, at the king's order, his
ration of bread every day ([Jer
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021).md). But after he had been cast
into the pit, that royal ordinance no longer applied to him, so that he
was given over to the tender mercies of others, from whom, in the
prevailing scarcity of bread, he had not much to hope for.

[Jer 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#010.md)

Then the king commanded the Ethiopian, "Take hence thirty men in thine
hand, and bring up Jeremiah out of the pit before he dies." בידך, "in
thine hand," i.e., under your direction; cf. [Num
31:49](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#049.md). The number thirty has been
found too great; and Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf would read שׁלשׁה, because
the syntax requires the singular אישׁ after שׁלשׁים, and because at that
time, when the fighting men had already decreased in number ([Jer
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004).md), thirty men could not be sent
away from a post in danger without difficulty. These two arguments are
quite invalid. The syntax does not demand אישׁ; for with the tens
(20-90) the noun frequently follows in the plural as well as in the
singular, if the number precede; cf. [Sa2
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#020.md); [Kg2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#016.md), etc.; see also Gesenius'
Grammar, 120, 2. The other argument is based on arbitrary hypotheses;
for the passage neither speaks of fighting men, nor states that they
would be taken from a post in danger. Ebedmelech was to take thirty men,
not because they would all be required for drawing out the prophet, but
for making surer work in effecting the deliverance of the prophet,
against all possible attempts on the part of the princes or of the
populace to prevent them.

[Jer 38:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#011.md)

Ebedmelech took the men at his hand, went into the king's house under
the treasury, and took thence rags of torn and of worn-out garments, and
let them down on ropes to Jeremiah into the pit, and said to him, "Put,
I pray thee, the rages of the torn and cast-off clothes under thine
arm-pits under the ropes." Jeremiah did so, and then they drew him out
of the pit by the ropes. תּחת is a room under the treasury. בּלוי, in
[Jer 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#012.md) בּלואים, from בּלה, to be
worn away (of clothes), are rags. סחבות (from סחב, to drag, drag about,
tear to pieces) are torn pieces of clothing. מלחים, worn-out garments,
from מלח, in Niphal, [Isa 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md), to
vanish, dissolve away. The article at הסּחבות is expunged from the Qeri
for sake of uniformity, because it is not found with מלחים; but it may
as well be allowed to stand as be removed. אצּילות ידים, properly the
roots of the hands, are not the knuckles of the hand, but the shoulders
of the arms. מתּחת לחבלים, under the ropes; i.e., the rags were to serve
as pads to the ropes which were to be placed under the arm-pits, to
prevent the ropes from cutting the flesh. When Jeremiah had been drawn
out in this way from the deep pit of mire, he remained in the court of
the prison.

[Jeremiah 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 38:14</span></span>

Conversation between the king and the prophet. - [Jer
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014.md). King Zedekiah was desirous of
once more hearing a message of God from the prophet, and for this object
had him brought into the third entrance in the house of the Lord.
Nothing further is known about the situation and the nature of this
entrance; possibly it led from the palace to the temple, and seems to
have been an enclosed space, for the king could carry on a private
conversation there with the prophet. The king said to him, "I ask you
about a matter, do not conceal anything from me." He meant a message
from God regarding the final issue of the siege, cf. [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md). Jeremiah, knowing the aversion
of the king to the truth, replies, [Jer
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#015.md) : "If I tell thee \[sc. the word
of the Lord\], wilt thou not assuredly kill me? And if I were to give
thee advice, thou wouldst not listen to me." [Jer
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#016.md). Then the king sware to him
secretly, "As Jahveh liveth, who hath made us this soul, I shall
certainly not kill thee, nor deliver thee into the hand of these men who
seek thy life." את אשׁר, as in [Jer
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md), properly means, "with regard to
Him who has created us." The Qeri expunges את. "These men" are the
princes mentioned in [Jer 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md).

[Jeremiah 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 38:17</span></span>

After this solemn asseveration of the king, Jeremiah said to him, "Thus
saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt
assuredly go out to the princes of the king of Babylon \[i.e., wilt
surrender thyself to them, cf. [Kg2
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#031.md); [Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md)\], then thy soul shall live, and
this city shall not be burned with fire, and thou and thy house shall
live. But if thou dost not go out to the princes of the king of Babylon,
then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they
shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand."
The word of God is the same that Jeremiah had already repeatedly
announced to the king, cf. [Jer
34:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#002.md); [Jer
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#004.md); [Jer
21:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004.md). The princes (chiefs,
generals) of the king of Babylon are named, because they commanded the
besieging army ([Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md), [Jer
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013).md); Nebuchadnezzar himself had his
headquarters at Riblah, [Jer 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md).

[Jeremiah 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 38:19</span></span>

Against the advice that he should save his life by surrendering to the
Chaldeans, Zedekiah suggests the consideration, "I am afraid of the
Jews, who have deserted \[נפל אל as in [Jer
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013.md)\] to the Chaldeans, lest they
give me into their hands and maltreat me." התעלּל בּ, illudere alicui,
to abuse any one by mockery or ill-treatment; cf. [Num
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#029.md); [Ch1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#004.md), etc. Jeremiah replies, [Jer
38:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#020.md)., "They will not give thee up.
Yet, pray, listen to the voice of Jahveh, in that which I say to thee,
that it may be well with thee, and that thy soul may live. [Jer
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#021.md). But if thou dost refuse to go
out i.e., to surrender thyself to the Chaldeans, this is the word which
the Lord hath shown me has revealed to me: [Jer
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#022.md). Behold, all the women that are
left in the house of the king of Judah shall be brought out to the
princes of the king of Babylon, and those \[women\] shall say, Thy
friends have misled thee and have overcome thee; thy feet are sunk in
the mud, they have turned away back. [Jer
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#023.md). And all thy wives and thy
children shall they bring out to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not
escape out of their hand; for thou shalt be seized by the hand of the
king of Babylon, and thou shalt burn this city with fire." - After
Jeremiah had once more assured the king that he would save his life by
voluntary surrender, he announces to him that, on the other alternative,
instead of his becoming the sport of the deserters, the women of his
harem would be insulted. The women who remain in the king's house, as
distinguished from "thy wives" ([Jer
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#023).md), are the women of the royal
harem, the wives of former kings, who remain in the harem as the
concubines of the reigning king. These are to be brought out to the
generals of the Chaldean king, and to sing a satire on him, to this
effect: "Thy friends have misled thee, and overpowered thee," etc. The
first sentence of this song is from [Oba
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#007.md), where השּׁיאוּך ere stands
instead of הסּיתוּך. The friends (אנשׁי שׁלמך, cf. [Jer
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010).md) are his great men and his false
prophets. Through their counsels, these have led him astray, and brought
him into a bog, in which his feet stick fast, and then they have gone
back; i.e., instead of helping him out, they have deserted him, leaving
him sticking in the bog. The expression is figurative, and the meaning
of the figure is plain (רגלך is plural). בּץ, ἁπ λεγ.., is equivalent to
בּצּה, a bog, [Job 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011.md). Moreover, the
wives and children of Zedekiah are to fall into the hand of the
Chaldeans. מוצאים, the participle, is used instead of the finite tense
to express the notion of indefinite personality: "they bring them out."
תּתּפשׂ בּיד ".tuo meht gnirb , properly, "to be seized in the hand," is
a pregnant construction for, "to fall into the hand and be held fast by
it." "Thou shalt burn this city," i.e., bring the blame of burning it
upon thyself. Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf, following the lxx, Syr., and
Chald., would change תּשׂרף into תּשּׂרף, but needlessly.

[Jeremiah 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 38:24</span></span>

From the king's weakness of character, and his dependence on his evil
counsellors, neither could this interview have any result. Partly from
want of firmness, but chiefly from fear of the reproaches of his
princes, he did not venture to surrender himself and the city to the
Chaldeans. Hence he did not wish that his interview with the prophet
should be known, partly for the purpose of sparing himself reproaches
from the princes, partly also, perhaps, not to expose the prophet to
further persecutions on the part of the great men. Accordingly, he
dismissed Jeremiah with this instruction: "Let no man know of these
words, lest thou die." But if the princes should learn that the king had
been speaking with him, and asked him, "Tell us, now, what thou hast
said to the king, do not hide it from us, and we will not kill thee; and
what did the king say to thee?" then he was to say to them, "I presented
my supplication before the king, that he would not send me back to the
house of Jonathan, to die there." As to the house of Jonathan, see on
[Jer 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015.md). On מפּיל תּחנּתי cf. [Jer
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md); [Jer
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#020.md).

[Jeremiah 38:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 38:27</span></span>

What the king had supposed actually occurred, and Jeremiah gave the
princes, who asked about the conversation, the reply that the king had
prepared for him. יחרשׁוּ ממּנּוּ .mih rof deraperp, they went away in
silence from him, and left him in peace; cf. [Sa1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#008.md). כּי לא נשׁמע , for the matter,
the real subject of the conversation did not become known. So Jeremiah
remained in the court of the prison till the day of the capture of
Jerusalem. - The last sentence of [Jer
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#028.md) belongs to the following
chapter, and forms the introductory sentence of the passage whose
conclusion follows in [Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md).
