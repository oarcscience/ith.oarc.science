### [Exodus Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 17:1</span></span>

Want of Water at Rephidim. - [Exo
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md). On leaving the desert of Sin,
the Israelites came למסעיהם, "according to their journeys," i.e., in
several marches performed with encampings and departures, to Rephidim,
at Horeb, where they found no water. According to [Num
33:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#012.md), they encamped twice between
the desert of Sin and Rephidim, viz., at Dofkah and Alush. The situation
of Rephidim may be determined with tolerable certainty, partly from [Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md) as compared with [Exo
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#005.md), which shows that it is to be
sought for at Horeb, and partly from the fact, that the Israelites
reached the desert of Sinai, after leaving Rephidim, in a single day's
march ([Exo 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#002).md). As the only way
from Debbet er Ramleh to Horeb or Sinai, through which a whole nation
could pass, lies through the large valley of es-Sheikh, Rephidim must be
sought for at the point where this valley opens into the broad plain of
er Rahah; and not in the defile with Moses' seat (Jokad Seidna Musa) in
it, which is a day's journey from the foot of Sinai, or five hours from
the point at which the Sheikh valley opens into the plain or er Rahah,
or the plain of Szueir or Suweiri,

(Note: Burckhardt, p. 799; v. Raumer, Zug der Israeliten, p. 29;
Robinson's Palestine, pp. 178, 179; De Laborde, comment., p. 78;
Tischendorf, Reise i. p. 244.)

because this plain is so far from Sinai, that the Israelites could not
possibly have travelled thence to the desert of Sinai in a single day;
nor yet at the fountain of Abu Suweirah, which is three hours to the
north of Sinai (Strauss, p. 131), for the Sheikh valley, which is only a
quarter of a mile broad at this spot, and enclosed on both sides by tall
cliffs (Robinson, i. 215), would not afford the requisite space for a
whole nation; and the well found here, which though small is never dry
(Robinson, i. 216), neither tallies with the want of water at Rephidim,
nor stands "upon the rock at (in) Horeb," so that it could be taken to
be the spring opened by Moses. The distance from Wady Nasb (in the
desert of Sin) to the point at which the upper Sinai road reaches the
Wady es Sheikh is about 15 hours (Robinson, vol. iii. app.), and the
distance thence to the plain of er Rahah through the Sheikh valley,
which runs in a large semicircle to Horeb, 10 hours more (Burckhardt,
pp. 797ff.), whereas the straight road across el Oerf, Wady Solaf, and
Nukb Hawy to the convent of Sinai is only seven hours and a half
(Robinson, vol. iii. appendix). The whole distance from Wady Nasb to the
opening of the Sheikh valley into the plain of er Rahah, viz., 25 hours
in all, the Israelites might have accomplished in three days, answering
to the three stations, Dofkah, Alush, and Rephidim. A trace of Dofkah
seems to have been retained in el Tabbacha, which Seetzen found in the
narrow rocky valley of Wady Gn, i.e., Kineh, after his visit to Wady
Mukatteb, on proceeding an hour and a half farther in a
north-westerly(?) direction, and where he saw some Egyptian antiquities.
Knobel supposes the station Alush to have been in the Wady Oesch or Osh
(Robinson, i. 125; Burckhardt, p. 792), where sweet water may be met
with at a little distance off. But apart from the improbability of Alush
being identical with Osh, even if al were the Arabic article, the
distance is against it, as it is at least twelve camel-hours from Horeb
through the Sheikh valley. Alush is rather to be sought for at the
entrance to the Sheikh valley; for in no other case could the Israelites
have reached Rephidim in one day.

[Exo 17:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002.md)

As there was no water to drink in Rephidim, the people murmured against
Moses, for having brought them out of Egypt to perish with thirst in the
wilderness. This murmuring Moses called "tempting God," i.e.,
unbelieving doubt in the gracious presence of the Lord to help them
([Exo 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007).md). In this the people
manifested not only their ingratitude to Jehovah, who had hitherto
interposed so gloriously and miraculously in every time of distress or
need, but their distrust in the guidance of Jehovah and the divine
mission of Moses, and such impatience of unbelief as threatened to break
out into open rebellion against Moses. "Yet a little," he said to God
(i.e., a very little more), "and they stone me;" and the divine
long-suffering and grace interposed in this case also, and provided for
the want without punishing their murmuring. Moses was to pass on before
the people, and, taking some of the elders with him, and his staff with
which he smote the Nile, to go to the rock at Horeb, and smite upon the
rock with the staff, at the place where God should stand before him, and
water would come out of the rock. The elders were to be eye-witnesses of
the miracle, that they might bear their testimony to it before the
unbelieving people, "ne dicere possint, jam ab antiquis temporibus
fontes ibi fuisse" (Rashi). Jehovah's standing before Moses upon the
rock, signified the gracious assistance of God. לפני עמד frequently
denotes the attitude of a servant when standing before his master, to
receive and execute his commands. Thus Jehovah condescended to come to
the help of Moses, and assist His people with His almighty power. His
gracious presence caused water to flow out of the hard dry rock, though
not till Moses struck it with his staff, that the people might
acknowledge him afresh as the possessor of supernatural and miraculous
powers. The precise spot at which the water was smitten out of the rock
cannot be determined; for there is no reason whatever for fixing upon
the summit of the present Horeb, Ras el Sufsafeh, from which you can
take in the whole of the plain of er Rahah (Robinson, i. p. 154).

[Exo 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007.md)

From this behaviour of the unbelieving nation the place received the
names Massah and Meribah, "temptation and murmuring," that this sin of
the people might never be forgotten (cf. [Deu
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016.md); [Psa
78:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#020.md); [Psa
95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md); [Psa
105:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#041).md).

[Exodus 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 17:8</span></span>

The want of water had only just been provided for, when Israel had to
engage in a conflict with the Amalekites, who had fallen upon their rear
and smitten it ([Deu 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#018).md). The
expansion of this tribe, that was descended from a grandson of Esau (see
[Gen 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012).md), into so great a power
even in the Mosaic times, is perfectly conceivable, if we imagine the
process to have been analogous to that which we have already described
in the case of the leading branches of the Edomites, who had grown into
a powerful nation through the subjugation and incorporation of the
earlier population of Mount Seir. The Amalekites had no doubt come to
the neighbourhood of Sinai for the same reason for which, even in the
present day, the Bedouin Arabs leave the lower districts at the
beginning of summer, and congregate in the mountain regions of the
Arabian peninsula, viz., because the grass is dried up in the former,
whereas in the latter the pasturage remains green much longer, on
account of the climate being comparatively cooler (Burckhardt, Syr. p.
789). There they fell upon the Israelites, probably in the Sheikh
valley, where the rear had remained behind the main body, not merely for
the purpose of plundering or of disputing the possession of this
district and its pasture ground with the Israelites, but to assail
Israel as the nation of God, and if possible to destroy it. The divine
command to exterminate Amalek ([Exo
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014).md) points to this; and still more
the description given of the Amalekites in Balaam's utterances, as גּוים
ראשׁית, "the beginning," i.e., the first and foremost of the heathen
nations ([Num 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020).md). In Amalek the
heathen world commenced that conflict with the people of God, which,
while it aims at their destruction, can only be terminated by the
complete annihilation of the ungodly powers of the world. Earlier
theologians pointed out quite correctly the deepest ground for the
hostility of the Amalekites, when they traced the causa belli to this
fact, "quod timebat Amalec, qui erat de semine Esau, jam implendam
benedictionem, quam Jacob obtinuit et praeripuit ipsi Esau, praesertim
cum in magna potentia venirent Israelitae, ut promissam occuparent
terram" Mnster, C. a Lapide, etc.). This peculiar significance in the
conflict is apparent, not only from the divine command to exterminate
the Amalekites, and to carry on the war of Jehovah with Amalek from
generation to generation ([Exo 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014.md)
and [Exo 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#016).md), but also from the
manner in which Moses led the Israelites to battle and to victory.
Whereas he had performed all the miracles in Egypt and on the journey by
stretching out his staff, on this occasion he directed his servant
Joshua to choose men for the war, and to fight the battle with the
sword. He himself went with Aaron and Hur to the summit of a hill to
hold up the staff of God in his hands, that he might procure success to
the warriors through the spiritual weapons of prayer.

The proper name of Joshua, who appears here for the first time in the
service of Moses, as Hosea (הושׁע); he was a prince of the tribe of
Ephraim ([Num 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#008.md), [Num
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016.md); [Deu
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#044).md). The name יהושׁע, "Jehovah is
help" (or, God-help), he probably received at the time when he entered
Moses' service, either before or after the battle with the Amalekites
(see [Num 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016.md), and Hengstenberg,
Dissertations, vol. ii.). Hur, who also held a prominent position in the
nation, according to [Exo 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#014.md), in
connection with Aaron, was the son of Caleb, the son of Hezron, the
grandson of Judah ([Ch1 2:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018).md), and
the grandfather of Bezaleel, the architect of the tabernacle ([Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md); [Exo
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030.md); [Exo
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#022.md), cf. [Ch1
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019).md). According to Jewish
tradition, he was the husband of Miriam.

The battle was fought on the day after the first attack ([Exo
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009).md). The hill (גּבעה, not Mount
Horeb), upon the summit of which Moses took up his position during the
battle, along with Aaron and Hur, cannot be fixed upon with exact
precision, but it was probably situated in the table-land of Fureia, to
the north of er Rahah and the Sheikh valley, which is a fertile piece of
pasture ground (Burckhardt, p. 801; Robinson, i. pp. 139, 215), or else
in the plateau which runs to the north-east of the Horeb mountains and
to the east of the Sheikh valley, with the two peaks Umlanz and Um
Alawy; supposing, that is, that the Amalekites attacked the Israelites
from Wady Muklifeh or es Suweiriyeh. Moses went to the top of the hill
that he might see the battle from thence. He took Aaron and Hur with
him, not as adjutants to convey his orders to Joshua and the army
engaged, but to support him in his own part in connection with the
conflict. This was to hold up his hand with the staff of God in it. To
understand the meaning of this sign, it must be borne in mind that,
although [Exo 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#011.md) merely speaks of
the raising and dropping of the hand (in the singular), yet, according
to [Exo 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012.md), both hands were
supported by Aaron and Hur, who stood one on either side, so that Moses
did not hold up his hands alternately, but grasped the staff with both
his hands, and held it up with the two. The lifting up of the hands has
been regarded almost with unvarying unanimity by Targumists, Rabbins,
Fathers, Reformers, and nearly all the more modern commentators, as the
sign or attitude of prayer. Kurtz, on the contrary, maintains, in direct
opposition to the custom observed throughout the whole of the Old
Testament by all pious and earnest worshipers, of lifting up their hands
to God in heaven, that this view attributes an importance to the outward
form of prayer which has no analogy even in the Old Testament; he
therefore agrees with Lakemacher, in Rosenmller's Scholien, in regarding
the attitude of Moses with his hand lifted up as "the attitude of a
commander superintending and directing the battle," and the elevation of
the hand as only the means adopted for raising the staff, which was
elevated in the sight of the warriors of Israel as the banner of
victory. But this meaning cannot be established from [Exo
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015.md) and [Exo
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#016.md). For the altar with the name
"Jehovah my banner," and the watchword "the hand on the banner of
Jehovah, war of the Lord against Amalek," can neither be proved to be
connected with the staff which Moses held in his hand, nor be adduced as
a proof that Moses held the staff in front of the Israelites as the
banner of victory. The lifting up of the staff of God was, no doubt, a
banner to the Israelites of victory over their foes, but not in this
sense, that Moses directed the battle as commander-in-chief, for he had
transferred the command to Joshua; nor yet in this sense, that he
imparted divine powers to the warriors by means of the staff, and so
secured the victory. To effect this, he would not have lifted it up, but
have stretched it out, either over the combatants, or at all events
towards them, as in the case of all the other miracles that were
performed with the staff. The lifting up of the staff secured to the
warriors the strength needed to obtain the victory, from the fact that
by means of the staff Moses brought down this strength from above, i.e.,
from the Almighty God in heaven; not indeed by a merely spiritless and
unthinking elevation of the staff, but by the power of his prayer, which
was embodied in the lifting up of his hands with the staff, and was so
far strengthened thereby, that God had chosen and already employed this
staff as a medium of the saving manifestation of His almighty power.
There is no other way in which we can explain the effect produced upon
the battle by the raising and dropping (הניח) of the staff in his hands.
As long as Moses held up the staff, he drew down from God victorious
powers for the Israelites by means of his prayer; but when he let it
fall through the exhaustion of the strength of his hands, he ceased to
draw down the power of God, and Amalek gained the upper hand. The staff,
therefore, as it was stretched out on high, was not a sign to the
Israelites that were fighting, for it is by no means certain that they
could see it in the heat of the battle; but it was a sign to Jehovah,
carrying up, as it were, to God the wishes and prayers of Moses, and
bringing down from God victorious powers for Israel. If the intention
had been the hold it up before the Israelites as a banner of victory.
Moses would not have withdrawn to a hill apart from the field of battle,
but would either have carried it himself in front of the army, or have
given it to Joshua as commander, to be borne by him in front of the
combatants, or else have entrusted it to Aaron, who had performed the
miracles in Egypt, that he might carry it at their head. The pure reason
why Moses did not do this, but withdrew from the field of battle to lift
up the staff of God upon the summit of a hill, and to secure the victory
by so doing, is to be found in the important character of the battle
itself. As the heathen world was now commencing its conflict with the
people of God in the persons of the Amalekites, and the prototype of the
heathen world, with its hostility to God, was opposing the nation of the
Lord, that had been redeemed from the bondage of Egypt and was on its
way to Canaan, to contest its entrance into the promised inheritance; so
the battle which Israel fought with this foe possessed a typical
significance in relation to all the future history of Israel. It could
not conquer by the sword alone, but could only gain the victory by the
power of God, coming down from on high, and obtained through prayer and
those means of grace with which it had been entrusted. The means now
possessed by Moses were the staff, which was, as it were, a channel
through which the powers of omnipotence were conducted to him. In most
cases he used it under the direction of God; but God had not promised
him miraculous help for the conflict with the Amalekites, and for this
reason he lifted up his hands with the staff in prayer to God, that he
might thereby secure the assistance of Jehovah for His struggling
people. At length he became exhausted, and with the falling of his hands
and the staff he held, the flow of divine power ceased, so that it was
necessary to support his arms, that they might be kept firmly directed
upwards (אמוּנה, lit., firmness) until the enemy was entirely subdued.
And from this Israel was to learn the lesson, that in all its conflicts
with the ungodly powers of the world, strength for victory could only be
procured through the incessant lifting up of its hands in prayer. "And
Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people (the Amalekites and their
people) with the edge of the sword" (i.e., without quarter. See [Gen
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#026).md).

[Exodus 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 17:14</span></span>

As this battle and victory were of such significance, Moses was to write
it for a memorial בּסּפר, in "the book" appointed for a record of the
wonderful works of God, and "to put it into the ears of Joshua," i.e.,
to make known to him, and impress upon him, that Jehovah would utterly
put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; not "in order that
he might carry out this decree of God on the conquest of Canaan, as
Knobel supposes, but to strengthen his confidence in the help of the
Lord against all the enemies of Israel. In [Deu
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019.md) the Israelites are commanded to
exterminate Amalek, when God should have given them rest in the land of
Canaan from all their enemies round about.

[Exo 17:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015.md)

To praise God for His help, Moses built an altar, which he called
"Jehovah my banner," and said, when he did so, "The hand on the throne
(or banner) of Jah! War to the Lord from generation to generation!"
There is nothing said about sacrifices being offered upon this altar. It
has been conjectured, therefore, that as a place of worship and
thank-offering, the altar with its expressive name was merely to serve
as a memorial to posterity of the gracious help of the Lord, and that
the words which were spoken by Moses were to serve as a watchword for
Israel, keeping this act of God in lively remembrance among the people
in all succeeding generations. כּי ([Exo
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#016).md) merely introduces the words as
in [Gen 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#023.md), etc. The expression יהּ
על־כּס יד is obscure, chiefly on account of the ἁπ λεγ. כּס. In the
ancient versions (with the exception of the Septuagint, in which יה כץ
is treated as one word, and rendered κρυφαία) כּס is taken to be
equivalent to כּסּה ([Kg1 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#019.md); [Job
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#009).md) for כּסּא, and the clause is
rendered "the hand upon the throne of the Lord." But whilst some
understand the laying of the hand (sc., of God) upon the throne to be
expressive of the attitude of swearing, others regard the hand as
symbolical of power. There are others again, like Clericus, who suppose
the hand to denote the hand laid by the Amalekites upon the throne of
the Lord, i.e., on Israel. But if כּס signifies throng or adytum
arcanum, the words can hardly be understood in any other sense than "the
hand lifted up to the throne of Jehovah in heaven, war to the Lord,"
etc.; and thus understood, they can only contain an admonition to Israel
to follow the example of Moses, and wage war against Amalek with the
hands lifted up to the throne of Jehovah. Modern expositors, however,
for the most part regard כּס as a corruption of נס, "the hand on the
banner of the Lord." But even admitting this, though many objections may
be offered to its correctness, we must not understand by "the banner of
Jehovah" the staff of Moses, but only the altar with the name
Jehovah-nissi, as the symbol or memorial of the victorious help afforded
by God in the battle with the Amalekites.
