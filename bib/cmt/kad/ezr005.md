The Building of the Temple Continued, and Notice Thereof Sent to King
Darius - Ezra 5

In the second year of Darius Hystaspis (Darajavus Vitapa) the prophets
Zechariah and Haggai arose, and exhorted the people by words, both of
reproof and encouragement, to assist in the work of rebuilding the house
of God. In consequence of these prophetic admonitions, the rulers of the
community resumed the work ([Ezr 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md),
[Ezr 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002).md); and the royal governor on
this side the Euphrates allowed them, when in answer to his inquiries
they appealed to the decree of Cyrus, to proceed with their building
until the arrival of a decision from King Darius, to whom he addressed a
written report of the matter ([Ezr
5:3-17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003).md).

[Ezra 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 5:1</span></span>

"The prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo,
prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of
Israel upon them." חתנבּי without א, which this word occasionally loses
in Hebrew also, comp. [Sa1 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#006.md), [Sa1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#013.md); [Jer
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#009.md). The epithet נביּאה added to the
name of Haggai serves to distinguish him from others of the same name,
and as well as הנּביא, Hagg. [Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md),
[Hag 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#003.md), [Hag
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012.md), and elsewhere, is used instead
of the name of his father; hence, after Zechariah is named, the
prophets, as designating the position of both, can follow. על־יהוּדיא,
they prophesied to (not against) the Jews; על as in [Eze
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#004.md), = אל, [Eze
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009.md); [Eze
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md). The Jews in Judah and Jerusalem,
in contradistinction to Jews dwelling elsewhere, especially to those who
had remained in Babylon. עליהון belongs to אלהּ בּשׁם, in the name of
God, who was upon them, who was come upon them, had manifested Himself
to them. Comp. [Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016.md).

[Ezr 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002.md)

"Then rose up Zerubbabel ... and Joshua ... and began to build the house
of God at Jerusalem, and with them the prophets of God helping them."
The beginning to build is ([Ezr 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#006.md),
etc.) the commencement of the building properly so called, upon the
foundations laid, [Ezr 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md); for what
was done after this foundation-laying till a stop was put to the work,
was so unimportant that no further notice is taken of it. The "prophets
of God" are those mentioned [Ezr 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md),
viz., Haggai, and Zechariah the son, i.e., grandson, of Iddo, for his
father's name was Berechiah (see Introd. to Zechariah). Haggai entered
upon his work on the first day of the sixth month, in the second year of
Darius; and his first address made such an impression, that Zerubbabel
and Joshua with the people set about the intermitted work of building as
early as the twenty-fourth day of the same month (comp. [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md) and [Hag
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014)..md). Two months later, viz., in the
eighth month of the same year, Zechariah began to exhort the people to
turn sincerely to the Lord their God, and not to relapse into the sins
of their fathers.

[Ezra 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 5:3</span></span>

When the building was recommenced, the governor on this side Euphrates,
and other royal officials, evidently informed of the undertaking by the
adversaries of the Jews, made their appearance for the purpose of
investigating matters on the spot. עליהון אתּה, came to them, to the two
above-named rulers of the community at Jerusalem. Tatnai (lxx Θανθαναΐ́)
was פּחה, viceroy, in the provinces west of Euphrates, i.e., as
correctly expanded in 1 Esdras, of Syria and Phoenicia, to which Judaea
with its Pecha Zerubbabel was subordinate. With him came Shethar-Boznai,
perhaps his secretary, and their companions, their subordinates. The
royal officials inquired: "Who has commanded you to build this house,
and to finish this wall?" The form לבנא here and [Ezr
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#013.md) is remarkable, the infinitive in
Chaldee being not בנא, butמבנא; compare [Ezr
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002.md), [Ezr
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017.md), and [Ezr
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#008.md). Norzi has both times לבּנא, as
through the Dagesh forte were compensating for an omitted .מ אשּׁרנא
which occurs only here and [Ezr 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#009.md),
is variously explained. The Vulgate, the Syriac, and also the Rabbins,
translate: these walls. This meaning best answers to the context, and is
also linguistically the most correct. It can hardly, however, be derived
(Gesenius) from אשׁר, but rather from אשׁן, in Chaldee אשׁוּן, firm,
strong-walls as the strength or firmness of the building. The form
אשּׁרנא has arisen from אשׁנּא, and is analogous to the form בּשׁנה.

(Note: The interpretations of the lxx, τὴν χορηγίαν ταύτην, meaning
these building materials, and of 1 Esdr. 6:4, τὴν στέγην ταύτην καὶ τὰ
ἄλλα πάντα, this roof and all besides, for which Bertheau decides,
without considering that שׁכלל may mean to complete, and not to prepare
for anything, are but conjectures.)

[Ezr 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004.md)

Then told we them after this manner (כּנמא, [Ezr
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#008).md), what were the names of the men
who were building this building. From אמרנא, we said, it is obvious that
the author of this account was an eye-witness of, and sharer in, the
work of building. These is not a shadow of reason for altering אמרנא
into אמרוּ, or into the participle אמרין (Ew., Berth., and others); the
εἴποσαν of the lxx being no critical authority for so doing. The answer
in [Ezr 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004.md) seems not to correspond
with the question in [Ezr 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md). The
royal officials asked, Who had commanded them to build? The Jews told
them the names of those who had undertaken and were conducting the
building. But this incongruity between the question and answer is merely
caused by the fact that the discussion is reported only by a short
extract restricted to the principal subjects. We learn that this is the
case from the contents of the letter sent by the officials to the king.
According to these, the royal functionary inquired not merely concerning
the author of the command to build, but asked also the names of those
who were undertaking the work (comp. [Ezr
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#009.md) and [Ezr
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#010).md); while the rulers of the Jews
gave a circumstantial answer to both questions ([Ezr
5:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011).md).

[Ezr 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#005.md)

Tatnai and Shethar-Boznai had power to prohibit them from proceeding;
they allowed them, however, to go on with their work till the arrival of
an answer from the king, to whom they had furnished a written report of
the matter. In these dealings, the historian sees a proof of the divine
protection which was watching over the building. "The eye of their God
was over the elders of the Jews, that they should not restrain them
(from building) till the matter came to Darius; and they should then
receive a letter concerning this matter." Bertheau incorrectly
translates יהך לד עד־טעמא: until the command of King Darius should
arrive. ל is only used as a paraphrase of the genitive in statements of
time; otherwise the genitive, if not expressed by the status construc.,
is designated by דּ or דּי. יהך, fut. Peal of הלך, formed by the
rejection of ל, construed with ל, signifies to go to a place (comp. [Ezr
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#013).md), or to come to a person. טעמא
(טעם) does not here mean commandment, but the matter, causa, which the
king is to decide; just as פּתגּן, [Ezr
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#011.md), means thing, res. The clause
יתיבוּן ואדין still depends upon עד: and till they (the royal officials)
then receive a letter, i.e., obtain a decision.

[Ezra 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 5:6</span></span>

In [Ezr 5:6-17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006.md) follows the letter
which the royal officials sent to the king. [Ezr
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006.md) and [Ezr
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#007.md) form the introduction to this
document, and correspond with [Ezr
5:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008.md) in Ezra 4. Copy of the letter
(comp. [Ezr 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#011).md) which Tatnai, etc.,
sent. The senders of the letter are, besides Tatnai, Shethar-Boznai and
his companions the Apharsachites, the same called [Ezr
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#009.md) the Apharsathchites, who perhaps,
as a race specially devoted to the Persian king, took a prominent
position among the settlers in Syria, and may have formed the royal
garrison. After this general announcement of the letter, follows the
more precise statement: They sent the matter to him; and in it was
written, To King Darius, much peace. פּתגּן here is not command, but
matter; see above. כלּא, its totality, is unconnected with, yet
dependent on שׁלמא: peace in all things, in every respect. The letter
itself begins with a simple representation of the state of affairs ([Ezr
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008).md): "We went into the province of
Judaea, to the house of the great God (for so might Persian officials
speak of the God of Israel, after what they had learned from the elders
of Judah of the edict of Cyrus), and it is being built with freestone,
and timber is laid in the walls; and this work is being diligently
carried on, and is prospering under their hands." The placing of wood in
the walls refers to building beams into the wall for flooring; for the
building was not so far advanced as to make it possible that this should
be said of covering the walls with wainscotting. The word אספּרנא here,
and [Ezr 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#008.md), [Ezr
6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#012.md); [Ezr
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#017.md), [Ezr
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#021.md), [Ezr
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#026.md), is of Aryan origin, and is
explained by Haug in Ew. Janro. v. p. 154, from the Old-Persian
us-parna, to mean: carefully or exactly finished-a meaning which suits
all these passages.

[Ezra 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 5:9</span></span>

Hereupon the royal officials asked the elders of the Jews who had
commanded them to build, and inquired concerning their names, that they
might write to the king the names of the leading men (see the remark on
3 and 41). בראשׁהם דּי does not mean, who are at the head of them: but,
who act in the capacity of heads.

[Ezra 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 5:11</span></span>

The answer of the elders of the Jews. They returned us answer in the
following manner (לממר = לאמר): "We are His, the servants of the God of
heaven and earth, and build the house which was built many years ago;
and a great king of Israel built and completed it." דּנה מקּדמת, of
before this, i.e., before the present; to which is added the more
precise definition: many years (accusative of time), i.e., many years
before the present time.

[Ezra 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 5:12</span></span>

For this reason (להן), because (מן־דּי = מאשׁר, e.g., [Isa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004).md) our fathers provoked the God of
heaven, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
the Chaldean, and he (Nebuch.) destroyed this house, and carried the
people away into Babylon. For כּסדּיא the Keri requires כּסדּאה, the
ordinary form of the absolute state of the noun in ai. סתר, Pael, in the
sense of destroy, appears only here in biblical Chaldee, but more
frequently in the Targums. עמּה, its people, would refer to the town of
Jerusalem; but Norzi and J. H. Mich. have עמּהּ, and the Masora
expressly says that the word is to be written without Mappik, and is
therefore the stat. emphat. for עמּא.

[Ezra 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 5:13</span></span>

In the first year, however, of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus made a
decree, etc.; comp. [Ezr 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003.md). The
infin. לבנא like [Ezr 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md). - On [Ezr
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#014.md) and [Ezr
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#015.md), comp. [Ezr
1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007.md). ויחיבוּ, praeter. pass. of
Peal; they were given to one Sheshbazzar, (is) his name, i.e., to one of
the name of Sheshbazzar, whom he had made pechah. Zerubbabel is also
called פּחה, [Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md), [Hag
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md), and elsewhere.

[Ezra 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 5:15</span></span>

Take these vessels, go forth, place them in the temple. For אלּה the
Keri reads אל, according to [Ch1 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#008.md).
אחת is imperat. Aphel of נחת. The three imperatives succeed each other
without any copula in this rapid form of expression. The last sentence,
"and let the house of God be built in its place," i.e., be rebuilt in
its former place, gives the reason for the command to deposit the
vessels in the temple at Jerusalem, i.e., in the house of God, which is
to be rebuilt in its former place.

[Ezra 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ezr 5:16</span></span>

In virtue of this command of Cyrus, this Sheshbazzar came (from Babylon
to Jerusalem), and laid then the foundations of the house of God, and
from that time till now it has been building, and is not (yet) finished.
שׁלים, part. pass. of שׁלם, often used in the Targums and in Syriac for
the Hebrew תּמם; hence in [Dan 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#026.md)
the Aphel, in the meaning of to finish, and [Eze
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019.md), to restore. This statement does
not exclude the cessation from building from the last year of Cyrus to
the second of Darius, narrated Ezra 4-6:7, as Bertheau and others
suppose, but only leaves the unmentioned circumstance which had been the
cause of the delay. If the section Ezra 4:6-23 does not refer to the
building of the temple, then neither is a "forcible interruption" of the
building spoken of in Ezra 4; but it is only said that the adversaries
frustrated the purpose of the Jews to rebuild the temple till the time
of Darius, and weakened the hands of the people, so that the work of the
house of God ceased.

[Ezra 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 5:17</span></span>

After thus representing the state of affairs, the royal officials
request Darius to cause a search to be made among the archives of the
kingdom, as to whether a decree made by Cyrus for the erection of the
temple at Jerusalem was to be found therein, and then to communicate to
them his decision concerning the matter. "And if it seem good to the
king, let search be made in the king's treasure-house there at Babylon,
whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king." על טב הן,
like the Hebrew על טּוב אם, [Est 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#019.md),
for which in older Hebrew לו טּוב, [Deu
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017.md), or בּעינים טוב, [Gen
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008.md); [Jdg
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#015.md), and elsewhere, is used. גּזיּא
בּית, house of the treasure, more definitely called, [Ezr
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md), house of the rolls, where also
the royal treasures were deposited. Hence it is obvious that important
documents and writings were preserved in the royal treasury. תּמּה,
there, is explained by "which at Babylon." רעוּת, chald. voluntas, comp.
[Ezr 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#018.md). Concerning the behaviour of
these officials Brentius well remarks: vides differentiam inter
calumniatores et bonos ac probos viros. Una eademque causa erat
aedificii templi, unus idemque populus Judaeorum; attamen hujus populi
causa aliter refertur ab impiis calumniatoribus, aliter a bonis viris.
