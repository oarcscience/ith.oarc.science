[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

The Consolation of Prayer under the Oppression of Tyrants

This Psalm, akin to [Psa 92:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md) and
[Psa 93:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md) by the community of the
anadiplosis, bears the inscription Ψαλμὸς ᾠδῆς τῷ Δαυίδ, τετράδι
σαββάτου in the lxx. It is also a Talmudic tradition

(Note: According to B. Erachin 11a, at the time of the Chaldaean
destruction of Jerusalem the Levites on their pulpits were singing this
94th Psalm, and as they came to the words "and He turneth back upon them
their iniquity" ([Psa 94:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#023).md), the
enemies pressed into the Temple, so that they were not able to sing the
closing words, "Jahve, our God, will destroy them." To the scruple that
Ps 94 is a Wednesday, not a Sunday, Psalm (that fatal day, however, was
a Sunday, מוצאי שׁבת), it is replied, it may have been a lamentation
song that had just been put into their mouths by the circumstances of
that time (אלייא בעלמא דעלמא דנפל להו בפומייהו).)

that it was the Wednesday song in the Temple liturgy (τετράδι σαββάτου =
ברביעי בשׁבת). Athanasius explains it by a reference to the fourth month
([Jer 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002).md). The τῳ Δαυίδ, however, is
worthless. It is a post-Davidic Psalm; for, although it comes out of one
mould, we still meet throughout with reminiscences of older Davidic and
Asaphic models. The enemies against whom it supplicates the appearing of
the God of righteous retribution are, as follows from a comparison of
[Psa 94:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#005.md), [Psa
94:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008.md), [Psa
94:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#010.md), [Psa
94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md), non-Israelites, who despise the
God of Israel and fear not His vengeance, [Psa
94:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#007.md); whose barbarous doings, however,
call forth, even among the oppressed people themselves, foolish doubts
concerning Jahve's omniscient beholding and judicial interposition.
Accordingly the Psalm is one of the latest, but not necessarily a
Maccabaean Psalm. The later Persian age, in which the Book of
Ecclesiastes was written, could also exhibit circumstances and moods
such as these.

[Psalms 94:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 94:1</span></span>

The first strophe prays that God would at length put a judicial
restraint upon the arrogance of ungodliness. Instead of חופיע (a less
frequent form of the imperative for הופע, Ges. ֗53, rem. 3) it was
perhaps originally written הופיעה ([Psa
80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002).md), the He of which has been lost
owing to the He that follows. The plural נקמות signifies not merely
single instances of taking vengeance ([Eze
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#017.md), cf. supra [Psa
18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048).md), but also intensively complete
revenge or recompense ([Jdg 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#036.md);
[Sa2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008).md). The designation of God is
similar to אל גּמלות in [Jer 51:56](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#056.md),
and the anadiplosis is like [Psa 94:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003.md),
[Psa 94:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#023.md), [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md), [Psa
93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003.md). הנּשׂא, lift Thyself up, arise,
viz., in judicial majesty, calls to mind [Psa
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007.md). השׁיב גּמוּל is construed with על
(cf. ל, [Psa 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004); 59:18.md) as in [Joe
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004.md). With גּאים accidentally accord
ἀγαυός and κύδεΐ γαίων in the epic poets.

[Psalms 94:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 94:4</span></span>

The second strophe describes those over whom the first prays that the
judgment of God may come. הבּיע (cf. הטּיף) is a tropical phrase used of
that kind of speech that results from strong inward impulse and flows
forth in rich abundance. The poet himself explains how it is here (cf.
[Psa 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#008).md) intended: they speak עתק,
that which is unrestrained, unbridled, insolent (vid., [Psa
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019).md). The Hithpa. התאמּר Schultens
interprets ut Emiri (Arab. 'mı̂r, a commander) se gerunt; but אמיר
signifies in Hebrew the top of a tree (vid., on [Isa
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#009).md); and from the primary
signification to tower aloft, whence too אמר, to speak, prop. effere =
effari, התאמּר, like התימּר in [Isa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006.md), directly signifies to exalt
one's self, to carry one's self high, to strut. On ודכּאוּ cf. [Pro
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md); [Isa
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#015.md); and on their atheistical
principle which ויּאמרוּ places in closest connection with their mode of
action, cf. [Psa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011.md); [Psa
59:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#008.md) extrem. The Dagesh in יּהּ,
distinct from the Dag. in the same word in [Psa
94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md), [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md), [Psa
118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018.md), is the Dag. forte conjunct.
according to the rule of the so-called דחיק.

[Psalms 94:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 94:8</span></span>

The third strophe now turns from those bloodthirsty, blasphemous
oppressors of the people of God whose conduct calls forth the vengeance
of Jahve, to those among the people themselves, who have been puzzled
about the omniscience and indirectly about the righteousness of God by
the fact that this vengeance is delayed. They are called בערים and
כסילים in the sense of [Psa 73:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#021.md).
Those hitherto described against whom God's vengeance is supplicated are
this also; but this appellation would be too one-sided for them, and
בּעם refers the address expressly to a class of men among the people
whom those oppress and slay. It is absurd that God, the planter of the
ear (הנּטע, like שׁסע in [Lev 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#007.md),
with an accented ultima, because the praet. Kal does not follow the rule
for the drawing back of the accent called נסוג אחור) and the former of
the eye (cf. [Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md); [Exo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011).md), should not be able to hear and
to see; everything that is excellent in the creature, God must indeed
possess in original, absolute perfection.

(Note: The questions are not: ought He to have no ear, etc.; as Jerome
pertinently observes in opposition to the anthropomorphites, membra
tulit, efficientias dedit.)

The poet then points to the extra-Israelitish world and calls God יסר
גּוים, which cannot be made to refer to a warning by means of the voice
of conscience; יסר used thus without any closer definition does not
signify "warning," but "chastening" ([Pro
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007).md). Taking his stand upon facts like
those in [Job 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#023.md), the poet assumes
the punitive judicial rule of God among the heathen to be an undeniable
fact, and presents for consideration the question, whether He who
chasteneth nations cannot and will not also punish the oppressors of His
church (cf. [Gen 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025).md), He who
teacheth men knowledge, i.e., He who nevertheless must be the omnipotent
One, since all knowledge comes originally from Him? Jahve - thus does
the course of argument close in [Psa
94:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#011.md) - sees through (ידע of
penetrative perceiving or knowing that goes to the very root of a
matter) the thoughts of men that they are vanity. Thus it is to be
interpreted, and not: for they (men) are vanity; for this ought to have
been כּי הבל המּה, whereas in the dependent clause, when the predicate
is not intended to be rendered especially prominent, as in Ps 9:21, the
pronominal subject may precede, [Isa
61:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009.md); [Jer
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005) (Hitzig.md). The rendering of the
lxx ([Co1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020).md), ὅτι εἰσὶ μάταιοι
(Jerome, quoniam vanae sunt), is therefore correct; המּה, with the
customary want of exactness, stands for הנּה. It is true men themselves
are הבל; it is not, however, on this account that He who sees through
all things sees through their thoughts, but He sees through them in
their sinful vanity.

[Psalms 94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 94:12</span></span>

The fourth strophe praises the pious sufferer, whose good cause God will
at length aid in obtaining its right. The "blessed" reminds one of [Psa
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#009.md); [Psa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md), and more especially of [Job
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017.md), cf. [Pro
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md). Here what are meant are
sufferings like those bewailed in [Psa
94:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#005.md)., which are however, after all,
the well-meant dispensations of God. Concerning the aim and fruit of
purifying and testing afflictions God teaches the sufferer out of His
Law (cf. e.g., [Deu 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#005)..md), in order to
procure him rest, viz., inward rest (cf. [Jer
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023.md) with [Isa
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015).md), i.e., not to suffer him to be
disheartened and tempted by days of wickedness, i.e., wicked, calamitous
days (Ew. 287, b), until (and it will inevitably come to pass) the pit
is finished being dug into which the ungodly falls headlong (cf. [Psa
112:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#007)..md). יּהּ has the emphatic Dagesh,
which properly does not double, and still less unite, but requires an
emphatic pronunciation of the letter, which might easily become
inaudible. The initial Jod of the divine name might easily lose it
consonantal value here in connection with the preceding toneless û,

(Note: If it is correct that, as Aben-Ezra and Parchon testify, the וּ,
as being compounded of o (u) + i, was pronounced like the u in the
French word pur by the inhabitants of Palestine, then this Dagesh, in
accordance with its orthophonic function, is the more intelligible in
cases like תיסרנו יּה and קראתי יּה, cf. Pinsker, Einleitung, S. 153,
and Geiger, Urschrift, S. 277. In קומו צּאו, [Gen
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014.md); [Exo
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#031.md), קומו סּעו, [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024.md), Tsade and Samech have this
Dagesh for the same reason as the Sin in תשׁביתו שּׁאור, [Exo
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015.md) (vid., Heidenheim on that
passage), viz., because there is a danger in all these cases of slurring
over the sharp sibilant. Even Chajug' (vid., Ewald and Dukes' Beitrge,
iii. 23) confuses this Dag. orthophonicum with the Dag. forte
conjunctivum.)

and the Dag. guards against this: cf. [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md), [Psa
118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018.md). The certainty of the issue
that is set in prospect by עד is then confirmed with כּי. It is
impossible that God can desert His church - He cannot do this, because
in general right must finally come to His right, or, as it is here
expressed, משׁפּט must turn to צדק, i.e., the right that is now subdued
must at length be again strictly maintained and justly administered, and
"after it then all who are upright in heart," i.e., all such will side
with it, joyously greeting that which has been long missed and yearned
after. משׁפּט is fundamental right, which is at all times consistent
with itself and raised above the casual circumstances of the time, and
צדק, like אמת in [Isa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003.md), is
righteousness (justice), which converts this right into a practical
truth and reality.

[Psalms 94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 94:16</span></span>

In the fifth strophe the poet celebrates the praise of the Lord as his
sole, but also trusty and most consolatory help. The meaning of the
question in [Psa 94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016.md) is, that there
is no man who would rise and succour him in the conflict with the
evil-doers; ל as in [Exo 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025.md); [Jdg
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#031.md), and עם (without נלחם or the
like) in the sense of contra, as in [Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md), cf. [Ch2
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#006.md). God alone is his help. He alone
has rescued him from death. היה is to be supplied to לוּלי: if He had
not been, or: if He were not; and the apodosis is: then very little
would have been wanting, then it would soon have come to this, that his
soul would have taken up its abode, etc.; cf. on the construction [Psa
119:92](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#092.md); [Psa
124:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md); [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md), and on כּמעט with the praet. [Psa
73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002.md); [Psa
119:87](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#087.md); [Gen
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#010.md) (on the other hand with the fut.
[Psa 81:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#015).md). דּוּמה is, as in [Psa
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md), the silence of the grave and
of Hades; here it is the object to שׁכנה, as in [Psa
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003.md), [Pro
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#012.md), and frequently. When he appears
to himself already as one that has fallen, God's mercy holds him up. And
when thoughts, viz., sad and fearful thoughts, are multiplied within
him, God's comforts delight him, viz., the encouragement of His word and
the inward utterances of His Spirit. שׁרעפּים, as in [Psa
139:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#023.md), is equivalent to שעפּים, from
שׂעף, סעף, Arab. š‛b, to split, branch off (Psychology, S. 181; tr. p.
214). The plural form ישׁעשׁעוּ, like the plural of the imperative in
[Isa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md), has two Pathachs, the
second of which is the "independentification" of the Chateph of ישׁעשׁע.

[Psalms 94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 94:20</span></span>

In the sixth strophe the poet confidently expects the inevitable divine
retribution for which he has earnestly prayed in the introduction. יחברך
is erroneously accounted by many (and by Gesenius too) as fut. Pual =
יחבּרך = יחבּר עמּך, a vocal contraction together with a giving up of
the reduplication in favour of which no example can be advanced. It is
fut. Kal = יחברך, from יחבּר = יחבּר, with the same regression of the
modification of the vowel

(Note: By means of a similar transposition of the vowel as is to be
assumed in תּאהבוּ, [Pro 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022.md), it also
appears that מדוּבּין = מוּסבּין (lying upon the table, ἀνακείμενοι) of
the Pesach-Haggada has to be explained, which Joseph Kimchi finds so
inexplicable that he regards it as a clerical error that has become
traditional.)

as in יחנך = יחנך in [Gen 43:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#029.md); [Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019) (Hupfeld.md), but as in verbs
primae gutturalis, so also in כּתבם, כּתבם, inflected from כּתב, Ew.
֗251, d. It might be more readily regarded as Poel than as Pual (like
תּאכלנוּ, [Job 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026).md), but the Kal too
already signifies to enter into fellowship ([Gen
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#003.md); [Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017).md), therefore (similarly to יגרך,
[Psa 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#005).md) it is: num consociabitur
tecum. כּסּא is here the judgment-seat, just as the Arabic cursi
directly denotes the tribunal of God (in distinction from Arab. 'l-‛arš,
the throne of His majesty). With reference to הוּות vid., on [Psa
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md). Assuming that חק is a divine
statute, we obtain this meaning for עלי־חק: which frameth (i.e., plots
and executes) trouble, by making the written divine right into a
rightful title for unrighteous conduct, by means of which the innocent
are plunged into misfortune. Hitzig renders: contrary to order, after
[Pro 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026.md), where, however, על־ישׁר is
intended like ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης, [Mat
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010.md). Olshausen proposes to read
יגוּרוּ ([Psa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md); [Psa
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#004).md) instead of יגודּוּ, just as
conversely Aben-Ezra in [Psa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md)
reads יגודּוּ. But גּדד, גּוּד, has the secured signification of
scindere, incidere (cf. Arab. jdd, but also chd, supra, p. 255), from
which the signification invadere can be easily derived (whence גּדוּד, a
breaking in, invasion, an invading host). With reference to דּם נקי
vid., Psychology, S. 243 (tr. p. 286): because the blood is the soul,
that is said of the blood which applies properly to the person. The
subject to יגודו are the seat of corruption (by which a high council
consisting of many may be meant, just as much as a princely throne) and
its accomplices. Prophetic certainty is expressed in ויהי and ויּשׁב.
The figure of God as משׂגּב is Davidic and Korahitic. צוּר מחסּי צוּר is
explained from [Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md). Since השׁיב
designates the retribution as a return of guilt incurred in the form of
actual punishment, it might be rendered "requite" just as well as "cause
to return;" עליהם, however, instead of להם ([Psa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007).md) makes the idea expressed in [Psa
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017.md) more natural. On ברעתם Hitzig
correctly compares [Sa2 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#007.md); [Sa2
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#027.md). The Psalm closes with an
anadiplosis, just as it began with one; and אלהינוּ affirms that the
destruction of the persecutor will follow as surely as the church is
able to call Jahve its God.
