### [Jeremiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 3:1</span></span>

As a divorced woman who has become another man's wife cannot return to
her first husband, so Judah, after it has turned away to other gods,
will not be received again by Jahveh; especially since, in spite of all
chastisement, it adheres to its evil ways. [Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md). "He saith, If a man put away his
wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, can he return to
her again? would not such a land be polluted? and thou hast whored with
many partners; and wouldst thou return to me? saith Jahveh. [Jer
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002.md). Lift up thine eyes unto the
bare-topped hills and look, where hast thou not been lien with; on the
ways thou sattest for them, like an Arab in the desert, and pollutedst
the land by thy whoredoms and by thy wickedness. [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md). And the showers were withheld,
and the latter rain came not; but thou hadst the forehead of an harlot
woman, wouldst not be ashamed. [Jer
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004.md). Ay, and from this time forward
thou criest to me, My father, the friend of my youth art thou. [Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005.md). Will he always bear a grudge and
keep it up for ever? Behold, thou speakest thus and dost wickedness and
carriest it out." This section is a continuation of the preceding
discourse in Jer 2, and forms the conclusion of it. That this is so may
be seen from the fact that a new discourse, introduced by a heading of
its own, begins with [Jer 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md). The
substance of the fifth verse is further evidence in the same direction;
for the rejection of Judah by God declared in that verse furnishes the
suitable conclusion to the discourse in Jer 2, and briefly shows how the
Lord will plead with the people that holds itself blameless ([Jer
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035).md).

(Note: The contrary assertion of Ew. and Ngelsb. that these verses do
not belong to what precedes, but constitute the beginning of the next
discourse (Jer 3-6), rests upon an erroneous view of the train of
thought in this discourse. And such meagre support as it obtains
involves a violation of usage in interpreting ושׁוב as: yet turn again
to me, and needs further the arbitrary critical assertion that the
heading in [Jer 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md) : and Jahveh said
to me in the days of Josiah, has been put by a copyist in the wrong
place, and that it ought to stand before [Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md). - Nor is there any reason for the
assumption of J. D. Mich. and Graf, that at [Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md) the text has been mutilated, and
that by an oversight ויהי has dropped out; and this assumption also
contradicts the fact that [Jer 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md)
can neither contain nor begin any new prophetic utterance.)

But it is somewhat singular to find the connection made by means of
לאמר, which is not translated by the lxx or Syr., and is expressed by
Jerome by vulgo dicitur. Ros. would make it, after Rashi, possem dicere,
Rashi's opinion being that it stands for ישׁ לי לימר. In this shape the
assumption can hardly be justified. It might be more readily supposed
that the infinitive stood in the sense: it is to be said, one may say,
it must be affirmed; but there is against this the objection that this
use of the infinitive is never found at the beginning of a new train of
thought. The only alternative is with Maur. and Hitz. to join לאמר with
what precedes, and to make it dependent on the verb מאס in [Jer
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#037.md) : Jahveh hath rejected those in
whom thou trustest, so that thou shalt not prosper with them; for He
says: As a wife, after she has been put away from her husband and has
been joined to another, cannot be taken back again by her first husband,
so art thou thrust away for thy whoredom. The rejection of Judah by God
is not, indeed, declared expressis verbis in [Jer
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md), but is clearly enough contained
there in substance. Besides, "the rejection of the people's sureties
([Jer 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#037).md) involves that of the
people too" (Hitz.). לאמר, indeed, is not universally used after verbis
dicendi alone, but frequently stands after very various antecedent
verbs, in which case it must be very variously expressed in English;
e.g., in [Jos 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#011.md) it comes after
ישׁמעוּ, they heard: as follows, or these words; in [Sa2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#012.md) we have it twice, once after the
words, he sent messengers to David to say, i.e., and cause them say to
him, a second time in the sense of namely; in [Sa1
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#011.md) with the force of: for he said
or thought. It is used here in a manner analogous to this: he announces
to thee, makes known to thee. - The comparison with the divorced wife is
suggested by the law in [Deu 24:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md).
Here it is forbidden that a man shall take in marriage again his
divorced wife after she has been married to another, even although she
has been separated from her second husband, or even in the case of the
death of the latter; and re-marriage of this kind is called an
abomination before the Lord, a thing that makes the land sinful. The
question, May he yet return to her? corresponds to the words of the law:
her husband may not again (לשׁוּב) take her to be his wife. The making
of the land sinful is put by Jer. in stronger words: this land is
polluted; making in this an allusion to [Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md), [Lev
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#027.md), where it is said of similar
sins of the flesh that they pollute the land.

With "and thou hast whored" comes the application of this law to the
people that had by its idolatry broken its marriage vows to its God. זנה
is construed with the accus. as in [Eze
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#028.md). רעים, comrades in the sense of
paramours; cf. [Hos 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md). רבּים,
inasmuch as Israel or Judah had intrigued with the gods of many nations.
ושׁוב אלי .snoi is infin. abs., and the clause is to be taken as a
question: and is it to be supposed that thou mayest return to me? The
question is marked only by the accent; cf. Ew. 328, a, and Gesen. 131,
4, b. Syr., Targ., Jerome, etc. have taken ושׁוב as imperative: return
again to me; but wrongly, since the continuity is destroyed. This
argument is not answered by taking ו copul. adversatively with the sig.
yet: it is on the contrary strengthened by this arbitrary
interpretation. The call to return to God is incompatible with the
reference in [Jer 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002.md) to the idolatry
which is set before the eyes of the people to show it that God has cause
to be wroth. "Look but to the bare-topped hills." שׁפים, bald hills and
mountains (cf. [Isa 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018).md), were
favoured spots for idolatrous worship; cf. [Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md). When hast not thou let thyself
be ravished? i.e., on all sides. For שׁגּלתּ the Masoretes have here and
everywhere substituted שׁכּבתּ, see [Deu
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030.md); [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md), etc. The word is here used for
spiritual ravishment by idolatry; here represented as spiritual
fornication. Upon the roads thou sattest, like a prostitute, to entice
the passers-by; cf. [Gen 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014.md); [Pro
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#012.md). This figure corresponds in
actual fact to the erection of idolatrous altars at the corners of the
streets and at the gates: [Kg2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008.md);
[Eze 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#025.md). Like an Arab in the
desert, i.e., a Bedouin, who lies in wait for travellers, to plunder
them. The Bedouins were known to the ancients, cf. Diod. Sic. 2:48,
Plin. Hist. Nat. vi. 28, precisely as they are represented to this day
by travellers. - By this idolatrous course Israel desecrated the land.
The plural form of the suffix with the singular זנוּת is to be explained
by the resemblance borne both in sound and meaning (an abstract) by the
termination וּת to the plural ות; cf. [Jer
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md), [Zep
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#020.md), and Ew. 259, b. רעתך refers to
the moral enormities bound up with idolatry, e.g., the shedding of
innocent blood, [Jer 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030.md), [Jer
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035.md). The shedding of blood is
represented as defilement of the land in [Num
35:33](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#033.md).

[Jeremiah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 3:3</span></span>

But the idolatrous race was not to be brought to reflection or turned
from its evil ways, even when judgment fell upon it. God chastised it by
withholding the rain, by drought; cf. [Jer
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001.md)., [Amo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007.md). רביבים, rain-showers ([Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002).md), does not stand for the early
rain (יורה), but denotes any fall of rain; and the late rain (shortly
before harvest) is mentioned along with it, as in [Hos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003.md); [Zac
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md). But affliction made no
impression. The people persisted in its sinful courses with unabashed
effrontery; cf. [Jer 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003.md); [Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md).

[Jeremiah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 3:4</span></span>

Henceforward, forsooth, it calls upon its God, and expects that His
wrath will abate; but this calling on Him is but lip-service, for it
goes on in its sins, amends not its life. הלוא, nonne, has usually the
force of a confident assurance, introducing in the form of a question
that which is held not to be in the least doubtful. מעתּה, henceforward,
the antithesis to מעולם, [Jer 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md),
[Jer 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027.md), is rightly referred by Chr.
B. Mich. to the time of the reformation in public worship, begun by
Josiah in the twelfth year of his reign, and finally completed in the
eighteenth year, 2 Chron 34:3-33. Clearly we cannot suppose a reference
to distress and anxiety excited by the drought; since, in [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md), it is expressly said that this
had made no impression on the people. On אבי, cf. [Jer
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027.md). אלּוּף נערי (cf. [Pro
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017).md), the familiar friend of my
youth, is the dear beloved God, i.e., Jahveh, who has espoused Israel
when it was a young nation ([Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002).md).
Of Him it expects that He will not bear a grudge for ever. נטר, guard,
then like τηρεῖν, cherish ill-will, keep up, used of anger; see on [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md); [Psa
103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009.md), etc. A like meaning has ישׁמר,
to which אף, iram, is to be supplied from the context; cf. [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md). - Thus the people speaks, but it
does evil. דּבּרתּי, like קראתי in [Jer
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004.md), is 2nd pers. fem.; see in [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md). Hitz. connects דּבּרתּי so
closely with ותּעשׂי as to make הרעות the object to the former verb
also: thou hast spoken and done the evil; but this is plainly contrary
to the context. "Thou speakest" refers to the people's saying quoted in
the first half of the verse: Will God be angry for ever? What they do is
the contradiction of what they thus say. If the people wishes that God
be angry no more, it must give over its evil life. הרעות, not calamity,
but misdeeds, as in [Jer 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033.md). תּוּכל,
thou hast managed it, properly mastered, i.e., carried it through; cf.
[Sa1 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#025.md); [Kg1
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022.md). The form is 2nd pers. fem.,
with the fem. ending dropped on account of the Vav consec. at the end of
the discourse, cf. Ew. 191, b. So long as this is the behaviour of the
people, God cannot withdraw His anger.

[Jeremiah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 3:6</span></span>

Israel's backsliding and rejection a warning for Judah. - [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md). "And Jahveh spake to me in the
days of King Josiah, Hast thou seen what the backsliding one, Israel,
hath done? she went up on every high mountain, and under every green
tree, and played the harlot there. [Jer
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#007.md). And I thought: After she hath
done all this, she will return to me; but she returned not. And the
faithless one, her sister Judah, saw it. [Jer
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md). And I saw that, because the
backsliding one, Israel, had committed adultery, and I had put her away,
and had given her a bill of divorce, yet the faithless one, Judah, her
sister, feared not even on this account, and went and played the harlot
also. [Jer 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009.md). And it befell that for
the noise of her whoredom the land was defiled, and she committed
adultery with stone and wood. [Jer
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010.md). And yet with all this, the
faithless one, her sister Judah, turned not to me with her whole heart,
but with falsehood, saith Jahveh." The thought of these verses is this:
notwithstanding that Judah has before its eyes the lot which Israel (of
the ten tribes) has brought on itself by its obdurate apostasy from the
covenant God, it will not be moved to true fear of God and real
repentance. Viewing idolatry as spiritual whoredom, the prophet
developes that train of thought by representing the two kingdoms as two
adulterous sisters, calling the inhabitants of the ten tribes משׁבה, the
backsliding, those of Judah בּגודה, the faithless. On these names Venema
well remarks: "Sorores propter unam eandemque stirpem, unde uterque
populus fuit, et arctam ad se invicem relationem appellantur. Utraque
fuit adultera propter idololatriam et faederis violationem; sed Israel
vocatur uxor aversa; Juda vero perfida, quia Israel non tantum
religionis sed et regni et civitatis respectu, adeoque palam erat a Deo
alienata, Juda vero Deo et sedi regni ac religionis adfixa, sed
nihilominus a Deo et cultu ejus defecerat, et sub externa specie populi
Dei faedus ejus fregerat, quo ipso gravius peccaverat." This
representation Ezekiel has in Jer 23 expanded into an elaborate
allegory. The epithets משׁבה and בּגודה or בּגדה ([Jer
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#011).md) are coined into proper names.
This is shown by their being set without articles before the names; as
mere epithets they would stand after the substantives and have the
article, since Israel and Judah as being nomm. propr. are definite
ideas. משׁוּבה is elsewhere an abstract substantive: apostasy, defection
([Jer 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#005.md); [Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007), etc..md), here concrete, the
apostate, so-called for her many משׁבות, [Jer
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022.md) and [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019.md). בּגודה, the faithless, used of
perfidious forsaking of a husband; cf. [Jer
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020.md), [Mal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014.md). הלכה היא, going was she,
expressing continuance. Cf. the same statement in [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md). ותּזני, 3rd pers. fem., is an
Aramaizing form for ותּזנה or ותּזן; cf. [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md).

[Jeremiah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 3:7</span></span>

And I said, sc. to myself, i.e., I thought. A speaking by the prophets
(Rashi) is not to be thought of; for it is no summons, turn again to me,
but only the thought, they will return. It is true that God caused
backsliding Israel to be ever called again to repentance by the
prophets, yet without effect. Meantime, however, no reference is made to
what God did in this connection, only Israel's behaviour towards the
Lord being here kept in view. The Chet. ותּראה is the later usage; the
Keri substitutes the regular contracted form ותּרא. The object, it (the
whoredom of Israel), may be gathered from what precedes.

[Jer 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md)

Many commentators have taken objection to the וארא, because the
sentence, "I saw that I had therefore given Israel a bill of divorce,"
is as little intelligible as "and the faithless Judah saw it, and I saw
it, for," etc. Thus e.g., Graf, who proposes with Ew. and Syr. to read
ותּרא, "and she saw," or with Jerome to omit the word from the text. To
this we may add, that either the change or the omission destroys the
natural relation to one another of the clauses. In either case we would
have this connection: "and the faithless one, her sister Judah, saw
that, because the backslider Israel had committed adultery, I had put
her away...yet the faithless one feared not." But thus the gist of the
thing, what Judah saw, namely, the repudiation of Israel, would be
related but cursorily in a subordinate clause, and the 7th verse would
be shortened into a half verse; while, on the other hand, the 8th verse
would be burdened with an unnaturally long protasis. Ros. is right in
declaring any change to be unnecessary, provided the two halves of [Jer
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#007.md) and [Jer
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md) are connected in this sense: vidi
quod quum adulteram Israelitidem dimiseram, tamen non timeret ejus
perfida soror Juda. If we compare [Jer
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#007.md) and [Jer
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md) together, the correspondence
between the two comes clearly out. In the first half of either verse
Israel is spoken of, in the second Judah; while as to Israel, both
verses state how God regarded the conduct of Israel, and as to Judah,
how it observed and imitated Israel's conduct. וארא corresponds to ואמר
in [Jer 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#007.md). God thought the
backsliding Israel will repent, and it did not, and this Judah saw.
Thus, then, God saw that even the repudiation of the backsliding Israel
for her adultery incited no fear in Judah, but Judah went and did
whoredom like Israel. The true sense of [Jer
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md) is rendered obscure or difficult
by the external co-ordination to one another of the two thoughts, that
God has rejected Israel just because it has committed adultery, and,
that Judah nevertheless feared not; the second thought being introduced
by Vav. In reality, however, the first should be subordinated to the
second thus: that although I had to reject Israel, Judah yet feared not.
What God saw is not the adultery and rejection or divorce of Israel, but
that Judah nevertheless had no fear in committing and persisting in the
self-same sin. The כּי belongs properly to לא יראה, but this relation is
obscured by the length of the prefixed grounding clause, and so לא יראה
is introduced by ,על־כּל־אדות וגו' .ו yb decud literally: that for all
the reasons, because the backslider had committed adultery, I put her
away and gave her a bill of divorce; yet the faithless Judah feared not.
In plain English: that, in spite of all my putting away the backsliding
Israel, and my giving her...because she had committed adultery, yet the
faithless Judah feared not. On ספר כּריתוּת, cf. [Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md), [Deu
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#003.md).

[Jer 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009.md)

In [Jer 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009.md) Judah's fornication with
the false gods is further described. Here מקּל זנוּתהּ ereH is rather
stumbling, since ob vocem scortationis cannot well be simply tantamount
to ob famosam scortationem; for קול, voice, tone, sound, din, noise, is
distinct from שׁם or שׁמע, fame, rumour. All ancient translators have
taken קל from קלל, as being formed analogously to עז ,תּם ,חם; and a
Masoretic note finds in the defective spelling קל an indication of the
meaning levitas. Yet we occasionally find קול, vox, written defectively,
e.g., [Exo 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#008.md); [Gen
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#022.md); [Gen
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#016.md). And the derivation from קלל
gives no very suitable sense; neither lightness nor despisedness is a
proper predicate for whoredom, by which the land is polluted; only shame
or shameful would suit, as it is put by Ew. and Graf. But there is no
evidence from the usage of the language that קל has the meaning of קלון.
Yet more inadmissible is the conjecture of J. D. Mich., adopted by
Hitz., that of reading מקּל gnidaer fo taht, stock, for מקּל, a stock
being the object of her unchastity; in support of which, reference is
unfairly made to [Hos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md). For there
the matter in hand is rhabdomancy, with which the present passage has
evidently nothing to do. The case standing thus, we adhere to the usual
meaning of קל: for the noise or din of her whoredom, not, for her crying
whoredom (de Wette). Jeremiah makes use of this epithet to point out the
open riotous orgies of idolatry. תּחנף is neither used in the active
signification of desecrating, nor is it to be pointed ותּחנף (Hiph.). On
the last clause cf. [Jer 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027.md).

[Jer 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010.md)

But even with all this, i.e., in spite of this deep degradation in
idolatry, Judah returned not to God sincerely, but in hypocritical wise.
"And yet with all this," Ros., following Rashi, refers to the judgment
that had fallen on Israel ([Jer 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008).md);
but this is too remote. The words can bear reference only to that which
immediately precedes: even in view of all these sinful horrors the
returning was not "from the whole heart," i.e., did not proceed from a
sincere heart, but in falsehood and hypocrisy. For (the returning being
that which began with the abolition of idolatrous public worship in
Josiah's reformation) the people had returned outwardly to the worship
of Jahveh in the temple, but at heart they still calve to the idols.
Although Josiah had put an end to the idol-worship, and though the
people too, in the enthusiasm for the service of Jahveh, awakened by the
solemn celebration of the passover, had broken in pieces the images and
altars of the false gods throughout the land, yet there was imminent
danger that the people, alienated in heart from the living God, should
take the suppression of open idolatry for a true return to God, and,
vainly admiring themselves, should look upon themselves as righteous and
pious. Against this delusion the prophet takes his stand.

[Jeremiah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 3:11</span></span>

Israel's return, pardon, and blessedness. - [Jer
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#011.md). "And Jahveh said to me, The
backsliding one, Israel, is justified more than the faithless one,
Judah. [Jer 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md). Go and proclaim
these words towards the north, and say, Turn, thou backsliding one,
Israel, saith Jahveh; I will not look darkly on you, for I am gracious,
saith Jahveh; I will not always be wrathful. [Jer
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013.md). Only acknowledge thy guilt, for
from Jahveh thy God art thou fallen away, and hither and thither hast
thou wandered to strangers under every green tree, but to my voice ye
have not hearkened, saith Jahveh. [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md). Return, backsliding sons, saith
Jahveh; for I have wedded you to me, and will take you, one out of a
city and two out of a race, and will bring you to Zion; [Jer
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015.md). And will give you shepherds
according to my heart, and they will feed you with knowledge ad wisdom.
[Jer 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016.md). And it comes to pass, when
ye increase and are fruitful in the land, in those days, saith Jahveh,
they will no more say, 'The ark of the covenant of Jahveh;' and it will
no more come to mind, and ye will not longer remember it or miss it, and
it shall not be made again. [Jer 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md).
In that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jahveh; and to it
all peoples shall gather themselves, because the name of Jahveh is at
Jerusalem: and no longer shall they walk after the stubbornness of their
evil heart. [Jer 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md). In those days
shall the house of Judah go along with the house of Israel, and together
out of the land of midnight shall they come into the land which I have
given for an inheritance unto your fathers." In [Jer
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#011.md), from the comparison of the
faithless Judah with the backsliding Israel, is drawn the conclusion:
Israel stands forth more righteous than Judah. The same is said in other
words by [Eze 16:51](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#051).; cf. (Ezek..md) [Jer
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011.md). צדק in Piel is to show to be
righteous, to justify. נפשׁהּ, her soul, i.e., herself. Israel appears
more righteous than Judah, not because the apostasy and idolatry of the
Israelites was less than that of the people of Judah; in this they are
put on the same footing in [Jer
3:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md); in the like fashion both have
played the harlot, i.e., stained themselves with idolatry (while by a
rhetorical amplification the apostasy of Judah is in [Jer
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009.md) represented as not greater than
that of Israel). But it is inasmuch as, in the first place, Judah had
the warning example of Israel before its eyes, but would not be
persuaded to repentance by Israel's punishment; then again, Judah had
more notable pledges than the ten tribes of divine grace, especially in
the temple with its divinely-ordained cultus, in the Levitical
priesthood, and in its race of kings chosen by God. Hence its fall into
idolatry called more loudly for punishment than did that of the ten
tribes; for these, after their disruption from Judah and the Davidic
dynasty, had neither a lawful cultus, lawful priests, nor a
divinely-ordained kingship. If, then, in spite of these privileges,
Judah sank as far into idolatry as Israel, its offence was greater and
more grievous than that of the ten tribes; and it was surely yet more
deserving of punishment than Israel, if it was resolved neither to be
brought to reflection nor moved to repentance from its evil ways by the
judgment that had fallen upon Israel, and if, on the contrary, it
returned to God only outwardly and took the opus operatum of the
temple-service for genuine conversion. For "the measure of guilt is
proportioned to the measure of grace." Yet will not the Lord utterly
cast off His people, [Jer 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md). He
summons to repentance the Israelites who had now long been living in
exile; and to them, the backsliding sons, who confess their sin and
return to Him, He offers restoration to the full favours of the covenant
and to rich blessings, and this in order to humble Judah and to provoke
it to jealousy. The call to repentance which the prophet is in [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md) to proclaim towards the region of
midnight, concerns the ten tribes living in Assyrian exile. צפנה,
towards midnight, i.e., into the northern provinces of the Assyrian
empire the tribes had been carried away ([Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md); [Kg2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011).md). שׁוּבה, return, sc. to thy
God. Notwithstanding that the subject which follows, משׁבה, is fem., we
have the masculine form here used ad sensum, because the faithless
Israel is the people of the ten tribes. לא אפּיל פּני, I will not lower
my countenance, is explained by [Gen
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#005.md); [Job
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#024.md), and means to look darkly,
frowningly, as outward expression of anger; and this without our needing
to take פּני for כּעסי as Kimchi does. For I am חסיד, gracious; cf. [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md). As to אטּור, see on [Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005.md).

[Jeremiah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 3:13</span></span>

An indispensable element of the return is: Acknowledge thy guilt, thine
offence, for grievously hast thou offended; thou art fallen away
(פּשׁע), and תּפזּרי את־דּרכיך, lit., hast scattered thy ways for
strangers; i.e., hither and thither, on many a track, hast thou run
after the strange gods: cf. [Jer 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023.md).

The repeated call שׁוּבוּ, [Jer 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md),
is, like that in [Jer 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md), addressed
to Israel in the narrower sense, not to the whole covenant people or to
Judah. The "backsliding sons" are "the backsliding Israel" of [Jer
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#007.md), [Jer
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md), [Jer
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#011.md)., and of [Jer
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022.md). In [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md) also Judah is mentioned only as
it is in connection with Israel. בּעלתּי בכם, here and in [Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032.md), is variously explained. There
is no evidence for the meaning loathe, despise, which Ges. and Diet. in
the Lex., following the example of Jos. Kimchi, Pococke, A Schultens,
and others, attribute to the word בּעל; against this, cf. Hgstb.
Christol. ii. p. 375; nor is the sig. "rule" certified (lxx διότι ἐγὼ
κατακυριεύσω ὑμῶν); it cannot be proved from [Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013.md). בּעל means only, own, possess;
whence come the meanings, take to wife, have oneself married, which are
to be maintained here and in [Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032.md). In this view Jerome translates,
quia ego vir vester; Luther, denn ich will euch mir vertrauen; Hgstb.,
denn ich traue euch mir an;-the reception anew of the people being given
under the figure of a new marriage. This acceptation is, however, not
suitable to the perf. בּעלתּי, for this, even if taken prophetically,
cannot refer to a renewal of marriage which is to take place in the
future. The perf. can be referred only to the marriage of Israel at the
conclusion of the covenant on Sinai, and must be translated accordingly:
I am your husband, or: I have wedded you to me. This is demanded by the
grounding כּי; for the summons to repent cannot give as its motive some
future act of God, but must point to that covenant relationship founded
in the past, which, though suspended for a time, was not wholly broken
up.

(Note: Calvin gives it rightly: "Dixerat enim, se dedisse libellum
repudii h. e. quasi publicis tabulis se testatum fuisse, nihil amplius
sibi esse conjunctionis cum populo illo. Nam exilium erat instar
divortii. Jam dicit: Ego sum maritus vester. Nam etiamsi ego tam
graviter laesus a vobis fuerim, quia fefellistis fidem mihi datam, tamen
maneo in proposito, ut sim bovis maritus;...et perinde ac si mihi semper
fidem praestitissetis, iterum assuman vos, inqiut.")

The promise of what God will do if Israel repents is given only from
ולקחתּי (with ו consec.) onwards. The words, I take you, one out of a
city, two out of a race, are not with Kimchi to be so turned: if even a
single Israelite dwelt in a heathen city; but thus: if from amongst the
inhabitants of a city there returns to me but one, and if out of a whole
race there return but two, I will gather even these few and bring them
to Zion. Quite aside from the point is Hitz.'s remark, that in [Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md), too, a city is called אלף, and is
equivalent to משׁפּחה. The numbers one and two themselves show us that
משׁפּחה is a larger community than the inhabitants of one town, i.e.,
that it indicates the great subdivisions into which the tribes of Israel
were distributed. The thought, then, is this: Though but so small a
number obey the call to repent, yet the Lord will save even these; He
will exclude from salvation no one who is willing to return, but will
increase the small number of the saved to a great nation. This promise
is not only not contradictory of those which declare the restoration of
Israel as a whole; but it is rather a pledge that God will forget no one
who is willing to be saved, and shows the greatness of the divine
compassion.

As to the historical reference, it is manifest that the promise cannot
be limited, as it is by Theodrt. and Grot., to the return from the
Assyrian and Babylonian exile; and although the majority of commentators
take it so, it can as little be solely referred to the Messianic times
or to the time of the consummation of the kingdom of God. The fulfilment
is accomplished gradually. It begins with the end of the Babylonian
exile, in so far as at that time individual members of the ten tribes
may have returned into the land of their fathers; it is continued in
Messianic times during the lives of the apostles, by the reception, on
the part of the Israelites, of the salvation that had appeared in
Christ; it is carried on throughout the whole history of the Church, and
attains its completion in the final conversion of Israel. This Messianic
reference of the words is here the ruling one. This we may see from
"bring you to Zion," which is intelligible only when we look on Zion as
the seat of the kingdom of God; and yet more clearly is it seen from the
further promise, [Jer 3:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015.md), I will
give you shepherds according to my heart, etc. By shepherds we are not
to understand prophets and priests, but the civil authorities, rulers,
princes, kings (cf. [Jer 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008.md), [Jer
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026).md). This may not only be gathered
from the parallel passage, [Jer 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#004.md),
but is found in the כּלבּי, which is an unmistakeable allusion to [Sa1
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014.md), where David is spoken of as a
man whom Jahveh has sought out for Himself after His heart (כּלבבו), and
has set to be prince over His people. They will feed you דּעה . Both
these words are used adverbially. דּעה is a noun, and השׂכּיל an infin.:
deal wisely, possess, and show wisdom; the latter is as noun generally
השׂכּל , [Dan 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#017.md); [Pro
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003.md); [Pro
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016.md), but is found also as infin.
absol. [Jer 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md). A direct contrast to
these shepherds is found in the earlier kings, whom Israel had itself
appointed according to the desire of its heart, of whom the Lord said by
Hosea, They have set up kings (to themselves), but not by me ([Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004).md); kings who seduced the people of
God to apostasy, and encouraged them in it. "In the whole of the long
series of Israelitish rulers we find no Jehoshaphat, no Hezekiah, no
Josiah; and quite as might have been expected, for the foundation of the
throne of Israel was insurrection" (Hgstb.). But if Israel will return
to the Lord, He will give it rulers according to His heart, like David
(cf. [Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md); [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005)), who did wisely (משׂכּיל .md) in all
his ways, and with whom Jahveh was ([Sa1
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#014.md).; cf. [Kg1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003).md). The knowledge and wisdom
consists in the keeping and doing of the law of God, [Deu
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md); [Deu
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#008.md). As regards form, the promise
attaches itself to the circumstances of the earlier times, and is not to
be understood of particular historical rulers in the period after the
exile; it means simply that the Lord will give to Israel, when it is
converted to Him, good and faithful governors who will rule over it in
the spirit of David. But the Davidic dynasty culminates in the kingship
of the Messiah, who is indeed named David by the prophets; cf. [Jer
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#004.md).

[Jeremiah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 3:16</span></span>

In [Jer 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016.md) and [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md) also the thought is clothed in a
form characteristic of the Old Testament. When the returned Israelites
shall increase and be fruitful in the land, then shall they no more
remember the ark of the covenant of the Lord or feel the want of it,
because Jerusalem will then be the throne of the Lord. The fruitfulness
and increase of the saved remnant is a constant feature in the picture
of Israel's Messianic future; cf. [Jer
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003.md); [Eze
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#011.md); [Hos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001.md). This promise rests on the
blessing given at the creation, [Gen
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028.md). God as creator and preserver of
the world increases mankind together with the creatures; even so, as
covenant God, He increases His people Israel. Thus He increased the sons
of Israel in Egypt to be a numerous nation, [Exo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#012.md); thus, too, He will again make
fruitful and multiply the small number of those who have been saved from
the judgment that scattered Israel amongst the heathen. In the passages
which treat of this blessing, פּרה generally precedes רבה; here, on the
contrary, and in [Eze 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#011.md), the
latter is put first. The words 'לא יאמרוּ וגו must not be translated:
they will speak no more of the ark of the covenant; אמר c. accus. never
has this meaning. They must be taken as the substance of what is said,
the predicate being omitted for rhetorical effect, so that the words are
to be taken as an exclamation. Hgstb. supplies: It is the aim of all our
wishes, the object of our longing. Mov. simply: It is our most precious
treasure, or the glory of Israel, [Sa1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#021.md).; [Psa
78:61](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#061.md). And they will no more remember
it. Ascend into the heart, i.e., come to mind, joined with זכר here and
in [Isa 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); cf. [Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md); [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035.md); [Jer
51:50](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#050.md); [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md). ולא יפקדוּ, and they will not
miss it; cf. [Isa 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016.md); [Sa1
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#006.md), etc. This meaning is called for
by the context, and especially by the next clause: it will not be made
again. Hitz.'s objection against this, that the words cannot mean this,
is an arbitrary dictum. Non fiet amplius (Chr. B. Mich.), or, it will
not happen any more, is an unsuitable translation, for this would be but
an unmeaning addition; and the expansion, that the ark will be taken
into the battle as it formerly was, is such a manifest rabbinical
attempt to twist the words, that it needs no further refutation.
Luther's translation, nor offer more there, is untenable, since עשׂה by
itself never means offer.

The thought is this: then they will no longer have any feeling of desire
or want towards the ark. And wherefore? The answer is contained in [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md): At that time will they call
Jerusalem the throne of Jahveh. The ark was the throne of Jahveh,
inasmuch as Jahveh, in fulfilment of His promise in [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md), and as covenant God, was ever
present to His people in a cloud over the extended wings of the two
cherubim that were upon the covering of the ark of the law; from the
mercy-seat too, between the two cherubs, He spake with His people, and
made known to them His gracious presence: [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md); cf. [Ch1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006.md); [Psa
80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002.md); [Sa1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004.md). The ark was therefore called the
footstool of God, [Ch1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md); [Psa
99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md); [Psa
132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007.md); [Lam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md). But in future Jerusalem is to be,
and to be called, the throne of Jahveh; and it is in such a manner to
take the place of the ark, that the people will neither miss it nor make
any more mention of it. The promise by no means presumes that when
Jeremiah spoke or wrote this prophecy the ark was no longer in
existence; "was gone out of sight in some mysterious manner," as Movers,
Chron. S. 139, and Hitz. suppose,

(Note: Against this Hgstb. well says, that this allegation springs from
the incapacity of modern exegesis to accommodate itself to the prophetic
anticipation of the future; and that we might as well infer from [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md), that at the time these words
were spoken, the house of Judah must already in some mysterious manner
have come into the land of the north. [Ch2
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#005.md) furnishes unimpeachable testimony
to the existence of the ark in the 18th year of Josiah. And even Graf
says he cannot find anything to justify Movers' conclusion, since from
the special stress laid on the fact that at a future time they will have
the ark no longer, it might more naturally be inferred that the ark was
still in the people's possession, and was an object of care to them.)

but only that it will be lost or destroyed. This could happen only at
and along with the destruction of Jerusalem; and history testifies that
the temple after the exile had no ark. Hence it is justly concluded that
the ark had perished in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans,
and that upon the rebuilding of the temple after the exile, the ark was
not restored, because the nucleus of it, the tables of the law written
by the finger of God, could not be constructed by the hand of man.
Without the ark the second temple was also without the gracious presence
of Jahveh, the Shechinah or dwelling-place of God; so that this temple
was no longer the throne of God, but only a seeming temple, without
substance or reality. And thus the Old Testament covenant had come to an
end. "We have here then before us," Hgstb. truly observes, "the
announcement of an entire overthrow of the earlier form of the kingdom;
but it is such an overthrow of the form that it is at the same time the
highest perfection of the substance - a process like that in seed-corn,
which only dies in order to bring forth much fruit; like that in the
body, which is sown a corruptible that it may rise an incorruptible."
For the dwelling and enthronement of the Lord amidst His people was
again to come about, but in a higher form. Jerusalem is to become the
throne of Jahveh, i.e., Jerusalem is to be for the renewed Israel that
which the ark had been for the former Israel, the holy dwelling-place of
God. Under the old covenant Jerusalem had been the city of Jahveh, of
the great King ([Psa 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003).md); because
Jerusalem had possessed the temple, in which the Lord sat enthroned in
the holy of holies over the ark. If in the future Jerusalem is to become
the throne of the Lord instead of the ark, Jerusalem must itself become
a sanctuary of God; God the Lord must fill all Jerusalem with His glory
(כּבוד), as Isaiah prophesied He would in Isaiah 60, of which prophecy
we have the fulfilment portrayed in Apoc. 21 and 22. Jeremiah does not
more particularly explain how this is to happen, or how the raising of
Jerusalem to be the throne of the Lord is to be accomplished; for he is
not seeking in this discourse to proclaim the future reconstitution of
the kingdom of God. His immediate aim is to clear away the false props
of their confidence from a people that set its trust in the possession
of the temple and the ark, and further to show it that the presence of
the temple and ark will not protect it from judgment; that, on the
contrary, the Lord will reject faithless Judah, destroying Jerusalem and
the temple; that nevertheless He will keep His covenant promises, and
that by receiving again as His people the repentant members of the ten
tribes, regarded by Judah as wholly repudiated, with whom indeed He will
renew His covenant.

As a consequence of Jerusalem's being raised to the glory of being the
Lord's throne, all nations will gather themselves to her, the city of
God; cf. [Zac 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md) :15. Indeed in
the Old Testament every revelation of the glory of God amongst His
people attracted the heathen; cf. [Jos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#009.md). לשׁם יהוה, not, to the name of
Jahveh towards Jerusalem (Hitz.), but, because of the name of Jahveh at
Jerusalem (as in [Jos 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#009).md), i.e.,
because Jahveh reveals His glory there; for the name of Jahveh is Jahveh
Himself in the making of His glorious being known in deeds of almighty
power and grace. לירוּשׁלם, prop. belonging to Jerusalem, because the
name makes itself known there; cf. [Jer
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019.md); [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002.md); [Zac
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#022.md). - The last clause, they will
walk no more, etc., refers not to the heathen peoples, but to the
Israelites as being the principal subject of the discourse (cf. [Jer
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#016).md), since שׁררוּת is used of Israel
in all the cases ([Jer 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#024.md); [Jer
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#013.md); [Jer
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008.md); [Jer
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#010.md); [Jer
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#012.md); [Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md); [Jer
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md), and [Psa
81:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#013).md), thus corresponding to the
original in [Deu 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md), whence it is
taken. שׁררוּת prop. firmness, but in Hebr. always sensu malo:
obstinacy, obduracy of heart, see in Deut. l.c.; here strengthened by
the adjective הרע belonging to לבּם.

[Jeremiah 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 3:18</span></span>

In those days when Jerusalem is glorified by being made the throne of
the Lord, Judah along with Israel will come out of the north into the
land which the Lord gave to their fathers. As the destruction of
Jerusalem and of the temple is foretold implicite in [Jer
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016.md), so here the expulsion of Judah
into exile is assumed as having already taken place, and the return not
of Israel, only, but of Judah too is announced, as in [Hos
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002.md), and more fully in [Eze
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#016.md). We should note the arrangement,
the house of Judah with (על, prop. on) the house of Israel; this is as
much as to say that Israel is the first to resolve on a return and to
arise, and that Judah joins itself to the house of Israel. Judah is thus
subordinated to the house of Israel, because the prophet is here seeking
chiefly to announce the return of Israel to the Lord. It can surely not
be necessary to say that, as regards the fulfilment, we are not entitled
hence to infer that the remnant of the ten tribes will positively be
converted to the Lord and redeemed out of exile sooner than the remnant
of Judah. For more on this point see on [Jer
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#008.md).

3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019.md). "I thought, O how I will put
thee among the sons, and give thee a delightful land, a heritage of the
chiefest splendour of the nations! and thought, 'My Father,' ye will cry
to me, and not turn yourselves away from me. [Jer
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020.md). truly as a wife faithlessly
forsakes her mate, so are ye become faithless towards me, house of
Israel, saith Jahveh. [Jer 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md). A
voice upon the bare-topped hills is heard, suppliant weeping of the sons
of Israel; for that they have made their way crooked, forsaken Jahveh
their God. [Jer 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022.md). 'Return, ye
backsliding sons, I will heal your backsliding,' Behold, we come to
thee; for Thou Jahveh art our God. [Jer
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023.md). Truly the sound from the hills,
from the mountains, is become falsehood: truly in Jahveh our God is the
salvation of Israel. [Jer 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024.md). And
shame hath devoured the gains of our fathers from our youth on; their
sheep and their oxen, their sons and their daughters. [Jer
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#025.md). Let us lie down in our shame,
and let our disgrace cover us; for against Jahveh our God have we
sinned, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have
not listened to the voice of our God." Hitz. takes [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md) and [Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019.md) together, without giving an
opinion on ואנכי אמרתּי. Ew. joins [Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019.md) to the preceding, and begins a
new strophe with [Jer 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md). Neither
assumption can be justified. With [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md) closes the promise which formed
the burden of the preceding strophe, and in [Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019.md) there begins a new train of
thought, the announcement as to how Israel comes to a consciousness of
sin and returns penitent to the Lord its God ([Jer
3:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021).md). The transition to this
announcement is formed by [Jer 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019.md)
and [Jer 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020.md), in which the contrast
between God's fatherly designs and Israel's faithless bearing towards
God is brought prominently forward; and by ואנכי אמרתּי it is attached
to the last clause of the 18th verse. His having mentioned the land into
which the Israelites would again return, carries the prophet's thoughts
back again to the present and the past, to the bliss which Jahveh had
designed for them, forfeited by their faithless apostasy, and to be
regained only by repentant return (Graf). "I thought," refers to the
time when God gave the land to their fathers for an inheritance. Then
spake, i.e., thought, I; cf. [Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md). How I will set thee or place
thee among the sons! i.e., how I will make thee glorious among the sons
(שׁית c. accus. and ב, as in [Sa2
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029).md). No valid objection against
this is founded by Hitz.'s plea that in that case we must read אשׁיתך,
and that by Jeremiah, the teacher of morals, no heathen nation, or any
but Israel, can ever be regarded as a son of God ([Jer
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009.md), [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020).md). The fem. אשׁיתך is explained
by the personification of Judah and Israel as two sisters, extending
throughout the whole prophecy. The other objection is erroneous as to
the fact. In [Jer 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009.md) Jahveh calls
Ephraim, = Israel, his first-born son, as all Israel is called by God in
[Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md). But the conception of
first-born has, as necessary correlate, that of other "sons." Inasmuch
as Jahveh the God of Israel is creator of the world and of all men, all
the peoples of the earth are His בּנים; and from amongst all the peoples
He has made choice of Israel as סגלּה, or chosen him for His first-born
son. Hitz.'s translation: how will I endow thee with children, is
contrary to the usage of the language. - The place which God willed to
give Israel amongst His children is specified by the next clause: and I
willed to give thee a delightful land (ארץ חמדּה as in [Zac
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md); [Psa
106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024).md). צבי צבאות, ornament of
ornaments, i.e., the greatest, most splendid ornament. For there can be
no doubt that צבאות does not come from צבא, but, with Kimchi after the
Targum, is to be derived from צבי; for the plural צביים from צבי may
pass into צבאים, cf. Gesen. 93. 6b, as Ew., too, in 186, c, admits,
though he takes our צבאות from צבא, and strains the meaning into: an
heirloom-adornment amidst the hosts of heathen. After such proofs of a
father's love, God expected that Israel would by a true cleaving to Him
show some return of filial affection. To cry, "My father," is a token of
a child's love and adherence. The Chet. תּקראוּ and תּשׁוּבוּ are not to
be impugned; the Keris are unnecessary alterations.

[Jer 3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020.md)

But Israel did not meet the expectation. Like a faithless wife from her
husband, Israel fell away from its God. The particle of comparison
כּאשׁר is omitted before the verb, as in [Isa
55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009.md), cf. [Isa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md) and [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011.md). רע does not precisely mean
husband, nor yet paramour, but friend and companion, and so here is
equal to wedded husband. בּגד c. מן, withdraw faithlessly from one,
faithlessly forsake - c. בּ, be faithless, deal faithlessly with one.

Yet Israel will come to a knowledge of its iniquity, and bitterly repent
it, [Jer 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md). From the heights where
idolatry was practised, the prophet already hears in spirit the
lamentations and supplications of the Israelites entreating for
forgiveness. על שׁפיים points back to [Jer
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002.md), when the naked heights were
mentioned as the scenes of idolatry. From these places is heard the
supplicating cry for pardon. כּי העווּ, because (for that) they had made
their way crooked, i.e., had entered on a crooked path, had forgotten
their God.

[Jer 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022.md)

The prophet further overhears in spirit, as answer to the entreaty of
the Israelites, the divine invitation and promise: Return, ye
backsliding children (cf. [Jer 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014).md),
I will heal your backslidings. ארפּה for ארפּא. Backslidings, i.e.,
mischief which backsliding has brought, the wounds inflicted by apostasy
from God; cf. [Hos 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005.md), a passage
which was in the prophet's mind; and fore the figure of healing, cf.
[Jer 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#017.md); [Jer
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006.md). To this promise they answer:
Behold, we come to Thee (אתנוּ for אתאנוּ from אתא, [Isa
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#012), for אתה .md), for Thou art Jahveh,
art our God. Of this confession they further state the cause in [Jer
3:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023.md).

[Jer 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023.md)

From the false gods they have gained but disgrace; the salvation of
Israel is found only in Jahveh their God. The thought now given is
clearly expressed in the second clause of the verse; less clear is the
meaning of the first clause, which tells what Israel had got from
idolatry. The difficulty lies in המון הרים, which the early commentators
so joined together as to make המון stat. constr. (המון). Similarly Hitz.
and Graf: from the hills the host (or tumult) of the mountains is (for)
a delusion; Hitz. understanding by the host of the mountains the many
gods, or the numerous statues of them that were erected at the spots
where they were worshipped, while Graf takes the tumult of the mountains
to mean the turmoil of the pilgrims, the exulting cries of the
celebrants. But it is as impossible that "the sound of the hills" should
mean the multitude of the gods, as that it should mean the tumult of the
pilgrims upon the mountains. Besides, the expression, "the host or
tumult of the mountains comes from the hills," would be singularly
tautological. These reasons are enough to show that הרים cannot be a
genitive dependent on המון, but must be taken as coordinate with
מגּבעות, so that the preposition מן will have to be repeated before
הרים. But המון must be the subject of the clause, else where would be no
subject at all. המון means bustle, eager crowd, tumult, noise, and is
also used of the surging mass of earthly possessions or riches, [Psa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016.md); [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md). Schnur., Ros., Maur., de W.,
have preferred the last meaning, and have put the sense thus: vana est
ex collibus, vana ex montibus affluentia, or: delusive is the abundance
that comes from the hills, from the mountains. This view is not to be
overthrown by Graf's objection, that we cannot here entertain the idea
of abundance, however, imaginary, acquired by the Israelites through
idolatry, seeing that in the next verses it is declared that the false
gods have devoured the wealth which the Israelites had inherited and
received from God. For in the present connection the abundance would be
not a real but expected or imagined abundance, the delusiveness of which
would be shown in the next verse by the statement that the false gods
had devoured the acquisitions of Israel. But to take המון in the sense
of affluentia seems questionable here, when the context makes no
reference to wealth or earthly riches, and where the abundance of the
hills and mountains cannot be understood to mean their produce; the
abundance is that which the idolatry practised upon the hills and
mountains brought or was expected to bring to the people. Hence, along
with Ew., we take this word in the sig. tumult or noise, and by it we
understand the wild uproarious orgies of idolatry, which, according to
[Jer 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002.md) and [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md), were practised on the hills and
mountains (קל זנוּתהּ, [Jer 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009).md). Thus
we obtain the sense already given by the Targ.: in vanum coluimus super
collibus et non in utilitatem congregavimus nos (אתרגישׁנא ( son , prop.
tumultuati sumus) super montibus, i.e., delusive and profitless were our
idolatrous observances upon the heights.

[Jer 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024.md)

In [Jer 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024.md) we are told in what
particulars idolatry became to them הבּשׁת .לשׁקר, the shame,
opprobrious expression for הבּעל, equal to shame-god, cf. [Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013.md) and [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md); since the worship of Baal, i.e.,
of the false gods, resulted in disgrace to the people. He devoured the
wealth of our fathers, namely, their sheep and oxen, mentioned as a
specimen of their wealth, and their sons and daughters. The idols
devoured this wealth, to in respect that sheep and oxen, and, on
Moloch's altar, children too, were sacrificed, for sheep and oxen were
offered to Jahveh; but because idolatry drew down judgments on the
people and brought about the devastation of the land by enemies who
devoured the substance of the people, and slew sons and daughters, [Deu
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030.md), [Deu
28:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033.md). From our youth on; - the youth
of the people is the period of the judges.

[Jer 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#025.md)

The people does not repudiate this shame and disgrace, but is willing to
endure it patiently, since by its sin it has fully deserved it. נשׁכּבה,
not: we lie, but: we will lay us down in our shame, as a man in pain and
grief throws himself on the ground, or on his couch (cf. [Sa2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#016.md); [Sa2
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#031.md); [Kg1
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#004).md), in order wholly to give way to
the feelings that crush him down. And let our disgrace cover us, i.e.,
enwrap us as a mourning robe or cloak; cf. [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026.md); [Psa
109:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#029.md); [Mic
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md), [Oba
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010.md).
