Hymn in Praise of the All-Bountiful King

With [Psa 144:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001) the collection
draws doxologically towards its close. This Psalm, which begins in the
form of the beracha (ברוך ה), is followed by another in which benedicam
([Psa 145:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001)) and benedicat ([Psa
145:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#021)) is the favourite word. It is
the only Psalm that bears the title תּהלּה, whose plural תּהלּים is
become the collective name of the Psalms. In B. Berachoth 4b it is
distinguished by the apophthegm: "Every one who repeats the תהלה לדוד
three times a day may be sure that he is a child of the world to come
(בן העולם הבא)." And why? Not merely because this Psalm, as the Gemara
says, אתיא באלף בית, i.e., follows the course of the alphabet (for Ps
119 is in fact also alphabetical, and that in an eightfold degree), and
not merely because it celebrates God's care for all creatures (for this
the Great Hallel also does, [Psa
136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025)), but because it unites both
these prominent qualities in itself (משׁום דאית ביה תרתי). In fact, [Psa
145:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#016) is a celebration of the
goodness of God which embraces every living thing, with which only [Psa
136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025), and not [Psa
111:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#005), can be compared. Valde
sententiosus hic Psalmus est, says Bakius; and do we not find in this
Psalm our favourite Benedicite and Oculi omnium which our children
repeat before a meal? It is the ancient church's Psalm for the noon-day
repast (vid., Armknecht, Die heilige Psalmodie, 1855, S. 54); [Psa
145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015) was also used at the holy
communion, hence Chrysostom says it contains τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, ἅπερ οἱ
μεμυημένοι συνεχῶς ὑποψάλλουσι λέγοντες· Οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ πάντων εἰς σὲ
ἐλπίζουσιν καὶ σὺ δίδως τὴν τροφὴν αὐτῶν ἐν εὐκαιρίᾳ.

Κατὰ στοιχεῖον, observes Theodoret, καὶ οὗτος ὁ ὕμνος σύγκειται. The
Psalm is distichic, and every first line of the distich has the ordinal
letter; but the distich Nun is wanting. The Talmud (loc cit.) is of
opinion that it is because the fatal נפלה ([Amo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002)), which David, going on at once
with סומך ה לכל־הנפלים, skips over, begins with Nun. On the other hand,
Ewald, Vaihinger, and Sommer, like Grotius, think that the Nun-strophe
has been lost. The lxx (but not Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, nor
Jerome in his translation after the original text) gives such a strophe,
perhaps out of a MS (like the Dublin Cod. Kennicot, 142) in which it was
supplied: Πιστὸς (נאמן as in [Psa
111:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#007)) κύριος ἐν (πᾶσι) τοῖς λόγοις
αὐτοῦ καὶ ὅσιος ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ (according with [Psa
145:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#017), with the change only of two
words of this distich). Hitzig is of opinion that the original
Nun-strophe has been welded into [Psa
141:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001); but only his
clairvoyant-like historical discernment is able to amalgamate [Psa
145:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#006) of this Psalm with our Psalms
145. We are contented to see in the omission of the Nun-strophe an
example of that freedom with which the Old Testament poets are wont to
handle this kind of forms. Likewise there is no reason apparent for
there fact that Jeremiah has chosen in [Lam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001), [Lam
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#001), and [Lam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001) of the Lamentations to make the
Ajin-strophe follow the Pe-strophe three times, whilst in [Lam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001) it precedes it.

[Psalms 145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 145:1</span></span>

The strains with which this hymn opens are familiar Psalm-strains. We
are reminded of [Psa 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#002), and the
likewise alphabetical song of praise and thanksgiving [Psa
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002). The plena scriptio אלוהי in [Psa
143:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#010); [Psa
98:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#006). The language of address "my God
the King," which sounds harsh in comparison with the otherwise usual "my
King and my God" ([Psa 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003); [Psa
84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004)), purposely calls God with
unrelated generality, that is to say in the most absolute manner, the
King. If the poet is himself a king, the occasion for this appellation
of God is all the more natural and the signification all the more
pertinent. But even in the mouth of any other person it is significant.
Whosoever calls God by such a name acknowledges His royal prerogative,
and at the same time does homage to Him and binds himself to allegiance;
and it is just this confessory act of exalting Him who in Himself is the
absolutely lofty One that is here called רומם. But who can the poet
express the purpose of praising God's Name for ever? Because the praise
of God is a need of his inmost nature, he has a perfect right to forget
his own mortality when engaged upon this devotion to the ever-living
King. Clinging adoringly to the Eternal One, he must seem to himself to
be eternal; and if there is a practical proof for a life after death, it
is just this ardent desire of the soul, wrought of God Himself, after
the praise of the God of its life (lit., its origin) which affords it
the highest, noblest delight. The idea of the silent Hades, which forces
itself forward elsewhere, as in [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006), where the mind of the poet is
beclouded by sin, is here entirely removed, inasmuch as here the mind of
the poet is the undimmed mirror of the divine glory. Therefore [Psa
145:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#002) also does not concede the
possibility of any interruption of the praise: the poet will daily ([Psa
68:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#020)) bless God, be they days of
prosperity or of sorrow, uninterruptedly in all eternity will he glorify
His Name (אהללה as in [Psa 69:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#031)).
There is no worthier and more exhaustless object of praise ([Psa
145:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#003)): Jahve is great, and greatly to
be praised (מהלּל, taken from [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002), as in [Psa
96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004), cf. [Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004)), and of His "greatness" (cf.
[Ch1 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#011), where this attribute
precedes all others) there is no searching out, i.e., it is so abysmally
deep that no searching can reach its bottom (as in [Isa
40:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#028); [Job
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007).). It has, however, been
revealed, and is being revealed continually, and is for this very reason
thus celebrated in [Psa 145:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#004) : one
generation propagates to the next the growing praise of the works that
He has wrought out (עשׂה מעשׁים), and men are able to relate all manner
of proofs of His victorious power which prevails over everything, and
makes everything subject to itself (גּבוּרת as in [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007), and frequently). This
historically manifest and traditional divine doxa and the facts (דּברי
as in [Psa 105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027)) of the divine
wonders the poet will devoutly consider. הדר stands in attributive
relation to כּבוד, as this on its part does to הודך. Thy brilliantly
gloriously (kingly) majesty (cf. [Jer
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018); [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021)). The poet does not say גּם אני,
nor may we insert it, either here in [Psa
145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005), or in [Psa
145:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#006), where the same sequence of
thoughts recurs, more briefly expressed. The emphasis lies on the
objects. The mightiness (עזוּז as in [Psa
78:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#004), and in [Isa
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025), where it signifies violence) of
His terrible acts shall pass from mouth to mouth (אמר with a
substantival object as in [Psa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011)),
and His mighty acts (גּדלּות, magnalia, as in [Ch1
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#019), [Ch1
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#021)) - according to the Ker (which
is determined by the suffix of אספּרנּה; cf. however, [Sa2
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#023); [Kg2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#003); [Kg2
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#026), and frequently): His greatness
(גּדלּה) - will he also on his part make the matter of his narrating. It
is, however, not alone the awe-inspiring majesty of God which is
revealed in history, but also the greatness (רב used as a substantive as
in [Psa 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020); [Isa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007); [Isa
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007), whereas רבּים in [Psa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010); [Psa
89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051) is an adjective placed before
the noun after the manner of a numeral), i.e., the abundant measure, of
His goodness and His righteousness, i.e., His acting in inviolable
correspondence with His counsel and order of salvation. The memory of
the transcendent goodness of God is the object of universal, overflowing
acknowledgement and the righteousness of God is the object of universal
exultation (רנּן with the accusative as in [Psa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016); [Psa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017)). After the poet has sung the
glorious self-attestation of God according to both its sides, the fiery
and the light sides, he lingers by the light side, the front side of the
Name of Jahve unfolded in [Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).

[Psalms 145:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 145:8</span></span>

This memorable utterance of Jahve concerning Himself the writer of Ps
103, which is of kindred import, also interweaves into his celebration
of the revelation of divine love in [Psa
145:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008). Instead of רב־חסד the
expression here, however, is וגדול חסד (Kerמ, as in [Nah
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003), cf. [Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029), with Makkeph וּגדל־). The real
will of God tends towards favour, which gladly giving stoops to give
(חנּוּן), and towards compassion, which interests itself on behalf of
the sinner for his help and comfort (רחוּם). Wrath is only the
background of His nature, which He reluctantly and only after long
waiting (ארך אפּים) lets loose against those who spurn His great mercy.
For His goodness embraces, as [Psa
145:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#009) says, all; His tender mercies
are over all His works, they hover over and encompass all His creatures.
Therefore, too, all His works praise Him: they are all together
loud-speaking witnesses of that sympathetic all-embracing love of His,
which excludes no one who does not exclude himself; and His saints, who
live in God's love, bless Him (יברכוּכה written as in [Kg1
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044)): their mouth overflows with the
declaration (יאמרוּ) of the glory of the kingdom of this loving God, and
in speaking (ידבּרוּ) of the sovereign power with which He maintains and
extends this kingdom. This confession they make their employ, in order
that the knowledge of the mighty acts of God and the glorious majesty of
His kingdom may at length become the general possession of mankind. When
the poet in [Psa 145:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#012) sets forth the
purpose of the proclamation, he drops the form of address. God's kingdom
is a kingdom of all aeons, and His dominion is manifested without
exception and continually in all periods or generations (בּכל־דּור ודר
as in Ps 45:18, [Est 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#028), a
pleonastic strengthening of the expression בּדר ודר, [Psa
90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001)). It is the eternal circumference
of the history of time, but at the same time its eternal substance,
which more and more unfolds and achieves itself in the succession of the
periods that mark its course. For that all things in heaven and on earth
shall be gathered up together (ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι, [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010)) in the all-embracing kingdom of
God in His Christ, is the goal of all history, and therefore the
substance of history which is working itself out. With [Psa
145:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#013) (cf. Dan. 3:33, [Dan
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#031), according to Hitzig the primary
passages) another paragraph is brought to a close.

[Psalms 145:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 145:14</span></span>

The poet now celebrates in detail the deeds of the gracious King. The
words with ל are pure datives, cf. the accusative expression in [Psa
146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008). He in person is the support
which holds fast the falling ones (נופלים, here not the fallen ones, see
[Psa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001)) in the midst of falling
(Nicephorus: τοὺς καταπεσεῖν μέλλοντας ἑδραιοῖ, ὥστε μὴ καταπεσεῖν), and
the stay by which those who are bowed together raise themselves. He is
the Provider for all beings, the Father of the house, to whom in the
great house of the world the eyes (עיני with the second ê toneless, Ew.
100, b) of all beings, endowed with reason and irrational, are directed
with calm confidence ([Mat 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026)), and
who gives them their food in its, i.e., in due season. The language of
[Psa 104:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027) is very similar, and it
proceeds here, too, as there in [Psa
104:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#028) (cf. Sir. 40:14). He opens His
hand, which is ever full, much as a man who feeds the doves in his court
does, and gives רצון, pleasure, i.e., that which is good, which is the
fulfilling of their desire, in sufficient fulness to all living things
(and therefore those in need of support for the body and the life). Thus
it is to be interpreted, according to [Deu
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023) (after which here in the lxx the
reading varies between εὐδοκίας and εὐλογίας), cf. [Act
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017), ἐμπιπλών τροφῆς καὶ εὐφροσύνης
τάς καρδίας ἡμῶν. השׂבּיע is construed with a dative and accusative of
the object instead of with two accusatives of the object (Ges. 139. 1,
2). The usage of the language is unacquainted with רצון as an adverb in
the sense of "willingly" (Hitzig), which would rather be ברצונך. In all
the ways that Jahve takes in His historical rule He is "righteous,"
i.e., He keeps strictly to the rule (norm) of His holy love; and in all
His works which He accomplishes in the course of history He is merciful
(חסיד), i.e., He practises mercy (חסד, see [Psa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002)); for during the present time of
mercy the primary essence of His active manifestation is free preventing
mercy, condescending love. True, He remains at a distance from the
hypocrites, just as their heart remains far from Him ([Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013)); but as for the rest, with
impartial equality He is nigh (קרוב as in [Psa
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#019)) to all who call upon Him בּאמת,
in firmness, certainty, truth, i.e., so that the prayer comes from their
heart and is holy fervour (cf. [Isa
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020); [Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001)). What is meant is true and real
prayer in opposition to the νεκρὸν ἔργον, as is also meant in the main
in [Joh 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023). To such true praying
ones Jahve is present, viz., in mercy (for in respect of His power He is
everywhere); He makes the desire of those who fear Him a reality, their
will being also His; and He grants them the salvation (σωτηρία) prayed
for. Those who are called in [Psa
145:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#019) those who fear Him, are called
in [Psa 145:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#020) those who love Him.
Fear and love of God belong inseparably together; for fear without love
is an unfree, servile disposition, and love without fear, bold-faced
familiarity: the one dishonours the all-gracious One, and the other the
all-exalted One. But all who love and fear Him He preserves, and on the
other hand exterminates all wanton sinners. Having reached the Tav, the
hymn of praise, which has traversed all the elements of the language, is
at an end. The poet does not, however, close without saying that
praising God shall be his everlasting employment (פּי ידבּר with
Olewejored, the Mahpach or rather Jethib sign of which above represents
the Makkeph), and without wishing that all flesh, i.e., all men, who αρε
σὰρξ καὶ αἷμα, בּשׂר ודם, may bless God's holy Name to all eternity. The
realization of this wish is the final goal of history. It will then have
reached [Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043) of the great song
in Deut. 32 - Jahve one and His Name one ([Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009)), Israel praising God ὑπὲρ
ἀληθείας, and the Gentiles ὑπὲρ ἐλέους ([Rom
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008).).
