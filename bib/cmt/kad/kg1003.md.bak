Solomon's Marriage; Worship and Sacrifice at Gibeon; and Wise Judicial
Sentence - 1 Kings 3

The establishment of the government in the hands of Solomon having been
noticed in 1 Kings 2, the history of his reign commences with an account
of his marriage to an Egyptian princess, and with a remark concerning
the state of the kingdom at the beginning of his reign ([Kg1
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001).md). There then follows a
description of the solemn sacrifice and prayer at Gibeon, by which
Solomon sought to give a religious consecration to his government, and
to secure the assistance of the Lord and His blessing upon it, and
obtained the fulfilment of his desire ([Kg1
2:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004).md). And then, as a practical
proof of the spirit of his government, we have the sentence through
which he displayed the wisdom of his judicial decisions in the sight of
all the people ([Kg1 2:16-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#016).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 3:1</span></span>

Solomon's marriage and the religious state of the kingdom. - [Kg1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md). When Solomon had well secured his
possession of the throne ([Kg1 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046).md),
he entered into alliance with Pharaoh, by taking his daughter as his
wife. This Pharaoh of Egypt is supposed by Winer, Ewald, and others to
have been Psusennes, the last king of the twenty-first (Tanitic)
dynasty, who reigned thirty-five years; since the first king of the
twenty-second (Bubastic) dynasty, Sesonchis or Sheshonk, was certainly
the Shishak who conquered Jerusalem in the fifth year of Rehoboam's
reign ([Kg1 14:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025).md). The alliance by
marriage with the royal family of Egypt presupposes that Egypt was
desirous of cultivating friendly relations with the kingdom of Israel,
which had grown into a power to be dreaded; although, as we know nothing
more of the history of Egypt at that time than the mere names of the
kings (as given by Manetho), it is impossible to determine what may have
been the more precise grounds which led the reigning king of Egypt to
seek the friendship of Israel. There is, at any rate, greater
probability in this supposition than in that of Thenius, who conjectures
that Solomon contracted this marriage because he saw the necessity of
entering into a closer relationship with this powerful neighbour, who
had a perfectly free access to Palestine. The conclusion of this
marriage took place in the first year of Solomon's reign, though
probably not at the very beginning of the reign, but not till after his
buildings had been begun, as we may infer from the expression לבנות
כּלּתו עד (until he had made an end of building). Moreover, Solomon had
already married Naamah the Ammonitess before ascending the throne, and
had had a son by her (compare [Kg1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021.md) with [Kg1
11:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#042).md). - Marriage with an Egyptian
princess was not a transgression of the law, as it was only marriages
with Canaanitish women that were expressly prohibited ([Exo
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#016.md); [Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003).md), whereas it was allowable to
marry even foreign women taken in war ([Deu
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#010)..md). At the same time, it was only
when the foreign wives renounced idolatry and confessed their faith in
Jehovah, that such marriages were in accordance with the spirit of the
law. And we may assume that this was the case even with Pharaoh's
daughter; because Solomon adhered so faithfully to the Lord during the
first years of his reign, that he would not have tolerated any idolatry
in his neighbourhood, and we cannot find any trace of Egyptian idolatry
in Israel in the time of Solomon, and, lastly, the daughter of Pharaoh
is expressly distinguished in [Kg1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md) from the foreign wives who
tempted Solomon to idolatry in his old age. The assertion of Seb.
Schmidt and Thenius to the contrary rests upon a false interpretation of
[Kg1 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md). - "And he brought her into
the city of David, till he had finished the building of his palace,"
etc. Into the city of David: i.e., not into the palace in which his
father had dwelt, as Thenius arbitrarily interprets it in opposition to
[Ch2 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011.md), but into a house in the
city of David or Jerusalem, from which he brought her up into the house
appointed for her after the building of his own palace was finished
([Kg1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024).md). The building of the house
of Jehovah is mentioned as well, because the sacred tent for the ark of
the covenant was set up in the palace of David until the temple was
finished, and the temple was not consecrated till after the completion
of the building of the palace (see at [Kg1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001).md). By the building of "the wall of
Jerusalem" we are to understand a stronger fortification, and possibly
also the extension of the city wall (see at [Kg1
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#027).md).

[Kg1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002.md)

"Only the people sacrificed upon high places, because there was not yet
a house built for the name of Jehovah until those days." The limiting
רק, only, by which this general account of the existing condition of the
religious worship is appended to what precedes, may be accounted for
from the antithesis to the strengthening of the kingdom by Solomon
mentioned in [Kg1 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046.md). The train of
thought is the following: It is true that Solomon's authority was firmly
established by the punishment of the rebels, so that he was able to ally
himself by marriage with the king of Egypt; but just as he was obliged
to bring his Egyptian wife into the city of David, because the building
of his palace as not yet finished, so the people, and (according to [Kg1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003).md) even Solomon himself, were only
able to sacrifice to the Lord at that time upon altars on the high
places, because the temple was not yet built. The participle מזבּחים
denotes the continuation of this religious condition (see Ewald, 168,
c.). The בּמות, or high places,

(Note: The opinion of Bttcher and Thenius, that בּמה signifies a "sacred
coppice," is only based upon untenable etymological combinations, and
cannot be proved. And Ewald's view is equally unfounded, viz., that
"high places were an old Canaanaean species of sanctuary, which at that
time had become common in Israel also, and consisted of a tall stone of
a conical shape, as the symbol of the Holy One, and of the real high
place, viz., an altar, a sacred tree or grove, or even an image of the
one God as well" (Gesch. iii. p. 390). For, on the one hand, it cannot
be shown that the tall stone of a conical shape existed even in the case
of the Canaanitish bamoth, and, on the other hand, it is impossible to
adduce a shadow of a proof that the Israelitish bamoth, which were
dedicated to Jehovah, were constructed precisely after the pattern of
the Baal's-bamoth of the Canaanites.)

were places of sacrifice and prayer, which were built upon eminences of
hills, because men thought they were nearer the Deity there, and which
consisted in some cases probably of an altar only, though as a rule
there was an altar with a sanctuary built by the side (בּמות בּית, [Kg1
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#032.md); [Kg2
17:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#029.md), [Kg2
17:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#032.md); [Kg2
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#019).md), so that בּמה frequently stands
for בּמה בּית (e.g., [Kg1 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md); [Kg1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023.md); [Kg2
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md); [Kg2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008).md), and the בּמה is also
distinguished from the מזבּח ([Kg2
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015.md); [Ch2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#002).md). These high places were
consecrated to the worship of Jehovah, and essentially different from
the high places of the Canaanites which were consecrated to Baal.
Nevertheless sacrificing upon these high places was opposed to the law,
according to which the place which the Lord Himself had chosen for the
revelation of His name was the only place where sacrifices were to be
offered ([Lev 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003)..md); and therefore it
is excused here on the ground that no house (temple) had yet been built
to the name of the Lord.

[Kg1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#003.md)

Even Solomon, although he loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of his
father David, i.e., according to [Kg1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003.md), in the commandments of the Lord
as they are written in the law of Moses, sacrificed and burnt incense
upon high places. Before the building of the temple, more especially
since the tabernacle had lost its significance as the central place of
the gracious presence of God among His people, through the removal of
the ark of the covenant, the worship of the high places was unavoidable;
although even afterwards it still continued as a forbidden cultus, and
could not be thoroughly exterminated even by the most righteous kings
([Kg1 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md); [Kg2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#004.md); [Kg2
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#004.md); [Kg2
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#004.md), [Kg2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 3:4</span></span>

Solomon's Sacrifice and Dream at Gibeon (cf. [Ch2
1:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001).md). - To implore the divine
blessing upon his reign, Solomon offered to the Lord at Gibeon a great
sacrifice - a thousand burnt-offerings; and, according to [Ch2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002.md), the representatives of the whole
nation took part in this sacrificial festival. At that time the great or
principal bamah was at Gibeon (the present el Jib; see at [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003).md), namely, the Mosaic tabernacle
([Ch2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003).md), which is called הבּמה,
because the ark of the covenant, with which Jehovah had bound up His
gracious presence, was not there now. "Upon that altar," i.e., upon the
altar of the great bamah at Gibeon, the brazen altar of burnt-offering
in the tabernacle ([Ch2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#006).md).

[Kg1 3:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md)

The one thing wanting in the place of sacrifice at Gibeon, viz., the ark
of the covenant with the gracious presence of Jehovah, was supplied by
the Lord in the case of this sacrifice by a direct revelation in a
dream, which Solomon received in the night following the sacrifice.
There is a connection between the question which God addressed to
Solomon in the dream, "What shall I give thee?" and the object of the
sacrifice, viz., to seek the help of God for his reign. Solomon
commences his prayer in [Kg1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006.md) with
an acknowledgment of the great favour which the Lord had shown to his
father David, and had continued till now by raising his son to his
throne (הזּה כּיּום, as it is this day: cf. [Sa1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#008.md); [Deu
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#018), etc..md); and then, in [Kg1
3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007.md), in the consciousness of his
incapacity for the right administration of government over so numerous a
people, he asks the Lord for an obedient heart and for wisdom to rule
His people. ועתּה introduces the petition, the reasons assigned for
which are, (1) his youth and inexperience, and (2) the greatness or
multitude of the nation to be governed. I am, says he, קטן נער, i.e., an
inexperienced youth (Solomon was only about twenty years old): "I know
not to go out and in," i.e., how to behave myself as king, or govern the
people (for ובא צאת compare the note on [Num
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#017).md). At [Kg1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#008.md) he describes the magnitude of the
nation in words which recall to mind the divine promises in [Gen
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016.md) and [Gen
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013.md), to indicate how gloriously the
Lord has fulfilled the promises which He made to the patriarchs.

[Kg1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009.md)

ונתתּ, therefore give. The prayer (commencing with ועתּה in [Kg1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007).md) is appended in the form of an
apodosis to the circumstantial clauses וגו ואנכי and וגו ועבדּך, which
contain the grounds of the petition. שׁמע לב, a hearing heart, i.e., a
heart giving heed to the law and right of God, "to judge Thy people,
(namely) to distinguish between good and evil (i.e., right and wrong)."
"For who could judge this Thy numerous people," sc. unless Thou gavest
him intelligence? כּבד, heavy in multitude: in the Chronicles this is
explained by גּדול.

[Kg1 3:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#010.md)

This prayer pleased God well. "Because thou hast asked this, and hast
not asked for thyself long life, nor riches, nor the life (i.e., the
destruction) of thy foes," all of them good things, which the world
seeks to obtain as the greatest prize, "but intelligence to hear
judgment (i.e., to foster it, inasmuch as the administration of justice
rests upon a conscientious hearing of the parties), behold I have done
according to thy word" (i.e., fulfilled thy request: the perfect is
used, inasmuch as the hearkening has already begun; for הנּה in this
connection compare Ewald, 307, e.), "and given thee a wise and
understanding heart." The words which follow, "so that there has been
none like thee before thee," etc., are not to be restricted to the kings
of Israel, as Clericus supposes, but are to be understood quite
universally as applying to all mankind (cf. [Kg1
5:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#009).md).

[Kg1 3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#013.md)

In addition to this, according to the promise that to him who seeks
first the kingdom of God and His righteousness all other things shall be
added ([Mat 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033).md), God will also give
him the earthly blessings, for which he has not asked, and that in great
abundance, viz., riches and honour such as no king of the earth has had
before him; and if he adhere faithfully to God's commandments, long life
also (והארכתּי, in this case I have lengthened). This last promise was
not fulfilled, because Solomon did not observe the condition (cf. [Kg1
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#042).md).

[Kg1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015.md)

Then Solomon awoke, and behold it was a dream; i.e., a dream produced by
God, a revelation by dream, or a divine appearance in a dream. חלום as
in [Num 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md). - Solomon thanked the
Lord again for this promise after his return to Jerusalem, by offering
burnt-offerings and thank-offerings before the ark of the covenant,
i.e., upon the altar at the tent erected for the ark upon Zion, and
prepared a meal for all his servants (viz., his court-servants), i.e., a
sacrificial meal of the שׁלמים. - This sacrificial festival upon Zion is
omitted in the Chronicles, as well as the following account in [Num
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016.md) -28; not, however, because in
the chronicler's opinion no sacrifices had any legal validity but such
as were offered upon the altar of the Mosaic tabernacle, as Thenius
fancies, though without observing the account in [Ch1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026.md)., which overthrows this
assertion, but because this sacrificial festival had no essential
significance in relation to Solomon's reign.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 3:16</span></span>

Solomon's Judicial Wisdom. - As a proof that the Lord had bestowed upon
Solomon unusual judicial wisdom, there is appended a decision of his in
a very difficult case, in which Solomon had shown extraordinary
intelligence. Two harlots living together in one house had each given
birth to a child, and one of them had "overlaid" her child in the night
while asleep (עליו שׁכבה אשׁר, because she had lain upon it), and had
then placed her dead child in the other one's bosom and taken her living
child away. When the other woman looked the next morning at the child
lying in her bosom, she saw that it was not her own but the other
woman's child, whereas the latter maintained the opposite. As they
eventually referred the matter in dispute to the king, and each one
declared that the living child was her own, the king ordered a sword to
be brought, and the living child to be cut in two, and a half given to
each. Then the mother of the living child, "because her bowels yearned
upon her son," i.e., her maternal love was excited, cried out, "Give her
(the other) the living child, but do not slay it;" whereas the latter
said, "It shall be neither mine nor thine, cut it in pieces."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 3:27</span></span>

Solomon saw from this which was the mother of the living child, and
handed it over to her.

(Note: Grotius observes on this: "The ἀγχίνοια of Solomon was shown by
this to be very great. There is a certain similarity in the account of
Ariopharnis, king of the Thracians, who, when three persons claimed to
be the sons of the king of the Cimmerii, decided that he was the son who
would not obey the command to cast javelins at his father's corpse. The
account is given by Diodorus Siculus.")

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 3:28</span></span>

This judicial decision convinced all the people that Solomon was endowed
with divine wisdom for the administration of justice.
