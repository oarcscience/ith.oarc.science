### [Proverbs Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 20:1</span></span>

This proverb warns against the debauchery with which free-thinking is
intimately associated.

Wine is a mocker, mead boisterous;

And no one who is overtaken thereby is wise.

The article stands with יין. Ewald maintains that in 10:1-22:6 the
article occurs only here and at [Pro
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#031.md), and that it is here, as the lxx
shows, not original. Both statements are incorrect. The article is
found, e.g., at [Pro 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006.md); [Pro
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018.md), [Pro
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017.md), and here the personification of
"wine" requires it; but that it is wanting to שׁכר shows how little
poetry delights in it; it stands once for twice. The effects of wine and
mead (שׁכר from שׁכר, to stop, obstruct, become stupid) are attributed
to these liquors themselves as their property. Wine is a mocker, because
he who is intoxicated with it readily scoffs at that which is holy; mead
is boisterous (cf. הומיּה, [Pro 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#011).md),
because he who is inebriated in his dissolute madness breaks through the
limits of morality and propriety. He is unwise who, through wine and the
like, i.e., overpowered by it (cf. [Sa2
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#028).md), staggers, i.e., he gives
himself up to wine to such a degree that he is no longer master of
himself. At [Pro 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019.md) we read, שׁגה ב,
of the intoxication of love; here, as at [Isa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md), of the intoxication of wine,
i.e., of the passionate slavish desire of wine or for wine. The word
"Erpicht" \[avidissimus\], i.e., being indissolubly bound to a thing,
corresponds at least in some degree to the idea. Fleischer compares the
French: tre fou de quelque chose. [Isa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md), however, shows that one has to
think on actual staggering, being overtaken in wine.

[Proverbs 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 20:2</span></span>

2 A roaring as of a lion is the terror of the king;

And he that provoketh him forfeiteth his life.

Line first is a variation of [Pro
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012.md). The terror which a king spreads
around (מלך, gen. subjecti., as, e.g., at [Job
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034) and generally.md) is like the
growling of a lion which threatens danger. The thought here suggested is
that it is dangerous to arouse a lion. Thus מתעבּרו does not mean: he
who is angry at him (Venet.: χολούμενος αὐτῷ), but he who provokes him
(lxx, Syr., Targ., Jerome, Luther). התעבּר signifies, as we saw at [Pro
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#016.md), to be in a state of excessive
displeasure, extreme anger. Here the meaning must be: he who puts him
into a state of anger (lxx, ὁ παροξύνων αὐτόν, in other versions with
the addition of καὶ ἐπιμιγνύμενος, who conducts himself familiarly
towards him = מתערבו). But can mitharvo have this meaning? That the
Hithpa. of transitive stems, e.g., התחגּן ([Kg1
8:59](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#059).md) and השׁתּמּר ([Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016).md), is construed with the accus. of
that which any one performs for himself (cf. Ewald's Gramm. Arab. 180),
is not unusual; but can the Hithpa. of the intrans. עבר, which signifies
to fall into a passion, "express with the accusative the passion of
another excited thereby" (Ewald, 282a)? There is no evidence for this;
and Hitzig's conjecture, מתעבּרו (Tiphel of the Targ. תּעבור = עברה), is
thus not without occasion. But one might suppose that התעבּר, as the
reflexive of a Piel or Hiphil which meant to be put into a state of
anger, may mean to draw forth the anger of any one, as in Arab., the
VIIIth form (Hithpa.) of ḥaḍr, to be present, with the accus. as
reflexive of the IVth form, may mean: sibi aliquid praesens sistere. Not
so difficult is חטא with the accus. of that which is missing, vid., [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036.md) and [Hab
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010.md).

[Proverbs 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 20:3</span></span>

3 It is an honour to a man to remain far from strife;

But every fool showeth his teeth.

Or better: whoever is a fool quisquis amens, for the emphasis does not
lie on this, that every fool, i.e., every single one of this sort,
contends to the uttermost; but that whoever is only always a fool finds
pleasure in such strife. Regarding התגּלּע, vid., [Pro
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#014.md); [Pro
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001.md). On the contrary, it is an honour
to a man to be peaceable, or, as it is here expressed, to remain far
from strife. The phrase may be translated: to desist from strife; but in
this case the word would be pointed שׁבת, which Hitzig prefers; for שׁבת
from שׁבת means, [Sa2 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#007.md),
annihilation (the termination of existence); also [Exo
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#019.md), שׁבתּו does not mean to be
keeping holy day; but to be sitting, viz., at home, in a state of
incapability for work. Rightly Fleischer: "ישׁב מן, like Arab. ḳ'ad ṣan,
to remain sitting quiet, and thus to hold oneself removed from any kind
of activity." He who is prudent, and cares for his honour, not only
breaks off strife when it threatens to become passionate, but does not
at all enter into it, keeps himself far removed from it.

[Proverbs 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 20:4</span></span>

4 At the beginning of the harvest the sluggard plougheth not;

And so when he cometh to the reaping-time there is nothing.

Many translators (Symmachus, Jerome, Luther) and interpreters (e.g.,
Rashi, Zckler) explain: propter frigus; but חרף is, according to its
verbal import, not a synon. of קר and צנּה, but means gathering = the
time of gathering (synon. אסיף), from חרף, carpere,

(Note: Vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterbuch, i. 426.)

as harvest, the time of the καρπίζειν, the plucking off of the fruit;
but the harvest is the beginning of the old Eastern agricultural year,
for in Palestine and Syria the time of ploughing and sowing with the
harvest or early rains (חריף = יורה, [Neh
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#024.md); [Ezr
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#018).md) followed the fruit harvest from
October to December. The מן is thus not that of cause but of time. Thus
rendered, it may mean the beginning of an event and onwards (e.g., [Sa1
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#025).md), as well as its termination and
onwards ([Lev 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#017).md): here of the
harvest and its ingathering and onwards. In 4b, the Chethı̂b and Kerı̂
vary as at [Pro 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017.md). The fut. ישׁאל
would denote what stands before the sluggard; the perf. שׁאלו places him
in the midst of this, and besides has this in its favour, that,
interpreted as perf. hypotheticum, it makes the absence of an object to
שׁאל more tenable. The Chethı̂b, ושׁאל, is not to be read after [Psa
109:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#010.md) : he will beg in harvest - in
vain (Jerome, Luther), to which Hitzig well remarks: Why in vain? Amid
the joy of harvest people dispense most liberally; and the right time
for begging comes later. Hitzig conjecturally arrives at the
translation:

"A pannier the sluggard provideth not;

Seeketh to borrow in harvest, and nothing cometh of it."

But leaving out of view the "pannier," the meaning "to obtain something
as a loan," which שׁאל from the connection may bear, is here altogether
imaginary. Let one imagine to himself an indolent owner of land, who
does not trouble himself about the filling and sowing of his fields at
the right time and with diligence, but leaves this to his people, who do
only as much as is commanded them: such an one asks, when now the
harvest-time has come, about the ingathering; but he receives the
answer, that the land has lain unploughed, because he had not commanded
it to be ploughed. When he asks, there is nothing, he asks in vain
(ואין, as at [Pro 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006.md); [Pro
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004).md). Meri rightly explains מחרף by
מתחלת זמן החרישׁה, and 4b by: "so then, when he asks at harvest time, he
will find nothing;" on the other hand, the lxx and Aram. think on חרף,
carpere conviciis, as also in Codd. here and there is found the
meaningless מחרף.

[Proverbs 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 20:5</span></span>

5 The purpose in the heart of a man is deep water;

But a man of understanding draweth it out.

"Still waters are deep." Like such deep waters ([Pro
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#004).md) is that which a man hath
secretly ([Isa 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015).md) planned in his
heart. He keeps it secret, conceals it carefully, craftily misleads
those who seek to draw it out; but the man of תּבוּנה, i.e., one who
possesses the right criteria for distinguishing between good and bad,
true and false, and at the same time has the capacity to look through
men and things, draws out (the Venet. well, ἀνέλξει) the secret עצה, for
he penetrates to the bottom of the deep water. Such an one does not
deceive himself with men, he knows how to estimate their conduct
according to its last underlying motive and aim; and if the purpose is
one that is pernicious to him, he meets it in the process of
realization. What is here said is applicable not only to the subtle
statesman and the general, but also the pragmatical historian and the
expositor, as, e.g., of a poem such as the book of Job, the idea of
which lies like a pearl at the bottom of deep water.

[Proverbs 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 20:6</span></span>

6 Almost every one meeteth a man who is gracious to him;

But a man who standeth the test, who findeth such a one?

As ציר אמונים, [Pro 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017.md), signifies a
messenger in whom there is confidence, and עד אמונים, [Pro
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005.md), a witness who is altogether
truthful, so אישׁ אמוּנים is a man who remains true to himself, and
maintains fidelity toward others. Such an one it is not easy to find;
but patrons who make promises and awaken expectations, finally to leave
in the lurch him who depends on them - of such there are many. This
contrast would proceed from 6a also, if we took קרא in the sense of to
call, to call or cry out with ostentation: multi homines sunt quorum
suam quisque humanitatem proclamat (Schelling, Fleischer, Ewald, Zckler,
and also, e.g., Meri). But אישׁ חסדּו is certainly to be interpreted
after [Pro 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#017.md), [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md). Recognising this, Hitzig
translates: many a man one names his dear friend; but in point of style
this would be as unsuitable as possible. Must יקרא then mean vocat? A
more appropriate parallel word to מצא is קרא = קרה, according to which,
with Oetinger, Heidenheim, Euchel, and Lwenstein, we explain: the
greater part of men meet one who shows himself to them (to this or that
man) as אישׁ חסד, a man well-affectioned and benevolent; but it is rare
to find one who in his affection and its fruits proves himself to be
true, and actually performs that which was hoped for from him. Luther
translates, with the Syr. and Targ. after Jerome: Viel Menschen werden
From gerhmbt \[many men are reputed pious\]; but if יקרא were equivalent
to יקּרא, then אישׁ חסד ought to have been used instead of אישׁ חסדו.
The lxx read רב אדם יקר אישׁ חסד, man is something great, and a
compassionate man is something precious; but it costs trouble to find
out a true man. The fundamental thought remains almost the same in all
these interpretations and readings: love is plentiful; fidelity, rare;
therefore חסד, of the right kind, after the image of God, is joined to
אמת.

[Proverbs 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 20:7</span></span>

7 He who in his innocence walketh as one upright,

Blessed are his children after him!

We may not take the first line as a separate clause with צדּיק, as
subject (Van Dyk, Elster) or predicate (Targ.); for, thus rendered, it
does not appropriately fall in as parallel to the second line, because
containing nothing of promise, and the second line would then strike in
at least not so unconnectedly (cf. on the contrary, [Pro
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009.md); [Pro
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025).md). We have before us a
substantival clause, of which the first line is the complex subject. But
Jerome, the Venet., and Luther erroneously: the just man walking in his
innocence; this placing first of the adj. is in opposition to the Hebr.
syntax. We must, if the whole is to be interpreted as nom., regard צדיק
as permutative: one walking in his innocence, a righteous one. But,
without doubt, tsedek is the accus. of the manner; in the manner of one
righteous, or in apposition: as one righteous; cf. [Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md) with [Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md). Thus Hitzig rightly also refers
to these two passages, and Ewald also refers to [Pro
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#011.md); [Pro
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#015.md). To walk in his innocence as a
righteous man, is equivalent to always to do that which is right,
without laying claim to any distinction or making any boast on that
account; for thereby one only follows the impulse and the direction of
his heart, which shows itself and can show itself not otherwise than in
unreserved devotion to God and to that which is good. The children after
him are not the children after his death ([Gen
24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067).md); but, according to [Deu
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040.md), cf. [Job
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#021.md), those who follow his example,
and thus those who come after him; for already in the lifetime of such
an one, the benediction begins to have its fulfilment in his children.

[Proverbs 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 20:8</span></span>

The following group begins with a royal proverb, which expresses what a
king does with his eyes. Two proverbs, of the seeing eye and the
necessary opening of the eyes, close it.

8 A king sitting on the seat of justice,

Scattereth asunder all evil with his eyes.

Excellently the Venet. ἐπὶ θρόνου δίκης, for כּסּא־דין is the name of
the seat of rectitude (the tribunal), as the "throne of grace," Heb.
4:17, is the name of the capporeth as the seat of mercy; the seat of the
judge is merely called כסא; on the other hand, כסא־דין is the contrast
of כּסּא הוּות fo, [Psa 94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020.md) : the
seat from which the decision that is in conformity with what is right
(cf. e.g., [Jer 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028).md) goes forth, and
where it is sought. As little here as at [Pro
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026.md) is there need for a
characterizing adj. to melek; but the lxx hits the meaning for it,
understands such to דין: ὅταν βασιλεὺς δίκαιος καθίσῃ ἐπὶ θρόνου. By the
"eyes" are we then to understand those of the mind: he sifts, dignoscit,
with the eyes of the mind all that is evil, i.e., distinguishes it
subjectively from that which is not evil? Thus Hitzig by a comparison of
[Psa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004.md); [Psa
139:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#003.md) (where Jerome has eventilasti,
the Vulg. investigasti). Scarcely correctly, for it lies nearer to think
on the eyes in the king's head (vid., [Pro
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015).md); in that case: to winnow (to
sift) means to separate the good and the bad, but first mediately: to
exclude the bad; finally, [Pro 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026.md)
leads to the conclusion that מזרה is to be understood, not of a
subjective, but of an actual scattering, or separating, or driving away.
Thus the penetrating, fear-inspiring eyes of the king are meant, as
Immanuel explains: בראיית עיניו מבריחם מפניו ומפזר אותם בכל פיאה. But in
this explanation the personal rendering of כּל־רע is incorrect; for
mezareh, meant of the driving asunder of persons, requires as its object
a plur. (cf. 26a). Col-ra is understood as neut. like [Pro
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#014.md). Before the look of a king to
whom it belongs to execute righteousness and justice ([Isa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#005).md), nothing evil stands; criminal
acts and devices seen through, and so also judged by these eyes, are
broken up and scattered to all the winds, along with the danger that
thereby threatened the community. It is the command: "put away the evil"
([Deu 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006) \[5\].md), which the king
carries into effect by the powerful influence of his look. With col-ra
there is connected the thought that in the presence of the heavenly King
no one is wholly free from sin.

[Proverbs 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 20:9</span></span>

9 Who can say I have made my heart clean,

I am pure from my sins?

It is the same thought that Solomon expresses in his prayer at the
consecration of the temple, [Kg1 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046.md)
: there is no man who sinneth not. To cleanse his heart (as [Psa
73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013).md), is equivalent to to empty it,
by self-examination and earnest effort after holiness, of all impure
motives and inclinations; vid., regarding זכה, to be piercing, shining
brightly, cloudlessly pure, Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterbuch, i.
424. The consequence of זכּות is, becoming pure; and the consequence of
זכּות לב, i.e., of the purifying of the heart, the being pure from
sinful conduct: I have become pure from my sins, i.e., from such as I
might fall into by not resisting temptations; the suffix is not
understood as actual, but as potential, like [Psa
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024.md). No one can boast of this, for
man's knowledge of himself and of his sins remains always limited ([Jer
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009.md).; [Psa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013).md); and sin is so deeply rooted in
his nature ([Job 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004.md); [Job
15:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014).md), that the remains of a
sinful tendency always still conceal themselves in the folds of his
heart, sinful thoughts still cross his soul, sinful inclinations still
sometimes by their natural force overcome the moral resistance that
opposes them, and stains of all kinds still defile even his best
actions.

[Proverbs 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 20:10</span></span>

This proverb passes sentence of condemnation against gross sins in
action and life.

Diverse stones, diverse measures -

An abomination to Jahve are they both.

The stones are, as at [Pro 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001.md); [Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011.md), those used as weights. Stone
and stone, ephah and ephah, means that they are of diverse kinds, one
large and one small (the lxx, in which the sequence of the proverbs from
[Pro 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010.md) is different, has μέγα καὶ
μικρόν), so that one may be able deceitfully to substitute the one for
the other. איפה (from אפה, to bake) may originally have been used to
designate such a quantity of meal as supplied a family of moderate
wants; it corresponds to the bath ([Eze
45:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#011).md) as a measure for fluids, and
stands here synecdochically instead of all the measures, including,
e.g., the cor, of which the ephah was a tenth part, and the seah, which
was a third part of it. 10b = [Pro
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md), an echo of [Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036.md); [Deu
25:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013.md). Just and equal measure is
the demand of a holy God; the contrary is to Him an abhorrence.

[Proverbs 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 20:11</span></span>

11 Even a child maketh himself known by his conduct,

Whether his dispostion be pure and whether it be right.

If מעלל may be here understood after the use of עולל, to play, to pass
the time with anything, then גּם neht refers thereto: even by his play
(Ewald). But granting that מעולל \[children\], synon. with נער, had
occasioned the choice of the word מעלל (vid., Fleischer on [Isa
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#004).md), yet this word never means
anything else than work, an undertaking of something, and accomplishing
it; wherefore Bttcher proposes מעוּליו, for מעלוּל may have meant play,
in contradistinction to מעלל ot noitcni. This is possible, but
conjectural. Thus gam is not taken along with b'amalalav. That the child
also makes himself known by his actions, is an awkward thought; for if
in anything else, in these he must show what one has to expect from him.
Thus gam is after the syntactical method spoken of at [Pro
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026.md); [Pro
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002.md), to be referred to נער (also the
child, even the child), although in this order it is referred to the
whole clause. The verb נכר is, from its fundamental thought, to
perceive, observe from an ἐναντιόσημον: to know, and to know as strange,
to disown (vid., under [Isa 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009).md); the
Hithpa. elsewhere signifies, like (Arab.) tankkar, to make oneself
unknowable, but here to make oneself knowable; Symmachus,
ἐπιγνωρισθήσεται, Venet. γνωσθήσεται. Or does the proverb mean: even the
child dissembles in his actions (Oetinger)? Certainly not, for that
would be a statement which, thus generally made, is not justified by
experience. We must then interpret 11b as a direct question, though it
has the form of an indirect one: he gives himself to be known, viz.,
whether his disposition be pure and right. That one may recognise his
actions in the conduct of any one, is a platitude; also that one may
recognise his conduct in these, is not much better. פּעל is therefore
referred by Hitzig to God as the Creator, and he interprets it in the
sense of the Arab. khulk, being created = natura. We also in this way
explain יצרנוּ, [Psa 103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md), as
referable to God the יצר; and that poal occurs, e.g., [Isa
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#031.md), not merely in the sense of
action, but also in that of performance or structure, is favourable to
this interpretation. But one would think that poal, if thus used in the
sense of the nature of man, would have more frequently occurred. It
everywhere else means action or work. And thus it is perhaps also here
used to denote action, but regarded as habitual conduct, and according
to the root-meaning, moral disposition. The N.T. word ἕργον approaches
this idea in such passages as [Gal
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004.md). It is less probable that 11b is
understood with reference to the future (Luther and others); for in that
case one does not see why the poet did not make use of the more
intelligible phrase אם זך וישׁר יהיה פעלו. It is like our (Germ.)
proverb: Was ein Haken werden will krmmt sick bald what means to become
a hook bends itself early; or: Was ein Drnchen werden will spitzt sich
bei Zeiten

(Note: A similar comparison from Bereschith Rabba, vid., Duke's Rabbin.
Blumenlese, p. 126.)

\[what means to become a thorn sharpens itself early\], and to the Aram.
בוצין בוצין מקטפיה ידיע = that which will become a gourd shows itself in
the bud, Berachoth 48a.

[Proverbs 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 20:12</span></span>

12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye -

Jahve hath created them both.

Lwenstein, like the lxx: the ear hears and the eye sees - it is enough
to refer to the contrary to [Pro 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010.md)
and [Pro 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#015.md). In itself the proverb
affirms a fact, and that is its sensus simplex; but besides, this fact
may be seen from many points of view, and it has many consequences, none
of which is to be rejected as contrary to the meaning: (1.) It lies
nearest to draw the conclusion, vi eminentiae, which is drawn in [Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009.md). God is thus the All-hearing and
the All-seeing, from which, on the one side, the consolation arises that
everything that is seen stands under His protection and government, [Pro
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003.md); and on the other side, the
warning, Aboth ii. 1: "Know what is above thee; a Seeing eye and a
Hearing ear, and all thy conduct is marked in His book." (2.) With this
also is connected the sense arising out of the combination in [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md) : man ought then to use the ear
and the eye in conformity with the design which they are intended to
subserve, according to the purpose of the Creator (Hitzig compares [Pro
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004).md); it is not first applicable to
man with reference to the natural, but to the moral life: he shall not
make himself deaf and blind to that which it is his duty to hear and to
see; but he ought also not to hear and to see with pleasure that from
which he should turn away ([Isa 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015).md)
- in all his hearing and seeing he is responsible to the Creator of the
ear and the eye. (3.) One may thus interpret "hearing" and "seeing" as
commendable properties, as Fleischer suggests from comparison of [Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011.md) : an ear that truly hears (the
word of God and the lessons of Wisdom) and an eye that truly sees (the
works of God) are a gift of the Creator, and are (Arab.) lillhi, are to
be held as high and precious. Thus the proverb, like a polished gem, may
be turned now in one direction and now in another; it is to be regarded
as a many-sided fact.

[Proverbs 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 20:13</span></span>

13 Love not sleep, lest thou become poor;

Open thine eyes, and have enough to eat.

What is comprehended in the first line here is presented in detail in
[Pro 6:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#009.md). The fut. Niph. of רוּשׁ,
to become poor (cf. [Pro 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004).md), is
formed metaplastically from ירשׁ, [Pro
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#021.md); [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md), as at [Sa1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#007); Hitzig compares (Arab..md) ryth,
which, however, means to loiter or delay, not to come back or down. The
R. רש signifies either to be slack without support (cf. דּל), or to
desire (cf. אבון, Arab. fkyr, properly hiscens, R. פק, as in פקח, to
open widely, which here follows). Regarding the second imper. 13b, vid.,
[Pro 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004.md) : it has the force of a
consequence, Las deine augen wacker sein, So wirstu brots gnug haben
(Luth.) \[Let thine eyes be open, so shalt thou have bread enough\].
With these two proverbs of the eyes, the group beginning with [Pro
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008.md) rounds itself off.

[Proverbs 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 20:14</span></span>

The following group has its natural limit at the new point of departure
at [Pro 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#020.md), and is internally
connected in a diversity of ways.

14 "Bad, bad!" saith the buyer;

And going his way, he boasteth then.

Luther otherwise:

"Bad, bad!" saith one if he hath it;

But when it is gone, then he boasteth of it.

This rendering has many supporters. Geier cites the words of the Latin
poet:

"Omne bonum praesens minus est, sperata videntur Magna."

Schultens quotes the proverbs τὸ παρὸν βαρύ and Praesentia laudato, for
with Luther he refers ואזל לו to the present possession (אזל, as [Sa1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007) = (Arab..md) zâl, to cease, to be
lost), and translates: at dilapsum sibi, tum demum pro splendido
celebrat. But by this the Hithpa. does not receive its full meaning; and
to extract from הקּונה the idea to which ואזל לו refers, if not
unnecessary, is certainly worthless. Hakkoneh may also certainly mean
the possessor, but the possessor by acquisition (lxx and the Venet. ὁ
κτώμενος); for the most part it signifies the possessor by purchase, the
buyer (Jerome, emptor), as correlate of מכר, [Isa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002.md); [Eze
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#012.md). It is customary for the buyer to
undervalue that which he seeks to purchase, so as to obtain it as
cheaply as possible; afterwards he boasts that he has bought that which
is good, and yet so cheap. That is an every-day experience; but the
proverb indirectly warns against conventional lying, and shows that one
should not be startled and deceived thereby. The subject to ואזל לו is
thus the buyer; אזל with לו denotes, more definitely even than הלך לו,
going from thence, s'en aller. Syntactically, the punctuation ואזל לו
\[and he takes himself off\] (perf. hypoth., Ewald, 357a) would have
been near (Jerome: et cum recesserit); but yet it is not necessary, with
Hitzig, thus to correct it. The poet means to say: making himself off,
he then boasts. We cannot in German place the "alsdann" \[then\] as the
אז here, and as also, e.g., at [Sa1
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#012.md); but Theodotion, in good Greek:
καὶ πορευθεὶς τότε καυχήσεται. We may write ואזל לו with Mercha on the
antepenult, on which the accent is thrown back, cf. חונן, [Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017.md), but not לּו; for the rule for
Dagesh does not here, with the retrogression of the tone, come into
application, as, e.g., in אוכל לּחמי, [Psa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010.md). Singularly the Syr. and Targ.
do not read רע רע, but רע לרע, and couple [Pro
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#015.md) with 14. In the lxx, [Pro
20:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#014.md) are wanting.

[Proverbs 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 20:15</span></span>

15 There is indeed gold, and many pearls;

But a precious treasure are lips full of knowledge.

In order to find a connection between this proverb and that which
precedes, we need only be reminded of the parable of the merchantman who
sought goodly pearls, [Mat 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#045.md). The
proverb rises to a climax: there is gold, and there are pearls in
abundance, the one of which has always a higher value than the other;
but intelligent lips are above all such jewels - they are a precious
treasure, which gold and all pearls cannot equal. In a similar manner
the N.T. places the one pearl above the many goodly pearls. So might דעת
(chokma) be called the pearl above all pearls ([Pro
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md); [Pro
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#011).md); but the lips as the organ of
knowledge are fittingly compared with a precious vessel, a vessel of
more precious substance than gold and pearls are.

[Proverbs 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 20:16</span></span>

16 Take from him the garment, for he hath become surety for another;

And for strangers take him as a pledge.

The same proverb [Pro 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#013.md), where קח,
with the usual aphaeresis, here interchanges with it the fuller form
לקח, which is also found at [Eze
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016.md). To this imperative חבלהוּ is
parallel: take him as a pledge (Theodotion, Jerome, the Venet. and
Luther); it is not a substantive: his pledge (Targ.), which would
require the word חבלתו (חבלו); nor is it to be read with the Syr.
חבלהוּ, one pledges him; but it is imperative, not however of the Piel,
which would be חבלהוּ, and would mean "destroy him;" but, as Aben Ezra
rightly, the imperative of Kal of חבל, to take as a pledge, [Exo
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md), for חבלהוּ without any example
indeed except חננני, [Psa 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014.md); cf.
[Psa 80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md). The first line is clear:
take his garment, for he has become good for another (cf. [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015).md), who has left him in the lurch,
so that he must now become wise by experience. The second line also is
intelligible if we read, according to the Chethı̂b, נכרים (Jerome, the
Venet.), not נכריּם, as Schultens incorrectly points it, and if we
interpret this plur. like בנים, [Gen
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007.md), with Hitzig following Luther, as
plur. of the category: take him as a pledge, hold fast by his person, so
as not to suffer injury from strange people for whom he has become
surety. But the Kerı̂ requires נכריּה (according to which Theodotion and
the Syr., and, more distinctly still than these, the Targ. translates),
and thus, indeed, it stands written, [Pro
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#013.md), without the Kerı̂, thus Bathra
173b reads and writes also here. Either נכריּה is a strange woman, a
prostitute, a maitresse for whom the unwise has made himself surety, or
it is neut. for aliena res (lxx [Pro
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#013), τὰ ἀλλότρια.md), a matter not
properly belonging to this unwise person. We regard נכרים in this
passage as original. בעד coincides with [Pro
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#026.md) : it does not mean ἀντὶ, but
ὑπέρ; "for strange people" is here equivalent to for the sake of, on
account of strange people" is here equivalent to for the sake of, on
account of strange people (χάριν τῶν ἀλλοτρίων, as the Venet. translates
it).

[Proverbs 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 20:17</span></span>

17 Sweet to a man is the bread of deceit;

Yet at last his mouth is full of gravel.

"Bread of deceit" is not deceit itself, as that after which the desire
of a man goes forth, and that for which he has a relish (thus, e.g.,
Immanuel and Hitzig); but that which is not gained by labour, and is not
merited. Possession (vid., [Pro 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#017).md)
or enjoyment ([Pro 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#017).md) obtained by
deceit is thus called, as לחם כּזבים, [Pro
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#003.md), denotes bread; but for him who
has a relish for it, it is connected with deceit. Such bread of lies is
sweet to a man, because it has come to him without effort, but in the
end not only will he have nothing to eat, but his tongue, teeth, and
mouth will be injured by small stones; i.e., in the end he will have
nothing, and there will remain to him only evil (Fleischer). Or: it
changes itself ([Job 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#014).md) at last
into gravel, of which his mouth is filled full, as we might say, "it
lies at last in his stomach like lead." חצץ is the Arab. ḥaṭny, gravel
(Hitzig, grien = gries, coarse sand, grit), R. חץ, scindere. Similarly
in Arab. ḥajar, a stone, is used as the image of disappointed
expectations, e.g., the adulterer finds a stone, i.e., experiences
disappointment.

[Proverbs 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 20:18</span></span>

18 Plans are established by counsel,

And with prudent government make war.

From the conception of a thought, practically influencing the formation
of our own life and the life of the community, to its accomplishment
there is always a long way which does not lead to the end unless one
goes forward with counsel and strength combined, and considers all means
and eventualities. The Niph. of כּוּן means, in a passive sense: to be
accomplished or realized ([Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002).md).
The clause 18a is true for times of war as well as for times of peace;
war is disastrous, unless it is directed with strategic skill (vid.,
regarding תּחבּות, [Pro 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005).md). Grotius
compares the proverb, Γνῶμαι πλέον δρατοῦσιν ἢ σθένος χειρῶν. In [Pro
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#006.md), the necessity of counsel is also
referred to the case of war. Ewald would read \[the infin.\] עשׂה, or
עשׂה: with management it is that one carries on war. But why? Because to
him the challenge to carry on war appears to be contrary to the spirit
of proverbial poetry. But the author of the proverb does certainly mean:
if thou hast to carry on war, carry it on with the skill of a general;
and the imper. is protected by [Pro
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#006.md) against that infin., which is,
besides, stylistically incongruous.

[Proverbs 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 20:19</span></span>

19 He that goeth out gossiping revealeth a secret;

And the babbler have nothing to do.

Luther otherwise (like Hitzig) -

Be not complicated with him who revealeth a secret,

And with the slanderer, and with the false (better: loquacious) mouth,

so that ל and the warning apply to the threefold description, a
rendering which Kimchi also, and Immanuel, and others at least suggest.
But in connection with [Pro 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#013.md), the
first line has the force of a judicium, which includes the warning to
entrust nothing to a babbler which ought to be kept silent. Write גּולה
סּוד, as found in Codd. and old Edd., with Munach on the penultima, on
which the tone is thrown back, and Dagesh to ס, after the rule of the
דחיק (Gesen. 20, 2a), altogether like קונה לב, [Pro
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#032.md). 19b the Venet. translates after
the first meaning of the word by Kimchi, τῷ ἀπαταιῶνι τοῖς χείλεσι, to
him who slanders and befools, for it thus improves Theodotion's τῷ
ἀπατῶντι τὰ χείλη αὐτοῦ. But פּתה means, [Job
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#002.md) - cf. [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md) - not him who befools another,
but him who is befooled, is slandered, by another (Aben Ezra: שׁיפתוהו
אחרים), with which שׂפתיו here does not agree. But now he who is easily
befooled is called פּתה, as being open to influence (susceptible),
patens; and if this particip. is used, as here, transitively, and, on
account of the object שׂפתיו standing near cannot possibly be equivalent
to מפתּה, the usage of the language also just noticed is against it,
then it means patefaciens or dilatans (cf. הפתּה, [Gen
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027), Targ. אפתּי = הרחיב.md), and places
itself as synon. to פשׂק, [Pro 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#003.md);
thus one is called who does not close his mouth, who cannot hold his
mouth, who always idly babbles, and is therefore, because he can keep
nothing to himself, a dangerous companion. The Complut. rightly
translates: μετὰ πλατύνοντος τὰ ἑαυτοῦ μὴ μίχθητι χείλη.

[Proverbs 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 20:20</span></span>

The following group begins, for once more the aim of this older Book of
Proverbs becomes prominent, with an inculcation of the fourth

(Note: i.e., The fifth according to the arrangement of the Westminster
Confession.)

commandment.

20 He that curseth his father and his mother,

His light is extinguished in midnight darkness.

The divine law, [Exo 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017.md); [Lev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009.md), condemns such an one to death.
But the proverb does not mean this sentence against the criminal, which
may only seldom be carried into execution, but the fearful end which,
because of the righteousness of God ruling in history, terminates the
life of such an unnatural son ([Pro
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017).md). Of the godless, it has already
been said that their light is extinguished, [Pro
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009.md), there is suddenly an end to all
that brightened, i.e., made happy and embellished their life; but he who
acts wickedly (קלּל, R. קל, levem esse, synon. הקלה, [Deu
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#016).md), even to the cursing of his
father and mother, will see himself surrounded by midnight darkness
(Symmachus, σκοτομήνῃ, moonless night), not: he will see himself in the
greatest need, forsaken by divine protection (Fleischer), for Jansen
rightly: Lux et lucerna in scripturis et vitae claritatem et
posteritatem et prosperitatem significat. The apple of the eye, אישׁון,
of darkness (vid., [Pro 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#009).md), is that
which forms the centre of centralization of darkness. The Syr. renders
it correctly by bobtho, pupil of the eye, but the Targ. retains the
אשׁוּן of the Kerı̂, and renders it in Aram. by אתוּן, which Rashi
regards as an infin., Parchon as a particip. after the form ערוּך; but
it may be also an infin. substantive after the form עזוּז, and is
certainly nothing else than the abbreviated and vocally obscured אישׁון.
For the Talm. אשׁן, to be hard, furnishes no suitable idea; and the same
holds true of אשׁוּני, times, [Lev
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#025.md) of the Jerusalem Targ.; while
the same abbreviation and the same passing over of o into u represents
this as the inflected אישׁון (= עת). There is also no evidence for a
verb אשׁן, to be black, dark; the author of Aruch interprets אשׁונא,
Bereschith Rabba, c. 33, with reference to the passage before us, of a
dark bathing apartment, but only tentatively, and אישׁון is there quoted
as the Targ. of צל, [Gen 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008.md), which
the text lying before us does not ratify. Ishon means the little man (in
the eye), and neither the blackness (Buxtorf and others) nor the point
of strength, the central point (Levy) of the eye.

(Note: Vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterbuch, i. 419.)

[Proverbs 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 20:21</span></span>

21 An inheritance which in the beginning is obtained in haste,

Its end will not be blessed.

The partic. מבחל may, after [Zac 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#008.md),
cf. Syr. bhlaa', nauseans, mean "detested," but that affords here no
sense; rather it might be interpreted after the Arab. bajila, to be
avaricious, "gotten by avarice, niggardliness," with which, however,
neither נחלה, inheritance, nor, since avarice is a chronic disease,
בּראשׁונה agrees. On the contrary, the Kerı̂ מבהלת \[hastened\] perfectly
agrees, both linguistically (vid., [Pro
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022.md); cf. [Pro
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#011).md) and actually; for, as Hitzig
remarks, the words following [Pro
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#020.md) fully harmonize with the idea of
an inheritance, into the possession of which one is put before it is
rightly due to him; for a son such as that, the parents may live too
long, and so he violently deprives them of the possession (cf. [Pro
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026).md); but on such a possession there
rests no blessing. Since the Piel may mean to hasten, [Est
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#009.md), so מבהל may mean hastened =
speedy, [Est 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#014.md), as well as made in
haste. All the old interpreters adopt the Kerı̂; the Aram. render it well
by מסרהבא, from מסרהב, overturned; and Luther, like Jerome, haereditas
ad quam festinatur.

[Proverbs 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 20:22</span></span>

22 Say not: I will avenge the evil;

Hope in Jahve, so will He help thee.

Men ought always to act toward their neighbours according to the law of
love, and not according to the jus talionis, [Pro
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#029.md); they ought not only, by
requiting good with evil ([Pro 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#013.md);
[Psa 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005.md), [Psa
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012).md), not to transgress this law of
requital, but they ought to surpass it, by also recompensing not evil
with evil (vid., regarding שׁלּם, and synon. to [Pro
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#013).md); and that is what the proverb
means, for 22b supposes injustice suffered, which might stir up a spirit
of revenge. It does not, however, say that men ought to commit the
taking of vengeance to God; but, in the sense of [Rom
12:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017.md); [Pe1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009.md), that, renouncing all dependence
on self, they ought to commit their deliverance out of the distress into
which they have fallen, and their vindication, into the hands of God;
for the promise is not that He will avenge them, but that He will help
them. The jussive וישׁע (write וישׁע, according to Metheg-setzung, 42,
with Gaja as העמדה, with the ע to secure distinct utterance to the final
guttural) states as a consequence, like, e.g., [Kg2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010.md), what will then happen (Jerome,
Luther, Hitzig) if one lets God rule (Gesen. 128, 2c); equally possible,
syntactically, is the rendering: that He may help thee (lxx, Ewald);
but, regarded as a promise, the words are more in accordance with the
spirit of the proverb, and they round it off more expressively.

are not good, much rather bad and pernicious, for the deceiver succeeds
only in appearance; in reality he fails.

[Proverbs 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 20:24</span></span>

24 The steps of a man depend on Jahve;

And a man - how can he understand his way?

Line first is from [Psa 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023.md), but
there, where the clause has the verbal predicate כּוננוּ, the meaning is
that it is the gracious assistance of God, by virtue of which a man
takes certain steps with his feet, while here we have before us a
variation of the proverb "der Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt" = man proposes,
God disposes, [Pro 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009.md), [Jer
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023.md); for מן, as at [Sa2
3:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#037.md); [Psa
118:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#023.md), denotes God in general as
conditioning, as the ultimate cause. Man is indeed free to turn himself
hither or thither, to decide on this course of conduct or on that, and
is therefore responsible for it; but the relations co-operating in all
his steps as the possible and defining conditions are God's contrivance
and guidance, and the consequences which are connected with his steps
and flow therefrom, lie beyond the power of man - every one of his steps
is a link of a chain, neither the beginning nor the end of which he can
see; while, on the other hand, God's knowledge comprehends the
beginning, middle, and end, and the wisdom of God ruling in the sphere
of history, makes all human activity, the free action of man,
subservient to his world-plan. The question, which has a negative
answer, is applicable to man: what, i.e., how shall he understand his
way? מה is like, e.g., [Exo 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#026.md);
[Job 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002.md); [Job
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#028.md), accus., and fluctuates between
the functions of a governed accusative: What does he understand... ([Job
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#008).md) and an adv.: how, i.e., how so
little, how even not, for it is the מה of the negative question which
has become in (Arab.) mâ a word of negation. The way of a man is his
life's-course. This he understands in the present life only relatively,
the true unravelling of it remains for the future.

[Proverbs 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 20:25</span></span>

25 It is a snare to a man to cry out hastily "holy;"

And first after vows to investigate.

Two other interpretations of the first line have been proposed. The
snare of a man devours, i.e., destroys the holy; but then מוקשׁ אדם must
be an expression of an action, instead of an expression of an endurance,
which is impossible. The same is true against the explanation: the snare
of a man devours, i.e., consumes, eats up the holy, which as such is
withdrawn from common use. Jerome with his devotare sanctos, and Luther
with his das Heilige lestern \[to calumniate the holy\], give to לוּע =
בּלע a meaning which loses itself in the arbitrary. Accordingly, nothing
is to be done with the meaning καταπίεται (Aquila, the Venet.). But ילע
will be the abbreviated fut. of לוּע (from ילוּע), or לעע (ילע), [Job
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#003) = (Arab..md) laghâ temere loqui
(proloqui); and קדשׁ (after Hitzig: consecration, which is contrary to
usage) is like κορβᾶν, [Mar 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#011.md), the
exclamation to which one suddenly gives utterance, thereby meaning that
this or that among his possessions henceforth no longer belongs to him,
but is consecrated to God, and thus ought to be delivered up to the
temple. Such a sudden vow and halting deference to the oath that has
been uttered is a snare to a man, for he comes to know that he has
injured himself by the alienation of his property, which he has vowed
beyond that which was due from him, or that the fulfilling of his vow is
connected with difficulties, and perhaps also to others, with regard to
whom its disposal was not permitted to him, is of evil consequences, or
it may be he is overcome by repentance and is constrained to break his
oath. The lxx hits the true meaning of the proverb with rare success:
Παγὶς ἀνδρὶ ταχύ τι τῶν ἰδίων ἁγιάσαι, μετὰ δὲ τὸ εὔξασθαι μετανοεῖν
γίνεται. נדרים is plur. of the category (cf. 16b Chethı̂b), and בקּר, as
[Kg2 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015.md), Arab. baḳr, examinare,
inquirere, means to subject to investigation, viz., whether he ought to
observe, and might observe, a vow such as this, or whether he might not
and ought not rather to renounce it (Fleischer). Viewed syntactically,
25a is so difficult, that Bertheau, with Hitzig, punctuates ילע; but
this substantive must be formed from a verb ילע (cf. [Hab
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013).md), and this would mean, after
(Arab.) wala', "to long eagerly for," which is not suitable here. The
punctuation shows ילע as the 3rd fut. What interpreters here say of the
doubled accent of the word arises from ignorance: the correct
punctuation is ילע, with Gaja to ע, to give the final guttural more
force in utterance. The poet appears to place in the foreground: "a
snare for a man," as a rubrum; and then continuing the description, he
cries out suddenly "holy!" and after the vow, he proceeds to deliberate
upon it. Fleischer rightly: post vota inquisiturus est (in ea) = יהיה
לבקּר; vid., at [Hab 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017.md), which
passage Hitzig also compares as syntactically very closely related.

[Proverbs 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 20:26</span></span>

26 A wise king winnoweth the godless,

And bringeth over them the wheel.

A variant to [Pro 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008.md), but here with
the following out of the figure of the winnowing. For אופן with מזרה is,
without doubt, the wheel of the threshing-cart, עגלה, [Isa
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027.md).; and thus with מזרה, the
winnowing fork, מזרה is to be thought of; vid., a description of them
along with that of the winnowing shovel, רחת, in Wetzstein's Excursus to
Isa., p. 707ff. We are not to think of the punishment of the wheel,
which occurs only as a terrible custom of war (e.g., [Amo
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003).md). It is only meant that a wise
king, by sharp and vigorous procedure, separates the godless, and
immediately visits them with merited punishment, as he who works with
the winnowing shovel gives the chaff to the wind. Most ancient
interpreters think on אופן (from אפן, vertere) in its metaphorical
meaning: τρόπος (thus also Lwenstein, he deals with them according to
merit), or the wheel of fortune, with reference to the constellations;
thus, misfortune (Immanuel, Meri). Arama, Oetinger, and others are,
however, on the right track.

[Proverbs 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 20:27</span></span>

With a proverb of a light that was extinguished, [Pro
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#020.md) began the group; the proverb of
God's light, which here follows, we take as the beginning of a new
group.

27 A candle of Jahve is the soul of man,

Searching through all the chambers of the heart.

If the O.T. language has a separate word to denote the self-conscious
personal human spirit in contradistinction to the spirit of a beast,
this word, according to the usage of the language, as Reuchlin, in an
appendix to Aben Ezra, remarks, is נשׁמה; it is so called as the
principle of life breathed immediately by God into the body (vid., at
[Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md); [Gen
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#022).md). Indeed, that which is here said
of the human spirit would not be said of the spirit of a beast: it is
"the mystery of self-consciousness which is here figuratively
represented" (Elster). The proverb intentionally does not use the word
נפשׁ, for this is not the power of self-consciousness in man, but the
medium of bodily life; it is related secondarily to nshmh (רוח), while
נשׁמת חיים (רוח) is used, נפשׁ חיים is an expression unheard of. Hitzig
is in error when he understands by נשׁמה here the soul in
contradistinction to the spirit, and in support of this appeals to an
expression in the Cosmography of Kazwni: "the soul (Arab. âl-nefs) is
like the lamp which moves about in the chambers of the house;" here also
en-nefs is the self-conscious spirit, for the Arab. and post-bibl. Heb.
terminology influenced by philosophy reverses the biblical usage, and
calls the rational soul נפשׁ, and, on the contrary, the animal soul
נשׁמה, רוח (Psychologie, p. 154). חפשׂ is the particip. of חפּשׂ, [Zep
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012.md), without distinguishing the Kal
and Piel. Regarding חדרי־בטן, lxx ταμιεῖα κοιλίας, vid., at [Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md) : בּטן denotes the inner part of
the body (R. בט, to be deepened), and generally of the personality; cf.
Arab. bâtn âlrwh, the interior of the spirit, and [Pro
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#018.md), according to which Fleischer
explains: "A candle of Jahve, i.e., a means bestowed on man by God
Himself to search out the secrets deeply hid in the spirit of another."
But the candle which God has kindled in man has as the nearest sphere of
illumination, which goes forth from it, the condition of the man himself
- the spirit comprehends all that belongs to the nature of man in the
unity of self-consciousness, but yet more: it makes it the object of
reflection; it penetrates, searching it through, and seeks to take it up
into its knowledge, and recognises the problem proposed to it, to rule
it by its power. The proverb is thus to be ethically understood: the
spirit is that which penetrates that which is within, even into its many
secret corners and folds, with its self-testing and self-knowing light -
it is, after [Mat 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022.md), the inner
light, the inner eye. Man becomes known to himself according to his
moral as well as his natural condition in the light of the spirit; "for
what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in
him?" says Paul, [Co1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md). With
reference to this Solomonic proverb, the seven-branched candlestick is
an ancient symbol of the soul, e.g., on the Jewish sepulchral monuments
of the Roman vi Portuensis. Our texts present the phrase נר יהוה; but
the Talm. Pesachim 7b, 8a, the Pesikta in part 8, the Midrash Othijoth
de-Rabbi Akiba, under the letter נ, Alphasi (יף''ר) in Pesachim, and
others, read נר אלהים; and after this phrase the Targum translates,
while the Syr. and the other old versions render by the word "Lord"
(Venet. ὀντωτής), and thus had יהוה before them.

[Proverbs 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 20:28</span></span>

28 Love and truth guard the king;

And he supports his throne by love.

We have not in the German \[nor in the Eng.\] language a couple of words
that completely cover חסד ואמת; when they are used of God, we translate
them by grace and truth \[Gnade u. Wahrheit\], [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012) (יצּרוּני.md); when of men, by love
and truth \[Liebe u. Treue\], [Pro
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#006.md); and when of the two-sided divine
forces, by kindness and truth, [Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md). Love and truth are the two good
spirits that guard the king. If it is elsewhere said that the king's
throne is supported "with judgment and with justice," [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md) \[7\]; here, on the other side, we
see that the exercise of government must have love as its centre; he has
not only to act on the line of right, שׁוּרת הדּין; but, as the later
proverb says, in such a way, that within this circle his conduct is
determined by the central motive of love. In this sense we give the king
not only the title of Grossmchtigster \[most high and mighty\], but also
that of "Allergndigster" most gracious, for the king can and ought to
exercise grace before other men; the virtue of condescension establishes
his throne more than the might of greatness.

[Proverbs 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 20:29</span></span>

29 The ornament of young men is their strength;

And the honour of the old is grey hairs.

Youth has the name בּחוּר (different from בּחוּר, chosen), of the
maturity (R. בחר, cogn. בכר, בגר, whence Mishn. בּגרוּת, manhood, in
contradistinction to נערוּת) into which he enters from the bloom of
boyhood; and the old man is called זקן (Arab. dhikn, as Schultens says,
a mento pendulo, from the hanging chin זקן, (Arab.) dhakan, chin, beard
on the chin). To stand in the fulness of fresh unwasted strength is to
youth, as such, an ornament (תּפארת, cf. פּארוּר, blooming colour of the
countenance); on the contrary, to the old man who has spent his strength
in the duties of his office, or as it is said at [Pro
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#031.md), "in the way of righteousness,"
grey hairs (שׂיבה, from שׂב, Arab. shâb, canescere) give an honourable
appearance (הדר, from הדר, turgidum, amplum esse, vid., at [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 20:30</span></span>

30 Cutting wounds cleanse away evil,

And reach the inner parts of the body.

The two words for wounds in line first stand in the st. constr.; חבּוּרה
(from חבר, to be bound around with stripes, to be striped) is properly
the streak, the stripe; but is here heightened by פּצע (from פּצע, to
cleave, split, tear open), beyond the idea of the stripe-wound: tearing
open the flesh, cuts tearing into the flesh. The pred. is after the Kerı̂
תּמרוּק; but this substantive, found in the Book of Esther, where it
signifies the purification of the women for the harem (according to
which, e.g., Ahron B. Joseph explains כמו תמרוק לנשׁים שׁהוא יפה להם),
is syntactically hard, and scarcely original. For if we explain with
Kimchi: wounds of deep incision find their cleansing (cure) by evil,
i.e., by means which bring suffering (according to which, probably the
Venet. μώλωπες τραύματος λάμψουσιν ἐν κακῷ), then תמרוקן, with the
pronoun pointing back, one would have expected. But the interpretation
of בּרע, of severe means of cure, is constrained; that which lies
nearest, however, is to understand רע of evil. But if, with this
understanding of the word, we translate: Vibices plagarum sunt lustratio
quae adhibetur malo (Fleischer), one does not see why בּרע, and not
rather gen. רע, is used. But if we read after the Chethı̂b תּמריק, then
all is syntactically correct; for (1.) that the word ימריקוּ, or
תּמרקנה, is not used, is in accordance with a well-known rule, Gesen.
146. 3; and (2.) that המריק is connected, not directly with an accus.
obj., but with ב, has its analogy in התעה ב, [Jer
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002.md), השׁרישׁ בּ, [Job
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#012.md), and the like, and besides has
its special ground in the metaphorical character of the cleansing. Thus,
e.g., one uses Syr. 't'aa' of external misleading; but with Syr. k of
moral misleading (Ewald, 217, 2); and Arab. '\_ of erecting a building;
but with Arab. b of the intellectual erection of a memorial (monument).
It is the so-called Bâ̇âlmojâz; vid., de Sacy's Chrest Arab. i. 397. The
verb מרק means in Talm. also, "to take away" (a metaph. of abstergere;
cf. Arab. marak, to wipe off)

(Note: Vid., Dozy's Lettre M. Fleischer (1871), p. 198.)

and that meaning is adopted, Schabbath 33a, for the interpretations of
this proverb: stripes and wounds a preparedness for evil carries away,
and sorrow in the innermost part of the body, which is explained by
דרוקן (a disease appearing in diverse forms; cf. "Drachenschuss,"; as
the name of an animal disease); but granting that the biblical מרק may
bear this meaning, the ב remains unaccountable; for we say מרק עצמו
לעברה, for to prepare oneself for a transgression (sin of excess), and
not בעברה. We have thus to abide by the primary meaning, and to compare
the proverb, Berachoth 5a: "afflictive providences wash away all the
transgressions of a man." But the proverb before us means, first at
least, not the wounds which God inflicts, but those which human
educational energy inflicts: deep-cutting wounds, i.e., stern
discipline, leads to the rubbing off of evil, i.e., rubs it, washes it,
cleanses it away. It may now be possible that in 30b the subject idea is
permutatively continued: et verbera penetralium corporis (thus the
Venet.: πληγαὶ τῶν ταμιείων τοῦ γαρστρός), i.e., quorum vis ad intimos
corporis et animi recessus penetrat (Fleischer). But that is encumbered,
and חדרי־בטן (cf. [Pro 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md), [Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008).md), as referring to the depths to
which stern corporal discipline penetrates, has not its full force.
וּמכּות is either a particip.: and that is touching (ferientes) the
inner chambers of the body, or חדרי־בטן is with the ב, or immediately
the second object of תמריק to be supplied: and strokes (rub off,
cleanse, make pure) the innermost part. Jerome and the Targ. also supply
ב, but erroneously, as designating place: in secretioribus ventris,
relatively better the lxx and Syr.: εἰς ταμιεῖα κοιλίας. Luther hits the
sense at least, for he translates:

One must restrain evil with severe punishment,

And with hard strokes which one feels.
