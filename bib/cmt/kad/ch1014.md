### [1 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 14:1</span></span>

David's palace-building, wives and children, [Ch1
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001.md); cf. [Sa2
5:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md). Two victories over the
Philistines, [Ch1 14:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#008.md); cf. [Sa2
5:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md). - The position in which the
narrative of these events stands, between the removal of the ark from
Kirjath-jearim and its being brought to Jerusalem, is not to be supposed
to indicate that they happened in the interval of three months, curing
which the ark was left in the house of Obed-edom. The explanation of it
rather is, that the author of our Chronicle, for the reasons given in
page 170, desired to represent David's design to bring the ark into the
capital city of his kingdom as his first undertaking after he had won
Jerusalem, and was consequently compelled to bring in the events of our
chapter at a later period, and for that purpose this interval of three
months seemed to offer him the fittest opportunity. The whole contents
of our chapter have already been commented upon in [Sa2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md), so that we need not here do more
than refer to a few subordinate points.

[1 Chronicles 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 14:2</span></span>

Instead of נשּׂא כּי, that He (Jahve) had lifted up (נשּׂא, perf. Pi.),
as in [Sa2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#012.md), in the Chronicle we
read למעלה נשּׂאת כּי, that his kingdom had been lifted up on high. The
unusual form נשּׂאת may be, according to the context, the third pers.
fem. perf. Niph., nisaa't having first been changed into נשּׂאת, and
thus contracted into נשּׂאת; cf. Ew. 194, b. In [Sa2
19:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#043.md) the same form is the infin. abs.
Niph. למעלה is here, as frequently in the Chronicles, used to intensify
the expression: cf. [Ch1 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#005.md); [Ch1
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#017.md); [Ch1
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003.md), [Ch1
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#025.md); [Ch2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md); [Ch2
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012.md). With regard to the sons of
David, see on [Ch1 3:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005.md).

In the account of the victories over the Philistines, the statement
([Sa2 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017).md) that David went down to
the mountain-hold, which has no important connection with the main fact,
and would have been for the readers of the Chronicle somewhat obscure,
is exchanged in [Ch1 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#008.md) for the more
general expression לפניהם ויּצא, "he went forth against them." In [Ch1
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#014.md), the divine answer to David's
question, whether he should march against the Philistines, runs thus:
מעליהם הסב אחריהם תּעלה לא, Thou shalt not go up after them; turn away
from them, and come upon them over against the baca-bushes; - while in
[Sa2 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#023.md), on the contrary, we read:
אל־אחריהם הסב תעלה הסב אל־א לע, Thou shalt not go up (i.e., advance
against the enemy to attack them in front); turn thee behind them (i.e.,
to their rear), and come upon them over against the baca-bushes.
Bertheau endeavours to get rid of the discrepancy, by supposing that
into both texts corruptions have crept through transcribers' errors. He
conjectures that the text of Samuel was originally אחריהם תּעלה לא,
while in the Chronicle a transposition of the words עליהם and אחריהם was
occasioned by a copyist's error, which in turn resulted in the
alteration of עליהם into מעליהם. This supposition, however, stands or
falls with the presumption that by תּעלה לא (Sam.) an attack is
forbidden; but for that presumption no tenable grounds exist: it would
rather involve a contradiction between the first part of the divine
answer and the second. The last clause, "Come upon them from over
against the baca-bushes," shows that the attack was not forbidden; all
that was forbidden was the making of the attack by advancing straight
forward: instead of that, they were to try to fall upon them in the
rear, by making a circuit. The chronicler consequently gives us an
explanation of the ambiguous words of 2 Samuel, which might easily be
misunderstood. As David's question was doubtless expressed as it is in
[Ch1 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#010.md), הפל על האעלה, the answer
תּעלה לא might be understood to mean, "Go not up against them, attack
them not, but go away behind them;" but with that the following וגו להם
וּבאת, "Come upon them from the baca-bushes," did not seem to harmonize.
The chronicler consequently explains the first clauses of the answer
thus: "Go not up straight behind them," i.e., advance not against them
so as to attack them openly, "but turn thyself away from them," i.e.,
strike off in such a direction as to turn their flank, and come upon
them from the front of the baca-bushes. In this way the apparently
contradictory texts are reconciled without the alteration of a word. In
[Ch1 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#017.md), which is wanting in
Samuel, the author concludes the account of these victories by the
remark that they tended greatly to exalt the name of David among the
nations. For similar reflections, cf. [Ch2
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#010.md); [Ch2
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#029.md); [Ch2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#013.md); and for שׁם ויּצא, [Ch2
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015.md).
