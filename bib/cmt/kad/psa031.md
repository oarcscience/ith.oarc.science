[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

Surrender of One Sorely Persecuted into the Hand of God

In Ps 31 the poet also, in ואני אמרתּי ([Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023).md), looks back upon a previous
state of mind, viz., that of conflict, just as in [Psa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007.md) upon that of security. And here,
also, he makes all the חסידים partakers with him of the healthful fruit
of his deliverance (cf. [Psa 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#024.md)
with [Psa 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005).md). But in other respects
the situation of the two Psalms is very different. They are both
Davidic. Hitzig, however, regards them both as composed by Jeremiah.
With reference to Ps 31, which Ewald also ascribes to "Jremj," this view
is well worthy of notice. Not only do we find [Psa
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014.md) recurring in Jeremiah, [Jer
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md), but the whole Psalm, in its
language (cf. e.g., [Jer 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md) with
[Lam 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020.md); [Psa
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011.md) with [Jer
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#018.md); [Psa
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#018.md) with [Jer
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018.md); [Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md) with [Lam
3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054).md) and its plaintive tenderness,
reminds one of Jeremiah. But this relationship does not decide the
question. The passage [Jer 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md), like
many other passages of this prophet, whose language is so strongly
imbued with that of the Psalter, may be just as much a reminiscence as
[Jon 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#005.md), [Jon
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#009.md); and as regards its plaintive
tenderness there are no two characters more closely allied naturally and
in spirit than David and Jeremiah; both are servants of Jahve, whose
noble, tender spirits were capable of strong feeling, who cherished
earnest longings, and abounded in tribulations. We abide, though not
without some degree of hesitation, by the testimony of the inscription;
and regard the Psalm as a song springing from the outward and inward
conflict (lxx ἐκστάσεως, probably by a combination of [Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md), ἐν ἐκστάσει, בחפזי, with [Sa1
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#026).md) of the time of Saul. While [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md) is not suited to the mouth of
the captive Jeremiah (Hitzig), the Psalm has much that is common not
only to Ps 69 (more especially [Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md), [Psa
69:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033).md), a Psalm that sounds much like
Jeremiah's, but also to others, which we regard as Davidic; viz., the
figures corresponding to the life of warfare which David then lived
among the rocks and caves of the wilderness; the cheering call, [Jer
31:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#025.md), cf. [Psa
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027.md); [Psa
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md); the rare use of the Hiph. הפליא
[Psa 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022.md); [Psa
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md); the desire to be hidden by God,
[Psa 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021.md), cf. [Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md); [Psa
64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md); etc. In common with Ps 22 this
may be noted, that the crucified Christ takes His last word from this
Psalm, just as He takes His last utterance but three from that Psalm.
But in [Psa 31:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md), the
prefigurement of the Passion is confined within the limits of the type
and does not undergo the same prophetical enhancement as it does in that
unique Ps 22, to which only Ps 69 is in any degree comparable. The
opening, [Psa 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002.md), is repeated in the
centonic Ps 71, the work of a later anonymous poet, just as [Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md) is in part repeated in [Psa
116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011.md). The arrangement of the
strophes is not very clear.

[Psalms 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 31:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 31:2-9) The poet begins with the prayer for deliverance, based
upon the trust which Jahve, to whom he surrenders himself, cannot
possibly disappoint; and rejoices beforehand in the protection which he
assumes will, without any doubt, be granted. Out of his confident
security in God (הסיתי) springs the prayer: may it never come to this
with me, that I am put to confusion by the disappointment of my hope.
This prayer in the form of intense desire is followed by prayers in the
direct form of supplication. The supplicatory פלּטני is based upon God's
righteousness, which cannot refrain from repaying conduct consistent
with the order of redemption, though after prolonged trial, with the
longed for tokens of deliverance. In the second paragraph, the prayer is
moulded in accordance with the circumstances of him who is chased by
Saul hither and thither among the mountains and in the desert, homeless
and defenceless. In the expression צוּר מעוז, מעוז is genit.
appositionis: a rock of defence (מעוז from עזז, as in [Psa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001).md), or rather: of refuge (מעוז =
Arab. m‛âd, from עוּז, עוז = Arab. 'âd, as in [Psa
37:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039.md); [Psa
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009.md), and probably also in [Isa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002) and elsewhere.md);

(Note: It can hardly be doubted, that, in opposition to the pointing as
we have it, which only recognises one מעוז (מעז) from עזז, to be strong,
there are two different substantives having this principal form, viz.,
מעז a fortress, secure place, bulwark, which according to its derivation
is inflected מעזּי, etc., and מעוז equivalent to the Arabic ma‛âdh, a
hiding-place, defence, refuge, which ought to have been declined מעוזי
or מעוּזי like the synonymous מנוּסי (Olshausen 201, 202). Moreover
עוּז, Arab. 'âd, like חסה, of which it is the parallel word in [Isa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002.md), means to hide one's self
anywhere (Piel and Hiph., Hebrew העיז, according to the Kamus,
Zamachshari and Neshwn: to hide any one, e.g., Koran 3:31); hence Arab.
'â‛d, a plant that grows among bushes (bên esh-shôk according to the
Kamus) or in the crevices of the rocks (fi-l-hazn according to Neshwn)
and is thus inaccessible to the herds; Arab. 'wwad, gazelles that are
invisible, i.e., keep hidden, for seven days after giving birth, also
used of pieces of flesh of which part is hidden among the bones; Arab.
'ûdat, an amulet with which a man covers himself (protegit), and so
forth. - Wetzstein.

Consequently מעוז (formed like Arab. m‛âd, according to Neshwn
equivalent to Arab. ma'wad) is prop. a place in which to hide one's
self, synonymous with מחסה, מנוס, Arab. mlâd, malja‛, and the like.
True, the two substantives from עזז and עוז meet in their meanings like
praesidium and asylum, and according to passages like [Jer
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019.md) appear to be blended in the
genius of the language, but they are radically distinct.)

a rock-castle, i.e., a castle upon a rock, would be called מעוז צוּר,
reversing the order of the words. צוּר מעוז in [Psa
71:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#003.md), a rock of habitation, i.e., of
safe sojourn, fully warrants this interpretation. מצוּדה, prop. specula,
signifies a mountain height or the summit of a mountain; a house on the
mountain height is one that is situated on some high mountain top and
affords a safe asylum (vid., on [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003).md). The thought "show me Thy
salvation, for Thou art my Saviour," underlies the connection expressed
by כּי in [Psa 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004.md) and [Psa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005.md). Lster considers it to be
illogical, but it is the logic of every believing prayer. The poet prays
that God would become to him, actu reflexo, that which to the actus
directus of his faith He is even now. The futures in [Psa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004.md), [Psa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005.md) express hopes which necessarily
arise out of that which Jahve is to the poet. The interchangeable
notions הנחה and נהל, with which we are familiar from [Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md), stand side by side, in order
to give urgency to the utterance of the longing for God's gentle and
safe guidance. Instead of translating it "out of the net, which etc.,"
according to the accents (cf. [Psa
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002.md); [Psa
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#008).md) it should be rendered "out of
the net there," so that טמנוּ לּי is a relative clause without the
relative.

Into the hand of this God, who is and will be all this to him, he
commends his spirit; he gives it over into His hand as a trust or
deposit (פּקּדון); for whatsoever is deposited there is safely kept, and
freed from all danger and all distress. The word used is not נפשׁי,
which Theodotion substitutes when he renders it τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ ψυχὴν τῇ σῇ
παρατίθημι προμηθείᾳ but רוּחי; and this is used designedly. The
language of the prayer lays hold of life at its root, as springing
directly from God and as also living in the believer from God and in
God; and this life it places under His protection, who is the true life
of all spirit-life ([Isa 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016).md) and of
all life. It is the language of prayer with which the dying Christ
breathed forth His life, [Luk 23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046.md).
The period of David's persecution by Saul is the most prolific in types
of the Passion; and this language of prayer, which proceeded from the
furnace of affliction through which David at that time passed, denotes,
in the mouth of Christ a crisis in the history of redemption in which
the Old Testament receives its fulfilment. Like David, He commends His
spirit to God; but not, that He may not die, but that dying He may not
die, i.e., that He may receive back again His spirit-corporeal life,
which is hidden in the hand of God, in imperishable power and glory.
That which is so ardently desired and hoped for is regarded by him, who
thus in faith commends himself to God, as having already taken place,
"Thou hast redeemed me, Jahve, God of truth." The perfect פּדיתה is not
used here, as in [Psa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002.md), of that
which is past, but of that which is already as good as past; it is not
precative (Ew. 223, b), but, like the perfects in [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md), [Psa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009.md), an expression of believing
anticipation of redemption. It is the praet. confidentiae which is
closely related to the praet. prophet.; for the spirit of faith, like
the spirit of the prophets, speaks of the future with historic
certainty. In the notion of אל אמת it is impossible to exclude the
reference to false gods which is contained in אלהי אמת, [Ch2
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003.md), since, in [Psa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#007.md), "vain illusions" are used as an
antithesis. הבלים, ever since [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md), has become a favourite name for
idols, and more particularly in Jeremiah (e.g., [Psa
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001) :19.md). On the other hand,
according to the context, it may also not differ very greatly from אל
אמוּנה, [Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md); since the idea of
God as a depositary or trustee still influences the thought, and אמת and
אמוּנה are used interchangeably in other passages as personal
attributes. We may say that אמת is being that lasts and verifies itself,
and אמונה is sentiment that lasts and verifies itself. Therefore אל אמת
is the God, who as the true God, maintains the truth of His revelation,
and more especially of His promises, by a living authority or rule.

In [Psa 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#007.md), David appeals to his
entire and simple surrender to this true and faithful God: hateful to
him are those, who worship vain images, whilst he, on the other hand,
cleaves to Jahve. It is the false gods, which are called הבלי־שׁוא, as
beings without being, which are of no service to their worshippers and
only disappoint their expectations. Probably (as in [Psa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006).md) it is to be read שׂנאת with the
lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions (Hitzig, Ewald, Olshausen, and
others). In the text before us, which gives us no corrective Ker as in
[Sa2 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#021.md); [Rut
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005.md), ואני is not an antithesis to the
preceding clause, but to the member of that clause which immediately
precedes it. In Jonah's psalm, [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md), this is expressed by משׁמּרים
הבלי־שׁוא; in the present instance the Kal is used in the signification
observare, colere, as in [Hos 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md),
and even in [Pro 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#018.md). In the waiting
of service is included, according to [Psa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010.md), the waiting of trust. The word
בּטח which denotes the fiducia fidei is usually construed with בּ of
adhering to, or על of resting upon; but here it is combined with אל of
hanging on. The cohortatives in [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md) express intentions. Olshausen and
Hitzig translate them as optatives: may I be able to rejoice; but this,
as a continuation of [Psa 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#007.md), seems
less appropriate. Certain that he will be heard, he determines to
manifest thankful joy for Jahve's mercy, that (אשׁר as in [Gen
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#027).md) He has regarded (ἐπέβλεψε, [Luk
1:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#048).md) his affliction, that He has
known and exerted Himself about his soul's distresses. The construction
ידע בּ, in the presence of [Gen 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#033.md),
[Gen 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#035.md); [Job
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009.md); [Job
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015), cannot be doubted (Hupfeld.md); it
is more significant than the expression "to know of anything;" בּ is
like ἐπὶ in ἐπιγιγνώσκειν used of the perception or comprehensive
knowledge, which grasps an object and takes possession of it, or makes
itself master of it. הסגּיר, [Psa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009.md), συγκλείειν, as in [Sa1
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#011) (in the mouth of David.md) is so to
abandon, that the hand of another closes upon that which is abandoned to
it, i.e., has it completely in its power. מרחב, as in [Psa
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md), cf. [Psa
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#012.md). The language is David's, in
which the language of the Tra, and more especially of Deuteronomy ([Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030.md); [Deu
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#016).md), is re-echoed.

[Psalms 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 31:9</span></span>

(Heb.: 31:10-14) After the paean before victory, which he has sung in
the fulness of his faith, in this second part of the Psalm (with groups,
or strophes, of diminishing compass: 6. 5. 4) there again breaks forth
the petition, based upon the greatness of the suffering which the
psalmist, after having strengthened himself in his trust in God, now all
the more vividly sets before Him. צר־לּי, angustum est mihi, as in [Psa
69:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#018.md), cf. [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md). [Psa
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md) is word for word like [Psa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md), except that in this passage to
עיני, the eye which mirrors the state of suffering in which the sensuous
perception and objective receptivity of the man are concentrated, are
added נפשׁ, the soul forming the nexus of the spirit and the body, and
בּטן, the inward parts of the body reflecting the energies and feelings
of the spirit and the soul. חיּים, with which is combined the idea of
the organic intermingling of the powers of soul and body, has the
predicate in the plural, as in [Psa
88:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#004.md). The fact that the poet makes
mention of his iniquity as that by which his physical strength has
become tottering (כּשׁל as in [Neh
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#004).md), is nothing surprising even in a
Psalm that belongs to the time of his persecution by Saul; for the
longer this persecution continued, the more deeply must David have felt
that he needed this furnace of affliction.

The text of [Psa 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md) upon which the
lxx rendering is based, was just the same as ours: παρὰ πάντας τοὺς
ἐχθρούς μου ἐγενήθην ὄνειδος καὶ τοῖς γείτοσί μου σφόδρα καὶ φόβος τοῖς
γνωστοῖς μου. But this σφδόρα (Jerome nimis) would certainly only be
tolerable, if it could be rendered, "I am become a reproach even to my
neighbours exceedingly" - in favour of this position of מאד we might
compare [Jdg 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#002.md), - and this
rendering is not really an impossible one; for not only has ו frequently
the sense of "even" as in [Sa2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#023.md),
but (independently of passages, in which it may even be explained as
"and that," an expression which takes up what has been omitted, as in
[Amo 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#010).md) it sometimes has this
meaning direct (like καὶ, et -etiam), [Isa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#007.md); [Hos
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006) (according to the accents.md), [Ch2
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005.md); [Ecc
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#005) (cf. Ew. @a7352, b.md). Inasmuch,
however, as this usage, in Hebrew, was not definitely developed, but was
only as it were just developing, it may be asked whether it is not
possible to find a suitable explanation without having recourse to this
rendering of the ו as equivalent to גּם, a rendering which is always
hazardous. Olshausen places ולשׁכני after למידעי, a change which
certainly gets rid of all difficulty. Hitzig alters מאד into מנּד,
frightened, scared. But one naturally looks for a parallel substantive
to חרפּה, somewhat like "terror" (Syriac) or "burden." Still מגור
(dread) and משּׂאת (a burden) do not look as though מאד could be a
corruption of either of those words. Is it not perhaps possible for מאד
itself to be equivalent in meaning to משׂאת? Since in the signification
σφόδρα it is so unsuited to this passage, the expression would not be
ambiguous, if it were here used in a special sense. J. D. Michaelis has
even compared the Arabic awd (awdat) in the sense of onus. We can,
without the hesitation felt by Maurer and Hupfeld, suppose that מאד has
indeed this meaning in this passage, and without any necessity for its
being pointed מאד; for even the adverb מאד is originally a substantive
derived from אוּד, Arab. âd (after the form מצד from צוּד) gravitas,
firmitas, which is then used in the sense of graviter, firmiter (cf. the
French ferme). אוּד, Arab. âd, however, has the radical signification to
be compressed, compact, firm, and solid, from which proceed the
significations, which are divided between âda, jaı̂du, and âda, jaûdu, to
be strong, powerful, and to press upon, to burden, both of which
meanings Arab. 'dd unites within itself (cf. on [Psa
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009).md).

The number of opponents that David had, at length made him a reproach
even in the eyes of the better disposed of his people, as being a
revolter and usurper. Those among whom he found friendly shelter began
to feel themselves burdened by his presence because they were thereby
imperilled; and we see from the sad fate of Abimelech and the other
priests of Nob what cause, humanly speaking, they, who were not merely
slightly, but even intimately acquainted with him (מידּעים as inn [Psa
55:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#014.md); [Psa
88:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#009), 19.md), had for avoiding all
intercourse with him. Thus, then, he is like one dead, whom as soon as
he is borne out of his home to the grave, men are wont, in general, to
put out of mind also (נשׁכּח מלּא, oblivione extingui ex corde; cf.
מפּה, [Deu 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021).md). All intimate
connection with him is as it were sundered, he is become כּכלי אבד, - a
phrase, which, as we consider the confirmation which follows in [Psa
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014.md), has the sense of vas periens
(not vas perditum), a vessel that is in the act of אבד, i.e., one that
is set aside or thrown away, being abandoned to utter destruction and no
more cared for (cf. [Hos 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#008.md), together
with [Jer 48:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#038.md), and [Jer
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028).md). With כּי he gives the ground
for his comparison of himself to a household vessel that has become
worthless. The insinuations and slanders of many brand him as a
transgressor, dread surrounds him on every side (this is word for word
the same as in [Jer 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md), where the
prophet, with whom in other passages also מגור מסּביב is a frequent and
standing formula, under similar circumstances uses the language of the
psalmist); when they come together to take counsel concerning him
(according to the accents the second half of the verse begins with
בּהוּסדם), they think only how they may get rid of him. If the
construction of ב with its infinitive were intended to be continued in
[Psa 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014.md), it would have been וזממוּ
לקחת נפשׁי or לקחת נפשׁי יזמּוּ.

[Psalms 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 31:14</span></span>

(Heb.: 31:15-19) But, although a curse of the world and an offscouring
of all people, he is confident in God, his Deliverer and Avenger. By
ואני prominence is given to the subject by way of contrast, as in [Psa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#007.md). It appears as though Jahve had
given him up in His anger; but he confides in Him, and in spite of this
appearance, he even confides in Him with the prayer of appropriating
faith. עתּות or אתּים ([Ch1 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#030).md) are
the appointed events and circumstances, the vicissitudes of human life;
like the Arabic 'idât (like עת from ועד), the appointed rewards and
punishments. The times, with whatsoever they bring with them, are in the
Lord's hand, every lot is of His appointment or sending. The Vulgate
follows the lxx, in manibus tuis sortes meae. The petitions of [Psa
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016.md), [Psa
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#017.md), spring from this consciousness
that the almighty and faithful hand of God has mould his life. There are
three petitions; the middle one is an echo of the Aaronitish blessing in
[Num 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025.md). כּי קראתיך, which gives the
ground of his hope that he shall not be put to shame (cf. [Psa
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002).md), is to be understood like אמרתּי
in [Psa 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#015.md), according to Ges. 126,
3. The expression of the ground for אל־אבושׁה, favours the explanation
of it not so much as the language of petition (let me not be ashamed) of
as hope. The futures which follow might be none the less regarded as
optatives, but the order of the words does not require this. And we
prefer to take them as expressing hope, so that the three petitions in
[Psa 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016.md), [Psa
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#017.md), correspond to the three hopes
in [Psa 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#018.md), [Psa
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md). He will not be ashamed, but the
wicked shall be ashamed and silenced for ever. The form ידּמוּ, from
דּמם, is, as in [Jer 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014.md), the plural
of the fut. Kal ידּם, with the doubling of the first radical, which is
customary in Aramaic (other examples of which we have in יקּד, ישּׁם,
יתּם), not of the fut. Niph. ידּם, the plural of which would be ידּמּוּ,
as in [Sa1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#009.md); conticescere in orcum
is equivalent to: to be silent, i.e., being made powerless to fall a
prey to hades. It is only in accordance with the connection, that in
this instance נאלם, [Psa 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md), just
like דּמם, denotes that which is forcibly laid upon them by the judicial
intervention of God: all lying lips shall be dumb, i.e., made dumb. עתק
prop. that which is unrestrained, free, insolent (cf. Arabic 'âtik,
'atı̂k, unrestrained, free

(Note: But these Arabic words do not pass over into the signification
"insolent."))

is the accusative of the object, as in [Psa
94:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#004.md), and as it is the nominative of
the subject in [Sa1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 31:19</span></span>

(Heb.: 31:20-25) In this part well-grounded hope expands to triumphant
certainty; and this breaks forth into grateful praise of the goodness of
God to His own, and an exhortation to all to wait with steadfast faith
on Jahve. The thought: how gracious hath Jahve been to me, takes a more
universal form in [Psa 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md). It is an
exclamation (מה, as in [Psa 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008).md) of
adoring admiration. טוּב יהוה is the sum of the good which God has
treasured up for the constant and ever increasing use and enjoyment of
His saints. צפן is used in the same sense as in [Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md); cf. τὸ μάννα τὸ κεκρυμμένον,
[Rev 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md). Instead of פּעלתּ it ought
strictly to be נתתּ; for we can say פּעל טּוב, but not פּעל טוּב. What
is meant is, the doing or manifesting of טּוב springing from this טוּב,
which is the treasure of grace. Jahve thus makes Himself known to His
saints for the confounding of their enemies and in defiance of all the
world besides, [Psa 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md). He takes
those who are His under His protection from the רכסי אישׁ,
confederations of men (from רכס, Arab. rks, magna copia), from the
wrangling, i.e., the slanderous scourging, of tongues. Elsewhere it is
said, that God hides one in סתר אהלו ([Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005).md), or in סתר כּנפיו ([Psa
61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005).md), or in His shadow (צל, [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001).md); in this passage it is: in the
defence and protection of His countenance, i.e., in the region of the
unapproachable light that emanates from His presence. The סכּה is the
safe and comfortable protection of the Almighty which spans over the
persecuted one like an arbour or rich foliage. With בּרוּך ה David again
passes over to his own personal experience. The unity of the Psalm
requires us to refer the praise to the fact of the deliverance which is
anticipated by faith. Jahve has shown him wondrous favour, inasmuch as
He has given him a עיר מצור as a place of abode. מצור, from צוּר to shut
in (Arabic misr with the denominative verb maṣṣara, to found a fortified
city), signifies both a siege, i.e., a shutting in by siege-works, and a
fortifying (cf. [Psa 60:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#011.md) with [Psa
108:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#011).md), i.e., a shutting in by
fortified works against the attack of the enemy, [Ch2
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#005.md). The fenced city is mostly
interpreted as God Himself and His powerful and gracious protection. We
might then compare [Isa 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md) and
other passages. But why may not an actual city be intended, viz.,
Ziklag? The fact, that after long and troublous days David there found a
strong and sure resting-place, he here celebrates beforehand, and
unconsciously prophetically, as a wondrous token of divine favour. To
him Ziklag was indeed the turning-point between his degradation and
exaltation. He had already said in his trepidation (חפז, trepidare), cf.
[Psa 116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011.md) : I am cut away from the
range of Thine eyes. נגרזתּי is explained according to גּרזן, an axe;
[Lam 3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054.md), נגרזתּי, and [Jon
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#005.md), נגרשׁתּי, favour this
interpretation. He thought in his fear and despair, that God would never
more care about him. אכן, verum enim vero, but Jahve heard the cry of
his entreaty, when he cried unto Him (the same words as in [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002).md). On the ground of these
experiences he calls upon all the godly to love the God who has done
such gracious things, i.e., to love Love itself. On the one hand, He
preserves the faithful (אמוּנים, from אמוּן = אמוּן, πιστοί, as in [Psa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002).md), who keep faith with Him, by
also proving to them His faithfulness by protection in every danger; on
the other hand, not scantily, but plentifully (על as in [Isa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007.md); [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014) : κατὰ περισσείαν.md) He rewardeth
those that practise pride-in the sight of God, the Lord, the sin of
sins. An animating appeal to the godly (metamorphosed out of the usual
form of the expression חזק ואמץ, macte esto), resembling the animating
call to his own heart in [Psa 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md),
closes the Psalm. The godly and faithful are here called "those who wait
upon Jahve." They are to wait patiently, for this waiting has a glorious
end; the bright, spring sun at length breaks through the dark, angry
aspect of the heavens, and the esto mihi is changed into halleluja. This
eye of hope patiently directed towards Jahve is the characteristic of
the Old Testament faith. The substantial unity, however, of the Old
Testament order of grace, or mercy, with that of the New Testament, is
set before us in [Psa 32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), which,
in its New Testament and Pauline character, is the counterpart of [Psa
19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md).
