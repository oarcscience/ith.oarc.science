### [Job Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001.md)

[Job 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 14:1</span></span>

1 Man that is born of a woman,

Short of days and full of unrest,

2 Cometh forth as a flower and is cut down;

He fleeth as a shadow, and continueth not.

3 Moreover, Thou openest Thine eyes upon him,

And Thou drawest me before Thy tribunal.

Even if he yields to the restraint which his suffering imposes on him,
to regard himself as a sinner undergoing punishment, he is not able to
satisfy himself by thus persuading himself to this view of God's conduct
towards him. How can God pass so strict a judgment on man, whose life is
so short and full of sorrow, and which cannot possibly be pure from sin?
- [Job 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001.md). אדם is followed by three
clauses in apposition, or rather two, for אשּׁה ילוּד (lxx γεννητὸς
γυναικός, as [Mat 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011.md); comp. γέννημα
γυν. Sir. 10:18) belongs to the subject as an adjectival clause:
woman-born man, short-lived, and full of unrest, opens out as a flower.
Woman is weak, with pain she brings forth children; she is impure during
her lying-in, therefore weakness, suffering, and impurity is the portion
of man even from the birth ([Job
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014.md); [Job
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#004).md). As קצר is the constr. of קצר,
so (רגז) שׂבע is from שׂבע, which here, as [Job
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015.md), has the strong signification:
endowed (with adversity). It is questionable whether ויּמּל, [Job
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002.md), signifies et marcescit or et
succiditur. We have decided here as elsewhere (vid., on [Psa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002.md); [Psa
90:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#006), Genesis, S. 383.md) in favour of
the latter meaning, and as the Targ. (אתמולל), translated "he is mown
down." For this meaning (prop. to cut off from above or before, to lop
off), - in which the verb מלל (מוּל נמל) is become technical for the
περιτομή, - is most probably favoured by its application in [Job
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#024.md); where Jerome however
translates, sicut summitates spicarum conterentur, since he derives ימלו
from מלל in the signification not found in the Bible (unless perhaps
retained in מלילה ni , [Deu 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025).md),
fricare (Arab. mll, frigere, to parch). At the same time, the
signification marcescere, which certainly cannot be combined with
praecidere, but may be with fricare (conterere), is not unnatural; it is
more appropriate to a flower (comp. נבל ציץ, [Isa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007).md); it accords with the parallelism
[Psa 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002.md), and must be considered
etymologically possible in comparison with ק־מל א־מל. But it is not
supported by any dialect, and none of the old translations furnish any
certain evidence in its favour; ימולל, [Psa
90:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#006.md), which is to be understood
impersonally rather than intransitively, does not favour it; and none of
the passages in which ימּל occurs demand it: least of all [Job
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#024.md), where praeciduntur is more
suitable than, and [Job 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md),
praeciditur, quite as suitable as, marcescit. For these reasons we also
take ויּמּל here, not as fut. Kal from מלל, or, as Hahn, from נמל = נבל,
to wither, but as fut. Niph. from מלל, to cut down. At the same time, we
do not deny the possibility of the notion of withering having been
connected with ימל, whether it be that it belonged originally and
independently to the root מל, or has branched off from some other
radical notion, as "to fall in pieces" (lxx here ἐξέπεσεν, and similarly
also [Job 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md); [Job
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#024.md); comp. מלחים, rags, נמלח, to
come to pieces, to be dissolved) or "to become soft" (with which the
significations in the dialects, to grind and to parch, may be
connected). As a flower, which having opened out is soon cut or
withered, is man: אף, accedit quod, insuper. This particle, related to
ἐπὶ, adds an enhancing cumulat. More than this, God keeps His eye open
(not: His eyes, for the correct reading, expressly noted by the Masora,
is עינך without Jod plur.), על־זה, super hoc s. tali, over this poor
child of man, who is a perishable flower, and not a "walking light, but
a fleeting shadow" (Gregory the Great), to watch for and punish his
sins, and brings Job to judgment before himself, His tribunal which puts
down every justification. Elsewhere the word is pointed במשׁפט, [Job
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032.md); [Job
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#004.md); here it is במשׁפט, because the
idea is rendered determinate by the addition of עמך.

[Job 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 14:4</span></span>

4 Would that a pure one could come from an impure!

Not a single one - -

5 His days then are determined,

The number of his months is known to Thee,

Thou hast appointed bounds for him that he may not pass over:

6 Look away from him then, and let him rest,

Until he shall accomplish as a hireling his day.

Would that perfect sinlessness were possible to man; but since (to use a
New Testament expression) that which is born of the flesh is flesh,
there is not a single one pure. The optative מי־יתּן seems to be used
here with an acc. of the object, according to its literal meaning, quis
det s. afferat, as [Job 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031.md); [Deu
28:67](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#067.md); [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md). Ewald remarks (and refers to
358, b, of his Grammar) that לא, [Job
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004.md), must be the same as לוּ; but
although in [Sa1 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#014.md); [Sa2
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#026.md); [Kg2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#017.md), לא might be equivalent to the
optative לו, which is questionable, still אחד לא here, as an echo of אין
גם־אחד, [Psa 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003.md), is Job's own answer
to his wish, that cannot be fulfilled: not one, i.e., is in existence.
Like the friends, he acknowledges an hereditary proneness to sin; but
this proneness to sin affords him no satisfactory explanation of so
unmerciful a visitation of punishment as his seems to him to be. It
appears to him that man must the rather be an object of divine
forbearance and compassion, since absolute purity is impossible to him.
If, as is really the case, man's days are חרוּצים, cut off, i.e.,
ἀποτόμως, determined (distinct from חרוצים with an unchangeable Kametz:
sharp, i.e., quick, eager, diligent), - if the number of his months is
with God, i.e., known by God, because fixed beforehand by Him, - if He
has set fixed bounds (Keri חקּיו) for him, and he cannot go beyond them,
may God then look away from him, i.e., turn from him His strict watch
(מן שׁעה, as [Job 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019.md); מן שׁית, [Job
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020).md), that he may have rest (יחדּל,
cesset), so that he may at least as a hireling enjoy his day. Thus ירצה
is interpreted by all modern expositors, and most of them consider the
object or reason of his rejoicing to be the rest of evening when his
work is done, and thereby miss the meaning.

Hahn appropriately says, "He desires that God would grant man the
comparative rest of the hireling, who must toil in sorrow and eat his
bread in the sweat of his brow, but still is free from any special
suffering, by not laying extraordinary affliction on him in addition to
the common infirmities beneath which he sighs. Since the context treats
of freedom from special suffering in life, not of the hope of being set
free from it, comp. [Job 13:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025.md);
[Job 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#003.md), the explanation of Umbreit,
Ew., Hirz., and others, is to be entirely rejected, viz., that God would
at least permit man the rest of a hireling, who, though he be vexed with
heavy toil, cheerfully reconciles himself to it in prospect of the
reward he hopes to obtain at evening time. Job does not claim for man
the toil which the hireling gladly undergoes in expectation of complete
rest, but the toil of the hireling, which seems to him to be rest in
comparison with the possibility of having still greater toil to
undergo." Such is the true connection.

(Note: In honour of our departed friend, whose Commentary on Job abounds
in observations manifesting a delicate appreciation of the writer's
purpose and thought, we have quoted his own words.)

Man's life - this life which is as a hand-breadth ([Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006).md), and in [Job
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md). is compared to a hireling's day,
which is sorrowful enough - is not to be overburdened with still more
and extraordinary suffering.

It must be asked, however, whether ריה seq. acc. here signifies εὐδοκεῖν
(τὸν βίον, lxx), or not rather persolvere; for it is undeniable that it
has this meaning in [Lev 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md) (vid.,
however Keil \[Pent., en loc.\]) and elsewhere (prop. to satisfy,
remove, discharge what is due). The Hiphil is used in this sense in
post-biblical Hebrew, and most Jewish expositors explain ירצה by ישלים.
If it signifies to enjoy, עד ought to be interpreted: that (he at least
may, like as a hireling, enjoy his day). But this signification of עד
(ut in the final sense) is strange, and the signification dum ([Job
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#018.md); [Job
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021).md) or adeo ut ([Isa
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#007).md) is not, however, suitable, if
ירצה is to be explained in the sense of persolvere, and therefore
translate donec persolvat (persolverit). We have translated "until he
accomplish," and wish "accomplish" to be understood in the sense of
"making complete," as [Col 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md),
Luther ("vollzhlig machen") = ἀνταναπληροῦν.

[Job 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 14:7</span></span>

7 For there is hope for a tree:

If it is hewn down, it sprouts again,

And its shoot ceaseth not.

8 If its root becometh old in the ground,

And its trunk dieth off in the dust:

9 At the scent of water it buddeth,

And bringeth forth branches like a young plant.

As the tree falleth so it lieth, says a cheerless proverb. Job, a true
child of his age, has a still sadder conception of the destiny of man in
death; and the conflict through which he is passing makes this sad
conception still sadder than it otherwise is. The fate of the tree is
far from being so hopeless as that of man; for (1) if a tree is hewn
down, it (the stump left in the ground) puts forth new shoots (on החליף,
vid., on [Psa 90:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#006).md), and young
branches (יונקת, the tender juicy sucker μόσχος) do not cease. This is a
fact, which is used by Isaiah ([Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md) as an emblem of a fundamental
law in operation in the history of Israel: the terebinth and oak there
symbolize Israel; the stump (מצבת) is the remnant that survives the
judgment, and this remnant becomes the seed from which a new sanctified
Israel springs up after the old is destroyed. Carey is certainly not
wrong when he remarks that Job thinks specially of the palm (the date),
which is propagated by such suckers; Shaw's expression corresponds
exactly to לא תחדל: "when the old trunk dies, there is never wanting one
or other of these offsprings to succeed it." Then (2) if the root of a
tree becomes old (חזקין inchoative Hiphil: senescere, Ew. 122, c) in the
earth, and its trunk (גּזע also of the stem of an undecayed tree, [Isa
40:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#024).md) dies away in the dust, it can
nevertheless regain its vitality which had succumbed to the weakness of
old age: revived by the scent (ריח always of scent, which anything
exhales, not, perhaps [Sol 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003.md) only
excepted, odor = odoratus) of water, it puts forth buds for both leaves
and flowers, and brings forth branches (קציר, prop. cuttings, twigs)
again, כמו נטע, like a plant, or a young plant (the form of נטע in
pause), therefore, as if fresh planted, lxx ὥσπερ νεόφυτον. One is here
at once reminded of the palm which, on the one hand, is pre-eminently a
φιλυδρον φυτόν,

(Note: When the English army landed in Egypt in 1801, Sir Sydney Smith
gave the troops the sure sign, that wherever date-trees grew there must
be water; and this is supported by the fact of people digging after it
generally, within a certain range round the tree within which the roots
of the tree could obtain moisture from the fluid. - Vid., R. Wilson's
History of the Expedition to Egypt, p. 18.)

on the other hand possesses a wonderful vitality, whence it is become a
figure for youthful vigour. The palm and the phoenix have one name, and
not without reason. The tree reviving as from the dead at the scent of
water, which Job describes, is like that wondrous bird rising again from
its own ashes (vid., on [Job 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#018).md).
Even when centuries have at last destroyed the palm - says Masius, in
his beautiful and thoughtful studies of nature - thousands of
inextricable fibres of parasites cling about the stem, and delude the
traveller with an appearance of life.

[Job 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 14:10</span></span>

10 But man dieth, he lieth there stretched out,

Man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?

11 The waters flow away from the sea,

And a stream decayeth and dryeth up:

12 So man lieth down and riseth not again;

Till the heavens pass away they wake not,

And are not aroused from their sleep.

How much less favoured is the final lot of man! He dies, and then lies
there completely broken down and melted away (חלשׁ( yaw, in the neuter
signification, confectum esse, rendered in the Targum by אתּבר and
אתמקמק). The fut. consec. continues the description of the cheerless
results of death: He who has thus once fallen together is gone without
leaving a trace of life. In [Job
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#011.md). this vanishing away without
hope and beyond recovery is contemplated under the figure of running
water, or of water that is dried up and never returns again to its
channel. Instead of אזלוּ Isaiah uses נשּׁתוּ ([Job
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#005).md) in the oracle on Egypt, a
prophecy in which many passages borrowed from the book of Job are
interwoven. The former means to flow away (related radically with נזל),
the latter to dry up (transposed נתּשׁ, [Jer
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014).md). But he also uses יחרב, which
signifies the drying in, and then ויבשׁ, which is the complete drying up
which follows upon the drying in (vid., Genesis, S. 264). What is thus
figuratively expressed is introduced by waw ([Job
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#012).md), similar to the waw
adaequationis of the emblematic proverbs mentioned at [Job
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007.md); [Job
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012.md) : so there is for man no rising
(קוּם), no waking up (הקיץ), no ἐγείρεσθαι (נעור), and indeed not for
ever; for what does not happen until the heavens are no more (comp. [Psa
72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007), till the moon is no more.md), never
happens; because God has called the heavens and the stars with their
laws into existence, לעד לעולם ([Psa
148:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#006).md), they never cease ([Jer
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035)..md), the days of heaven are
eternal ([Psa 89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030).md). This is not
opposed to declarations like [Psa
102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027.md), for the world's history,
according to the teaching of Scripture, closes with a change in all
these, but not their annihilation. What is affirmed in [Job
14:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#010.md) of mankind in general, is, by
the change to the plural in [Job
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#012.md), affirmed of each individual of
the race. Their sleep of death is עזלם שׁנת ([Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md), [Jer
51:57](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057).md). What Sheôl summons away from
the world, the world never sees again. Oh that it were otherwise! How
would the brighter future have comforted him with respect to the
sorrowful present and the dark night of the grave!

[Job 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 14:13</span></span>

13 Oh that Thou wouldst hide me in Shel,

That Thou wouldst conceal me till Thine anger change,

That Thou wouldst appoint me a time and then remember me!

14 If man dieth, shall he live again?

All the days of my warfare would I wait,

Until my change should come.

15 Thou wouldst call and I would answer,

Thou wouldst have a desire for the work of Thy hands -

16 For now thou numberest my steps,

And dost not restrain thyself over my sins.

The optative יתּן מי introduces a wish that has reference to the future,
and is therefore, as at [Job 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008.md),
followed by futt.; comp. on the other hand, [Job
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003.md), utinam noverim. The language of
the wish reminds one of such passages in the Psalms as [Psa
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021.md); [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md) (comp. [Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020).md): "In the day of trouble He
hideth me in His pavilion, and in the secret of His tabernacle doth He
conceal me." So Job wishes that Hades, into which the wrath of God now
precipitates him for ever, may only be a temporary place of safety for
him, until the wrath of God turn away (שׁוּב, comp. the causative, [Job
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013).md); that God would appoint to him,
when there, a חק, i.e., a terminus ad quem (comp. [Job
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#005).md), and when this limit should be
reached, again remember him in mercy. This is a wish that Job marks out
for himself. The reality is indeed different: "if (ἐὰν) a man dies, will
he live again?" The answer which Job's consciousness, ignorant of
anything better, alone can give, is: No, there is no life after death.
It is, however, none the less a craving of his heart that gives rise to
the wish; it is the most favourable thought, - a desirable possibility,
- which, if it were but a reality, would comfort him under all present
suffering: "all the days of my warfare would I wait until my change
came." צבא is the name he gives to the whole of this toilsome and
sorrowful interval between the present and the wished-for goal, - the
life on earth, which he likens to the service of the soldier or of the
hireling ([Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001).md), and which is
subject to an inevitable destiny ([Job
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007).md) of manifold suffering, together
with the night of Hades, where this life is continued in its most
shadowy and dismal phase. And חליפה does not here signify destruction in
the sense of death, as the Jewish expositors, by comparing [Isa
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018.md) and [Sol
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011.md), explain it; but (with reference
to צבאי, comp. [Job 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#017).md) the
following after (Arab. chlı̂ft, succession, successor, i.e., of
Mohammed), relief, change (syn. תּמוּרה, exchange, barter), here of
change of condition, as [Psa 55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020.md), of
change of mind; Aquila, Theod., ἄλλαγμα. Oh that such a change awaited
him! What a blessed future would it be if it should come to pass! Then
would God call to him in the depth of Shel, and he, imprisoned until the
appointed time of release, would answer Him from the deep. After His
anger was spent, God would again yearn after the work of His hands
(comp. [Job 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#003).md), the natural loving
relation between the Creator and His creature would again prevail, and
it would become manifest that wrath is only a waning power ([Isa
54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008).md), and love His true and essential
attribute. Schlottman well observes: "Job must have had a keen
perception of the profound relation between the creature and his Maker
in the past, to be able to give utterance to such an imaginative
expectation respecting the future."

In [Job 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#016.md), Job supports what is
cheering in this prospect, with which he wishes he might be allowed to
console himself, by the contrast of the present. עתּה כּי is used here
as in [Job 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021.md); כי is not, as
elsewhere, where עתה כי introduces the conclusion, confirmatory (indeed
now = then indeed), but assigns a reason (for now). Now God numbers his
steps ([Job 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#027).md), watching him as a
criminal, and does not restrain himself over his sin. Most modern
expositors (Ew., Hlgst, Hahn, Schlottm.) translate: Thou observest not
my sins, i.e., whether they are to be so severely punished or not; but
this is poor. Raschi: Thou waitest not over my sins, i.e., to punish
them; instead of which Ralbag directly: Thou waitest not for my sins =
repentance or punishment; but שׁמר is not supported in the meaning: to
wait, by [Gen 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#011.md). Aben-Ezra: Thou
lookest not except on my sins, by supplying רק, according to [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md) (where, however, probably משׁיאכל
should be read, and מ after אדם, just as in [Job
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017), has fallen away.md). The most
doubtful is, with Hirzel, to take the sentence as interrogative, in
opposition to the parallelism: and dost Thou not keep watch over my
sins? It seems to me that the sense intended must be derived from the
phrase אף שׁמר, which means to keep anger, and consequently to delay the
manifestation of it ([Amo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011).md). This
phrase is here so applied, that we obtain the sense: Thou keepest not
Thy wrath to thyself, but pourest it out entirely. Mercerus is
substantially correct: non reservas nec differs peccati mei punitionem.

[Job 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 14:17</span></span>

17 My transgression is sealed up in a bag,

And Thou hast devised additions to my iniquity.

18 But a falling mountain moveth indeed,

And a rock falleth from its place.

19 Water holloweth out stone,

Its overflowings carry away the dust of the earth,

And the hope of man - Thou destroyest.

The meaning of [Job 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017.md) is, not that
the judgment which pronounces him guilty lies in the sealed-up bag of
the judge, so that it requires only to be handed over for execution
(Hirz., Ew., Renan), for although פּשׁע (though not exactly the
punishment of sin, which it does not signify even in [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md) can denote wickedness, as proved
and recorded, and therefore metonomically the penal sentence, the figure
is, however, taken not from the mode of preserving important documents,
but from the mode of preserving collected articles of value in a sealed
bag. The passage must be explained according to [Hos
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#012.md); [Deu
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md); [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md), comp. [Jer
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md). The evil Job had formerly ([Job
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026).md) committed according to the
sentence of God, God has gathered together as in a money bag, and
carefully preserved, in order now to bring them home to him. And not
this alone, however; He has devised still more against him than his
actual misdeeds. Ewald translates: Thou hast sewed up my punishment; but
טפל (vid., on [Job 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004).md) signifies,
not to sew up, but: to sew on, patch on, and gen. to add (טפל, Rabb.
accidens, a subordinate matter, opp. עקּר), after which the lxx
translates ἐπεσημήνω (noted in addition), and Gecatilia Arab. ḥftṣt
(added to in collecting). It is used here just as in the Aramaic phrase
טפל שׁקרא (to patch on falsehood, to invent scandal).

The idea of the figures which follow is questionable. Hahn maintains
that they do not describe destruction, but change, and that consequently
the relation of [Job 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019.md) to what
precedes is not similarity, but contrast: stones are not so hard, that
they are not at length hollowed out, and the firm land is not so firm
that it cannot be carried away by the flood; but man's prospect is for
ever a hopeless one, and only for him is there no prospect of his lot
ever being changed. Thus I thought formerly it should be explained:
considering the waw, [Job 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019.md), as
indicative not of comparison, but of contrast. But the assumption that
the point of comparison is change, not destruction, cannot be
maintained: the figures represent the slow but inevitable destruction
wrought by the elements on the greatest mountains, on rocks, and on the
solid earth. And if the poet had intended to contrast the slow but
certain changes of nature with the hopelessness of man's lot, how many
more appropriate illustrations, in which nature seems to come forth as
with new life from the dead, were at his command! Raschi, who also
considers the relation of the clauses to be antithetical, is guided by
the right perception when he interprets: even a mountain that is cast
down still brings forth fruit, and a rock removed from its place, even
these are not without some signs of vitality in them, יבּול = (יבוּל)
יעשׂהבוּל, which is indeed a linguistic impossibility. The majority of
expositors are therefore right when they take the waw, [Job
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019.md), similarly to [Job
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007.md); [Job
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012.md); [Job
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011.md), as waw adaequationis. With this
interpretation also, the connection of the clause with what precedes by
ואוּלם (which is used exactly as in [Job
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011.md); [Job
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#005.md); [Job
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007.md), where it signifies verum enim
vero or attamen) is unconstrained. The course of thought is as follows:
With unsparing severity, and even beyond the measure of my guilt, hast
Thou caused me to suffer punishment for my sins, but (nevertheless) Thou
shouldst rather be gentle and forbearing towards me, since even that
which is firmest, strongest, and most durable cannot withstand ultimate
destruction; and entirely in accordance with the same law, weak, frail
man (אנושׁ) meets an early certain end, and at the same time Thou
cuttest off from him every ground of hope of a continued existence. The
waw, [Job 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019.md), is consequently,
according to the sense, more quanto magis than sic, placing the things
to be contrasted over against each other. הר־נופL is a falling, not a
fallen (Ralbag) mountain; and having once received the impetus, it
continues gradually to give way; Renan: s'effondre peu peu. Carey,
better: "will decay," for נבל (cogn. נבל) signifies, decrease from
external loses; specially of the falling off of leaves, [Isa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md). The second figure, like [Job
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#004.md), is to be explained according to
[Job 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#005.md) : a rock removes (not as
Jerome translates, transfertur, which would be יעתק, and also not as lxx
παλαιωθήσεται, Schlottm.: becomes old and crumbles away, although in
itself admissible both as to language and fact; comp. on [Job
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007).md) from its place; it does not
stand absolutely, immovably fast. In the third figure אבנים is a
prominent object, as the accentuation with Mehupach legarmeh or (as it
is found in correct Codd.) with Asla legarmeh rightly indicates שׁחק
signifies exactly the same as Arab. sḥq, attere, conterere. In the
fourth figure, ספיח must not be interpreted as meaning that which grows
up spontaneously without re-sowing, although the Targum translates
accordingly: it (the water) washes away its (i.e., the dust of the
earth's) after-growth (כּתהא), which Symm. follows (τὰ παραλελειμνένα).
It is also impossible according to the expression; for it must have been
עפר הארץ. Jerome is essentially correct: et alluvione paullatim terra
consumitur. It is true that ספח in Hebrew does not mean effundere in any
other passage (on this point, vid., on [Hab
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015).md), but here the meaning effusio or
alluvio may be supposed without much hesitation; and in a book whose
language is so closely connected with the Arabic, we may even refer to
ספח = Arab. sfḥ (kindred to Arab. sfk, שׁפך), although the word may also
(as Ralbag suggests), by comparison with מטר סחף, [Pro
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#003.md), and Arab. sḥı̂qt, a storm of
rain, be regarded as transposed from חיפיה, from סחף in Arab. to tear
off, sweep away, Targ. to thrust away (= רחף), Syr., Talm. to overthrow,
subvertere (whence s'chifto, a cancer or cancerous ulcer). The suffix
refers to מים, and תּשׁטף before a plural subject is quite according to
rule, Ges. 146, 3. ספיחיה is mostly marked with Mercha, but according to
our interpretation Dech, which is found here and there in the Codd.,
would be more correct.

The point of the four illustrations is not that not one of them is
restored to its former condition (Oetinger, Hirz.), but that in spite of
their stability they are overwhelmed by destruction, and that
irrecoverably. Even the most durable things cannot defy decay, and now
even as to mortal man - Thou hast brought his hope utterly to nought
(האבדת with Pathach in pause as frequently; vid., Psalter ii. 468). The
perf. is praegnans: all at once, suddenly - death, the germ of which he
carries in him even from his birth, is to him an end without one ray of
hope, - it is also the death of his hope.

[Job 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 14:20</span></span>

20 Thou siezest him for ever, then he passeth away;

Thou changest his countenance and castest him forth.

21 If his sons come to honour, he knoweth it not;

Or to want, he observeth them not.

22 Only on his own account his flesh suffereth pain,

And on his own account is his soul conscious of grief.

The old expositors thought that תּתקפהוּ must be explained by תתקף נמנו
(Thou provest thyself stronger than he, according to Ges. 121, 4),
because תּקף is intrans.; but it is also transitive in the sense of
seizing forcibly and grasping, [Job
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#024.md); [Ecc
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012.md), as Talm. תּקף (otherwise
commonly אתקף as החזיק), Arab. taqifa, comprehendere. The many
sufferings which God inflicts on him in the course of his life are not
meant; לנצח does not signify here: continually, without intermission, as
most expositors explain, but as [Job
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020.md); [Job
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#007.md), and throughout the book: for
ever (Rosenm., Hahn, Welte). God gives him the death-stroke which puts
an end to his life for ever, he passes away βαίνει, οἴχεται (comp. [Job
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021).md); disfiguring his countenance,
i.e., in the struggle of death and in death by the gradual working of
decay, distorting and making him unlike himself, He thrusts him out of
this life (שׁלּח like [Gen 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#023).md). The
waw consec. is used here as e.g., [Psa
118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027.md).

When he is descended into Hades he knows nothing more of the fortune of
his children, for as [Ecc 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006.md) says:
the dead have absolutely no portion in anything that happens under the
sun. In [Job 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#021.md) Job does not think
of his own children that have died, nor his grandchildren (Ewald); he
speaks of mankind in general. כּבד and צער are not here placed in
contrast in the sense of much and little, but, as in [Jer
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#019.md), in the wider sense of an
important or a destitute position; כּבד, to be honoured, to attain to
honour, as [Isa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md). בּין (to observe
anything) is joined with ל of the object, as in [Psa
73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md) (on the other hand, להּ, [Job
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001), was taken as dat. ethicus.md). He
neither knows nor cares anything about the welfare of those who survive
him: "Nothing but pain and sadness is the existence of the dead; and the
pain of his own flesh, the sadness of his own soul, alone engage him. He
has therefore no room for rejoicing, nor does the joyous or sorrowful
estate of others, though his nearest ones, affect him" (Hofmann,
Schriftbeweis, i. 495). This is certainly, as Ewald and Psychol. S. 444,
the meaning of [Job 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022.md); but עליו is
hardly to be translated with Hofmann "in him," so that it gives the
intensive force of ἴδιος to the suff. For it is improbable that in this
connection, - where the indifference of the deceased respecting others,
and the absolute reference to himself of the existence of pain on his
own account, are contrasted, - עליו, [Job
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022.md), is to be understood according
to [Job 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#016) (Psychol. S. 152.md), but
rather objectively (over him). On the other hand, [Job
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022.md) is not to be translated: over
himself only does his flesh feel pain (Schlottm., Hirz., and others);
for the flesh as inanimate may indeed be poetically, so to speak
zeugmatically, represented as conscious of pain, but not as referring
its pain to another, and consequently as self-conscious. On this
account, עליו, [Job 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022.md), is to be
taken in the signification, over him = upon him, or as [Job
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022) (beyond him.md), which is doubtful;
or it signifies, as we have sought to render it in our translation in
both cases, propter eum. Only on his own account does his flesh suffer,
i.e., only applying to himself, only on his own account does his soul
mourn, i.e., only over his own condition. He has no knowledge and
interest that extends beyond himself; only he himself is the object of
that which takes place with his flesh in the grave, and of that on which
his soul reflects below in the depths of Hades. According to this
interpretation אך belongs to עליו, after the hyperbaton described at
[Job 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md), comp. [Job
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015.md), [Isa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015.md). And he עליו, [Job
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022.md), implies the idea (which is
clearly expressed in [Isa 66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md), and
especially in Judith 16:17: δοῦναι πῦρ καὶ σκώληκας εἰς σάρκας αὐτῶν καὶ
κλαύσονται ἐν αἰσθήσει ἕως αἰῶνος) that the process of the decomposition
of the body is a source of pain and sorrow to the departed spirit, - a
conception which proceeds from the supposition, right in itself, that a
connection between body and soul is still continued beyond the grave, -
a connection which is assumed by the resurrection, but which, as Job
viewed it, only made the future still more sorrowful.

This speech of Job (Job 12-14), which closes here, falls into three
parts, which correspond to the divisions into chapters. In the
impassioned speech of Zophar, who treats Job as an empty and conceited
babbler, the one-sided dogmatical standpoint of the friends was
maintained with such arrogance and assumption, that Job is obliged to
put forth all his power in self-defence. The first part of the speech
(Job 12) triumphantly puts down this arrogance and assumption. Job
replies that the wisdom, of which they profess to be the only
possessors, is nothing remarkable, and the contempt with which they
treat him is the common lot of the innocent, while the prosperity of the
ungodly remains undisturbed. In order, however, to prove to them that
what they say of the majesty of God, before which he should humble
himself, can neither overawe nor help him, he refers them to creation,
which in its varied works testifies to this majesty, this creative power
of God, and the absolute dependence of every living thin on Him, and
proves that he is not wanting in an appreciation of the truth contained
in the sayings of the ancients by a description of the absolute majesty
of God as it is manifested in the works of nature, and especially in the
history of man, which excels everything that the three had said. This
description is, however, throughout a gloomy picture of disasters which
God brings about in the world, corresponding to the gloomy condition of
mind in which Job is, and the disaster which is come upon himself.

As the friends have failed to solace him by their descriptions of God,
so his own description is also utterly devoid of comfort. For the wisdom
of God, of which he speaks, is not the wisdom that orders the world in
which one can confide, and in which one has the surety of seeing every
mystery of life sooner or later gloriously solved; but this wisdom is
something purely negative, and repulsive rather than attractive, it is
abstract exaltation over all created wisdom, whence it follows that he
puts to shame the wisdom of the wise. Of the justice of God he does not
speak at all, for in the narrow idea of the friends he cannot recognise
its control; and of the love of God he speaks as little as the friends,
for as the sight of the divine love is removed from them by the
one-sidedness of their dogma, so is it from him by the feeling of the
wrath of God which at present has possession of his whole being. Hegel
has called the religion of the Old Testament the religion of sublimity
(die Religion der Erhabenheit); and it is true that, so long as that
manifestation of love, the incarnation of the Godhead, was not yet
realized, God must have relatively transcended the religious
consciousness. From the book of Job, however, this view can be brought
back to its right limits; for, according to the tendency of the book,
neither the idea of God presented by the friends nor by Job is the pure
undimmed notion of God that belongs to the Old Testament. The friends
conceive of God as the absolute One, who acts only according to justice;
Job conceives of Him as the absolute One, who acts according to the
arbitrariness of His absolute power. According to the idea of the book,
the former is dogmatic one-sidedness, the latter the conception of one
passing through temptation. The God of the Old Testament consequently
rules neither according to justice alone, nor according to a "sublime
whim."

After having proved his superiority over the friends in perception of
the majesty of God, Job tells them his decision, that he shall turn away
from them. The sermon they address to him is to no purpose, and in fact
produces an effect the reverse of that intended by them. And while it
does Job no good, it injures them, because their very defence of the
honour of God incriminates themselves in the eyes of God. Their aim is
missed by them, for the thought of the absolute majesty of God has no
power to impart comfort to any kind of sufferer; nor can the thought of
His absolute justice give any solace to a sufferer who is conscious that
he suffers innocently. By their confidence that Job's affliction is a
decree of the justice of God, they certainly seem to defend the honour
of God; but this defence is reversed as soon as it is manifest that
there exists no such just ground for inflicting punishment on him. Job's
self-consciousness, however, which cannot be shaken, gives no testimony
to its justice; their advocacy of God is therefore an injustice to Job,
and a miserable attempt at doing God service, which cannot escape the
undisguised punishment of God. It is to be carefully noted that in [Job
13:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#006.md) Job seriously warns the
friends that God will punish them for their partiality, i.e., that they
have endeavoured to defend Him at the expense of truth.

We see from this how sound Job's idea of God is, so far as it is not
affected by the change which seems, according to the light which his
temptation casts upon his affliction, to have taken place in his
personal relationship to God. While above, ch. 9, he did not acknowledge
an objective right, and the rather evaded the thought, of God's dealing
unjustly towards him, by the desperate assertion that what God does is
in every case right because God does it, he here recognises an objective
truth, which cannot be denied, even in favour of God, and the denial of
which, even though it were a pientissima fraus, is strictly punished by
God. God is the God of truth, and will therefore be neither defended nor
honoured by any perverting of the truth. By such pious lies the friends
involve themselves in guilt, since in opposition to their better
knowledge they regard Job as unrighteous, and blind themselves to the
incongruities of daily experience and the justice of God. Job will
therefore have nothing more to do with them; and to whom does he now
turn? Repelled by men, he feels all the more strongly drawn to God. He
desires to carry his cause before God. He certainly considers God to be
his enemy, but, like David, he thinks it is better to fall into the
hands of God than into the hands of man ([Sa2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#014).md). He will plead his cause with
God, and prove to Him his innocence: he will do it, even though he be
obliged to expiate his boldness with his life; for he knows that morally
he will not be overcome in the contest. He requires compliance with but
two conditions: that God would grant a temporary alleviation of his
pain, and that He would not overawe him with the display of His majesty.
Job's disputing with God is as terrible as it is pitiable. It is
terrible, because he uplifts himself, Titan-like, against God; and
pitiable, because the God against which he fights is not the God he has
known, but a God that he is unable to recognise, - the phantom which the
temptation has presented before his dim vision instead of the true God.
This phantom is still the real God to him, but in other respects in no
way differing from the inexorable ruling fate of the Greek tragedy. As
in this the hero of the drama seeks to maintain his personal freedom
against the mysterious power that is crushing him with an iron arm, so
Job, even at the risk of sudden destruction, maintains the stedfast
conviction of his innocence, in opposition to a God who has devoted him,
as an evil-doer, to slow but certain destruction. The battle of freedom
against necessity is the same as in the Greek tragedy. Accordingly one
is obliged to regard it as an error, arising from simple ignorance, when
it has been recently maintained that the boundless oriental imagination
is not equal to such a truly exalted task as that of representing in art
and poetry the power of the human spirit, and the maintenance of its
dignity in the conflict with hostile powers, because a task that can
only be accomplished by an imagination formed with a perception of the
importance of recognising ascertained phenomena.

(Note: Vid., Arnold Ruge, Die Academie, i. S. 29.)

In treating this subject, the book of Job not only attains to, but rises
far above, the height attained by the Greek tragedy: for, on the one
hand, it brings this conflict before us in all the fearful earnestness
of a death-struggle; on the other, however, it does not leave us to the
cheerless delusion that an absolute caprice moulds human destiny. This
tragic conflict with the divine necessity is but the middle, not the
beginning nor the end, of the book; for this god of fate is not the real
God, but a delusion of Job's temptation. Human freedom does not succumb,
but it comes forth from the battle, which is a refining fire to it, as
conqueror. The dualism, which the Greek tragedy leaves unexplained, is
here cleared up. The book certainly presents much which, from its tragic
character, suggests this idea of destiny, but it is not its final aim -
it goes far beyond: it does not end in the destruction of its hero by
fate; but the end is the destruction of the idea of this fate itself.

We have seen in this speech (comp. [Job
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023.md), [Job
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026.md); [Job
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#016)..md), as often already, that Job is
as little able as the friends to disconnect suffering from the idea of
the punishment of sin. If Job were mistaken or were misled by the
friends respecting his innocence, the history of his sufferings would be
no material for a drama, because there would be no inner development.
But it is just Job's stedfast conviction of his innocence, and his
maintenance of it in spite of the power which this prejudice exercises
over him, that makes the history of his affliction the history of the
development of a new and grand idea, and makes him as the subject, on
whom it is developed, a tragic character. In conformity with his
prepossession, Job sees himself put down by his affliction as a great
sinner; and his friends actually draw the conclusion from false premises
that he is such. But he asserts the testimony of his conscience to his
innocence; and because this contradicts those premises, the
one-sidedness of which he does not discern, God himself appears to him
to be unjust and unmerciful. And against this God, whom the temptation
has distorted and transformed to the miserable image of a ruler, guided
only by an absolute caprice, he struggles on, and places the truth and
freedom of his moral self-consciousness over against the restraint of
the condemnatory sentence, which seems to be pronounced over him in the
suffering he has to endure. Such is the struggle against God which we
behold in the second part of the speech (ch. 13): ready to prove his
innocence, he challenges God to trial; but since God does not appear,
his confidence gives place to despondency, and his defiant tone to a
tone of lamentation, which is continued in the third part of the speech
(ch. 14).

While he has raised his head towards heaven with the conscious pride of
a תמים צדיק, first in opposition to the friends and then to God, he
begins to complain as one who is thrust back, and yielding to the
pressure of his affliction, begins to regard himself as a sinner. But he
is still unable to satisfy himself respecting God's dealings by any such
forcible self-persuasion. For how can God execute such strict judgment
upon man, whose life is so short and full of care, and who, because he
belongs to a sinful race, cannot possibly be pure from sin, without
allowing him the comparative rest of a hireling? How can he thus harshly
visit man, to whose life He has set an appointed bound, and who, when he
once dies, returns to life no more for ever? The old expositors cannot
at all understand this absolute denial of a new life after death.
Brentius erroneously observes on donec coelum transierit: ergo resurget;
and Mercerus, whose exposition is free from all prejudice, cannot
persuade himself that the elecus et sanctus Dei vir can have denied not
merely a second earthly life, but also the eternal imperishable life
after death. And yet it is so: Job does not indeed mean that man when he
dies is annihilated, but he knows of no other life after death but the
shadowy life in Shel, which is no life at all. His laments really
harmonize with those in Moschos iii. 106ff.:

Αἲ αἲ, ταὶ μαλάχαι μὲν ἐπὰν κατὰ κᾶπον ὄλωνται,

Ἤ τὰ χλωρὰ σέλινα, τό τ ̓ εὐθαλὲς οὖλον ἄνηθον,

Ὕστερον αὖ ζώοντι καὶ εἰς ἔτος ἄλλο φύοντι·

Ἄμμες δ ̓ οἱ μεγάλοι καὶ καρτεροὶ ἢ σοφοὶ ἄνδρες,

Ὁππότε πρῶτα θάνωμες, ἀνάκοοι ἐν χθονὶ κοίλᾳ

Εὔδομες εὖ μάλα μακρὸν ἀτέρμονα νήγρετον ὕπνον.

Alas! alas! the mallows, after they are withered in the garden,

Or the green parsley and the luxuriant curly dill,

Live again hereafter and sprout in future years;

But we men, the great and brave, or the wise,

When once we die, senseless in the bosom of the earth

We sleep a long, endless, and eternal sleep.

And with that of Horace, Od. iv. 7, 1:

Nos ubi decidimus

Quo pius Aeneas, quo dives Tullus et Ancus,

Pulvis et umbra sumus;

Or with that of the Jagur Weda: "While the tree that has fallen sprouts
again from the root fresher than before, from what root does mortal man
spring forth when he has fallen by the hand of death?"

(Note: Vid., Carey, The Book of Job, p. 447. We append here an extract
from a letter of Consul Wetzstein, as giving an explanation of [Job
14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007.md), derived from personal
observation: "The practice of cutting down the trees in order to obtain
a new and increased use from them, is an important part of husbandry in
the country east of the Jordan. It is, however, now almost confined to
the region round Damascus, in consequence of the devastation of the
country. This operation is called gemm (גמם), and is performed only with
the axe, because the stump would decay away if sawn. When the vine,
after bearing from sixty to eighty years, loses its fruitfulness and
begins to decay, it is cut down close to the ground in the second kânûn
(January). The first year it bears little or nothing, but throws out new
branches and roots; and afterwards it bears plenteously, for the
vine-stock has renewed its youth. The fig-tree (tı̂ne) and the
pomegranate (rummâne), when old and decayed, are cut down in like
manner. Their shoots are very numerous, and in the following winter as
many as ten young plants may be taken from the pomegranate. Those that
are left on the old stem bear fruit in the fourth year. The walnut-tree
(gôze) ceases to bear much after 100 years, and becomes hollow and
decayed. It is then cut down to within two or three yards from the
ground. If the trees are well watered, the new shoots spring up in a
year in uncommon luxuriance, and bear fruit in the second year. The new
shoot is called darbne. From many trees, as the citron (lı̂mûne), ash
(dardâre), and mulberry (tûte), this new shoot often attains a length of
twelve feet in the first year, provided the tree has the conditio sine
qua non which Job styles ריח מים - a plentiful supply of water.")

These laments echo through the ancient world from one end to the other,
and even Job is without any superior knowledge respecting the future
life. He denies a resurrection and eternal life, not as one who has a
knowledge of them and will not however know anything about them, but he
really knows nothing of them: our earthly life seems to him to flow on
into the darkness of Shel, and onward beyond Shel man has no further
existence.

We inquire here: Can we say that the poet knew nothing of a resurrection
and judgment after death? If we look to the psalms of the time of David
and Solomon, we must reply in the negative. Since, however, as the
Grecian mysteries fostered and cherished ἡδυστέρας ἐλπίδας, the
Israelitish Chokma also, by its constant struggles upwards and onwards,
anticipated views of the future world which reached beyond the present
(Psychol. S. 410): it may be assumed, and from the book of Job directly
inferred, that the poet had a perception of the future world which went
beyond the dim perception of the people, which was not yet lighted up by
any revelation. For, on the one hand, he has reproduced for us a history
of the patriarchal period, not merely according to its external, but
also according to its internal working, with as strict historical
faithfulness as delicate psychological tact; on the other, he has with a
master hand described for us in the history of Job what was only
possible from an advanced standpoint of knowledge, - how the hope of a
life beyond the present, where there is no express word of promise to
guide it, struggles forth from the heart of man as an undefined desire
and longing, so that the word of promise is the fulfilment and seal of
this desire and yearning. For when Job gives expression to the wish that
God would hide him in Shel until His anger turn, and then, at an
appointed time, yearning after the work of His hands, raise him again
from Shel ([Job 14:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013).md), this wish
it not to be understood other than that Shel might be only his temporary
hiding-place from the divine anger, instead of being his eternal abode.
He wishes himself in Shel, so far as he would thereby be removed for a
time from the wrath of God, in order that, after an appointed season, he
might again become an object of the divine favour. He cheers himself
with the delightful thought, All the days of my warfare would I wait
till my change should come, etc.; for then the warfare of suffering
would become easy to him, because favour, after wrath and deliverance
from suffering and death, would be near at hand. We cannot say that Job
here expresses the hope of a life after death; on the contrary, this
hope is wanting to him, and all knowledge respecting the reasons that
might warrant it. The hope exists only in imagination, as Ewald rightly
observes, without becoming a certainty, since it is only the idea, How
glorious it would be if it were so, that is followed up. But, on the one
side, the poet shows us by this touching utterance of Job how totally
different would be his endurance of suffering if he but knew that there
was really a release from Hades; on the other side, he shows us, in the
wish of Job, the incipient tendency of the growing hope that it might be
so, for what a devout mind desires has a spiritual power which presses
forward from the subjective to the objective reality. The hope of
eternal life is a flower, says one of the old commentators, which grows
on the verge of the abyss. The writer of the book of Job supports this.
In the midst of this abyss of the feeling of divine wrath in which Job
is sunk, this flower springs up to cheer him. In its growth, however, it
is not hope, but only at first a longing. And this longing cannot expand
into hope, because no light of promise shines forth in that night, by
which Job's feeling is controlled, and which makes the conflict darker
than it is in itself. Scarcely has Job feasted for a short space upon
the idea of that which he would gladly hope for, when the thought of the
reality of that which he has to fear overwhelms him. He seems to himself
to be an evil-doer who is reserved for the execution of the sentence of
death. If it is not possible in nature for mountains, rocks, stones, and
the dust of the earth to resist the force of the elements, so is it an
easy thing for God to destroy the hope of a mortal all at once. He
forcibly thrust him hence from this life; and when he is descended to
Hades, he knows nothing whatever of the lot of his own family in the
world above. Of the life and knowledge of the living, nothing remains to
him but the senseless pain of his dead body, which is gnawed away, and
the dull sorrow of his soul, which continues but a shadowy life in Shel.

Thus the poet shows us, in the third part of Job's speech, a grand idea,
which tries to force its way, but cannot. In the second part, Job
desired to maintain his conviction of innocence before God: his
confidence is repulsed by the idea of the God who is conceived of by him
as an enemy and a capricious ruler, and changes to despair. In the third
part, the desire for a life after death is maintained; but he is at once
overwhelmed by the imagined inevitable and eternal darkness of Shel, but
overwhelmed soon to appear again above the billows of temptation, until,
in ch. 19, the utterance of faith respecting a future life rises as a
certain confidence over death and the grave: the γνῶσις which comes
forth from the conflict of the πίστις anticipates that better hope which
in the New Testament is established and ratified by the act of
redemption wrought by the Conqueror of Hades.
