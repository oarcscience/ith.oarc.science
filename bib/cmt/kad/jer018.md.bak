The Figures of the Potter's Clay and of the Earthen Pitcher - Jeremiah
18-20

These three chapters have the title common to all Jeremiah's discourses
of the earlier period: The word which came to Jeremiah from Jahveh ([Jer
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001).md). In them, bodied forth in two
symbolical actions, are to discourses which are very closely related to
one another in form and substance, and which may be regarded as one
single prophecy set forth in words and actions. In them we find
discussed Judah's ripeness for the judgment, the destruction of the
kingdom, and the speediness with which that judgment was to befall. The
subject-matter of this discourse-compilation falls into two parts: Jer
18 and [Jer 19:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md) and 20; that is,
into the accounts of two symbolical actions, together with the
interpretation of them and their application to the people (Jer 18:1-17
and [Jer 19:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001).md), followed
immediately by notices as to the reception which these announcements met
on the part of the people and their rulers ([Jer
18:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018), and Jer 19:14-20:18.md). In the
first discourse, that illustrated by the figure of a potter who remodels
a misshapen vessel, Jer 18, the prophet inculcates on the people the
truth that the Lord has power to do according to His good-will, seeking
in this to make another appeal to them to turn from their evil ways; and
the people replies to this appeal by scheming against the life of the
austere preacher of repentance. As the consequence of this obdurate
impenitency, he, in [Jer 19:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md), by
breaking an earthen pitcher bought of the potter, predicts to the elders
of the people and the priests, in the valley of Benhinnom, the breaking
up of the kingdom and the demolition of Jerusalem ([Jer
18:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001).md). For this he is put in the
stocks by Pashur, the ward of the temple; and when freed from this
imprisonment, he tells him that he and all Judah shall be carried off to
Babylon and be put to death by the sword (19:14-20:6). As a conclusion
we have, as in Jer 18, complaint at the sufferings that attend his
calling ([Jer 20:7-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007).md).

As to the time of these two symbolical actions and announcements, we can
determine only thus much with certainty, that they both belong to the
period before the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, and that they
were not far separated in time from one another. The first assumes still
the possibility of the people's repentance, whence we may safely
conclude that the first chastisement at the hands of the Chaldeans was
not yet ready to be inflicted; in the second, that judgment is
threatened as inevitably on the approach, while still there is nothing
here either to show that the catastrophe was immediately at hand. Ng.
tries to make out that Jer 18 falls before the critical epoch of the
battle at Carchemish, [Jer 19:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md) and
20 after it; but his arguments are worthless. For there is not ground
whatever for the assertion that Jeremiah did not, until after that
decisive battle, give warning of the deliverance of all Judah into the
hand of the king of Babylon, and that not till the prophecies after that
time do we find the phrase: Jeremiah the prophet, as in [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md). The contents of the three
chapters do not even point us assuredly to the first year of Jehoiakim's
reign. There is no hint that Judah had become tributary to Egypt; so
that we might even assign both prophecies to the last year of Josiah.
For it might have happened even under Josiah that the upper warden of
the temple should have kept the prophet in custody for one night.

[Jeremiah 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 18:1</span></span>

The Emblem of the Clay and the Potter and the Complaint of the Prophet
against his Adversaries. - The figure of the potter who remodels a
misshapen vessel ([Jer 18:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#002).md). The
interpretation of this ([Jer 18:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#005).md),
and its application to degenerate Israel ([Jer
18:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011).md). The reception of the
discourse by the people, and Jeremiah's cry to the Lord ([Jer
18:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 18:2</span></span>

The emblem and its interpretation. - [Jer
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#002.md). "Arise and go down into the
potter's house; there will I cause thee to hear my words. [Jer
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#003.md). And I went down into the
potter's house; and, behold, he wrought on the wheels. [Jer
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#004.md). And the vessel was marred, that
he wrought in clay, in the hand of the potter; then he made again
another vessel of it, as seemed good to the potter to make. [Jer
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#005.md). Then came the word of Jahveh to
me, saying: [Jer 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md). Cannot I do
with you as this potter, house of Israel? saith Jahveh. Behold, as the
clay in the hand of the potter, so are ye in mine hand, house of Israel.
[Jer 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007.md). Now I speak concerning a
people and kingdom, to root it out and pluck up and destroy it. [Jer
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008.md). But if that people turns from
its wickedness, against which I spake, the it repents me of the evil
which I thought to do it. [Jer 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#009.md).
And now I speak concerning a people and a kingdom, to build and to plant
it. [Jer 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#010.md). If it do that which is
evil in mine eyes, so that it hearkens not unto my voice, then it
repents me of the good which I said I would do unto it."

By God's command Jeremiah is to go and see the potter's treatment of the
clay, and to receive thereafter God's interpretation of the same. Here
he has set before his eyes that which suggests a comparison of man to
the clay and of God to the potter, a comparison that frequently occurred
to the Hebrews, and which had been made to appear in the first formation
of man (cf. [Job 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#009.md); [Job
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006.md); [Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md); [Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md); [Isa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007).md). This is done that he may
forcibly represent to the people, by means of the emblem, the power of
the Lord to do according to His will with all nations, and so with
Israel too. From the "go down," we gather that the potteries of
Jerusalem lay in a valley near the city. האבנים are the round frames by
means of which the potter moulded his vessels. This sig. of the word is
well approved here; but in [Exo 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#016.md),
where too it is found, the meaning is doubtful, and it is a question
whether the derivation is from אבן or from אופן, wheel. The perfecta
consec. ונשׁחת and ושׁב designate, taken in connection with the
participle עשׂה, actions that were possibly repeated: "and if the vessel
was spoilt, he made it over again;" cf. Ew. 342, b. עשׂה , working in
clay, of the material in which men work in order to make something of
it; cf. [Exo 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#004.md).

(Note: Instead of בּחמר several codd. and editt. have כּחמר, as in [Jer
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md), to which Ew. and Hitz. both take
objection, so that they delete כחמר (Ew.) or כּחמר בּיד היּוצר (Hitz.)
as being glosses, since the words are not in the lxx. The attempts of
Umbr. and Nag. to obtain a sense for כּחמר are truly of such a kind as
only to strengthen the suspicion of spuriousness. Umbr., who is followed
by Graf, expounds: "as the clay in the hand of the potter does;" whereto
Hitz. justly replies: "but is then the (failure) solely its own doing?"
Ng. will have כ to be the כ verit.: the vessel was marred, as clay in
the hand of the potter, in which case the כחמר still interrupts. But the
failure of the attempts to make a good sense of כחמר does in no respect
justify the uncritical procedure of Ew. and Hitz. in deleting the word
without considering that the reading is by no means established, since
not only do the most important and correct editions and a great number
of codd. read בּחמר, but Aquila, Theodot., the Chald, and Syr. give this
reading; Norzi and Houbig. call it lectio accuratiorum codicum, and the
Masora on [Jer 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md) and [Job
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#009.md) confirms it. Cf. de Rossi variae
lectt. ad h. l. and the critical remarks in the Biblia Hal. by J. H.
Michaelis, according to which כחמר plainly made its way into the present
verse from [Jer 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md) by the error of a
copyist; and it can only be from his prejudice in favour of the lxx that
Hitz. pronounces כחמר original, as being "the reading traditionally in
use.")

[Jeremiah 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 18:6</span></span>

In [Jer 18:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md) the Lord discloses to
the prophet the truth lying in the potter's treatment of the clay. The
power the potter has over the clay to remould, according to his
pleasure, the vessel he had formed from it if it went wrong; the same
power God possesses over the people of Israel. This unlimited power of
God over mankind is exercised according to man's conduct, not according
to a decretum absolutum or unchangeable determination. If he pronounces
a people's overthrow or ruin, and if that people turn from its
wickedness, He repeals His decree ([Jer
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007)..md); and conversely, if He promises
a people welfare and prosperity, and if that people turn away from Him
to wickedness, then too He changes His resolve to do good to it ([Jer
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#009)..md). Inasmuch as He is even now
making His decree known by the mouth of the prophet, it follows that the
accomplishment of Jeremiah's last utterances is conditioned by the
impression God's word makes on men. רגע, adv., in the moment, forthwith,
and when repeated = now...now, now...again. Ng. maintains that the
arrangement here is paratactic, so that the רגע does not belong to the
nearest verb, but to the main idea, i.e., to the apodosis in this case.
The remark is just; but the word does not mean suddenly, but
immediately, and the sense is: when I have spoken against a people, and
this people repents, then immediately I let it repent me. נחם על as in
[Joe 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md), etc. With "to pluck up,"
etc., "to build," etc., cf. [Jer 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md).
"Against which I spake," [Jer 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008.md),
belongs to "that people," and seems as if it might be dispensed with;
but is not therefore spurious because the lxx have omitted it. For הרעה
the Keri has הרע, the most usual form, [Jer
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#030.md), [Num
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#013.md); [Jdg
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md), etc.; but the Chet. is called
for by the following הטּובה and מרעתו. להיטיב הטּובה, to show kindness,
cf. [Num 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#032.md).

The emblematical interpretation of the potter with the clay lays a
foundation for the prophecy that follows, [Jer
18:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md), in which the people are told
that it is only by reason of their stiffnecked persistency in wickedness
that they render threatened judgment certain, whereas by return to their
God they might prevent the ruin of the kingdom.

[Jeremiah 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 18:11</span></span>

Application of the emblem to Judah. - [Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md). "And now speak to the men of
Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: Thus hath Jahveh said:
Behold, I frame against you evil and devise against you a device. Return
ye, now, each from his evil way, and better your ways and your doings.
[Jer 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md). But they say: There is no
use! For our imaginations will we follow, and each do the stubbornness
of his evil heart. [Jer 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013.md).
Therefore thus hath Jahveh said: Ask now among the heathen! who hath
heard the like? A very horrible thing hath the virgin of Israel done!
[Jer 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014.md). Does the snow of Lebanon
cease from the rock of the field? or do strange, cold trickling waters
dry up? [Jer 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015.md). For my people hath
forgotten me; to the vanity they offer odours; they have made them to
stumble upon their ways, the everlasting paths, to walk in by-paths, a
way not cast up. [Jer 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md). To make
their land a dismay, a perpetual hissing, every one that passeth thereby
shall be astonished and shake his head. [Jer
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017.md). Like the east wind I will
scatter them before the enemy; with the back and not with the face will
I look upon them in the day of their ruin."

[Jer 18:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md)

In [Jer 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md) and [Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md) what was said at [Jer
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md). is applied to Judah. יצר, from
in sense of prepare (cf. [Isa 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011.md);
[Isa 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026).md), is chosen with special
reference to the potter (יוצר). מחשׁבה, the thought, design, here in
virtue of the parallelism: evil plot, as often both with and without
רעה; cf. [Est 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#003.md), [Est
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#005.md); [Est
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#025.md); [Eze
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#010.md). The call to repentance runs
much as do [Jer 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015.md) and [Jer
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#003.md). - But this call the people reject
disdainfully, replying that they are resolved to abide by their evil
courses. ואמרוּ, not: they said, but: they say; the perf. consec. of the
action repeating itself at the present time; cf. Ew. 342, b. 1. נואשׁ as
in [Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025.md); on "stubbornness of
their evil heart," cf. [Jer 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md). By
this answer the prophet makes them condemn themselves out of their own
mouth; cf. [Isa 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md); [Isa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010.md).

[Jer 18:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013.md)

Such obduracy is unheard of amongst the peoples; cf. a like idea in [Jer
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#010.md). שׁעררת = שׁערוּרה, [Jer
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030.md). מאד belongs to the verb:
horrible things hath Israel very much done = very horrible things have
they done. The idea is strengthened by Israel's being designated a
virgin (see on [Jer 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017).md). One could
hardly believe that a virgin could be guilty of such barefaced and
determined wickedness. In [Jer 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014.md).
the public conduct is further described; and first, it is illustrated by
a picture drawn from natural history, designed to fill the people with
shame for their unnatural conduct. But the significance of the picture
is disputed. The questions have a negative force: does it forsake? = it
does not forsake. The force of the first question is conditioned by the
view taken of מצּוּר ; and שׂדי may be either genitive to צוּר, or it
may be the accusative of the object, and be either a poetic form for
שׂדה, or plural c. suff. 1. pers. (my fields). Chr. B. Mich., Schur.,
Ros., Maur., Neum. translate according to the latter view: Does the snow
of Lebanon descending from the rock forsake my fields? i.e., does it
ever cease, flowing down from the rock, to water my fields, the fields
of my people? To this view, however, it is to be opposed, a. that "from
the rock" thus appears superfluous, at least not in its proper place,
since, according to the sense given, it would belong to "snow of
Lebanon;" b. that the figure contains no real illustrative truth. The
watering of the fields of God's people, i.e., of Palestine or Judah, by
the snow of Lebanon could be brought about only by the water from the
melting snow of Lebanon soaking into the ground, and so feeding the
springs of the country. But this view of the supply for the springs that
watered the land cannot be supposed to be a fact of natural history so
well known that the prophet could found an argument on it. Most recent
commentators therefore join מצּוּר שׂדי, and translate: does the snow of
Lebanon cease from the rock of the field (does it disappear)? The use of
עזב with מן is unexampled, but is analogous to עזב חסד מעם, [Gen
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027.md), where, however, עזב is used
transitively.

But even when translated as above, "rock of the field" is variously
understood. Hitz. will have it to be Mount Zion, which in [Jer
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003.md) is called my mountain in the
field, and [Jer 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md), rock of the
plain; and says the trickling waters are the waters of Gihon, these
being the only never-drying water of Jerusalem, the origin of which has
never been known, and may have been commonly held to be from the snow of
Lebanon. Graf and Ng., again, have justly objected that the connection
between the snow of Lebanon and the water-springs of Zion is of too
doubtful a kind, and does not become probable by appeal to [Psa
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003.md), where the dew of Hermon is said
to descend on the mountains of Zion. For it is perfectly possible that a
heavy dew after warm days might be carried to Jerusalem by means of the
cool current of air coming down from the north over Hermon (cf. Del. on
[Psa 133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003).md); but not that the water of
the springs of Jerusalem should have come from Lebanon. Like Ew., Umbr.,
Graf, and Ng., we therefore understand the rock of the field to be
Lebanon itself. But it is not so called as being a detached, commanding
rocky mountain, for this is not involved in the sig. of שׂדי (see on
[Jer 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003).md); nor as bulwark of the
field (Ng.), for צוּר does not mean bulwark, and the change of מצּוּר
into מצור, from מצור, a hemming in, siege, would give a most unsuitable
figure. We hold the "field" to be the land of Israel, whence seen, the
summit of Lebanon, and especially the peak of Hermon covered with
eternal snows might very well be called the rock of the field.

(Note: "Hermon is not a conical mountain like Tabor, with a single lofty
peak and a well-defined base, but a whole mountain mass of many days'
journey in circuit, with a broad crest of summits. The highest of these
lie within the Holy Land, and, according to the measurements of the
English engineers, Majors Scott and Robe (1840), rise to a height of
9376 English feet - summits encompassed by far-stretching mountain
ridges, from whose deep gloomy valleys the chief rivers of the country
take their rise.... Behind the dark green foremost range (that having
valleys clothed with pine and oak forests) high mountains raise their
domes aloft; there is a fir wood sprinkled with snow as with silver, a
marvellous mingling of bright and dark; and behind these rises the broad
central ridge with its peaks covered with a deep and all but everlasting
snows." - Van de Velde, Reise, i. S. 96f. Therewith cf. Robins. Phys.
Geogr. p. 315: "In the ravines round about the highest of the two peaks,
snow, or rather ice, lies the whole year round. In summer this gives the
mountain, when seen from a distance, the appearance of being surrounded
with radiant stripes descending from its crown.")

Observe the omission of the article before Lebanon, whereby it comes
about that the name is joined appellatively to "snow:" the Lebanon-snow.
And accordingly we regard the waters as those which trickle down from
Hermon. The wealth of springs in Lebanon is well known, and the
trickling water of Lebanon is used as an illustration in [Sol
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#015.md). ינּתשׁוּ, are rooted up, strikes
us as singular, since "root up" seems suitable neither for the drying up
of springs, nor for: to be checked in their course. Dav. Kimchi thought,
therefore, it stood for ,ינּתשׁוּomittuntur; but this word has not this
signification. Probably a transposition has taken place, so that we have
ינתשׁו for ינּשׁתוּ, since for נשׁת in Niph. the sig. dry up is
certified by [Isa 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md). The predicate,
too, זרים is singular. Strange waters are in [Kg2
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#024.md) waters belonging to others; but
this will not do here. So Ew. derives זר from זרר, press, urge, and
correspondingly, קרים from קוּר, spring, well up: waters pouring forth
with fierce pressure. In this case, however, the following נוזלים would
be superfluous, or at least feeble. Then, מים קרים, [Pro
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025.md), is cold water; and besides, זרר
means constinxit, compressit, of which root-meaning the sig. to press
forth is a contradiction. There is therefore nothing for it but to keep
to the sig. strange for זרים; strange waters = waters coming from afar,
whose springs are not known, so that they could be stopped up. The
predicate cold is quite in keeping, for cold waters do not readily dry
up, the coldness being a protection against evaporation. Such, then,
will be the meaning of the verse: As the Lebanon-snow does not forsake
the rock, so the waters trickling thence do not dry up. From the
application of this general idea, that in inanimate nature faithfulness
and constancy are found, to Israel's bearing towards God arises a deeper
significance, which shows why this figure was chosen. The rock in the
field points to the Rock of Israel as the everlasting rock, rock of ages
([Isa 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md) and [Isa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004).md), and the cold, i.e., refreshing
waters, which trickle from the rock of the field, point to Jahveh, the
fountain of living water, [Jer 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md)
and [Jer 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md). Although the snow does
not forsake Lebanon, Israel has forgotten the fountain of living water
from which water of life flows to it; cf. [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md).

[Jer 18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015.md)

The application at [Jer 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015.md) is
introduced by a causal כּי. Ew. wrongly translates: that my people
forgot me. כּי means for; and the causal import is founded on the main
idea of [Jer 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013.md) : A very horrible
thing hath Israel done; for it hath done that which is unheard of in the
natural world, it hath forsaken me, the rock of safety; cf. [Jer
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#032.md). They burn odours, i.e., kindle
sacrifices, to the vanity, i.e., the null gods, cf. [Psa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#007.md), i.e., to Baal, [Jer
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009.md); [Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013.md), [Jer
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#017.md). The subject to יכשׁלוּם may be
most simply supplied from the idea of "the vanity:" the null gods made
them to stumble; cf. for this idea [Ch2
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023.md). This seems more natural than to
leave the subject indefinite, in which case the false prophets (cf. [Jer
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#027).md) or the priests, or other
seducers, would be the moving spirits. "The ancient paths" is apposition
to "their ways:" upon their ways, the paths of the old time, i.e., not,
however, the good old believing times, from whose ways the Israelites
have but recently diverged. For עולם never denotes the time not very
long passed away, but always old, immemorial time, here specially the
time of the patriarchs, who walked on the right paths of faithfulness to
God, as in [Jer 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016.md). Hitz. and Graf
have taken "the ancient paths" as subject: the old paths have made the
Israelites to stumble on their ways, which gives a most unnatural idea,
while the "paths of the earliest time" is weakened into "the example of
their ancestors;" and besides, the parallelism is destroyed. As
"by-paths" is defined by the apposition "a way not cast up," so is "on
their ways" by "the ancient paths." The Chet. שׁבוּלי is found only
here; the Keri is formed after [Psa
77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020.md). A way not cast up is one on
which one cannot advance, reach the goal, or on which one suffers hurt
and perishes. - In [Jer 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md) the
consequences of these doings are spoken of as having been wrought out by
themselves, in order thus to bring out the God-ordained causal nexus
between actions and their consequences. To make their land an object of
horror to all that set foot on it. שׁרוּקות occurs only here, while the
Keri שׁריקות is found only in [Jdg
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#016.md) for the piping of shepherds, from
שׁרק, to hiss, to pipe. In connection with שׁמּה as expression of horror
or amazement, Jeremiah elsewhere uses only שׁרקה, cf. [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md); [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md), [Jer
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md); [Jer
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018.md); [Jer
51:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#037.md), so that here the vowelling
should perhaps be שׁרוּקת. The word does not here denote the hissing =
hissing down or against one, by way of contempt, but the sound midway
between hissing and whistling which escapes one when one looks on
something appalling. On "every one that passeth by shall be dismayed,"
cf. [Kg1 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008.md). הניע בּראשׁו only here =
הניע ראשׁ, to move the head to and fro, shake the head; a gesture of
malicious amazement, cf. [Psa 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008.md);
[Psa 109:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#025.md), like מנוד ראשׁ, [Psa
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015.md). - In [Jer
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017.md) the Lord discloses the coming
punishment. Like an east wind, i.e., a violent storm-wind (cf. [Psa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008).md), will I scatter them, cf. [Jer
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#024.md). Because they have turned to Him
the back and not the face (cf. [Jer
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027).md), so will He turn His back on
them in the day of their ruin, cf. [Eze
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md).

[Jeremiah 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 18:18</span></span>

Enmity displayed against the prophet by the people for this discourse,
and prayer for protection from his enemies. - [Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md). "Then said they: Come and let
us plot schemes against Jeremiah; for law shall not be lost to the
priest, and counsel to the wise, and speech to the prophet. Come and let
us smite him with the tongue and not give heed to all his speeches. [Jer
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#019.md). Give heed to me, Jahveh, and
hearken to the voice of them that contend with me! [Jer
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020.md). Shall evil be repaid for good,
that they dig a pit for my soul? Remember how I stood before Thee to
speak good for them, to turn away Thy wrath from them! [Jer
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md). Therefore give their sons to
the famine and deliver them to the sword, that their wives become
childless and widows, and their men slaughtered by death, their young
men smitten by the sword in battle. [Jer
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#022.md). Let a cry be heard from their
houses, when Thou bringest troops upon them suddenly; for they have
digged a pit to take me and laid snares for my feet. [Jer
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#023.md). But Thou Jahveh knowest all
their counsels against me for death: forgive not their iniquity and blot
not out their sin from before Thy face, that they be overthrown before
Thee; in the time of Thine anger deal with them."

Even the solemn words ([Jer 18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015).md)
of the prophet were in vain. Instead of examining themselves and
reforming their lives, the blinded sinners resolve to put the
troublesome preacher of repentance out of the way by means of false
charges. The subject of "and they said" is those who had heard the above
discourse; not all, of course, but the infatuated leaders of the people
who had. They call on the multitude to plot schemes against him, cf.
[Jer 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md). For they have, as they
think, priests, wise men, and prophets to give them instruction out of
the law, counsel, and word, i.e., prophecy - namely, according to their
idea, such as advise, teach, and preach otherwise than Jeremiah, who
speaks only of repentance and judgment. Recent scholars render תּורה
doctrine, which is right etymologically, but not so when judged by the
constant usage, which regards the Torah, the law, as containing the
substance of all the doctrine needed by man to tell him how to bear
himself towards God, or to make his life happy. The Mosaic law is the
foundation of all prophetic preaching; and that the speakers mean תּורה
in this sense is clear from their claiming the knowledge of the Torah as
belonging to the priests; the law was committed to the keeping and
administration of the priests. The "counsel" is that needed for the
conduct of the state in difficult circumstances, and in [Eze
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026.md) it is attributed to the elders;
and "speech" or word is the declarations of the prophets. On that
subject, cf. [Jer 8:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008.md). To smite
with the tongue is to ruin by slanders and malicious charges, cf. [Jer
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002.md), [Jer
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004.md),[Jer
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007.md), where the tongue is compared to a
lying bow and deadly arrow, [Psa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004.md)., [Psa
59:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#008.md), etc. That they had the prophet's
death in view appears from [Jer 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#023.md);
although their further speech: We will not give heed to his words, shows
that in the discourse against which they were so enraged, he had said
"nothing that, according to their ideas, was directly and immediately
punishable with death" (Hitz.); cf. [Jer
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#006.md), [Jer
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#011.md). Against these schemes Jeremiah
cries to God in [Jer 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#019.md) for help
and protection. While his adversaries are saying: People should give no
heed to his speeches, he prays the Lord to give heed to him and to
listen to the sayings of his enemies. "My contenders," who contend
against me, cf. [Jer 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001.md); [Isa
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025.md). - In support of his prayer he
says in [Jer 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020.md) : Shall evil be
repaid for good? cf. [Psa 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012.md). In
his discourses he had in view nothing but the good of the people, and he
appeals to the prayers he had presented to the Lord to turn away God's
anger from the people, cf. [Jer 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007.md).,
[Jer 18:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#019.md). (On "my standing before
Thee," cf. [Jer 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)..md) This good they
seek to repay with ill, by lying charges to dig a pit for his soul,
i.e., for his life, into which pit he may fall; cf. [Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md), where, however, instead of
שׁוּחה ([Jer 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md); [Pro
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014.md); [Pro
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027).md), we have שׁיחה, as in [Jer
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#022.md), Chet. - He prays the Lord to
requite them for this wickedness by bringing on the people that which
Jeremiah had sought to avert, by destroying them with famine, sword, and
disease. The various kinds of death are, [Jer
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md), distributed rhetorically
amongst the different classes of the people. The sons, i.e., children,
are to be given up to the famine, the men to the sword, the young men to
the sword in war. The suffix on הגּרם refers to the people, of which the
children are mentioned before, the men and women after. On הגּר על ידי
ח, cf. [Eze 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md); [Psa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#011.md). "Death," mentioned alongside of
sword and famine, is death by disease and pestilence, as in [Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002.md).

[Jer 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#022.md)

To the terrors of the war and the siege is to be added the cry rising
from all the houses into which hostile troops have burst, plundering and
massacring. To lay snares, as in [Psa
140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006.md); [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004.md). פּח is the spring of the
bird-catcher.

[Jer 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#023.md)

Comprehensive summing up of the whole prayer. As the Lord knows their
design against him for his death, he prays Him not to forgive their sin,
but to punish it. The form תּמחי instead of תּמח ([Neh
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#014).md) is the Aramaic form for תּמחה,
like תּזני, [Jer 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md); cf. Ew. 224, c.
The Chet. והיוּ is the regular continuation of the imperative: and let
them be cast down before Thee. The Keri ויהיוּ would be: that they may
be cast down before Thee. Hitz. wrongly expounds the Chet.: but let them
be fallen before Thee (in Thine eyes), i.e., morally degraded sinners;
for the question is not here one of moral degradation, but of the
punishment of sinners. In the time of Thine anger, i.e., when Thou
lettest loose Thy wrath, causest Thy judgments to come down, deal with
them, i.e., with their transgressions. On עשׂה ב, cf. [Dan
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007.md).

On this prayer of the prophet to God to exterminate his enemies Hitz.
remarks: "The various curses which in his bitter indignation he directs
against his enemies are at bottom but the expression of the thought: Now
may all that befall them which I sought to avert from them." The
Hirschberg Bible takes a deeper grasp of the matter: "It is no prayer of
carnal vengeance against those that hated him, [Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md), [Jer
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#023.md), [Psa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md); [Psa
55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md); but as God had commanded him to
desist ([Jer 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011.md), [Jer
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012).md) from the prayers he had
frequently made for them, [Jer 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020.md),
and as they themselves could not endure these prayers, [Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md), he leaves them to God's
judgments which he had been already compelled to predict to them, [Jer
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#022.md); [Jer
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012.md), [Jer
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#016.md), without any longer resisting
with his entreaties, [Luk 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#009.md); [Ti2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014.md)." In this observation that clause
only is wrong which says Jeremiah merely leaves the wicked to God's
judgments, since he, on the other hand, gives them up thereto, prays God
to carry out judgment on them with the utmost severity. In this respect
the present passage resembles the so-called cursing psalms ([Psa
35:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md); [Psa
109:6-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md); [Psa
59:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014.md); [Psa
69:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#026), etc..md); nor can we say with
Calvin: hanc vehementiam, quoniam dictata fuit a spiritu sancto, non
posse damnari, sed non debere trahi in exemplum, quia hoc singulare fuit
in propheta. For the prophet's prayer is no inspired דבר יהוה, but the
wish and utterance of his heart, for the fulfilment of which he cries to
God; just as in the psalms cited. On these imprecations, cf. Del. on Ps
35 and 109; as also the solid investigation of this point by Kurtz: Zur
Theologie der Ps. IV. die Fluch-und Rachepsalmen in the Dorpat Ztschr.
f. Theol. u. Kirche, vii. (1865), S. 359ff. All these curses are not the
outcome and effusions of personal vengeance against enemies, but flow
from the pure spring of a zeal, not self-regarding at all, for the glory
of God. The enemies are God's enemies, despisers of His salvation. Their
hostility against David and against Jeremiah was rooted in their
hostility against God and the kingdom of God. The advancement of the
kingdom of God, the fulfilment of the divine scheme of salvation,
required the fall of the ungodly who seek the lives of God's servants.
In this way we would seek to defend such words of cursing by appealing
to the legal spirit of the Old Testament, and would not oppose them to
the words of Christ, [Luk 9:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055.md). For
Christ tells us why He blamed the Elias-like zeal of His disciples in
the words: "The Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to
save them." In keeping with this, the peculiar end of Christ's coming on
earth, we find no curses from Him against His enemies and the enemies of
the kingdom of God. But just as the word, "I am not come," etc. ([Luk
9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056).md), does not exclude the truth that
the Father hath given all judgment to Him, so, as Kurtz very justly
remarks, "from our hearing no word of cursing from the mouth of Christ
during His life on earth we cannot infer the absolute inadmissibleness
of all such; still less can we infer that Christ's apostles and
disciples could not at all be justified in using any words of cursing."
And the apostles have indeed uttered curses against obdurate enemies: so
Peter against Simon the Magian, [Act
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020.md); Paul against the high priest
Ananias, [Act 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003.md), against the Jewish
false teachers, [Gal 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#009.md) and [Gal
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012.md), and against Alexander the
coppersmith, [Ti2 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014.md). But these
cases do not annihilate the distinction between the Old and the New
Testaments. Since grace and truth have been revealed in Christ, the Old
Testament standpoint of retribution according to the rigour of the law
cannot be for us the standard of our bearing even towards the enemies of
Christ and His kingdom.
