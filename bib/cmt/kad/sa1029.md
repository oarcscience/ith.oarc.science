### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 29:1</span></span>

Whilst Saul derived no comfort from his visit to the witch at Endor, but
simply heard from the mouth of Samuel the confirmation of his rejection
on the part of God, and an announcement of his approaching fate, David
was delivered, through the interposition of God, from the danger of
having to fight against his own people.

[Sa1 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md)

The account of this is introduced by a fuller description of the
position of the hostile army. "The Philistines gathered all their armies
together towards Aphek, but Israel encamped at the fountain in (at)
Jezreel." This fountain is the present Ain Jald (or Ain Jalt, i.e.,
Goliath's fountain, probably so called because it was regarded as the
scene of the defeat of Goliath), a very large fountain, which issues
from a cleft in the rock at the foot of the mountain on the
north-eastern border of Gilboa, forming a beautifully limpid pool of
about forty or fifty feet in diameter, and then flowing in a brook
through the valley (Rob. Pal. iii. p. 168). Consequently Aphek, which
must be carefully distinguished from the towns of the same name in Asher
([Jos 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030.md); [Jdg
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031).md) and upon the mountains of Judah
([Jos 15:53](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#053).md) and also at Ebenezer
([Sa1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001).md), is to be sought for not
very far from Shunem, in the plain of Jezreel; according to Van de
Velde's Mem., by the side of the present el Afleh, though the situation
has not been exactly determined. The statement in the Onom., "near Endor
of Jezreel where Saul fought," is merely founded upon the Septuagint, in
which בּעין is erroneously rendered ἐν Ἐνδώρ.

[Sa1 29:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002.md)

When the princes of the Philistines (sarne, as in [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003).md) advanced by hundreds and
thousands (i.e., arranged in companies of hundreds and thousands), and
David and his men came behind with Achish (i.e., forming the
rear-guard), the (other) princes pronounced against their allowing David
and his men to go with them. The did not occur at the time of their
setting out, but on the road, when they had already gone some distance
(compare [Sa1 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#011.md) with [Sa1
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001).md), probably when the five princes
([Jos 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003).md) of the Philistines had
effected a junction. To the inquiry, "What are these Hebrews doing?"
Achish replied, "Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of
Israel, who has been with me days already, or years already? and I have
found nothing in him since his coming over unto this day." מאוּמה,
anything at all that could render his suspicious, or his fidelity
doubtful. נפל, to fall away and go over to a person; generally construed
with אל ([Jer 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013.md); [Jer
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019), etc..md) or על ([Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009.md); [Jer
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#014.md); [Ch1
12:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#019).md), but here absolutely, as the
more precise meaning can be gathered from the context.

[Sa1 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004.md)

But the princes, i.e., the four other princes of the Philistines, not
the courtiers of Achish himself, were angry with Achish, and demanded,
"Send the man back, that he may return to his place, which thou hast
assigned him; that he may not go down with us into the war, and may not
become an adversary (satan) to us in the war; for wherewith could he
show himself acceptable to his lord (viz., Saul), if not with the heads
of these men?" הלוא, nonne, strictly speaking, introduces a new question
to confirm the previous question. "Go down to the battle:" this
expression is used as in [Sa1 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#010.md);
[Sa1 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#024.md), because battles were
generally fought in the plains, into which the Hebrews were obliged to
come down from their mountainous land. "These men," i.e., the soldiers
of the Philistines, to whom the princes were pointing.

[Sa1 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#005.md)

To justify their suspicion, the princes reminded him of their song with
which the women in Israel had celebrated David's victory over Goliath
([Sa1 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#007).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 29:6</span></span>

After this declaration on the part of the princes, Achish was obliged to
send David back.

[Sa1 29:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006.md)

With a solemn assertion, - swearing by Jehovah to convince David all the
more thoroughly of the sincerity of his declaration, - Achish said to
him, "Thou art honourable, and good in my eyes (i.e., quite right in my
estimation) are thy going out and coming in (i.e., all thy conduct) with
me in the camp, for I have not found anything bad in thee; but in the
eyes of the princes thou art not good (i.e., the princes do not think
thee honourable, do not trust thee). Turn now, and go in peace, that
thou mayest do nothing displeasing to the princes of the Philistines."

[Sa1 29:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008.md)

Partly for the sake of vindicating himself against this suspicion, and
partly to put the sincerity of Achish's words to the test, David
replied, "What have I done, and what hast thou found in thy servant,
since I was with thee till this day, that I am not to come and fight
against the enemies of my lord the king?" These last words are also
ambiguous, since the king whom David calls his lord might be understood
as meaning either Achish or Saul. Achish, in his goodness of heart,
applies them without suspicion to himself; for he assures David still
more earnestly ([Sa1 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#009).md), that he is
firmly convinced of his uprightness. "I know that thou art good in my
eyes as an angel of God," i.e., I have the strongest conviction that
thou hast behaved as well towards me as an angel could; but the princes
have desired thy removal.

[Sa1 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#010.md)

"And now get up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord
(i.e., Saul, whose subjects David's men all were), who have come with
thee; get ye up in the morning when it gets light for you (so that ye
can see), and go."

[Sa1 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#011.md)

In accordance with this admonition, David returned the next morning into
the land of the Philistines, i.e., to Ziklag; no doubt very light of
heart, and praising God for having so graciously rescued him out of the
disastrous situation into which he had been brought and not altogether
without some fault of his own, rejoicing that "he had not committed
either sin, i.e., had neither violated the fidelity which he owed to
Achish, nor had to fight against the Israelites" (Seb. Schmidt).
