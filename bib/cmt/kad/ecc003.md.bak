### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 3:1</span></span>

"Everything has its time, and every purpose under the heavens its hour."
The Germ. language is poor in synonyms of time. Zckler translates:
Everything has its Frist ..., but by Frist we think only of a fixed term
of duration, not of a period of beginning, which, though not
exclusively, is yet here primarily meant; we have therefore adopted
Luther's excellent translation. Certainly זמן (from זמן, cogn. סמן,
signare), belonging to the more modern Heb., means a Frist (e.g., [Dan
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016).md) as well as a Zeitpunkt, point of
time; in the Semit. (also Assyr. simmu, simanu, with ס) it is the most
common designation of the idea of time. עת is abbreviated either from
ענת (ועד, to determine) or from ענת (from ענה, cogn. אנה, to go towards,
to meet). In the first case it stands connected with מועד on the one
side, and with עדּן (from עדד, to count) on the other; in the latter
case, with עונה, [Exo 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#010.md) (perhaps
also ען and ענת in כען, כּענת). It is difficult to decide this point;
proportionally more, however, can be said for the original ענת
(Palest.-Aram. ענתּא), as also the prep. of participation את is derived
from אנת (meeting, coming together).

(Note: Vid., Orelli's work on the Heb. Synon. der Zeit u. Ewigkeit,
1871. He decides for the derivation from ועד morf ; Fleischer (Levy's
Chald. W.B. II. 572) for the derivation from ענה, the higher power of
אנה, whence (Arab.) inan, right time. We have, under [Job
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001.md), maintained the former
derivation.)

The author means to say, if we have regard to the root signification of
the second conception of time - (1) that everything has its
fore-determined time, in which there lies both a determined point of
time when it happens, and a determined period of time during which it
shall continue; and (2) that every matter has a time appointed for it,
or one appropriate, suitable for it. The Greeks were guided by the right
feeling when they rendered זמן by χρόνος , and עת by καιρός.

Olympiodorus distinguishes too sharply when he understands the former of
duration of time, and the latter of a point of time; while the state of
the matter is this, that by χρόνος the idea comprehends the termini a
quo and ad quem, while by καιρός it is limited to the terminus a quo.
Regarding חפץ, which proceeds from the ground-idea of being inclined to,
and intention, and thus, like πρᾶγμα and χρῆμα, to the general
signification of design, undertaking, res gesta, res.

The illustration commences with the beginning and the ending of the life
of man and (in near-lying connection of thought) of plants.

[Ecclesiastes 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 3:2</span></span>

(Note: These seven verses, 2-8, are in Codd and Edd., like [Jos
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#009.md)., and [Est
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#007.md)., arranged in the form of a song,
so that one עת (time) always stands under another, after the scheme
described in Megilla 16b, Massecheth Sofrim xiii. 3, but without any
express reference to this passage in Koheleth. J has a different manner
of arranging the words, the first four lines of which we here adduce: -

'ēth lāmoth veeth lalěděth 'ēth 'ēth nathu'ǎ lǎ'ǎqor veeth lathǎ'ǎth
'ēth lirpō veeth lǎhǎrog 'ēth livnoth veeth liphrots)

"To be born has its time, and to die has its time; to plant has its
time, and to root up that which is planted has its time." The inf. ללדת
signifies nothing else than to bring forth; but when that which is
brought forth comes more into view than she who brings forth, it is used
in the sense of being born (cf. [Jer
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034), לט = להטּבח.md); ledah, [Hos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md), is the birth; and in the Assyr.,
li-id-tu, li-i-tu, li-da-a-tu, designates posterity, progenies. Since
now lālǎděth has here lāmuth as contrast, and thus does not denote the
birth-throes of the mother, but the child's beginning of life, the
translation, "to be born has its time," is more appropriate to what is
designed than "to bring forth has its time." What Zckler, after Hitzig,
objects that by lěděth a הפץ an undertaking, and thus a conscious,
intended act must be named, is not applicable; for לכּל standing at the
beginning comprehends doing and suffering, and death also (apart from
suicide) is certainly not an intended act, frequently even an
unconscious suffering. Instead of לטעת (for which the form לטּעת

(Note: This Abulwalid found in a correct Damascus ms., Michlol 81b.)

is found, cf. למּוט, [Psa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009).md), the
older language uses לנטע, [Jer 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md).
In still more modern Heb. the expression used would be ליטע, i.e., לטּע
(Shebith ii. 1). עקד has here its nearest signification: to root up
(denom. of עקּד, root), like עקר, [Kg2
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025.md), where it is the Targ. word for
הפּיל (to fell trees).

From out-rooting, which puts an end to the life of plants, the
transition is now made to putting to death.

[Ecclesiastes 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 3:3</span></span>

"To put to death has its time, and to heal has its time; to pull down
has its time, and to build has its time." That harog (to kill) is placed
over against "to heal," Hitzig explains by the remark that harog does
not here include the full consequences of the act, and is fitly rendered
by "to wound." But "to put to death" is nowhere = "nearly to put to
death," - one who is harug is not otherwise to be healed than by
resurrection from the dead, [Eze 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#006.md).
The contrast has no need for such ingenuity to justify it. The striking
down of a sound life stands in contrast to the salvation of an
endangered life by healing, and this in many situations of life,
particularly in war, in the administration of justice, and in the
defence of innocence against murder or injury, may be fitting. Since the
author does not present these details from a moral point of view, the
time here is not that which is morally right, but that which, be it
morally right or not, has been determined by God, the Governor of the
world and Former of history, who makes even that which is evil
subservient to His plan. With the two pairs of γένεσις καὶ φθορά there
are two others associated in [Ecc 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#003.md);
with that, having reference, 2b, to the vegetable world, there here
corresponds one referring to buildings; to פּרוץ (synon. הרוס, [Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010).md) stands opposed בּנות (which is
more than גּדור), as at [Ch2 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005.md).

These contrasts between existence and non-existence are followed by
contrasts within the limits of existence itself: -

[Ecclesiastes 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 3:4</span></span>

"To weep has its time, and to laugh has its time; to mourn has its time,
and to dance has its time." It is possible that the author was led by
the consonance from livnoth to livkoth, which immediately follows it;
but the sequence of the thoughts is at the same time inwardly mediated,
for sorrow kills and joy enlivens, Sir. 32:21-24. ספוד is particularly
lamentation for the dead, [Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md);
and רקוד, dancing (in the more modern language the usual word for
hholēl, kirkēr, hhāgǎg) at a marriage festival and on other festal
occasions.

It is more difficult to say what leads the author to the two following
pairs of contrasts: -

[Ecclesiastes 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 3:5</span></span>

"To throw stones has its time, and to gather together stones has its
time; to embrace has its time, and to refrain from embracing has its
time." Did the old Jewish custom exist at the time of the author, of
throwing three shovelfuls of earth into the grave, and did this lead him
to use the phrase השׁ אבּ? But we do not need so incidental a connection
of the thought, for the first pair accords with the specific idea of
life and death; by the throwing of stones a field is destroyed, [Kg2
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025.md), or as expressed at [Kg2
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#019.md) is marred; and by gathering the
stones together and removing them (which is called סקּל), it is brought
under cultivation. Does לה, to embrace, now follow because it is done
with the arms and hands? Scarcely; but the loving action of embracing
stands beside the hostile, purposely injurious throwing of stones into a
field, not exclusively ([Kg2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#016).md),
but yet chiefly (as e.g., at [Pro
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#020).md) as referring to love for women;
the intensive in the second member is introduced perhaps only for the
purpose of avoiding the paronomasia lirhhoq mahhavoq.

The following pair of contrasts is connected with the avoiding or
refraining from the embrace of love: -

[Ecclesiastes 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 3:6</span></span>

"To seek has its time, and to lose has its time; to lay up has its time,
and to throw away has its time." Vaihinger and others translate לאבּד,
to give up as lost, which the Pih. signifies first as the expression of
a conscious act. The older language knows it only in the stronger sense
of bringing to ruin, making to perish, wasting ([Pro
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003).md). But in the more modern
language, אבד, like the Lat. perdere, in the sense of "to lose," is the
trans. to the intrans. אבד, e.g., Tahoroth; viii. 3, "if one loses
(המאבּד) anything," etc.; Sifri, at [Deu
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#019), "he who has lost (מאבּד.md) a
shekel," etc. In this sense the Palest.-Aram. uses the Aphel אובד, e.g.,
Jer. Meza ii. 5, "the queen had lost (אובדת) her ornament." The
intentional giving up, throwing away from oneself, finds its expression
in להשׁ.

The following pair of contrasts refers the abandoning and preserving to
articles of clothing: -

[Ecclesiastes 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 3:7</span></span>

7a. "To rend has its time, and to sew has its time." When evil tidings
come, when the tidings of death come, then is the time for rending the
garments ([Sa2 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#031).md), whether as a
spontaneous outbreak of sorrow, or merely as a traditionary custom. -
The tempest of the affections, however, passes by, and that which was
torn is again sewed together.

Perhaps it is the recollection of great calamities which leads to the
following contrasts: -

7b. "To keep silence has its time, and to speak has its time." Severe
strokes of adversity turn the mind in quietness back upon itself; and
the demeanour most befitting such adversity is silent resignation (cf.
[Kg2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#003.md), [Kg2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#005).md). This mediation of the thought is
so much the more probable, as in all these contrasts it is not so much
the spontaneity of man that comes into view, as the pre-determination
and providence of God.

The following contrasts proceed on the view that God has placed us in
relations in which it is permitted to us to love, or in which our hatred
is stirred up: -

[Ecclesiastes 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 3:8</span></span>

"To love has its time, and to hate has its time; war has its time, and
peace has its time." In the two pairs of contrasts here, the contents of
the first are, not exclusively indeed ([Psa
120:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#007).md), but yet chiefly referred to
the mutual relations of peoples. It is the result of thoughtful
intention that the quodlibet of 2 x 7 pairs terminates this for and
against in "peace;" and, besides, the author has made the termination
emphatic by this, that here "instead of infinitives, he introduces
proper nouns" (Hitz.).

[Ecclesiastes 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 3:9</span></span>

Since, then, everything has its time depending not on human influence,
but on the determination and providence of God, the question arises:
"What gain hath he that worketh in that wherewith he wearieth himself?"
It is the complaint of [Ecc 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003.md) which
is here repeated. From all the labour there comes forth nothing which
carries in it the security of its continuance; but in all he does man is
conditioned by the change of times and circumstances and relations over
which he has no control. And the converse of this his weakness is
short-sightedness.

[Ecclesiastes 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 3:10</span></span>

"I saw the travail, which God gave to the children of men to fatigue
themselves with it - : He hath well arranged everything beautiful in its
appointed time; He hath also put eternity in their heart, so that man
cannot indeed wholly search through from beginning to end the work which
God accomplisheth." As at [Ecc 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#014.md),
ראיתי is here seeing in the way of research, as elsewhere, e.g., at [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md), it is as the result of research.
In [Ecc 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010.md) the author says that he
closely considered the labour of men, and in [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md) he states the result. It is
impossible to render the word ענין everywhere by the same German (or
English) word: [Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013.md), wearisome
trouble; [Ecc 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md), business; here:
Geschftigkeit, the idea is in all the three places the same, viz., an
occupation which causes trouble, costs effort. What presented itself to
the beholder was (1) that He (viz., God, cf. [Ecc
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010.md) and [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011).md) has made everything beautiful in
its time. The author uses יפה as synon. of טוב ([Ecc
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017).md); also in other languages the
idea of the beautiful is gradually more and more generalized. The suffix
in בּעתּו does not refer to God, but to that which is in the time; this
word is = ἐν καιρῷ ιδίῳ (Symm.), at its proper time (vid., [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md); [Psa
104:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027.md); [Jer
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024), etc..md), since, as with יחדּו
(together with) and כּלּו (every one), the suffix is no longer thought
of as such. Like יפה, בעתו as pred. conception belongs to the verb: He
has made everything beautiful; He has made everything (falling out) at
its appointed time. - The beauty consists in this, that what is done is
not done sooner or later than it ought to be, so as to connect itself as
a constituent part to the whole of God's work. The pret. עשׂה is to be
also interpreted as such: He "has made," viz., in His world-plan, all
things beautiful, falling out at the appointed time; for that which
acquires an actual form in the course of history has a previous ideal
existence in the knowledge and will of God (vid., under [Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011.md); [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026).md).

That which presented itself to the beholder was - (2) the fact that He
(God) had put את־העלם in their hearts (i.e., the hearts of men). Gaab
and Spohn interpret 'olam in the sense of the Arab. 'ilam, knowledge,
understanding; and Hitz., pointing the word accordingly עלם, translates:
"He has also placed understanding in their heart, without which man,"
etc. The translation of אשׁר אשׁלי is not to be objected to; מבּ is,
however, only seldom a conjunction, and is then to be translated by eo
quod, [Exo 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011.md); [Kg2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#003.md), [Kg2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#006.md), [Kg2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#016.md), which is not appropriate here;
it will thus be here also a prep., and with asher following may mean
"without which," as well as "without this, that" = "besides that"
(Venet. ἄνευ τοῦ ὃτι, "except that"), as frequently כּי אפס, e.g., at
[Amo 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md). But that Arab. 'ilam is
quite foreign to the Heb., which has no word עלם in the sense of "to
rise up, to be visible, knowable," which is now also referred

(Note: Vid., Fried. Delitzsch's Assyr. Stud. (1874), p. 39. Otherwise
Fleischer, who connects 'alima, "to know," with 'alam, "to conceal," so
that to know = to be concealed, sunk deep, initiated in something (with
ba of the obj., as sh'ar, whence shâ'ir, the poet as "one who marks").)

to for the Assyr. as the stem-word of עילם = highland. It is true Hitzig
believes that he has found the Heb. עלם = wisdom, in Sir. 6:21, where
there is a play on the word with נעלם, "concealed:" σοφία γὰρ κατὰ τὸ
ὄνομα αὐτῆς ἐστί, καὶοὐ πολλοῖς ἐστὶ φανερά. Drusius and Eichhorn have
here already taken notice of the Arab. 'ilam; but Fritzsche with right
asks, "Shall this word as Heb. be regarded as traceable only here and
falsely pointed only at [Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md), and
shall no trace of it whatever be found in the Chald., Syr., and
Rabbin.?" We have also no need of it. That Ben-Sira has etymologically
investigated the word חכמה as going back to חכם, R. chap, "to be firm,
shut up, dark" (vid., at [Psa 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008).md),
is certainly very improbable, but so much the more probable (as already
suggested by Drusius) that he has introduced

(Note: Grtz translates eth-ha'olam by "ignorance" (vid., Orelli, p. 83).
R. Achwa in the Midrash has added here the scriptio defectiva with the
remark, שהועלם וגו, "for the mysterious name of God is concealed from
them.")

into חכמה, after the Aram. אכם, nigrescere, the idea of making dark.
Does eth-ha'olam in this passage before us then mean "the world"
(Jerome, Luther, Ewald), or "desire after the knowledge of the world"
(Rashi), or "worldly-mindedness" (Gesen., Knobel)? The answer to this
has been already given in my Psychol. p. 406 (2nd ed.): "In post-bibl.
Heb. 'olam denotes not only 'eternity' backwards and forwards as
infinite duration, but also 'the world' as that which endures for ever
(αἰών, seculum); the world in this latter sense is, however, not yet
known

(Note: In the Phoen. also, 'olam, down to a late period, denotes not the
world, but eternity: melek 'olam, βασιλεὺς αἰώνος (αἰώνιος), seculo
frugifero on a coin = the fruit-bringing 'olam (Αἰών).)

to the bibl. language, and we will thus not be able to interpret the
words of Koheleth of the impulse of man to reflect on the whole world."
In itself, the thought that God has placed the whole world in man's
heart is not untrue: man is, indeed, a micro-cosmos, in which the
macrocosmos mirrors itself (Elster), but the connection does not favour
it; for the discussion does not proceed from this, that man is only a
member in the great universe, and that God has given to each being its
appointed place, but that in all his experience he is conditioned by
time, and that in the course of history all that comes to him, according
to God's world-plan, happens at its appointed time. But the idea by
which that of time, את (זמן), is surpassed is not the world, but
eternity, to which time is related as part is to the whole (Cicero, Inv.
i. 26. 39, tempus est pars quaedam aeternitatis). The Mishna language
contains, along with the meaning of world, also this older meaning of
'olam, and has formed from it an adv. עולמית, aeterne. The author means
to say that God has not only assigned to each individually his appointed
place in history, thereby bringing to the consciousness of man the fact
of his being conditioned, but that He has also established in man an
impulse leading him beyond that which is temporal toward the eternal: it
lies in his nature not to be contented with the temporal, but to break
through the limits which it draws around him, to escape from the bondage
and the disquietude within which he is held, and amid the ceaseless
changes of time to console himself by directing his thoughts to
eternity.

This saying regarding the desiderium aeternitatis being planted in the
heart of man, is one of the profoundest utterances of Koheleth. In fact,
the impulse of man shows that his innermost wants cannot be satisfied by
that which is temporal. He is a being limited by time, but as to his
innermost nature he is related to eternity. That which is transient
yields him no support, it carries him on like a rushing stream, and
constrains him to save himself by laying hold on eternity. But it is not
so much the practical as the intellectual side of this endowment and
this peculiar dignity of human nature which Koheleth brings her to view.

It is not enough for man to know that everything that happens has its
divinely-ordained time. There is an instinct peculiar to his nature
impelling him to pass beyond this fragmentary knowledge and to
comprehend eternity; but his effort is in vain, for (3) "man is unable
to reach unto the work which God accomplisheth from the beginning to the
end." The work of God is that which is completing itself in the history
of the world, of which the life of individual men is a fragment. Of this
work he says, that God has wrought it עשׂה; because, before it is
wrought out in its separate "time," it is already completed in God's
plan. Eternity and this work are related to each other as the
accomplished and the being accomplished, they are interchangeably the
πλήρωμα to each other. ימצא is potential, and the same in conception as
at [Ecc 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md); [Job
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md); [Job
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023.md); a knowledge is meant which
reaches to the object, and lays hold of it. A laying hold of this work
is an impossibility, because eternity, as its name 'olam denotes, is the
concealed, i.e., is both forwards and backwards immeasurable. The
desiderium aeternitatis inherent in man thus remains under the sun
unappeased. He would raise himself above the limits within which he is
confined, and instead of being under the necessity of limiting his
attention to isolated matters, gain a view of the whole of God's work
which becomes manifest in time; but this all-embracing view is for him
unattainable.

If Koheleth had known of a future life - which proves that as no
instinct in the natural world is an allusion, so also the impulse toward
the eternal, which is natural to man, is no illusion-he would have
reached a better ultimatum than the following: -

[Ecclesiastes 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 3:12</span></span>

"Thus I then perceived that among them (men) there is nothing better
than to enjoy themselves, and indulge themselves in their life." The
resignation would acquire a reality if לע טוב meant "to do good," i.e.,
right (lxx, Targ., Syr., Jer., Venet.); and this appears of necessity to
be its meaning according to [Ecc 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md).
But, with right, Ginsburg remarks that nowhere else - neither at [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md), nor [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md); [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md); [Ecc
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md) - is this moral rendering given to
the ultimatum; also טוב ור, 13a, presupposes for לע טוב a eudemonistic
sense. On the other hand, Zckler is right in saying that for the meaning
of עשות תוב, in the sense of "to be of good cheer" (Luth.), there is no
example. Zirkel compares εὖ πράττειν, and regards it as a Graecism. But
it either stands ellipt. for לע לו טוב (= להיטיב לו), or, with Grtz, we
have to read טוב לראות; in any case, an ethical signification is here
excluded by the nearest connection, as well as by the parallels; it is
not contrary to the view of Koheleth, but this is not the place to
express it. Bam is to be understood after baadam, [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md). The plur., comprehending men,
here, as at [Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md), wholly passes
over into the individualizing sing.

But this enjoyment of life also, Koheleth continues, this advisedly the
best portion in the limited and restrained condition of man, is placed
beyond his control: -

[Ecclesiastes 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 3:13</span></span>

"But also that he should eat and drink, and see good in all his labour,
is for every man a gift of God." The inverted and yet anacoluthistic
formation of the sentence is quite like that at [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md). כּל־הא signifies, properly, the
totality of men = all men, e.g., [Psa
116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011.md); but here and at 5:18; 12:13,
the author uses the two words so that the determ. second member of the
st. constr. does not determine the first (which elsewhere sometimes
occurs, as bethulath Israel, a virgin of Israel, [Deu
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#019).md): every one of men (cf. πᾶς τις
βροτῶν). The subst. clause col-haadam is subject: every one of men, in
this that he eats ... is dependent on God. Instead of מיּד the word מתּת
(abbrev. from מתּנת) is here used, as at [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md). The connection by vegam is
related to the preceding adversat.: and (= but) also (= notwithstanding
that), as at [Ecc 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007.md), [Neh
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#008.md), cf. [Jer
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010.md), where gam is strengthened by
becol-zoth. As for the rest, it follows from [Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md), in connection with [Ecc
2:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md), that for Koheleth εὐποΐ́α and
εὐθυμία reciprocally condition each other, without, however, a
conclusion following therefrom justifying the translation "to do good,"
[Ecc 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md). Men's being conditioned in
the enjoyment of life, and, generally, their being conditioned by God
the Absolute, has certainly an ethical end in view, as is expressed in
the conclusion which Koheleth now reaches: -

[Ecclesiastes 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 3:14</span></span>

"Thus I discerned it then, that all that God will do exists for ever;
nothing is to be added to it, and nothing taken from it: God has thus
directed it, that men should fear before Him." This is a conclusion
derived from the facts of experience, a truth that is valid for the
present and for the time to come. We may with equal correctness render
by quidquid facit and quidquid faciet. But the pred. shows that the fut.
expression is also thought of as fut.; for הוּ יה לע does not mean: that
is for ever (Hitz.), which would be expressed by the subst. clause הוּא
לעולם; but: that shall be for ever (Zck.), i.e., will always assert its
validity. That which is affirmed here is true of God's directing and
guiding events in the natural world, as well as of the announcements of
His will and His controlling and directing providence in the history of
human affairs. All this is removed beyond the power of the creature to
alter it. The meaning is not that one ought not to add to or to take
from it ([Deu 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md); [Pro
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006).md), but that such a thing cannot be
done (vid., Sir. 18:5). And this unchangeableness characterizing the
arrangements of God has this as its aim, that men should fear Him who is
the All-conditioning and is Himself unconditioned: he has done it that
they (men) should fear before Him, אשׂה שׁ, fecit ut; cf. [Eze
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027.md). ποιεῖν ἳνα, [Rev
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015.md); and "fear before Him," as at
[Ecc 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md).; cf. [Ch1
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#030.md) with [Psa
96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md). The unchangeableness of God's
action shows itself in this, that in the course of history similar
phenomena repeat themselves; for the fundamental principles, the causal
connections, the norms of God's government, remain always the same.

[Ecclesiastes 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 3:15</span></span>

"That which is now hath been long ago; and that which will be hath
already been: God seeketh after that which was crowded out." The words:
"hath been long ago" (הוּא כּבר), are used of that which the present
represents as something that hath been, as the fruit of a development;
the words: "hath already been" (היה כּבר), are used of the future (ל
אשׁר, τὸ μέλλον, vid., Gesen. 132. 1), as denying to it the right of
being regarded as something new. The government of God is not to be
changed, and does not change; His creative as well as His moral ordering
of the world produces with the same laws the same phenomena (the ו
corresponds to this line of thought here, as at [Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014).md) - God seeks את־ן (cf. [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007); Ewald, 277d.md). Hengstenberg
renders: God seeks the persecuted (lxx, Symm., Targ., Syr.), i.e.,
visits them with consolation and comfort. Nirdaph here denotes that
which is followed, hunted, pressed, by which we may think of that which
is already driven into the past; that God seeks, seeks it purposely, and
brings it back again into the present; for His government remains
always, and brings thus always up again that which hath been. Thus
Jerome: Deut instaurat quod abiit; the Venet.: ὃ τηεὸς ζητήσει τὸ
ἀπεληλαμένον; and thus Geier, among the post-Reform. interpreters:
praestat ut quae propulsa sunt ac praeterierunt iterum innoventur ac
redeant; and this is now the prevailing exposition, after Knobel, Ewald,
and Hitzig. The thought is the same as if we were to translate: God
seeks after the analogue. In the Arab., one word in relation to another
is called muradif, if it is cogn. to it; and mutaradifat is the
technical expression for a synonym. In Heb. the expression used is שׁמות
נרדּפים, they who are followed the one by another, - one of which, as it
were, treads on the heels of another. But this designation is mediated
through the Arab. In evidence of the contrary, ancient examples are
wanting.

[Ecclesiastes 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 3:16</span></span>

"And, moreover, I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that wickedness
was there." The structure of the verse is palindromic, like [Ecc
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#006.md); [Ecc
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010.md); [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md). We might also render מקום as the
so-called casus absol., so that שׁם ... מק is an emphatic בּמקום
(Hitz.), and the construction like [Jer
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005.md); but the accentuation does not
require this (cf. [Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001).md); and why
should it not be at once the object to ראיתי, which in any case it
virtually is? These two words שׁמה הרשׁע might be attribut. clauses:
where wickedness (prevails), for the old scheme of the attributive
clause (the tsfat) is not foreign to the style of this book (vid., [Ecc
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013.md), nathan = nethano; and [Ecc
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012), raithi = reithiha.md); but why not
rather virtual pred. accus.: vidi locum juris (quod) ibi impietas? Cf.
[Neh 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023.md) with [Psa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025.md). The place of "judgment" is the
place where justice should be ascertained and executed; and the place of
"righteousness," that where righteousness should ascertain and
administer justice; for mishpat is the rule (of right), and the
objective matter of fact; tsedek, a subjective property and manner of
acting. רשׁע is in both cases the same: wickedness (see under [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md), which bends justice, and is the
contrary of tsěděk, i.e., upright and moral sternness. רשׁע elsewhere,
like mělěk̂ tsěděk, preserves in p. its e, but here it takes rank along
with חסד, which in like manner fluctuates (cf. [Psa
130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007.md) with [Pro
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#021).md). שׁמּה is here = שׁם, as at
[Psa 122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005.md), etc.; the locative ah
suits the question Where? as well as in the question Whither? - He now
expresses how, in such a state of things, he arrived at satisfaction of
mind.

[Ecclesiastes 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 3:17</span></span>

"I said in mine heart: God shall judge the righteous as well as the
wicked: for there is there a time for every purpose and for every work."
Since "the righteous" stands first, the word ישׁפּט has here the double
sense of judging \[richtens = setting upright\] = acting uprightly,
justly by one, as in the shofteni of [Psa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md); [Psa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md), etc., and of judging =
inflicting punishment. To the righteous, as well as to the wicked,

(Note: The lxx (in Aquila's manner): σὺν τὸν δίκαιον καὶ σὺν τὸν ἀσεβῆ -
according to the Talm. hermeneut. rule, that where the obj. is
designated by את, with that which is expressly named, something else is
associated, and is to be thought of along with it.)

God will administer that which of right belongs to them. But this does
not immediately happen, and has to be waited for a long time, for there
is a definite time for every undertaking ([Ecc
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001).md), and for (על, in the more modern
form of the language, interchanges promiscue with אל ht and ל, e.g.,
[Jer 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015.md); [Eze
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003); Ewald, 217i.md) every work there is
a "time." This שׁם, defended by all the old interpreters, cannot have a
temporal sense: tunc = in die judicii (Jerome, Targ.), cf. [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md); 36:13, for "a time of judgment
there is for all one day" is not intended, since certainly the שׁם (day
of judgment) is this time itself, and not the time of this time. Ewald
renders שׁם as pointing to the past, for he thus construes: the
righteous and the unrighteous God will judge (for there is a time for
everything), and judge (vav thus explicat., "and that too," "and
indeed") every act there, i.e., everything done before. But this שׁם is
not only heavy, but also ambiguous and purposeless; and besides, by this
parenthesizing of the words וגו עת כּי for there is a time for
everything, the principal thought, that with God everything, even His
act of judgment, has its time, is robbed of its independence and of the
place in the principal clause appropriate to it. But if שׁם is
understood adverbially, it certainly has a local meaning connected with
it: there, viz., with God, apud Deum; true, for this use of the word
[Gen 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md) affords the only example,
and it stands there in the midst of a very solemn and earnest address.
Therefore it lies near to read, with Houbig., Dderl., Palm., and Hitz.,
שׁם, "a definite time ... has He (God) ordained;" שׂום (שׂים) is the
usual word for the ordinances of God in the natural world and in human
history ([Pro 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#029.md); [Exo
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013.md); [Num
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#023.md); [Hab
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012), etc..md), and, as in the Assyr.
simtuv, so the Heb. שׂימה (שׂוּמה), [Sa2
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#032.md), signifies lot or fate, decree.

(Note: Vid., Schrader's Keilsch. u. A. T. p. 105, simtu ubilsu, i.e.,
fate snatched him away (Heb. simah hovilathhu), cf. Fried. Delitzsch's
Assyr. Stud. p. 66f.)

With this reading, Elster takes exception to the position of the words;
but at [Jdg 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#019.md) also the object goes
before שׂם, and "unto every purpose and for every work" is certainly the
complement of the object-conception, so that the position of the words
is in reality no other than at [Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md); [Dan
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#017.md). Quite untenable is Herzfeld's
supposition (Frst, Vaih.), that שׁם has here the Talm. signification:
aestimat, taxat, for (1) this שׁוּם = Arab. sham, has not על, but the
accus. after it; (2) the thought referring to the tie on which [Ecc
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md) rests is thereby interrupted.
Whether we read שׂם, or take שׁם in the sense of עמּו ([Job
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002.md); [Job
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014), etc..md), the thought is the same,
and equally congruous: God will judge the innocent and the guilty; it
shall be done some time, although not so soon as one might wish it, and
think necessary, for God has for every undertaking and for every work
its fixed time, also its judicial decision (vid., at [Psa
74:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003).md); He permits wickedness, lets it
develope itself, waits long before He interposes (vid., under [Isa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004)..md).

Reflecting on God's delay to a time hidden from men, and known only to
Himself, Koheleth explains the matter to himself in the following verse:
-

[Ecclesiastes 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 3:18</span></span>

"Thus I said then in mine heart: (it happeneth) for the sake of the
children of men that God might sift them, and that they might see that
they are like the cattle, they in themselves." Regarding על־דּב for the
sake of = on account of as at [Ecc
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md), vid., under [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004), where it signifies after (κατά.md)
the state of the matter. The infin. לבּ is not derived from בּוּר. -
לּבוּר, [Ecc 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md), is only the
metaplastic form of לבר or לברר - but only from בּרר, whose infin. may
take the form בּר, after the form רד, to tread down, [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md), שׁך, to bow, [Jer
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026.md); but nowhere else is this infin.
form found connected with a suff.; קחם, [Hos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md), would be in some measure to be
compared, if it could be supposed that this = בּקחתּם, sumendo eos. The
root בר proceeds, from the primary idea of cutting, on the one side to
the idea of separating, winnowing, choosing out; and, on the other, to
that of smoothing, polishing, purifying (vid., under [Isa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002).md). Here, by the connection, the
meaning of winnowing, i.e., of separating the good from the bad, is
intended, with which, however, as in לברר, [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), the meaning of making clear,
making light, bringing forward into the light, easily connects itself
(cf. Shabbath 138a, 74a), of which the meaning to winnow (cf. להבר, [Jer
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011).md) is only a particular form;

(Note: Not "to sift," for not בּרר but רקּד, means "to sift" (properly,
"to make to keep up," "to agitate"); cf. Shebith v. 9.)

cf. Sanhedrin 7b: "when a matter is clear, brwr, to thee (free from
ambiguity) as the morning, speak it out; and if not, do not speak it."

In the expression לב האל, the word האל is, without doubt, the subject,
according to Gesen. 133. 2. 3; Hitz. regards האל as genit., which,
judged according to the Arab., is correct; it is true that for
li-imti-ḥânihim allahi (with genit. of the subj.), also allahu (with
nominat. of the subj.) may be used; but the former expression is the
more regular and more common (vid., Ewald's Gramm. Arab. 649), but not
always equally decisive with reference to the Heb. usus loq. That God
delays His righteous interference till the time appointed beforehand, is
for the sake of the children of men, with the intention, viz., that God
may sift them, i.e., that, without breaking in upon the free development
of their characters before the time, He may permit the distinction
between the good and the bad to become manifest. Men, who are the obj.
to לב, are the subject to לראותו to be supplied: et ut videant; it is
unnecessary, with the lxx, Syr., and Jerome, to read ולראות (= וּלהר):
ut ostenderet. It is a question whether המּה

(Note: המּה שׁהם בּהמה thus accented rightly in F. Cf. Michlol 216a.)

is the expression of the copula: sunt (sint), or whether hēmmah lahěm is
a closer definition, co-ordinate with shehem behēmah. The remark of
Hitzig, that lahěm throws back the action on the subject, is not clear.
Does he suppose that lahem belongs to liroth? That is here impossible.
If we look away from lahem, the needlessly circumstantial expression הם
... שה can still be easily understood: hemmah takes up, as an echo,
behemah, and completes the comparison (compare the battology in [Hos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002).md). This play upon words musically
accompanying the thought remains also, when, according to the
accentuation שׁה בהם ה לה, we take hemmah along with lahem, and the
former as well as the latter of these two words is then better
understood. The ל in להם is not that of the pure dat. (Aben Ezra: They
are like beasts to themselves, i.e., in their own estimation), but that
of reference, as at [Gen 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020.md), "as
for Ishmael;" cf. [Psa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md); [Kg2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#007.md); cf. אל, [Sa1
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#027.md), etc. Men shall see that they are
cattle (beasts), they in reference to themselves, i.e., either they in
reference to themselves mutually (Luther: among themselves), or: they in
reference to themselves. To interpret the reference as that of mutual
relation, would, in looking back to [Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md), commend itself, for the
condemnation and oppression of the innocent under the appearance of
justice is an act of human brutishness. But the reason assigned in [Ecc
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019.md) does not accord with this
reciprocal rendering of lahem. Thus lahem will be meant reflexively, but
it is not on that account pleonastic (Knobel), nor does it ironically
form a climax: ipsissimi = hchstselbst (Ewald, 315a); but "they in
reference to themselves" is = they in and of themselves, i.e., viewed as
men (viewed naturally). If one disregards the idea of God's interfering
at a future time with the discordant human history, and, in general, if
one loses sight of God, the distinction between the life of man and of
beast disappears.

[Ecclesiastes 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 3:19</span></span>

"For the children of men are a chance, and the beast a chance, and they
both have once chance: as the death of the one, so that death of the
other, and they have all one breath; and there is no advantage to a man
over a beast, for all is vain." If in both instances the word is pointed
מקרה (lxx), the three-membered sentence would then have the form of an
emblematical proverb (as e.g., [Pro
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025).md): "For as the chance of men, so
(vav of comparison) the chance of the beast; they have both one chance."
מקרה with segol cannot possibly be the connecting form (Luzz.), for in
cases such as מע שׂ ם, [Isa 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md), the
relation of the words is appositional, not genitival. This form מקר,
thus found three times, is vindicated by the Targ. (also the Venet.) and
by Mss.; Joseph Kimchi remarks that "all three have segol, and are thus
forms of the absolutus." The author means that men, like beasts, are in
their existence and in their death influenced accidentally, i.e., not of
necessity, and are wholly conditioned, not by their own individual
energy, but by a power from without - are dependent beings, as Solon
(Herod. i. 32) says to Croesus: "Man is altogether συμφορή," i.e., the
sport of accident. The first two sentences mean exclusively neither that
men (apart from God) are, like beasts, the birth of a blind accident
(Hitz.), nor that they are placed under the same law of transitoriness
(Elst.); but of men, in the totality of their being, and doing, and
suffering, it is first said that they are accidental beings; then, that
which separates them from this, that they all, men like beasts, are
finally exposed to one, i.e., to the same fate. As is the death of one,
so is the death of the other; and they all have one breath, i.e., men
and beasts alike die, for this breath of life (חיּים רוּח, which
constitutes a beast - as well as a man a חיּה נפשׁ) departs from the
body ([Psa 104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029).md). In זה ... זה (as
at [Ecc 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005.md); [Exo
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020), and frequently.md), להם (mas. as
genus potius) is separately referred to men and beasts. With the Mishnic
בּמות = bibl. כּמו (cf. Maaser Sheni, v. 2), the כּמות here used has
manifestly nothing to do. The noun מותר, which in the Book of Proverbs
([Pro 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023.md); [Pro
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005), not elsewhere.md) occurs in the
sense of profit, gain, is here in the Book of Koheleth found as a synon.
of יתרון, "preference," advantage which is exclusively peculiar to it.
From this, that men and beasts fall under the same law of death, the
author concludes that there is no preference of a man to a beast; he
doubtless means that in respect of the end man has no superiority; but
he expresses himself thus generally because, as the matter presented
itself to him, all-absorbing death annulled every distinction. He looks
only to the present time, without encumbering himself with the
historical account of the matter found in the beginning of the Tra; and
he adheres to the external phenomenon, without thinking, with the
Psalmist in Ps 49, that although death is common to man with the beast,
yet all men do not therefore die as the beast does. That the beast dies
because it must, but that in the midst of this necessity of nature man
can maintain his freedom, is for him out of view. הבל הכּל, the
ματαιότης, which at last falls to man as well as to the beast, throws
its long dark shadows across his mind, and wholly shrouds it.

[Ecclesiastes 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 3:20</span></span>

"All goes hence to one place; all has sprung out of the dust, and all
returns to the dust again." The "one place" is (as at [Ecc
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#006).md) the earth, the great graveyard
which finally receives all the living when dead. The art. of the first
העפר is that denoting species; the art. of the second is retrospective:
to the dust whence he sprang (cf. [Psa
104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md); [Psa
146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004).md); otherwise, [Gen
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019.md) (cf. [Job
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#015).md), "to dust shalt thou return,"
shalt become dust again. From dust to dust (Sir. 40:11; 41:10) is true
of every living corporeal thing. It is true there exists the possibility
that with the spirit of the dying man it may be different from what it
is with the spirit of the dying beast, but yet that is open to question.

"Who knoweth with regard to the spirit of the children of men, whether
it mounteth upward; and with regard to the spirit of a beast, whether it
goeth downward to the earth?" The interrogative meaning of העלה and
הירדת is recognised by all the old translators: lxx, Targ., Syr.,
Jerome, Venet., Luther. Among the moderns, Heyder (vid., Psychol. p.
410), Hengst., Hahn, Dale, and Bullock take the h in both cases as the
article: "Who knoweth the spirit of the children of men, that which
goeth upward ... ?" But (1) thus rendered the question does not accord
with the connection, which requires a sceptical question; (2) following
"who knoweth," after [Ecc 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md); [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md), cf. [Jos
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#014.md), an interrogative continuance of
the sentence was to be expected; and (3) in both cases היא stands as
designation of the subject only for the purpose of marking the
interrogative clause (cf. [Jer 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014).md),
and of making it observable that ha'olah and hayorěděth are not appos.
belonging as objects to רוח and ורוח. It is questionable, indeed,
whether the punctuation of these words, העלה and היּרדת, as they lie
before us, proceeds from an interrogative rendering. Saadia in Emunoth
c. vi., and Juda Halevi in the Kuzri ii. 80, deny this; and so also do
Aben Ezra and Kimchi. And they may be right. For instead of העלה, the
pointing ought to have been העלה (cf. העלה, [Job
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025).md) when used as interrog. an
ascendens; even before א the compens. lengthening of the interrog. ha is
nowhere certainly found

(Note: For ה is to be read with a Pattach in [Jdg
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#031.md); [Jdg
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#005.md); [Neh
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#011.md); cf. under [Gen
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#009.md); [Gen
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#021.md). In [Num
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022.md) the ה of האישׁ is the art., the
question is not formally designated.

instead of the virtual reduplication; and thus also the parallel היּר is
not to be judged after היּי, [Lev
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#019.md), הדּ, [Eze
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#029.md), - we must allow that the
punctation seeks, by the removal of the two interrog. ha (ה), to place
that which is here said in accord with [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md). But there is no need for this.
For יודע מי does not quite fall in with that which Lucretius says (Lib.
I):

"Ignoratur enim quae sit natura animai,

Nata sit an contra nascentibus insinuetur?

An simul intereat nobiscum morte diremta?"

It may certainly be said of mi yode'a, as of ignoratur, that it does not
exclude every kind of knowledge, but only a sure and certain knowledge
resting on sufficient grounds; interire and ירד לם are also scarcely
different, for neither of the two necessarily signifies annihilation,
but both the discontinuance of independent individual existence. But the
putting of the question by Koheleth is different, for it discloses more
definitely than this by Lucretius, the possibility of a different end
for the spirit of a man from that which awaits the spirit of a beast,
and thus of a specific distinction between these two principles of life.
In the formation even of the dilemma: Whether upwards or downwards,
there lies an inquiring knowledge; and it cannot surprise us if Koheleth
finally decides that the way of the spirit of a man is upwards, although
it is not said that he rested this on the ground of demonstrative
certainty. It is enough that, with the moral necessity of a final
judgment beyond the sphere of this present life, at the same time also
the continued existence of the spirit of man presented itself to him as
a postulate of faith. One may conclude from the desiderium aeternitatis
([Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011).md) implanted in man by the
Creator, that, like the instincts implanted in the beasts, it will be
calculated not for deception, but for satisfaction; and from the למעלה,
[Pro 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#024.md) - i.e., the striving of a
wise man rising above earthly, temporary, common things, - that death
will not put an end to this striving, but will help it to reach its
goal. But this is an indirect proof, which, however, is always inferior
to the direct in force of argument. He presupposes that the Omnipotence
and Wisdom which formed the world is also at the same time Love. Thus,
though at last, it is faith which solves the dilemma, and we see from
[Ecc 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md) that this faith held sway
over Koheleth. In the Book of Sirach, also, the old conception of Hades
shows itself as yet dominant; but after the οὐκ ἀτηάνατος υἱὸς
ἀντηρώπου, 17:25, we read towards the end, where he speaks of Elias: καὶ
τὰρ ἡμεῖς ζωῇ ζησόμεθα, 48:11. In the passage before us, Koheleth
remains in doubt, without getting over it by the hand of faith. In a
certain reference the question he here proposes is to the present day
unanswered; for the soul, or, more correctly, according to the biblical
mode of conception the spirit from which the soul-life of all corporeal
beings proceeds, is a monas, and as such is indestructible. Do the
future of the beast's soul and of man's soul not then stand in a
solidaric mutual relation to each other? In fact, the future life
presents to us mysteries the solution of which is beyond the power of
human thought, and we need not wonder that Koheleth, this sober-minded,
intelligent man, who was inaccessible to fantastic self-deception,
arrives, by the line of thought commenced at [Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md), also again at the ultimatum.

[Ecclesiastes 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ecc 3:22</span></span>

"Thus I then saw that there is nothing better than that a man should
rejoice in his works, for that is his portion; for who can bring him to
this, that he gains an insight into that which shall be after him?"
Hengstenberg, who has decided against the interrog. signification of the
twice-repeated ה in [Ecc 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021.md), now
also explains אהריו ... בּמה, not: What shall become of him after it
(his death)? but: What further shall be done after the state in which he
now finds himself? Zckler, although rightly understanding both ה as well
as אחריו (after him = when he will be separated, or separates from this
life, [Ecc 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014.md); [Ecc
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#003.md); cf. [Gen
24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067).md), yet proceeds on that
explanation of Hengstenberg's, and gives it the rendering: how things
shall be on the earth after his departure. But (1) for this thought, as
[Ecc 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md) shows, the author had a more
suitable form of expression; (2) this thought, after the author has,
[Ecc 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021.md), explained it as uncertain
whether the spirit of a man in the act of death takes a different path
from that of a beast, is altogether aside from the subject, and it is
only an apologetic tendency not yet fully vanquished which here
constrains him. The chain of thought is however this: How it will be
with the spirit of a man when he dies, who knows? What will be after
death is thus withdrawn from human knowledge. Thus it is best to enjoy
the present, since we connect together ([Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024).md) labour and enjoyment mediated
thereby. This joy of a man in his work - i.e., as [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md) : which flows from his work as a
fountain, and accompanies him in it ([Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015).md) - is his portion, i.e., the best
which he has of life in this world. Instead of בּמה־שּׁ, the punctuation
is בּמה, because שׁיהיה אחריו is a kindred idea; vid.' regarding מה
under [Ecc 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md). And לראות בּ is sued,
because it is not so much to be said of the living, that he cannot
foresee how it shall be with him when he dies, as that he can gain no
glimpse into that world because it is an object that has for him no
fixity.
