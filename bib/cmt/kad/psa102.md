[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 102:0</span></span>

Prayer of a Patient Sufferer for Himself and for the Jerusalem That Lies
in Ruins

[Psa 101:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001.md) utters the sigh: When
wilt Thou come to me? and Ps 102 with the inscription: Prayer for an
afflicted one when he pineth away and poureth forth his complaint before
Jahve, prays, Let my prayer come unto Thee. It is to be taken, too, just
as personally as it sounds, and the person is not to be construed into a
nation. The song of the עני is, however, certainly a national song; the
poet is a servant of Jahve, who shares the calamity that has befallen
Jerusalem and its homeless people, both in outward circumstances and in
the very depth of his soul. עטף signifies to pine away, languish, as in
[Psa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#003.md), [Isa
57:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#016.md); and שׁפך שׂיחו to pour out
one's thoughts and complaints, one's anxious care, as in [Psa
142:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#003.md), cf. [Sa1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015.md).

As in the case already with many of the preceding Psalms, the
deutero-Isaianic impression accompanies us in connection with this Psalm
also, even to the end; and the further we get in it the more marked does
the echo of its prophetical prototype become. The poet also allies
himself with earlier Psalms, such as Ps 22, Ps 69, and [Psa
79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md), although himself capable of
lofty poetic flight, in return for which he makes us feel the absence of
any safely progressive unfolding of the thoughts.

[Psalms 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 102:1</span></span>

The Psalm opens with familiar expressions of prayer, such as rise in the
heart and mouth of the praying one without his feeling that they are of
foreign origin; cf. more especially [Psa
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013.md); [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md); [Psa
88:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#003.md); and on [Psa
102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md) : [Psa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009) (Hide not Thy face from me.md); [Psa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017) (ביום צר לי.md); [Psa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003.md) and frequently (Incline Thine ear
unto me); [Psa 56:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#010) (ביום אקוא.md); [Psa
69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008.md); [Psa
143:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#007) (מהר ענני.md).

[Psalms 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 102:3</span></span>

From this point onward the Psalm becomes original. Concerning the Beth
in בעשׁן, vid., on [Psa 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md). The
reading כּמו קד (in the Karaite Ben-Jerucham) enriches the lexicon in
the same sense with a word which has scarcely had any existence. מוקד
(Arabic mauḳid) signifies here, as in other instances, a hearth. נחרוּ
is, as in [Psa 69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md), Niphal: my bones
are heated through with a fever-heat, as a hearth with the smouldering
fire that is on it. הוּכּה (cf. יגודּוּ, [Psa
94:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#021).md) is used exactly as in [Hos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md), cf. [Psa
121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005.md). The heart is said to dry up
when the life's blood, of which it is the reservoir, fails. The verb
שׁכח is followed by מן of dislike. On the cleaving of the bones to the
flesh from being baked, i.e., to the skin (Arabic bašar, in accordance
with the radical signification, the surface of the body = the skin, from
בשׂר, to brush along, rub, scrape, scratch on the surface), cf. [Job
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#020.md); [Lam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#008). ל (אל.md) with דּבק is used just
like בּ. It is unnecessary, with Bttcher, to draw מקּול אנחתי to [Psa
102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005.md). Continuous straining of the
voice, especially in connection with persevering prayer arising from
inward conflict, does really make the body waste away.

[Psalms 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 102:6</span></span>

קאת (construct of קאת or קאת from קאה, vid., Isaiah, at [Isa
34:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011).md), according to the lxx, is
the pelican, and כּוס is the night-raven or the little horned-owl.

(Note: The lxx renders it: I am like a pelican of the desert, I am
become as a night-raven upon a ruined place (οἰκοπέδῳ). In harmony with
the lxx, Saadia (as also the Arabic version edited by Erpenius, the
Samaritan Arabic, and Abulwald) renders קאת by Arab. qûq (here and in
[Lev 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#018.md); [Deu
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#017.md); [Isa
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#017).md), and כוס by Arab. bûm; the
latter (bum) is an onomatopoetic name of the owl, and the former
(k\[uk\[) does not even signify the owl or horned-owl (although the
small horned-owl is called um kuéik in Egypt, and in Africa abu kuéik;
vid., the dictionaries of Bocthor and Marcel s.v. chouette), but the
pelican, the "long-necked water-bird" (Damiri after the lexicon el-‛Obâb
of Hasan ben-Mohammed el-Saghani). The Graeco-Veneta also renders קאת
with πελεκάν, - the Peshito, however, with Syr. qāqā'. What Ephrem on
[Deu 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#017.md) and the Physiologus Syrus
(ed. Tychsen, p. 13, cf. pp. 110 f). say of Syr. qāqā', viz., that it is
a marsh-bird, is very fond of its young ones, dwells in desolate places,
and is incessantly noisy, likewise points to the pelican, although the
Syrian lexicographers vary. Cf. also Oedmann, Vermischte Sammlungen,
Heft 3, Cap. 6. (Fleischer after a communication from Rodiger.))

דּמה obtains the signification to be like, equal (aequalem esse), from
the radical signification to be flat, even, and to spread out flat (as
the Dutch have already recognised). They are both unclean creatures,
which are fond of the loneliness of the desert and ruined places. To
such a wilderness, that of the exile, is the poet unwillingly
transported. He passes the nights without sleep (שׁקד, to watch during
the time for sleep), and is therefore like a bird sitting lonesome
(בּודד, Syriac erroneously נודד) upon the roof whilst all in the house
beneath are sleeping. The Athnach in [Psa
102:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#008.md) separates that which is come to
be from the ground of the "becoming" and the "becoming" itself. His
grief is that his enemies reproach him as one forsaken of God. מהולל,
part. Poal, is one made or become mad, [Ecc
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md) : my mad ones = those who are mad
against me. These swear by him, inasmuch as they say when they want to
curse: "God do unto thee as unto this man," which is to be explained
according to [Isa 65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015.md); [Jer
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022.md).

[Psalms 102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 102:9</span></span>

Ashes are his bread (cf. [Lam 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#016).md),
inasmuch as he, a mourner, sits in ashes, and has thrown ashes all over
himself, [Job 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md); [Eze
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030.md). The infected שׁקּוי has שׁקּוּ
= שׁקּוּו for its principal form, instead of which it is שׁקּוּי in [Hos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#007.md). "That Thou hast lifted me up and
cast me down" is to be understood according to [Job
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#022.md). First of all God has taken away
the firm ground from under his feet, then from aloft He has cast him to
the ground - an emblem of the lot of Israel, which is removed from its
fatherland and cast into exile, i.e., into a strange land. In that
passage the days of his life are כּצל נטוּי, like a lengthened shadow,
which grows longer and longer until it is entirely lost in darkness,
[Psa 109:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#023.md). Another figure follows:
he there becomes like an (uprooted) plant which dries up.

[Psalms 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 102:12</span></span>

When the church in its individual members dies off on a foreign soil,
still its God, the unchangeable One, remains, and therein the promise
has the guarantee of its fulfilment. Faith lays hold upon this guarantee
as in Ps 90. It becomes clear from [Psa
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008.md) and [Lam
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019.md) how תּשׁב is to be understood.
The Name which Jahve makes Himself by self-attestation never falls a
prey to the dead past, it is His ever-living memorial (זכר, [Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015).md). Thus, too, will He restore
Jerusalem; the limit, or appointed time, to which the promise points is,
as his longing tells the poet, now come. מועד, according to [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md); [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md), is the juncture, when the
redemption by means of the judgment on the enemies of Israel shall dawn.
לחננהּ, from the infinitive חנן, has ĕ, flattened from ă, in an entirely
closed syllable. רצה seq. acc. signifies to have pleasure in anything,
to cling to it with delight; and חנן, according to [Pro
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021.md), affirms a compassionate, tender
love of the object. The servants of God do not feel at home in Babylon,
but their loving yearning lingers over the ruins, the stones and the
heaps of the rubbish ([Neh 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#002).md), of
Jerusalem.

[Psalms 102:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 102:15</span></span>

With וייראוּ we are told what will take place when that which is
expected in [Psa 102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md) comes to pass,
and at the same time the fulfilment of that which is longed for is
thereby urged home upon God: Jahve's own honour depends upon it, since
the restoration of Jerusalem will become the means of the conversion of
the world - a fundamental thought of [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md) (cf. more particularly [Isa
59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md); [Isa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002).md), which is also called to mind in
the expression of this strophe. This prophetic prospect ([Isa
40:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001).md) that the restoration of
Jerusalem will take place simultaneously with the glorious parusia of
Jahve re-echoes here in a lyric form. כּי, [Psa
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md), states the ground of the
reverence, just as [Psa 102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md) the
ground of the praise. The people of the Exile are called in [Psa
102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md) הערער, from ערר, to be naked:
homeless, powerless, honourless, and in the eyes of men, prospectless.
The lxx renders this word in [Jer 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md)
ἀγριομυρίκη, and its plural, formed by an internal change of vowel,
ערוער, in [Jer 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006.md) ὄνος ἄγριος, which
are only particularizations of the primary notion of that which is stark
naked, neglected, wild. [Psa 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md) is
an echo off [Psa 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025.md). In the mirror
of this and of other Psalms written in times of affliction the Israel of
the Exile saw itself reflected.

[Psalms 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 102:18</span></span>

The poet goes on advancing motives to Jahve for the fulfilment of his
desire, by holding up to Him what will take place when He shall have
restored Zion. The evangel of God's redemptive deed will be written down
for succeeding generations, and a new, created people, i.e., a people
coming into existence, the church of the future, shall praise God the
Redeemer for it. דּור אחרון as in [Psa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#014.md); [Psa
78:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#004.md). עם נברא like עם נולד Ps 22:32,
perhaps with reference to deutero-Isaianic passages like [Isa
43:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017.md). On [Psa
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md), cf. [Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md); in [Psa
102:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021.md) (cf. [Isa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007.md); [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md) the deutero-Isaianic colouring
is very evident. And [Psa 102:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021.md) rests
still more verbally upon [Psa 79:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#011.md).
The people of the Exile are as it were in prison and chains (אסיר), and
are advancing towards their destruction (בּני תמוּתה), if God does not
interpose. Those who have returned home are the subject to לספּר. בּ in
[Psa 102:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023.md) introduces that which
takes place simultaneously: with the release of Israel from servitude is
united the conversion of the world. נקבּץ occurs in the same connection
as in [Isa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004.md). After having thus
revelled in the glory of the time of redemption the poet comes back to
himself and gives form to his prayer on his own behalf.

[Psalms 102:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 102:23</span></span>

On the way (ב as in [Psa 110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007).md) - not
"by means of the way" (ב as in [Psa
105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018).md), in connection with which one
would expect of find some attributive minuter definition of the way -
God hath bowed down his strength (cf. [Deu
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002).md); it was therefore a troublous,
toilsome way which he has been led, together with his people. He has
shortened his days, so that he only drags on wearily, and has only a
short distance still before him before he is entirely overcome. The
Chethb כחו (lxx ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ) may be understood of God's irresistible
might, as in [Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md); [Job
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#018.md), but in connection with it the
designation of the object is felt to be wanting. The introductory אמר
(cf. [Job 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#002).md), which announces a
definite moulding of the utterance, serves to give prominence to the
petition that follows. In the expression אל־תּעלני life is conceived of
as a line the length of which accords with nature; to die before one's
time is a being taken up out of this course, so that the second half of
the line is not lived through (Ps 55:24, [Isa
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010).md). The prayer not to sweep him
away before his time, the poet supports not by the eternity of God in
itself, but by the work of the rejuvenation of the world and of the
restoration of Israel that is to be looked for, which He can and will
bring to an accomplishment, because He is the ever-living One. The
longing to see this new time is the final ground of the poet's prayer
for the prolonging of his life. The confession of God the Creator in
[Psa 102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md) reminds one in its form of
[Isa 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#013.md), cf. [Psa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#024.md). המּה in [Psa
102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027.md) refers to the two great
divisions of the universe. The fact that God will create heaven and
earth anew is a revelation that is indicated even in [Isa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md), but is first of all expressed
more fully and in many ways in the second part of the Book of Isaiah,
viz., [Isa 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md), [Isa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016.md); [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md). It is clear from the agreement
in the figure of the garment ([Isa
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md), cf. [Psa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009).md) and in the expression (עמד,
perstare, as in [Isa 66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022).md) that the
poet has gained this knowledge from the prophet. The expressive אתּה
הוּא, Thou art He, i.e., unalterably the same One, is also taken from
the mouth of the prophet, [Isa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004.md);
[Isa 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md); [Isa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004.md); [Isa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012.md); הוּא is a predicate, and
denotes the identity (sameness) of Jahve (Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i.
63). In v. 29 also, in which the prayer for a lengthening of life tapers
off to a point, we hear [Isa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002.md);
[Isa 66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md) re-echoed. And from the
fact that in the mind of the poet as of the prophet the post-exilic
Jerusalem and the final new Jerusalem upon the new earth under a new
heaven blend together, it is evident that not merely in the time of
Hezekiah or of Manasseh (assuming that [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001) are by the old Isaiah.md), but also
even in the second half of the Exile, such a perspectively foreshortened
view was possible. When, moreover, the writer of the Epistle to the
Hebrews at once refers [Psa 102:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md)
to Christ, this is justified by the fact that the God whom the poet
confesses as the unchangeable One is Jahve who is to come.
