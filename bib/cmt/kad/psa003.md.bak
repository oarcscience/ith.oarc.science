### [Psalms Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

(In the Hebrew, v.1 is the designation 'A Psalm of David, when he fled
before Absolom, his son.'; from then on v.1-8 in English translation
corresponds to v.2-9 in the Hebrew)

Morning Hymn of One in Distress, but Confident in God

The two Psalms forming the prologue, which treat of cognate themes, the
one ethical, from the standpoint of the חכמה, and the other related to
the history of redemption from the standpoint of the נבואה, are now
followed by a morning prayer; for morning and evening prayers are surely
the first that one expects to find in a prayer-and hymn-book. The
morning hymn, [Psa 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md), which has
the mention of the "holy hill" in common with [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), naturally precedes the evening
hymn [Psa 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md); for that [Psa
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md) is an evening hymn as some are
of opinion, rests on grammatical misconception.

With [Psa 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md), begin, as already
stated, the hymns arranged for music. By מזמור לדוד, a Psalm of David,
the hymn which follows is marked as one designed for musical
accompaniment. Since מזמור occurs exclusively in the inscriptions of the
Psalms, it is no doubt a technical expression coined by David. זמר (root
זם) is an onomatopoetic word, which in Kal signifies to cut off, and in
fact to prune or lop (the vine) (cf. Arabic zbr, to write, from the
buzzing noise of the style or reed on the writing material). The
signification of singing and playing proper to the Piel are not
connected with the signification "to nip." For neither the rhythmical
division (Schultens) nor the articulated speaking (Hitz.) furnish a
probable explanation, since the caesura and syllable are not natural but
artificial notions, nor also the nipping of the strings (Bttch., Ges.),
for which the language has coined the word נגּן (of like root with נגע).
Moreover, the earliest passages in which זמרה and זמּר occur ([Gen
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#011.md); [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md); [Jdg
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#003).md), speak rather of song than music
and both words frequently denote song in distinction from music, e.g.,
[Psa 98:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#005.md); [Psa
81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003.md), cf. [Sol
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012.md). Also, if זמּר originally means,
like ψάλλειν, carpere (pulsare) fides, such names of instruments as
Arab. zemr the hautboy and zummâra the pipe would not be formed. But
זמּר means, as Hupfeld has shown, as indirect an onomatope as canere,
"to make music" in the widest sense; the more accurate usage of the
language, however, distinguishes זמּר and שׁיר as to play and to sing.
With בּ of the instrument זמּר denotes song with musical accompaniment
(like the Aethiopic זמר instrumento canere) and זמרה (Aram. זמר) is
sometimes, as in [Amo 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023.md),
absolutely: music. Accordingly מזמור signifies technically the music and
שׁיר the words. And therefore we translate the former by "Psalm," for ὁ
ψαλμός ἐστιν - says Gregory of Nyssa - ἡ διὰ τοῦ ὀργάνου τοῦ μουσικοῦ
μελωδία ᾠδὴ δὲ ἡ διὰ στόματος γενομένου τοῦ μέλους μετὰ ῥημάτων
ἐκφώνησις.

That [Psa 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md) is a hymn arranged for
music is also manifest from the סלה which occurs here 3 times. It is
found in the Psalter, as Bruno has correctly calculated, 71 times (17
times in the 1st book, 30 in the 2nd, 20 in the 3rd, 4 in the 4th) and,
with the exception of the anonymous Ps 66, [Psa
67:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md), always in those that are
inscribed by the name of David and of the psalmists famed from the time
of David. That it is a marginal note referring to the Davidic
Temple-music is clearly seen from the fact, that all the Psalms with סלה
have the למנצּח which relates to the musical execution, with the
exception of eight ([Psa 32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md), 50, [Psa
82:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md), 83, [Psa
87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md), 89, [Psa
143:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001).md) which, however, from the
designation מזמור are at least manifestly designed for music. The
Tephilla of Habbakuk, Hab 3, the only portion of Scripture in which סלה
occurs out of the Psalter, as an exception has the למנצח at the end.
Including the three סלה of this tephilla, the word does not occur less
than 74 times in the Old Testament.

Now as to the meaning of this musical nota bene, 1st, every explanation
as an abbreviation, - the best of which is = סב למעלה השּׁר (turn
thyself towards above i.e., towards the front, O Singer! therefore: da
capo) - is to be rejected, because such abbreviations fail of any
further support in the Old Testament. Also 2ndly, the derivation from
שׁלה = סלה silere, according to which it denotes a pause, or orders the
singers to be silent while the music strikes up, is inadmissible,
because סלה in this sense is neither Hebrew nor Aramaic and moreover in
Hebrew itself the interchange of שׁ with ס (שׁריון, סריון) is extremely
rare. There is but one verbal stem with which סלה can be combined, viz.,
סלל or סלה (סלא). The primary notion of this verbal stem is that of
lifting up, from which, with reference to the derivatives סלּם a ladder
and מסלּה in the signification an ascent, or steps, [Ch2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#011.md), comes the general meaning for
סלה, of a musical rise. When the tradition of the Mishna explains the
word as a synonym of נצח and the Targum, the Quinta, and the Sexta (and
although variously Aquila and sometimes the Syriac version) render it in
accordance therewith "for ever (always)," - in favour of which Jerome
also at last decides, Ep. ad Marcellam "quid sit Sela", - the original
musical signification is converted into a corresponding logical or
lexical one. But it is apparent from the διάψαλμα of the lxx (adopted by
Symm., Theod., and the Syr.), that the musical meaning amounts to a
strengthening of some kind or other; for διάψαλμα signifies, according
to its formation (-μα = -μενον), not the pause as Gregory of Nyssa
defines it: ἡ μεταξὺ τῆς ψαλμῳδιάς γενμένη κατὰ τὸ ἀθρόον ἐπηρέμησις
πρὸς ὑποδοχὴν τοῦ θεόθεν ἐπικρινομένου νοήματος, but either the
interlude, especially of the stringed instruments, (like διαύλιον
\[διαύλειον\], according to Hesychius the interlude of the flutes
between the choruses), or an intensified playing (as διαψάλλειν
τριγώνοις is found in a fragment of the comedian Eupolis in Athenaeus of
the strong play of triangular harps).

(Note: On the explanations of διάψαλμα in the Fathers and the old
lexicographers. Vid., Suicer's Thes. Eccl. and Augusti's Christl.
Archologie, Th. ii.)

According to the pointing of the word as we now have it, it ought
apparently to be regarded as a noun סל with the ah of direction
(synonymous with גּוה, up! [Job
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029).md); for the omission of the Dagesh
beside the ah of direction is not without example (cf. [Kg1
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#040.md) גּתה which is the proper reading,
instead of גּתּה, and referred to by Ewald) and the -, with Dag. forte
implicitum, is usual before liquids instead of -, as, פּדּנהּ [Gen
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#002.md), הרה [Gen
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#010.md) instead of paddannah, harrah, as
also כּרמלה [Sa1 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#005.md) instead of
כּרמלּה. But the present pointing of this word, which is uniformly
included in the accentuation of the Masoretic verse, is scarcely the
genuine pointing: it looks like an imitation of נצח. The word may
originally have been pronounced סלּה (elevatio after the form בּתּה,
דּלּה). The combination סלה הגּיון [Psa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md), in which הגיון refers to the
playing of the stringed instruments ([Psa
92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004).md) leads one to infer that סלה is a
note which refers not to the singing but to the instrumental
accompaniment. But to understand by this a heaping up of weighty
expressive accords and powerful harmonies in general, would be to
confound ancient with modern music. What is meant is the joining in of
the orchestra, or a reinforcement of the instruments, or even a
transition from piano to forte.

Three times in this Psalm we meet with this Hebrew forte. In sixteen
Psalms (7, 10, 21, 44, 47, 48, 50, 54, 60, 61, 75, 81, 82, 83, 85, 143)
we find it only once; in fifteen Psalms (4, 9, 24, 39, 49, 52, 55, 57,
59, 62, 67, 76, 84, 87, 88), twice; in but seven Psalms (3, 32, 46, 56,
68, 77, 140 and also Hab), three times; and only in one (Ps 89), four
times. It never stands at the beginning of a Psalm, for the ancient
music was not as yet so fully developed, that סלה should absolutely
correspond to the ritornello. Moreover, it does not always stand at the
close of a strophe so as to be the sign of a regular interlude, but it
is always placed where the instruments are to join in simultaneously and
take up the melody - a thing which frequently happens in the midst of
the strophe. In the Psalm before us it stands at the close of the 1st,
2nd, and 4th strophes. The reason of its omission after the third is
evident.

Not a few of the Psalms bear the date of the time of the persecution
under Saul, but only this and probably [Psa
63:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md) have that of Absolom. The
Psalter however contains other Psalms which reflect this second time of
persecution. It is therefore all the more easy to accept as tradition
the inscription: when he fled before Absolom, his son. And what is there
in the contents of the Psalm against this statement? All the leading
features of the Psalm accord with it, viz., the mockery of one who is
rejected of God [Sa2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#007.md)., the danger
by night [Sa2 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#001.md), the multitudes of
the people [Sa2 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#013.md); [Sa2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#011.md), and the high position of honour
held by the psalmist. Hitzig prefers to refer this and the following
Psalm to the surprize by the Amalekites during David's settlement in
Ziklag. But since at that time Zion and Jerusalem were not free some
different interpretation of [Psa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md)
becomes necessary. And the fact that the Psalm does not contain any
reference to Absalom does not militate against the inscription. It is
explained by the tone of [Sa2 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md)
\[[Sa2 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033.md) Engl.\]. And if Psalms
belonging to the time of Absalom's rebellion required any such reference
to make them known, then we should have none at all.

[Psalms 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 3:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 3:2-3) The first strophe contains the lament concerning the
existing distress. From its combination with the exclamative מה, רבּוּ
is accented on the ultima (and also in [Psa
104:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024).md); the accentuation of the perf.
of verbs עע very frequently (even without the Waw consec.) follows the
example of the strong verb, Ges. ֗67 rem. 12. A declaration then takes
the place of the summons and the רבּים implied in the predicate רבּוּ
now becomes the subject of participial predicates, which more minutely
describe the continuing condition of affairs. The ל of לנפשׁי signifies
"in the direction of," followed by an address in [Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001) (= "to".md), or, as here and
frequently (e.g., [Gen 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007).md) followed
by narration (= "of," concerning). לנפשׁי instead of לי implies that the
words of the adversaries pronounce a judgment upon his inmost life, or
upon his personal relationship to God. ישׁוּעתה is an intensive form for
ישׁוּעה, whether it be with a double feminine termination (Ges., Ew.,
Olsh.), or, with an original (accusative) ah of the direction: we regard
this latter view, with Hupfeld, as more in accordance with the usage and
analogy of the language (comp. Ps 44:27 with [Psa
80:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#003.md), and לילה prop. νύκτα, then as
common Greek ἡ νύκτα νύχθα). God is the ground of help; to have no more
help in Him is equivalent to being rooted out of favour with God. Open
enemies as well as disconcerted friends look upon him as one henceforth
cast away. David had plunged himself into the deepest abyss of
wretchedness by his adultery with Bathsheba, at the beginning of the
very year in which, by the renewal of the Syro-Ammonitish war, he had
reached the pinnacle of worldly power. The rebellion of Absolom belonged
to the series of dire calamities which began to come upon him from that
time. Plausible reasons were not wanting for such words as these which
give up his cause as lost.

[Psalms 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 3:3</span></span>

(Heb.: 3:4-5) But cleansed by penitence he stands in a totally different
relationship to God and God to him from that which men suppose. Every
hour he has reason to fear some overwhelming attack but Jahve is the
shield which covers him behind and before (בּעד constr. of בּעד = Arab.
ba‛da, prop. pone, post). His kingdom is taken from him, but Jahve is
his glory. With covered head and dejected countenance he ascended the
Mount of Olives ([Sa2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030).md), but
Jahve is the "lifter up of his head," inasmuch as He comforts and helps
him. The primary passage of this believing utterance "God is a shield"
is [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md) (cf. [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029).md). Very far from praying in vain,
he is assured, that when he prays his prayer will be heard and answered.
The rendering "I cried and He answered me" is erroneous here where אקרא
does not stand in an historical connection. The future of sequence does
not require it, as is evident from [Psa
55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017.md). (comp. on [Psa
120:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001).md); it is only an expression of
confidence in the answer on God's part, which will follow his prayer. In
constructions like קולי אקרא, Hitzig and Hupfeld regard קולי as the
narrower subject-notion beside the more general one (as [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md); [Psa
69:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011); 83:19.md): my voice - I cried; but
the position of the words is not favourable to this in the passage
before us and in [Psa 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md); [Psa
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007.md); [Psa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005.md); [Psa
66:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#017.md); [Psa
142:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#002.md), [Isa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#009.md), though it may be in [Psa
69:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011.md); [Psa
108:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#002.md). According to Ew. 281, c, קולי
is an accusative of more precise definition, as without doubt in [Isa
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030.md) cf. [Psa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007.md); [Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md).; the cry is thereby described
as a loud cry.

(Note: Bttcher, Collectanea pp. 166f., also adopts the view, that נפשׁי,
פּי, קולי are each appositum vicarium subjecti and therefore nomin. in
such passages. But 1) the fact that את never stands beside them is
explained by the consideration that it is not suited to an adverbial
collateral definition. And 2) that elsewhere the same notions appear as
direct subjects, just as 3) that elsewhere they alternate with the
verbal subject-notion in the parallel member of the verse ([Psa
130:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#005.md); [Pro
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#004).md) - these last two admit of no
inference. The controverted question of the syntax is, moreover, an old
one and has been treated of at length by Kimchi in his Book of Roots s.
r. אוה.)

To this cry, as ויּענני as being a pure mood of sequence implies,
succeeds the answer, or, which better corresponds to the original
meaning of ענה (comp. Arab. ‛nn, to meet, stand opposite) reply;

(Note: Vid., Redslob in his treatise: Die Integritat der Stelle Hos.
vii. 4-10 in Frage gestellt S. 7.)

and it comes from the place whither it was directed: מהר קדשוּ. He had
removed the ark from Kirjath Jeraim to Zion. He had not taken it with
him when he left Jerusalem and fled before Absolom, [Sa2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#025.md). He was therefore separated by a
hostile power from the resting-place of the divine presence. But his
prayer urged its way on to the cherubim-throne; and to the answer of Him
who is enthroned there, there is no separating barrier of space or
created things.

[Psalms 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 3:5</span></span>

(Heb.: 3:6-7) That this God will protect him, His protection during the
past night is now a pledge to him in the early morning. It is a
violation of the rules of grammar to translate ואישׁנה: I shall go to
sleep, or: I am going to sleep. The 1 pers. fut. consec. which is
indicated by the ו, is fond of taking an ah of direction, which gives
subjective intensity to the idea of sequence: "and thus I then fell
asleep," cf. [Psa 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005.md); [Psa
119:55](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#055.md), and frequently, [Gen
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#006.md), and more especially so in the
later style, [Ezr 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003.md); [Neh
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#021.md), vid., Ges. 49, 2, Bttcher, Neue
Aehrenlese, No. 412. It is a retrospective glance at the past night.
Awaking in health and safety, he feels grateful to Him to whom he owes
it: יהוה יסמכני. It is the result of the fact that Jahve supports him,
and that God's hand is his pillow.

(Note: Referred to the other David, [Psa
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006.md) has become an Easter-morning call,
vid., Val. Herberger's Paradies-Blmlein aus dem Lustgarten der Psalmen
(Neue Ausg. 1857) S. 25.)

Because this loving, almighty hand is beneath his head ([Sol
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006).md) he is inaccessible and therefore
also devoid of fear. שׁית (שׁוּת) carries its object in itself: to take
up one's position, as in [Isa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#007.md),
synon. חנה [Psa 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003.md) and שׂים [Kg1
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#012.md), cf. ἐπιτιθέναι τινί. David does
not put a merely possible case. All Israel, that is to say ten
thousands, myriads, were gone over to Absolom. Here, at the close of the
third strophe, סלה is wanting because the לא אירא (I will not fear) is
not uttered in a tone of triumph, but is only a quiet, meek expression
of believing confidence. If the instruments struck up boldly and
suddenly here, then a cry for help, urged forth by the difficulties that
still continually surrounded him, would not be able to follow.

[Psalms 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 3:7</span></span>

(Heb.: 3:8-9) The bold קוּמה is taken from the mouth of Moses, [Num
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md). God is said to arise when He
takes a decisive part in what takes place in this world. Instead of
kûmah it is accented kumáh as Milra, in order (since the reading קומה
אדני is assumed) that the final ah may be sharply cut off from the
guttural initial of the next word, and thus render a clear, exact
pronunciation of the latter possible (Hitz., Ew. 228, b).

(Note: This is the traditional reason of the accentuation shub h, kûm h,
shith h before יהוה: it is intended to prevent the one or other of the
two gutturals being swallowed up (יבולעו שׁלא) by too rapid speaking.
Hence it is that the same thing takes place even when another word, not
the name of God, follows, if it begins with א or the like, and is
closely connected with it by meaning and accentuation: e.g., [Jdg
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#018.md) סוּרה twice Milra before ;א [Psa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md) עוּרה, Milra before ;ה למּה,
Milra before ;ה [Exo 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#022.md); נחה [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md), and חבאת [Gen
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#010.md), Milra before ;ע and the
following fact favours it, viz., that for a similar reason Pasek is
placed where two י owt would come together, e.g., [Gen
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md) Adonaj jir'eh with the stroke of
separation between the two words, cf. [Exo
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#018.md); [Pro
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#021.md). The fact that in [Jer
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#005.md), ישׁבה remains Milel, is
accounted for by its being separated from the following אל־גּליה by
Pazer; a real exception, however (Michlol 112 b), - and not as Norzi
from misapprehension observes, a controverted one, - is שׁבה, Milel
before העיר [Sa2 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#027.md), but it is by
no means sufficient to oppose the purely orthophonic (not rhythmical)
ground of this ultima-accentuation. Even the semi-guttural ר sometimes
has a like influence over the tone: rı̂báh rı̂bı̂ [Psa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md); [Psa
119:154](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#154)..md)

Beside יהוה we have אלהי evah, with the suff. of appropriating faith.
The cry for help is then substantiated by כּי and the retrospective
perf. They are not such perff. of prophetically certain hope as in [Psa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#009.md); [Psa
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007.md); [Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005.md)., for the logical connection
requires an appeal to previous experience in the present passage: they
express facts of experience, which are taken from many single events
(hence כל) down to the present time. The verb הכּה is construed with a
double accusative, as e.g., Iliad xvi. 597 τὸν μὲν ἄρα Γλαῦκος στῆθος
μέσον οὔτασε δουρί. The idea of contempt ([Job
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010).md) is combined with that of
rendering harmless in this "smiting upon the cheek." What is meant is a
striking in of the jaw-bone and therewith a breaking of the teeth in
pieces (שׁבּר). David means, an ignominious end has always come upon the
ungodly who rose up against him and against God's order in general, as
their punishment. The enemies are conceived of as monsters given to
biting, and the picture of their fate is fashioned according to this
conception. Jahve has the power and the will to defend His Anointed
against their hostility: הישׁוּעה לה penes Jovam est salus. ישׁוּעה
(from ישׁע, Arab. wasi‛a, amplum esse) signifies breadth as applied to
perfect freedom of motion, removal of all straitness and oppression,
prosperity without exposure to danger and unbeclouded. In the ל of
possession lies the idea of the exclusiveness of the possession and of
perfect freedom of disposal. At Jahve's free disposal stands הישׁוּעה,
salvation, in all its fulness (just so in [Jon
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#010), Rev 7:10.md). In connection
therewith David first of all thinks of his own need of deliverance. But
as a true king he cannot before God think of himself, without connecting
himself with his people. Therefore he closes with the intercessory
inference: ברכתך על־עמּך Upon Thy people by Thy blessing! We may supply
תּהי or תּבא. Instead of cursing his faithless people he implores a
blessing upon those who have been piteously led astray and deceived.
This "upon Thy people be Thy blessing!" has its counterpart in the
"Father forgive them" of the other David, whom His people crucified. The
one concluding word of the Psalm - observes Ewald - casts a bright light
into the very depths of his noble soul.
