[Jeremiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 29:1</span></span>

A Letter from Jeremiah to the Captives in Babylon, together with
Threatenings against their False Prophets. - As in Jerusalem, so too in
Babylon the predictions of the false prophets fostered a lively hope
that the domination of Nebuchadnezzar would not last long, and that the
return of the exiles to their fatherland would soon come about. The
spirit of discontent thus excited must have exercised an injurious
influence on the fortunes of the captives, and could not fail to
frustrate the aim which the chastisement inflicted by God was designed
to work out, namely, the moral advancement of the people. Therefore
Jeremiah makes use of an opportunity furnished by an embassy sent by
King Zedekiah to Babel, to address a letter to the exiles, exhorting
them to yield with submission to the lot God had assigned to them. He
counsels them to prepare, by establishing their households there, for a
long sojourn in Babel, and to seek the welfare of that country as the
necessary condition of their own. They must not let themselves be
deceived by the false prophets' idle promises of a speedy return, since
God will not bring them back and fulfil His glorious promises till after
seventy years have passed ([Jer
29:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#004).md). Then he tells them that sore
judgments are yet in store for King Zedekiah and such as have been left
in the land ([Jer 29:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015).md); and
declares that some of their false prophets shall perish miserably ([Jer
29:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021).md).

Heading and Introduction. - The following circular is connected, in
point of outward form, with the preceding discourses against the false
prophets in Jerusalem by means of the words: "And these are the words of
the letter," etc. The words of the letter, i.e., the main contents of
the letter, since it was not transcribed, but given in substance. "Which
the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders
of the captives, and to the priests and prophets, and to the whole
people, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem to
Babylon." "The residue of the elders," Hitz. and Graf understand of
those elders who were not at the same time priests or prophets. On this
Ng. pronounces: "It is impossible that they can be right, for then 'the
residue of the elders of the captivity' must have stood after the
priests and prophets." And though we hear of elders of the priests,
there is no trace in the O.T. of elders of the prophets. Besides, the
elders, whenever they are mentioned along with the priests, are
universally the elders of the people. Thus must we understand the
expression here also. "The residue of the elders" can only be the
remaining, i.e., still surviving, elders of the exiles, as יתר is used
also in [Jer 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009.md) for those still in
life. But there is no foundation for the assumption by means of which
Gr. seeks to support his interpretation, namely, that the place of
elders that died was immediately filled by new appointments, so that the
council of the elders must always have been regarded as a whole, and
could not come to be a residue or remnant. Jeremiah could not possibly
have assumed the existence of such an organized governing authority,
since in this very letter he exhorts them to set about the establishment
of regular system in their affairs. The date given in [Jer
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002.md) : "after that Jechoniah the king,
and the sovereign lady, and the courtiers, the princes of Judah and
Jerusalem, the workmen and smiths, were gone away from Jerusalem,"
points to the beginning of Zedekiah's reign, to the first or second year
of it. With this the advice given to the captives in the letter
harmonizes well, namely, the counsel to build houses, plant gardens,
etc.; since this makes it clear that they had not been long there. The
despatch of this letter is usually referred to the fourth year of
Zedekiah's reign, because in [Jer 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)
this year is specified. But the connection in point of matter between
the present chapter and Jer 28 does not necessarily imply their
contemporaneousness, although that is perfectly possible; and the fact
that, according to [Jer 51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md),
Zedekiah himself undertook a journey to Babylon in the fourth year of
his reign, does not exclude the possibility of an embassy thither in the
same year. The going away from Jerusalem is the emigration to Babylon;
cf. [Jer 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md), [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015.md). הגּבירה, the queen-mother, see
on [Jer 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#018.md). סריסים are the
officials of the court; not necessarily eunuchs. Both words are joined
to the king, because these stood in closest relations to him. Then
follows without copula the second class of emigrants, the princes of
Judah and Jerusalem, i.e., the heads of the tribes, septs, and families
of the nation. The artisans form the third class. This disposes of the
objections raised by Mov. and Hitz. against the genuineness of the words
"princes of Judah and Jerusalem," their objections being based on the
false assumption that these words were an exposition of "courtiers." Cf.
against this, [Kg2 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015.md), where along
with the סריסים the heads of tribes and families are comprehended under
the head of אוּלי הארץ. [Jer 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003.md). "By
the hand" of Elasah is dependent on "sent," [Jer
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md). The men by whom Jeremiah sent
the letter to Babylon are not further known. Shaphan is perhaps the same
who is mentioned in [Jer 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024.md). We
have no information as to the aim of the embassy.

[Jeremiah 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 29:4</span></span>

At [Jer 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#004.md) the contents of the
letter begin. Jeremiah warns the people to prepare for a lengthened
sojourn in Babylonia, and exhorts them to settle down there. [Jer
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005.md). "Build houses and dwell
(therein), and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them. [Jer
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#006.md). Take wives and beget sons and
daughters, and take for your sons wives and give your daughters to
husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and increase there and
not diminish. [Jer 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md). And seek the
safety of the city whither I have carried you captive, and pray for it
to Jahveh, and in its safety shall be safety to you." The imperatives
"increase and not diminish" give the consequence of what has been said
just before. "The city whither I have carried you captive" is not
precisely Babylon, but every place whither separate companies of the
exiles have been transported. And pray for the city whither you are
come, because in this you further your own welfare, instead of looking
for advantage to yourselves from the fall of the Chaldean empire, from
the calamity of your heathen fellow-citizens. - With this is suitably
joined immediately the warning against putting trust in the delusive
hopes held out by the false prophets. "For thus saith Jahve of hosts,
the God of Israel: Let not your prophets, that are in the midst of you,
and your soothsayers, deceive you, and hearken not to your dreams which
ye cause to be dreamed; for falsely they prophesy to you in my name; I
have not sent them, saith Jahveh." מחלמים is somewhat singular, since we
have no other example of the Hiph. of חלם in its sig. dream (in [Isa
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016.md) the Hiph. of the same root means
to preserve in good health); but the Hiph. may here express the people's
spontaneity in the matter of dreams: which ye cause to be dreamed for
you (Hitz.). Thus there would be no need to alter the reading into
חלמים; a precedent for the defective spelling being found in מעזרים,
[Ch2 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023.md). What the false prophets
gave out is not expressly intimated, but may be gathered from the
context [Jer 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md), namely, that the
yoke of Babylon would soon be broken and captivity come to an end. -
This warning is justified in [Jer
29:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md), where God's decree is set
forth. The deliverance will not come about till after seventy years; but
then the Lord will fulfil to His people His promise of grace. [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md). "For thus saith Jahveh: When as
seventy years are fulfilled for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform
to you my good word, to bring you back to this place. [Jer
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011.md). For I know the thoughts that I
think toward you, saith Jahveh, thoughts of peace and not for evil, to
give you (a) destiny and hope. [Jer
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012.md). And ye will call upon me, and
go and pray unto me, and I will hear you. [Jer
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013.md). And ye will seek me, and find
me, if ye search for me with all your heart. [Jer
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014.md). And I will let myself be found
of you, saith Jahve, and will turn your captivity, and gather you out of
all the peoples and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith
Jahveh, and will bring you again to the place whence I have carried you
away." - לפי מלאת, according to the measure of the fulfilment of seventy
years for Babel. These words point back to [Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)., and we must reckon from the
date of that prediction. פּקד c. accus. sig. to visit in a good sense,
to look favourably on one and take his part. "My good word" is expounded
by the following infinitive clause. [Jer
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011.md). "I know my thoughts" is not to
be taken, as by Jerome, J. D. Mich., etc., as in contrast with the false
prophets: I know, but they do not. This antithesis is not in keeping
with what follows. The meaning is rather: Although I appoint so long a
term for the fulfilment of the plan of redemption, yet fear not that I
have utterly rejected you; I know well what my design is in your regard.
My thoughts toward you are thoughts of God, not of evil. Although now I
inflict lengthened sufferings on you, yet this chastisement but serves
to bring about your welfare in the future (Chr. B. Mich., Graf, etc.). -
To give you אחרית, lit., last, i.e., issue or future, and hope. For this
sig. cf. [Job 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#007.md); [Pro
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004.md), etc. This future destiny and hope
can, however, only be realized if by the sorrows of exile you permit
yourselves to be brought to a knowledge of your sins, and return
penitent to me. Then ye will call on me and pray, and I will hear you.
"And ye will go," [Jer 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012.md), is not
the apodosis to "ye will call," since there is no further explanation of
it, and since the simple הלך can neither mean to go away satisfied nor
to have success. "Go" must be taken with what follows: go to the place
of prayer (Ew., Umbr., Gr. Ng.). In [Jer
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013.md) אתי is to be repeated after
"find." [Jer 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012.md) and [Jer
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013.md) are a renewal of the promise,
[Deu 4:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029.md); and [Jer
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014.md) is a brief summary of the
promise, [Deu 30:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003.md), whence is taken
the graphic expression שׁוּב את־שׁבוּת; see on that passage. -
Thereafter in

[Jeremiah 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 29:15</span></span>

Jeremiah informs the captives of the judgments that is to gall on such
as are still left in the land. [Jer
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md). "If ye say: Jahveh hath raised
us up prophets in Babylon - [Jer
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md). Yea, thus saith Jahveh of the
king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that
dwelleth in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you
into captivity, [Jer 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#017.md). Thus saith
Jahveh of hosts: Behold, I send amongst them the sword, famine, and
pestilence, and make them like horrible figs, that cannot be eaten for
badness, [Jer 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018.md). And hunt after
them with the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and give them to be
abused to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an
astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach among all the peoples
whither I have driven them; [Jer
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#019.md). Inasmuch as they have not
hearkened to my words, saith Jahveh, wherewith I sent to them my
servants the prophets, from early morning on sending them, and ye have
not hearkened, saith Jahveh. [Jer
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#020.md). But ye, hear the word of
Jahveh, all ye captives whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon." -
The design with which Jeremiah tells the captives of this judgment may
be gathered from the terms of [Jer
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md), with which this prophecy is
introduced: God had raised up to us prophets in Babel (בּבלה, lit., as
far as Babel, i.e., extending His agency so far beyond the bounds of
Judah). Hence it is clear that the announcement of judgment to come on
those left in the land is in direct opposition to the predictions of the
prophets that had appeared in Babylon. these prophesied a swift end to
Chaldean domination and an immediate return of the exiles to their
fatherland. So long as one of David's posterity sat on his throne in
Jerusalem, and so long as the kingdom of Judah was maintained, the
partial captivity of the people and removal of the plundered treasures
of the temple would appear as a calamity which might soon be repaired.
The false prophets in Babylon laid, therefore, great stress on the
continued existence of the kingdom, with its capital and the temple, in
their efforts to obtain belief amongst the exiles. As Ng. justly
remarks, it was to take this ground from beneath their feet that
Jeremiah predicted expulsion and destruction against the people of
Jerusalem. The prophecy does indeed bear upon the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, "but not in the first reference; its immediate purpose was to
overthrow the foundations on which the false prophets of the exile
stood" (Ng.). Taken thus, these verses form and integral part of the
message sent by Jeremiah to the exiles, which was of no small weight for
quieting the excitement, nourished by the false prophets, which reigned
amongst them. One is struck by the want of connection between [Jer
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md) and [Jer
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md). The beginning of [Jer
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md), "Yea, thus saith," comes
directly after the end of [Jer 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md)
without any joining link. Ng. holds the כּי to be the pleonastic כּי
which often introduces a saying. But its position before the "thus
saith" makes this impossible. Here it serves to strengthen the
asseveration: yea, thus fitly introducing what Jahveh says to the
contrary; and [Jer 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md) and [Jer
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md) are, tersely and immediately,
set over against one another. "If ye say" means: as regards your saying
that Jahveh hath raised you up prophets in Babylon, the answer is: Thus
hath Jahveh said. This is the connection of [Jer
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md) with [Jer
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md).

(Note: By the above exposition of the connection and progress of the
thought, are disposed of all the objections that have been brought by
Houb., Lud. Capp., Ven., etc., against the genuineness of these verses,
or, at least, against the true position for them. The fact of their
being wanting in the lxx, on which Hitz. mainly grounds his charge of
spuriousness, proves nothing more than that these translators were
unable to understand the train of thought in the verses, especially
seeing that the substance of them has several times been expressed by
Jeremiah, particularly [Jer 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#017.md) and
[Jer 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018.md); [Jer
24:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md), cf. [Jer
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004.md); [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md); with [Jer
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#019.md) cf. [Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013.md), [Jer
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md). Against the attempts to alter
the text, Graf's remarks are admirable: "It is much easier to explain
how the passage was omitted as out of place by the lxx than to show how
it could have been introduced as an interpolation. It is too long for a
mere marginal gloss that had at a later time found its way into the
text; and why it should have been placed here, would remain all the more
incomprehensible if it were so wholly unconnected with the body of the
text. We cannot admit that it is merely an erroneous displacement of b.
15, which originally stood before [Jer
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md); since it is less likely that
[Jer 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md) could have come directly
after [Jer 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014.md). In respect of form,
[Jer 29:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md) is connected with and
forms a continuation of what precedes. [Jer
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#020.md) implies the presence of [Jer
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md) as an antithesis, and at the
same time completes again the connection that had been interrupted with
[Jer 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md), and leads on to [Jer
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md). Connection in thought seems to
be wanting only because [Jer 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md)
does not express the connecting idea, and because the contrast is so
abrupt." - The other arguments adduced by Hitz. to throw suspicion on
the passage, we can afford to pass over as wholly without force.)

"Your brethren that," etc., is co-ordinate with "all the people." The
words: "I make them like horrible figs," make allusion to the vision in
[Jer 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002.md)., but do not imply that this
vision was known to the exiles, for they are quite intelligible to him
who knows nothing of [Jer 24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)
(Ng.). The adject. שׁער is found only here, from שׁער, shudder;
horrible, that on tasting which one shudders. With [Jer
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018.md), cf. [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md). "Wherewith I sent my servants,"
i.e., commissioned them. This verb construed with double accus. as in
[Sa2 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#022.md); [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011.md). "Ye have not hearkened," the
2nd pers. instead of the 3rd, is hardly to be explained by the fact that
the prophet here cites in full an often quoted saying (Hitz., Ng.,
etc.). The reason is that the prophet is thinking of the exiles also as
having been equal to their brethren remaining in Judah in the matter of
not hearkening. Thus the way is prepared for the summons: But ye, hear,
[Jer 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#020.md).

[Jeremiah 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 29:21</span></span>

After having set forth the divine determination, the prophet's letter
addresses itself specially against the false prophets and tells them
their punishment from God. [Jer 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md).
"Thus saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of
Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy to you in my name falsely:
Behold, I give them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon,
that he may smite them before your eyes. [Jer
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022.md). And of them shall be taken up a
curse by all the exiles of Judah that are in Babylon, saying: Jahveh
make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted
in the fire, [Jer 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023.md). Because they
have done folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their
neighbours' wives, and have spoken in my name lying words which I have
not commanded them. But I know it and am witness, saith Jahveh." -
Beyond what is here told, we know nothing of these two pseudo-prophets.
The name אחאב is written in [Jer 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#020.md)
without א; thus the Kametz comes to be under the ח, and in consequence
of this the Pathach is changed into a Seghol "Smite," i.e., slay. The
manner of their death is called, probably with allusion to the name
Kolaiah, קלה, roast, burn in a heated furnace; a mode of execution usual
in Babylon, acc. to [Dan 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#006.md). This
punishment is to fall on them because of two kinds of sin: 1. Because
they have done folly in Israel, namely, committed adultery with their
neighbours' wives; 2. Because they have prophesied falsely in the name
of Jahveh. Except in [Jos 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#015.md), the
phrase: commit folly in Israel, is always used of the grosser sins of
uncleanness; see on [Gen 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#007.md). So here
also. - The Chet. הוידע is expounded in the Keri by היּודע, according to
which there has been a transposition of the letters ו and י, as in [Jer
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025.md); [Jer
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006.md), etc. Still the article here is
extraordinary, since עד has none. Therefore J. D. Mich., Ew., Hitz.,
Graf suppose we should read הוּ ידע, the א having been dropped from הוּא
in scriptio continua, as it often is, especially after י, in הביא and
other words, cf. [Jer 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015.md); [Jer
39:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#016.md), [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md), etc. הוּא is then the copula
between subject and predicate, as in [Isa
43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md); cf. Ew. 297, b.

[Jeremiah 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 29:24</span></span>

Threatening against the false prophet Shemaiah. - Jeremiah's letter to
the exiles (vv. 1-23) had excited great indignation among the false
prophets in Babylon, who predicted speedy restoration. One of them,
named Shemaiah, wrote accordingly letters to Jerusalem addressed to the
people, and especially to the priest Zephaniah, who held the highest
place in the management of the temple, insisting that he should
immediately take steps to punish Jeremiah and check his labours ([Jer
29:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024).md). When Zephaniah read this
letter to Jeremiah, the latter received from God the commission to tell
the pseudo-prophet of the punishment awaiting him, that and his race
should perish and not survive Israel's liberation ([Jer
29:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029).md). - This threatening
accordingly dates from a somewhat later time than the letter, vv. 1-23,
since it was its arrival and influence upon the exiles that led Shemaiah
to write to Jerusalem that letter, to which the threatening of the
present verse is the reply. But on account of their historical
connection, the letter of Jeremiah and that of Shemaiah were, at the
publication of Jeremiah's prophecies, placed the one after the other. -
From the introductory clause of [Jer
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024.md) : "And to Shemaiah the
Nehelamite thou shalt speak thus," we might conclude, with Graf, that
what Jeremiah had to say was not addressed by letter to Shemaiah
himself; and hold it to have sufficed that he should read it, like all
the exiles, in the letter which doubtless found its way to Babylon. But
this is incompatible with the command of God, [Jer
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#031.md) : Send to all the captives,
saying, etc. For it was only by writing that Jeremiah could send to the
exiles the sentence from God on Shemaiah that follows in [Jer
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#031.md). The introductory clause is
therefore interposed by the author of the book to form a link of
connection between the two utterances regarding the pseudo-prophets at
Babylon. We cannot make sure whether "the Nehelamite" refers the man to
a family or to a place of which we know nothing else. [Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025.md). Next the introduction to the
divine sentence comes (from "Because thou" on) a statement of the
occasion that called for it, which extends to [Jer
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028.md). Then in [Jer
29:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029.md) we are told that Zephaniah
read to Jeremiah the letter he had received from Shemaiah in Babylon,
and that Jeremiah was then commissioned by God to intimate to Shemaiah
the punishment to be sent on him by God for his false and seducing
prophecies. Then, again, attached to the preliminary statement by
"therefore," the introductory phrase "Thus saith Jahveh" is repeated,
and what the Lord said follows.

[Jer 29:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025.md)

"Because thou hast sent in thy name (without divine commission) letters
to all the people in Jerusalem, and to Sephaniah the son of Maaseiah the
priest, and to all the priests, saying." ספרים may be a single letter,
cf. [Kg2 10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md); but since these were
sent to the people, the priest Zephaniah, and all the people, the word
doubtless means here letters in the plural. As to Zephaniah ben
Maaseiah, see at [Jer 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md). - In [Jer
29:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026.md) follows the main substance of
the letter: "Jahveh hath set thee to be priest in the stead of the
priest Jehoiada, that there should be officers in the house of Jahveh
for every man that is mad and prophesieth, that thou shouldest put him
in the stocks and in neck-irons. [Jer
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#027.md). And, now, why hast thou not
restrained Jeremiah of Anathoth, that prophesieth to you? [Jer
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028.md). For therefore hath he sent to
us to Babylon (a letter) to the effect: It will last long; build houses
and dwell (therein), and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them."
Zephaniah occupied, acc. to [Jer
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026.md), the post of a chief officer of
the temple, was a chief warden, as Pashur had been before him, [Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md), who had charge of the police
regulations of the temple.

In the stead of the priest Jehoiada. These words Grot., Hitz., and Gr.
refer to the high priest Jehoiada under King Joash, [Kg2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018), who set up officers (פּקדּות.md)
over the temple. But this view cannot be reconciled with the words of
the text: "Jahveh hath set thee to be priest in Jehoiada's stead, that
there should be officers;" since from these ambiguous words, Zephaniah
filled the same post as Jehoiada had done, and was his successor in
office. The other well-known Jehoiada was high priest, who appointed
officers; Zephaniah, on the other hand was only "the second priest," and
as such had charge of the temple arrangements and of public order there.
Nor is there any hint here or elsewhere that Zephaniah was the immediate
successor of Pashur in this office, nor any indication to make it
unlikely that Jehoiada held the post after Pashur and that Zedekiah
succeeded him. The plural "officers" is general: that at all times there
should be officers. "For every man that is mad an prophesieth." משׁגּע,
the deranged or mad person, is here closely associated with מתנבּא, him
that bears himself as prophet. The former word is used in the evil sense
of the apparently deranged behaviour of the man on whom the Spirit of
God has laid hold, [Kg2 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011.md); [Hos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007). The idea is not: for (or against.md)
every prophet, but: for every madman that plays the prophet. The temple,
i.e., the outer court of the temple, was the usual place for prophets to
take their stand. Shemaiah accordingly means that it was the duty of the
chief warden of the temple to repress attempts to speak in the temple on
the part of pretended prophets, by putting such persons in stocks and
irons. As to מהפּכת, see on [Jer 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md).
צינק is ἁπ λεγ.. It certainly does not mean prison after צנק, in
Samaritan = clausit; but apparently neck-irons after Arab. znâq,
necklace, ring. Since both words are used together here, and since the
meaning is apparently that Jeremiah should be put into both instruments
at once, Hitz. conjectures that both together were needed to make the
stocks complete, but that each had its own proper name, because it was
possible to fix in the neck, leaving hands and feet free, or conversely,
as in [Jer 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md). - גּער, rebuke, check
by threats, restrain, cf. [Rut 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#016.md);
[Mal 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#011.md), etc. "For therefore," sc.
just because thou hast not restrained him from prophesying he has sent
to Babylon. שׁלח with לאמר following, send to say, means: to send a
message or letter as follows. לאמר ארכה היא Hitz. renders: for he
thought: it (Babylon) is far away; Jeremiah's meaning being, that in
Jerusalem they would know nothing about his letter he was sending to
Babylon. But such a hidden purpose is utterly foreign to the character
of the prophet. He had publicly predicted in Jerusalem the long seventy
years' duration of the exile; and it was not likely to occur to him to
wish to make a secret of the letter of like import which he sent to
Babylon. Besides, Hitz.'s interpretation is forced. Since there is no
לאמר before בּנוּ בתּים, the לאמר before ארכה can only be introductory
to the contents of the letter. For ארך used of duration in time, cf.
[Sa2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001.md); [Job
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#009.md). "Long-lasting it is," sc. your
sojourn in Babylon. These words give the burden of his prophecy, that on
which he founded his counsel: build houses, etc.

[Jer 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029.md)

Zephaniah read aloud to Jeremiah the letter he had received from
Babylon. With what design, we are not told; probably simply to inform
him of the proceedings of the pseudo-prophets in Babylon. If we may
judge by [Jer 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md) and [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md), Zephaniah seems to have been
friendly to Jeremiah.

[Jer 29:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#030.md)

In consequence of this, Jeremiah received from the Lord the commission
to predict to Shemaiah his punishment at the hand of God, and to send
the prediction to all that are in Babylon in banishment. With [Jer
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#031.md), cf. [Jer
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#015.md). The punishment is this:
Shemaiah shall have no posterity among his people, i.e., of his children
none shall be left amongst the people, nor shall he see, i.e.,
experience, have any share in the blessings which the Lord will yet
bestow upon His people. The extinction of his race and his own exclusion
from the privilege of seeing the day of Israel's redemption are the
punishment that is to fall on him for his rebellion against the
commandment of the Lord. With 'כּי סרה cf. [Jer
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016.md).
