### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 13:1</span></span>

The history of the reign of Saul commences with this chapter;

(Note: The connection of [Sa1 13:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008.md)
of this chapter with [Sa1 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008.md) is
adduced in support of the hypothesis that 1 Samuel 13 forms a direct
continuation of the account that was broken off in [Sa1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#016.md). This connection must be
admitted; but it by no means follows that in the source from which the
books before us were derived, 1 Samuel 13 was directly attached to [Sa1
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#016.md), and that Samuel intended to
introduce Saul publicly as king here in Gilgal immediately before the
attack upon the Philistines, to consecrate him by the solemn
presentation of sacrifices, and to connect with this the religious
consecration of the approaching campaign. For there is not a word about
any such intention in the chapter before us or in [Sa1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008.md), nor even the slightest hint at
it. Thenius has founded this view of his upon his erroneous
interpretation of ירדתּ in [Sa1 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008.md)
as an imperative, as if Samuel intended to command Saul to go to Gilgal
immediately after the occurrence of the signs mentioned in [Sa1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002.md).: a view which is at variance
with the instructions given to him, to do what his hand should find
after the occurrence of those signs. To this we may also add the
following objections: How is it conceivable that Saul, who concealed his
anointing even from his own family after his return from Samuel to
Gibeah ([Sa1 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#016).md), should have
immediately after chosen 3000 men of Israel to begin the war against the
Philistines? How did Saul attain to any such distinction, that at his
summons all Israel gathered round him as their king, even before he had
been publicly proclaimed king in the presence of the people, and before
he had secured the confidence of the people by any kingly heroic deed?
The fact of his having met with a band of prophets, and even prophesied
in his native town of Gibeah after his departure from Samuel, and that
this had become a proverb, is by no means enough to explain the
enterprises described in [Sa1 8:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md),
which so absolutely demand the incidents that occurred in the meantime
as recorded in 1 Samuel 10:17-12:25 even to make them intelligible, that
any writing in which [Sa1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md).
following directly upon [Sa1 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#016.md)
would necessarily be regarded as utterly faulty. This fact, which I have
already adduced in my examination of the hypothesis defended by Thenius
in my Introduction to the Old Testament (p. 168), retains its force
undiminished, even though, after a renewed investigation of the
question, I have given up the supposed connection between [Sa1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008.md) and the proclamation mentioned in
[Sa1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014)., which I defended there..md)

and according to the standing custom in the history of the kings, it
opens with a statement of the age of the king when he began to reign,
and the number of years that his reign lasted. If, for example, we
compare the form and contents of this verse with [Sa2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010.md); [Sa2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004.md); [Kg1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021.md); [Kg1
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#042.md); [Kg2
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md), and other passages, where the
age is given at which Ishbosheth, David, and many of the kings of Judah
began to reign, and also the number of years that their reign lasted,
there can be no doubt that our verse was also intended to give the same
account concerning Saul, and therefore that every attempt to connect
this verse with the one which follows is opposed to the uniform
historical usage. Moreover, even if, as a matter of necessity, the
second clause of \_[Sa1 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md) could be
combined with [Sa1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md) in the
following manner: He was two years king over Israel, then Saul chose
3000 men, etc.; the first half of the verse would give no reasonable
sense, according to the Masoretic text that has come down to us. בּמלכו
שׁאוּל בּן־שׁנה cannot possibly be rendered "jam per annum regnaverat
Saul," "Saul had been king for a year," or "Saul reigned one year," but
can only mean "Saul was a year old when he became king." This is the way
in which the words have been correctly rendered by the Sept. and Jerome;
and so also in the Chaldee paraphrase ("Saul was an innocent child when
he began to reign") this is the way in which the text has been
understood.

It is true that this statement as to his age is obviously false; but all
that follows from that is, that there is an error in the text, namely,
that between בּן and שׁנה the age has fallen out, - a thing which could
easily take place, as there are many traces to show that originally the
numbers were not written in words, but only in letters that were used as
numerals. This gap in the text is older than the Septuagint version, as
our present text is given there. There is, it is true, an anonymus in
the hexapla, in which we find the reading υἱὸς τριάκοντα ἐτῶν Σαούλ; but
this is certainly not according to ancient MSS, but simply according to
a private conjecture, and that an incorrect one. For since Saul already
had a son, Jonathan, who commanded a division of the army in the very
first years of his reign, and therefore must have been at least twenty
years of age, if not older, Saul himself cannot have been less than
forty years old when he began to reign. Moreover, in the second half of
the verse also, the number given is evidently a wrong one, and the text
therefore equally corrupt; for the rendering "when he had reigned two
years over Israel" is opposed both by the parallel passages already
quoted, and also by the introduction of the name Saul as the subject in
[Sa1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md), which shows very clearly
that [Sa1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md) commences a fresh
sentence, and is not merely the apodosis to [Sa1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md). But Saul's reign must have
lasted longer than two years, even if, in opposition to all analogies to
be found elsewhere, we should understand the two years as merely
denoting the length of his reign up to the time of his rejection (1
Samuel 15), and not till the time of his death. Even then he reigned
longer than that; for he could not possibly have carried on all the wars
mentioned in [Sa1 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md), with Moab,
Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah and the Philistines, in the space of two
years. Consequently a numeral, say כ, twenty, must also have dropped out
before שׁנים שׁתּי (two years); since there are cogent reasons for
assuming that his reign lasted as long as twenty or twenty-two years,
reckoning to the time of his death. We have given the reasons themselves
in connection with the chronology of the period of the judges (pp.
206f.).

(Note: The traditional account that Saul reigned forty years ([Act
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#024), and Josephus, Ant. vi. 14, 9.md)
is supposed to have arisen, according to the conjecture of Thenius (on
[Sa2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010).md), from the fact that his son
Ishbosheth was forty years old when he began to reign, and the notion
that as he is not mentioned among the sons of Saul in [Sa1
14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049.md), he must have been born after
the commencement of Saul's own reign. This conjecture is certainly a
probable one; but it is much more natural to assume that as David and
Solomon reigned forty years, it arose from the desire to make Saul's
reign equal to theirs.)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 13:2</span></span>

The war with the Philistines (1 Samuel 13-14) certainly falls, at least
so far as the commencement is concerned, in the very earliest part of
Saul's reign. This we must infer partly from the fact, that at the very
time when Saul was seeking for his father's asses, there was a military
post of the Philistines at Gibeah ([Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005).md), and therefore the Philistines
had already occupied certain places in the land; and partly also from
the fact, that according to this chapter Saul selected an army of 3000
men out of the whole nation, took up his post at Michmash with 2000 of
them, placing the other thousand at Gibeah under his son Jonathan, and
sent the rest of the people home ([Sa1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002).md), because his first intention was
simply to check the further advance of the Philistines. The dismission
of the rest of the people to their own homes presupposes that the whole
of the fighting men of the nation were assembled together. But as no
other summoning together of the people has been mentioned before, except
to the war upon the Ammonites at Jabesh ([Sa1
11:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#006).md), where all Israel gathered
together, and at the close of which Samuel had called the people and
their king to Gilgal ([Sa1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014).md), the
assumption is a very probable one, that it was there at Gilgal, after
the renewal of the monarchy, that Saul formed the resolution at once to
make war upon the Philistines, and selected 3000 fighting men for the
purpose out of the whole number that were collected together, and then
dismissed the remainder to their homes. In all probability Saul did not
consider that either he or the Israelites were sufficiently prepared as
yet to undertake a war upon the Philistines generally, and therefore
resolved, in the first place, only to attack the outpost of the
Philistines, which was advanced as far as Gibeah, with a small number of
picked soldiers. According to this simple view of affairs, the war here
described took place at the very commencement of Saul's reign; and the
chapter before us is closely connected with the preceding one.

[Sa1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md)

Saul posted himself at Michmash and on the mount of Bethel with his two
thousand men. Michmash, the present Mukhmas, a village in ruins upon the
northern ridge of the Wady Suweinit, according to the Onom. (s. v.
Machmas), was only nine Roman miles to the north of Jerusalem, whereas
it took Robinson three hours and a half to go from one to the other
(Pal. ii. p. 117). Bethel (Beitin; see at [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002).md) is to the north-west of this, at
a distance of two hours' journey, if you take the road past Deir-Diwan.
The mountain (הר) of Bethel cannot be precisely determined. Bethel
itself was situated upon very high ground; and the ruins of Beitin are
completely surrounded by heights (Rob. ii. p. 126; and v. Raumer, Pal.
pp. 178-9). Jonathan stationed himself with his thousand men at (by)
Gibeah of Benjamin, the native place and capital of Saul, which was
situated upon Tell el Phul (see at [Jos
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028).md), about an hour and a half form
Michmas.

[Sa1 13:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003.md)

"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba,"
probably the military post mentioned in [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005.md), which had been advanced in the
meantime as far as Geba. For Geba is not to be confounded with Gibeah,
from which it is clearly distinguished in [Sa1
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#016.md) as compared with [Sa1
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md), but is the modern Jeba, between
the Wady Suweinit and Wady Fara, to the north-west of Ramah (er-Rm; see
at [Jos 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024).md). "The Philistines heard
this. And Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the whole land, and
proclamation made: let the Hebrews hear it." לאמר after בּשּׁופר תּקע
points out the proclamation that was made after the alarm given by the
shophar (see [Sa2 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md); [Kg1
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#034.md), [Kg1
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039), etc..md). The object to "let them
hear" may be easily supplied from the context, viz., Jonathan's feat of
arms. Saul had this trumpeted in the whole land, not only as a joyful
message for the Hebrews, but also as an indirect summons to the whole
nation to rise and make war upon the Philistines. In the word שׁמע
(hear), there is often involved the idea of observing, laying to heart
that which is heard. If we understand ישׁמעוּ in this sense here, and
the next verse decidedly hints at it, there is no ground whatever for
the objection which Thenius, who follows the lxx, has raised to העברים
ישׁמעוּ. He proposes this emendation, העברים ישׁמעוּ, "let the Hebrews
fall away," according to the Alex. text ἠθετήκασιν οἱ δοῦλοι, without
reflecting that the very expression οἱδοῦλοι is sufficient to render the
Alex. reading suspicious, and that Saul could not have summoned the
people in all the land to fall away from the Philistines, since they had
not yet conquered and taken possession of the whole. Moreover, the
correctness of ישׁמעוּ is confirmed by ישׁמעוּ ישׂראל וכל in [Sa1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#004.md). "All Israel heard," not the call
to fall away, but the news, "Saul has smitten a garrison of the
Philistines, and Israel has also made itself stinking with the
Philistines," i.e., hated in consequence of the bold and successful
attack made by Jonathan, which proved that the Israelites would no
longer allow themselves to be oppressed by the Philistines. "And the
people let themselves be called together after Saul to Gilgal." הצּעק,
to permit to summon to war (as in [Jdg
7:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#023).md). The words are incorrectly
rendered by the Vulgate, "clamavit ergo populus post Saul," and by
Luther, "Then the people cried after Saul to Gilgal." Saul drew back to
Gilgal, when the Philistines advanced with a large army, to make
preparations for the further conflict (see at [Sa1
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#013).md).

[Sa1 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005.md)

The Philistines also did not delay to avenge the defeat at Geba. They
collected an innumerable army: 30,000 chariots, 6000 horsemen, and
people, i.e., foot-soldiers, without number (as the sand by the
sea-shore; cf. [Jdg 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#012.md); [Jos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#004), etc..md). רכב by the side of
פּרשׁים can only mean war chariots. 30,000 war chariots, however, bear
no proportion whatever to 6000 horsemen, not only because the number of
war chariots is invariably smaller than that of the horsemen (cf. [Sa2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018.md); [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md); [Ch2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003).md), but also, as Bochart observes
in his Hieroz. p. i. lib. ii. c. 9, because such a number of war
chariots is never met with either in sacred or profane history, not even
in the case of nations that were much more powerful than the
Philistines. The number is therefore certainly corrupt, and we must
either read 3000 (אל שׁלשׁת instead of אל שׁלשׁים), according to the
Syriac and Arabic, or else simply 1000; and in the latter case the
origin of the number thirty must be attributed to the fact, that through
the oversight of a copyist the ל of the word ישׂראל was written twice,
and consequently the second ל was taken for the numeral thirty. This
army was encamped "at Michmash, before (i.e., in the front, or on the
western side of) Bethaven:" for, according to [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md), Bethaven was to the east of
Michmash; and קדמת when it occurs in geographical accounts, does not
"always mean to the east," as Thenius erroneously maintains, but
invariably means simply "in front" (see at [Gen
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#014).md).

(Note: Consequently there is no ground whatever for altering the text
according to the confused rendering of the lxx, ἐν Μαχμὰς ἐξ ἐναντὶας
Βαιθωρὼν κατὰ νότου, for the purpose of substituting for the correct
statement in the text a description which would be geographically wrong,
viz., to the south-east of Beth-horon, since Michmash was neither to the
south nor to the south-east, but to the east of Beth-horon.)

[Sa1 13:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006.md)

When the Israelites saw that they had come into a strait (צר־לו), for
the people were oppressed (by the Philistines), they hid themselves in
the caves, thorn-bushes, rocks (i.e., clefts of the rocks), fortresses
(צרחים: see at [Jdg 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#046).md), and pits
(which were to be found in the land); and Hebrews also went over the
Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead, whilst Saul was still at Gilgal;
and all the people (the people of war who had been called together, v.
4) trembled behind him, i.e., were gathered together in his train, or
assembled round him as leader, trembling or in despair.

The Gilgal mentioned here cannot be Jiljilia, which is situated upon the
high ground, as assumed in the Comm. on Joshua, pp. 68f., but must be
the Gilgal in the valley of the Jordan. This is not only favoured by the
expression ירדוּ (the Philistines will come down from Michmash to
Gilgal, [Sa1 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#012).md), but also by ויּעל
(Samuel went up from Gilgal to Gibeah, [Sa1
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015).md), and by the general attitude of
Saul and his army towards the Philistines. As the Philistines advanced
with a powerful army, after Jonathan's victory over their garrison at
Geba (to the south of Michmash), and encamped at Michmash ([Sa1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005).md); and Saul, after withdrawing
from Gilgal, where he had gathered the Israelites together ([Sa1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#004.md), [Sa1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008.md), [Sa1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#012).md), with Jonathan and the six
hundred men who were with him when the muster took place, took up his
position at Geba ([Sa1 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md), [Sa1
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#016).md), from which point Jonathan
attacked the Philistine post in the pass of Michmash ([Sa1
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md), and [Sa1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001)..md): Saul must have drawn back from
the advancing army of the Philistines to the Gilgal in the Jordan
valley, to make ready for the battle by collecting soldiers and
presenting sacrifices, and then, after this had been done, must have
advanced once more to Gibeah and Geba to commence the war with the army
of the Philistines that was encamped at Michmash. If, on the other hand,
he had gone northwards to Jiljilia from Michmash, where he was first
stationed, to escape the advancing army of the Philistines; he would
have had to attack the Philistines from the north when they were
encamped at Michmash, and could not possibly have returned to Geba
without coming into conflict with the Philistines, since Michmash was
situated between Jiljilia and Geba.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 13:8</span></span>

Saul's untimely sacrifice. - [Sa1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008.md), [Sa1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009.md). Saul waited seven days for
Samuel's coming, according to the time appointed by Samuel (see at [Sa1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008).md), before proceeding to offer the
sacrifices through which the help of the Lord was to be secured for the
approaching campaign (see [Sa1 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#012).md);
and as Samuel did not come, the people began to disperse and leave him.
The Kethib וייחל is either the Niphal ויּיּחל, as in [Gen
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#012.md), or Piel וייחל; and the Keri
ויּוחל (Hiphil) is unnecessary. The verb יעד may easily be supplied to
שׁמוּאל אשׁר from the word למּועד (see Ges. Lehrgeb. p. 851).

[Sa1 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009.md)

Saul then resolved, in his anxiety lest the people should lose all heart
and forsake him altogether if there were any further delay, that he
would offer the sacrifice without Samuel. העולה ויּעל does not imply
that Saul offered the sacrifice with his own hand, i.e., that he
performed the priestly function upon this occasion. The co-operation of
the priests in performing the duties belonging to them on such an
occasion is taken for granted, just as in the case of the sacrifices
offered by David and Solomon ([Sa2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#025.md); [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md); [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063).md).

[Sa1 13:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#010.md)

The offering of the sacrifice was hardly finished when Samuel came and
said to Saul, as he came to meet him and salute him, "What hast thou
done?" Saul replied, "When I saw that the people were scattered away
from me, and thou camest not at the time appointed, and the Philistines
were assembled at Michmash, I thought the Philistines will come down to
me to Gilgal now (to attack me), before I have entreated the face of
Jehovah; and I overcame myself, and offered the burnt-offering." יי פּני
חלּה: see [Exo 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md).

[Sa1 13:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#013.md)

Samuel replied, "Thou hast acted foolishly, (and) not kept the
commandment of Jehovah thy God, which He commanded thee: for now (sc.,
if thou hadst obeyed His commandment) Jehovah would have established thy
sovereignty over Israel for ever; but now (sc., since thou hast acted
thus) thy sovereignty shall not continue." The antithesis of הכין עתּה
and תקוּם לא ועתּה requires that we should understand these two clauses
conditionally. The conditional clauses are omitted, simply because they
are at once suggested by the tenor of the address (see Ewald, 358, a.).
The כּי (for) assigns the reason, and refers to נסכּלתּ ("thou hast done
foolishly"), the וגו שׁמרתּ לא being merely added as explanatory. The
non-continuance of the sovereignty is not to be regarded as a rejection,
or as signifying that Saul had actually lost the throne so far as he
himself was concerned; but תקוּם לא (shall not continue) forms the
antithesis to עד־עולם הכין (established for ever), and refers to the
fact that it was not established in perpetuity by being transmitted to
his descendants. It was not till his second transgression that Saul was
rejected, or declared unworthy of being king over the people of God (1
Samuel 15). We are not compelled to assume an immediate rejection of
Saul even by the further announcement made by Samuel, "Jehovah hath
sought him a man after his own heart; him hath Jehovah appointed prince
over His people;" for these words merely announce the purpose of God,
without defining the time of its actual realization. Whether it would
take place during Saul's reign, or not till after his death, was known
only to God, and was made contingent upon Saul's further behaviour. But
if Saul's sin did not consist, as we have observed above, in his having
interfered with the prerogatives of the priests by offering the
sacrifice himself, but simply in the fact that he had transgressed the
commandment of God as revealed to him by Samuel, to postpone the
sacrifice until Samuel arrived, the punishment which the prophet
announced that God would inflict upon him in consequence appears a very
severe one, since Saul had not come to the resolution either frivolously
or presumptuously, but had been impelled and almost forced to act as he
did by the difficulties in which he was placed in consequence of the
prophet delaying his coming. But wherever, as in the present instance,
there is a definite command given by the Lord, a man has no right to
allow himself to be induced to transgress it, by fixing his attention
upon the earthly circumstances in which he is placed. As Samuel had
instructed Saul, as a direct command from Jehovah, to wait for his
arrival before offering sacrifice, Saul might have trusted in the Lord
that he would send His prophet at the right time and cause His command
to be fulfilled, and ought not to have allowed his confidence to be
shaken by the pressing danger of delay. The interval of seven days and
the delay in Samuel's arrival were intended as a test of his faith,
which he ought not to have lightly disregarded. Moreover, the matter in
hand was the commencement of the war against the principal enemies of
Israel, and Samuel was to tell him what he was to do ([Sa1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008).md). So that when Saul proceeded
with the consecrating sacrifice for that very conflict, without the
presence of Samuel, he showed clearly enough that he thought he could
make war upon the enemies of his kingdom without the counsel and
assistance of God. This was an act of rebellion against the sovereignty
of Jehovah, for which the punishment announced was by no means too
severe.

[Sa1 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md)

After this occurrence Samuel went up to Gibeah, and Saul mustered the
people who were with him, about six hundred men. Consequently Saul had
not even accomplished the object of his unseasonable sacrifice, namely,
to prevent the dispersion of the people. With this remark the account of
the occurrence that decided the fate of Saul's monarchy is brought to a
close.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 13:16</span></span>

Disarming of Israel by the Philistines. - The following account is no
doubt connected with the foregoing, so far as the facts are concerned,
inasmuch as Jonathan's brave heroic deed, which brought the Israelites a
splendid victory over the Philistines, terminated the war for which Saul
had entreated the help of God by his sacrifice at Gilgal; but it is not
formally connected with it, so as to form a compact and complete account
of the successive stages of the war. On the contrary, the 16th verse,
where we have an account of the Israelitish warriors and their enemies,
commences a new section of the history, in which the devastating march
of the Philistines through the land, and the disarming of the Israelites
by these their enemies, are first of all depicted ([Sa1
13:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017).md); and then the victory of the
Israelites through Jonathan's daring and heroic courage, notwithstanding
their utter prostration, is recorded (1 Samuel 14:1-46), for the purpose
of showing how the Lord had miraculously helped His people.

(Note: From this arrangement of the history, according to which the only
two points that are minutely described in connection with the war with
the Philistines are those which bring out the attitude of the king, whom
the nation had desired to deliver it from its foes, towards Jehovah, and
the way in which Jehovah acted towards His people, whilst all the rest
is passed over, we may explain the absence of any closer connection
between [Sa1 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md) and [Sa1
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#016.md), and not from a gap in the text.
The lxx, however, adopted the latter supposition, and according to the
usual fashion filled up the gap by expanding [Sa1
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md) in the following thoughtless
manner: καὶ ἀνέστη Σαμουὴλ καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκ Γαλγάλων· καὶ τὸ κατάλειμμα
τοῦ λαοῦ ἀνεβη ὀπίσω Σαοὺλ εἰς ἀπάντησιν ὀπίσω τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ πολεμιστοῦ·
αὐτῶν παραγενομένων ἐκ Γαλγάλων εἰς Γαβαὰ Βενιαμὶν καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Σαοὺλ,
κ.τ.λ. For there is no sense in εἰς ἀπάντησιν ὀπίσω, and the whole
thought, that the people who were left went up after Saul to meet the
people of war, is unintelligible, since it is not stated whence the
people of war had come, who are said to have met with those who had
remained behind with Saul, and to have gone up with him from Gilgal to
Gibeah. If, however, we overlook this, and assume that when Saul
returned from Gilgal to Gibeah a further number of fighting men came to
him from different parts of the land, how does this assumption agree
with the account which follows, viz., that when Saul mustered the people
he found only six hundred men, - a statement which is repeated again in
[Sa1 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#002.md)? The discrepancy remains
even if we adopt Ewald's conjecture (Gesch. iii. 43), that εἰς ἀπάντησιν
is a false rendering of לקּרב, "to the conflict." Moreover, even with
the Alexandrian filling up, no natural connection is secured between
[Sa1 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md) and [Sa1
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#016.md), unless we identify Geba of
Benjamin with Gibeah, as the Septuagint and its latest defenders have
done, and not only change the participle ישׁבים ([Sa1
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#016).md) into the aorist ἐκάθισαν, but
interpolate καὶ ἔκλαιον after "at Geba of Benjamin;" whereas the
statement of the text "at Geba in Benjamin" is proved to be correct by
the simple fact that Jonathan could only attempt or carry out the heroic
deed recorded in 1 Samuel 14 from Geba and not from Gibeah; and the
alteration of the participle into the aorist is just as arbitrary as the
interpolation of καὶ ἔκλαιον. From all this it follows that the
Septuagint version has not preserved the original reading, as Ewald and
Thenius suppose, but contains nothing more than a mistaken attempt to
restore the missing link. It is true the Vulgate contains the same
filling up as the Septuagint, but with one alteration, which upsets the
assertion made by Thenius, that the repetition of the expression הגּלגּל
מן, ἐκ Γαλγάλων, caused the reading contained in the Septuagint to be
dropped out of the Hebrew text. For the text of the Vulgate runs as
follows: Surrexit autem Samul et ascendit de Galgalis in Gabaa Benjamin.
Et reliqui populi ascenderunt post Saul obviam populo, qui expugnabant
eos venientes de Galgala in Gabaa in colle Benjamin. Et recensuit Saul,
etc. Jerome has therefore rendered the first two clauses of [Sa1
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md) in perfect accordance with the
Hebrew text; and the addition which follows is nothing more than a gloss
that has found its way into his translation from the Itala, and in which
de Galgala in colle Benjamin is still retained, whereas Jerome himself
rendered הגּלגּל מן de Galgalis.)

[Sa1 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#016.md)

The two clauses of this verse are circumstantial clauses: "But Saul, and
Jonathan his son, and the people that were with him, were sitting, i.e.,
tarrying, in Geba of Benjamin (the present Jeba; see at [Sa1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003).md); and the Philistines had
encamped at Michmash." Just as in [Sa1
13:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md) it is not stated when or why
Saul went from Michmash or Geba to Gilgal, but this change in his
position is merely hinted at indirectly at the close of [Sa1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#004.md); so here Saul's return from
Gilgal to Geba with the fighting men who remained with him is not
distinctly mentioned, but simply taken for granted as having already
occurred.

[Sa1 13:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017.md)

Then the spoiler went out of the camp of the Philistines in three
companies. ראשׁים שׁלשׁה is made subject to the verb to define the mode
of action (see Ewald, 279, c.); and rashim is used here, as in [Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011.md). המּשׁחית, according to the
context, is a hostile band that went out to devastate the land. The
definite article points it out as well known. One company took the road
to Ophrah into the land of Shual, i.e., went in a north-easterly
direction, as, according to the Onom., Ophrah of Benjamin was five Roman
miles to the east of Bethel (see at [Jos
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023).md). Robinson supposes it to have
been on the site of Tayibeh. The land of Shual (fox-land) is unknown; it
may possibly have been identical with the land of Saalim ([Sa1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#005).md). The other company turned on the
road to Beth-horon (Beit-ur: see at [Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011).md), that is to say, towards the
west; the third, "the way to the territory that rises above the valley
of Zeboim towards the desert." These descriptions are obscure; and the
valley of Zeboim altogether unknown. There is a town of this name
(צבעים, different from צביים, [Deu
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md); [Gen
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#002.md), [Gen
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#008.md); or צבאים, [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008), in the vale of Siddim.md) mentioned
in [Neh 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#034.md), which was inhabited by
Benjaminites, and was apparently situated in the south-eastern portion
of the land of Benjamin, to the north-east of Jerusalem, from which it
follows that the third company pursued its devastating course in a
south-easterly direction from Michmash towards Jericho. "The wilderness"
is probably the desert of Judah. The intention of the Philistines in
carrying out these devastating expeditions, was no doubt to entice the
men who were gathered round Saul and Jonathan out of their secure
positions at Gibeah and Geba, and force them to fight.

[Sa1 13:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#019.md)

The Israelites could not offer a successful resistance to these
devastating raids, as there was no smith to be found in the whole land:
"For the Philistines thought the Hebrews might make themselves sword or
spear" (אמר followed by פּן, "to say, or think, that not," equivalent to
being unwilling that it should be done). Consequently (as the words
clearly imply) when they proceeded to occupy the land of Israel as
described in [Sa1 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005.md), they disarmed
the people throughout, i.e., as far as they penetrated, and carried off
the smiths, who might have been able to forge weapons; so that, as is
still further related in [Sa1 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#020.md),
all Israel was obliged to go to the Philistines, every one to sharpen
his edge-tool, and his ploughshare, and his axe, and his chopper.
According to [Isa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md); [Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003.md), and [Joe
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#010.md), את is an iron instrument used in
agriculture; the majority of the ancient versions render it ploughshare.
The word מחרשׁתו is striking after the previous מחרשׁתּו (from מחרשׁת);
and the meaning of both words is uncertain. According to the etymology,
מחרשׁת might denote any kind of edge-tool, even the ploughshare. The
second מחרשׁתו is rendered τὸ δρέπανον αὐτοῦ (his sickle) by the lxx,
and sarculum by Jerome, a small garden hoe for loosening and weeding the
soil. The fact that the word is connected with קרדּם, the axe or
hatchet, favours the idea that it signifies a hoe or spade rather than a
sickle. Some of the words in [Sa1
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#021.md) are still more obscure. והיתה,
which is the reading adopted by all the earlier translators, indicates
that the result is about to be given of the facts mentioned before: "And
there came to pass," i.e., so that there came to pass (or arose), פּים
הפּצירה, "a blunting of the edges." פּצירה, bluntness, from פּצר, to
tear, hence to make blunt, is confirmed by the Arabic futâr, gladius
fissuras habens, obtusus ensis, whereas the meaning to hammer, i.e., to
sharpen by hammering, cannot be established. The insertion of the
article before פּצירה is as striking as the omission of it before פּים;
also the stat. abs. instead of the construct פּצירת. These anomalies
render it a very probable conjecture that the reading may have been
הפּים הפציר (inf. Hiph. nomin.). Accordingly the rendering would be, "so
that bluntness of the edges occurred in the edge-tools, and the
ploughshares, and the trident, and the axes, and the setting of the
goad." קלּשׁון שׁלשׁ is to be regarded as a nom. comp. like our trident,
denoting an instrument with three prongs, according to the Chaldee and
the Rabbins (see Ges. Thes. p. 1219). דּרבן, stimulus, is probably a
pointed instrument generally, since the meaning goad is fully
established in the case of דּרבון in [Ecc
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011.md).

(Note: [Sa1 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#021.md) runs very
differently in the lxx, namely, καὶ ἦν ὁ τρυγητὸς ἕτοιμος τοῦ θερίζειν,
τὰ δὲ σκεύη ἦν τρεῖς σίκλοι εἰς τὸν ὀδόντα, καὶ τῇ ἀξίνῃ καὶ τῷ δρεπάνῳ
ὑτόστασις ἦν ἡ αὐτή; and Thenius and Bttcher propose an emendation of
the Hebrew text accordingly, so as to obtain the following meaning: "And
the sharpening of the edges in the case of the spades and ploughshares
was done at three shekels a tooth (i.e., three shekels each), and for
the axe and sickle it was the same" (Thenius); or, "and the same for the
sickles, and for the axes, and for setting the prong" (Bttcher). But
here also it is easy enough to discover that the lxx had not another
text before them that was different from the Masoretic text, but merely
confounded הפציר with הבציר, τρυγητός, and took קלּשׁון שׁלשׁ, which was
unintelligible to them, e conjectura for השּׁן שׁק שׁלשׁ, altogether
regardless of the sense or nonsense of their own translation. The latest
supporters of this senseless rendering, however, have neither undertaken
to prove the possibility of translating ὀδόντα (ὀδούς), "each single
piece" (i.e., each), or inquired into the value of money at that time,
so as to see whether three shekels would be an unexampled charge for the
sharpening of an axe or sickle.)

[Sa1 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#022.md)

On the day of battle, therefore, the people with Saul and Jonathan were
without either sword or spear; Saul and Jonathan were the only persons
provided with them. The account of the expedition of the Israelites, and
their victory over the Ammonites, given in [Sa1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#011.md), is apparently at variance with
this description of the situation of the Israelites, since the war in
question not only presupposes the possession of weapons by the
Israelites, but must also have resulted in their capturing a
considerable quantity. The discrepancy is very easily removed, however,
when we look carefully at all the circumstances. For instance, we can
hardly picture the Israelites to ourselves as amply provided with
ordinary weapons in this expedition against the Ammonites. Moreover, the
disarming of the Israelites by the Philistines took place for the most
part if not entirely after this expedition, viz., at the time when the
Philistines swept over the land with an innumerable army after Jonathan
had smitten their garrison at Geba ([Sa1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003.md), [Sa1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005).md), so that the fighting men who
gathered round Saul and Jonathan after that could hardly bring many arms
with them. Lastly, the words "there was neither sword nor spear found in
the hands of all the people with Saul and Jonathan" must not be too
closely pressed, but simply affirm that the 600 fighting men of Saul and
Jonathan were not provided with the necessary arms, because the
Philistines had prevented the possibility of their arming themselves in
the ordinary way by depriving the people of all their smiths.

[Sa1 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md)

[Sa1 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md) forms the transition to the
heroic act of Jonathan described in 1 Samuel 14.: "An outpost of the
Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash;" i.e., the Philistines
pushed forward a company of soldiers to the pass (מעבר, the crossing
place) of Michmash, to prevent an attack being made by the Israelites
upon their camp. Between Geba and Michmash there runs the great deep
Wady es Suweinit, which goes down from Beitin and Bireh (Bethel and
Beeroth) to the valley of the Jordan, and intersects the ridge upon
which the two places are situated, so that the sides of the wady form
very precipitous walls. When Robinson was travelling from Jeba to
Mukhmas he had to go down a very steep and rugged path into this deep
wady (Pal. ii. p. 116). "The way," he says in his Biblical Researches,
p. 289, "was so steep, and the rocky steps so high, that we were
compelled to dismount; while the baggage mules got along with great
difficulty. Here, where we crossed, several short side wadys came in
from the south-west and north-west. The ridges between these terminate
in elevating points projecting into the great wady; and the most
easterly of these bluffs on each side were probably the outposts of the
two garrisons of Israel and the Philistines. The road passes around the
eastern side of the southern hill, the post of Israel, and then strikes
up over the western part of the northern one, the post of the
Philistines, and the scene of Jonathan's adventure."
