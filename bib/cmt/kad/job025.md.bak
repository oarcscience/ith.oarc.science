### [Job Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#001.md)

[Job 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 25:1</span></span>

1 Then began Bildad the Shuhite, and said:

2 Dominion and terror are with Him,

He maketh peace in His high places.

3 Is there any number to His armies,

And whom doth not His light surpass?

4 How could a mortal be just with God,

And how could one born of woman be pure?

5 Behold, even the moon, it shineth not brightly,

And the stars are not pure in His eyes.

6 How much less mortal man, a worm,

And the son of man, a worm!

Ultimum hocce classicum, observes Schultens, quod a parte triumvirorum
sonuit, magis receptui canentis videtur, quam praelium renovantis.
Bildad only repeats the two commonplaces, that man cannot possibly
maintain his supposedly perverted right before God, the all-just and
all-controlling One, to whom, even in heaven above, all things
cheerfully submit, and that man cannot possibly be accounted spotlessly
pure, and consequently exalted above all punishment before Him, the most
holy One, before whom even the brightest stars do not appear absolutely
pure. המשׁל is an inf. abs. made into a substantive, like השׁקט; the
Hiph. (to cause to rule), which is otherwise causative, can also, like
Kal, signify to rule, or properly, without destroying the
Hiphil-signification, to exercise authority (vid., on [Job
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#018).md); המשׁל therefore signifies
sovereign rule. עשׂה, with הוּא to be supplied, which is not
unfrequently omitted both in participial principal clauses ([Job
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017.md)., [Psa
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029.md); [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md); [Isa
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#008.md); [Isa
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019.md), comp. [Zac
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#012), where אני is to be supplied.md) and
in partic. subordinate clauses ([Psa
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010.md); [Psa
55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020.md); [Hab
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010).md), is an expression of the simple
praes., which is represented by the partic. used thus absolutely
(including the personal pronoun) as a proper tense-form (Ew. 168, c,
306, d). Schlottman refers עשׂה to המשׁל ופהד; but the analogy of such
attributive descriptions of God is against it. Umbreit and Hahn connect
בּמרומיו with the subject: He in His heights, i.e., down from His throne
in the heavens. But most expositors rightly take it as descriptive of
the place and object of the action expressed: He establishes peace in
His heights, i.e., among the celestial beings immediately surrounding
Him. This, only assuming the abstract possibility of discord, might
mean: facit magestate sua ut in summa pace et promptissima obedientia
ipsi ministrent angeli ipsius in excelsis (Schmid). But although from
[Job 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018.md); [Job
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015.md), nothing more than that even the
holy ones above are neither removed from the possibility of sin nor the
necessity of a judicial authority which is high above them, can be
inferred; yet, on the other hand, from [Job
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008.md); [Job
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013.md) (comp. [Job
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#012)..md), it is clear that the poet, in
whose conception, as in scripture generally, the angels and the stars
stand in the closest relation, knows of actual, and not merely past, but
possibly recurring, instances of hostile dissension and titanic
rebellion among the celestial powers; so that עשׂה שׁלום, therefore, is
intended not merely of a harmonizing reconciliation among creatures
which have been contending one against another, but of an actual
restoration of the equilibrium that had been disturbed through
self-will, by an act of mediation and the exercise of judicial authority
on the part of God.

[Job 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#003.md)

Instead of the appellation מרומיו, which reminds one of [Isa
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021.md), - where a like peacemaking act
of judgment on the part of God is promised in reference to the
spirit-host of the heights that have been working seductively among the
nations on earth, - גּדוּדיו, of similar meaning to צבאיו, used
elsewhere, occurs in this verse. The stars, according to biblical
representation, are like an army arrayed for battle, but not as after
the Persian representation - as an army divided into troops of the
Ahuramazd and Angramainyus (Ahriman), but a standing army of the
children of light, clad in the armour of light, under the guidance of
the one God the Creator ([Isa 40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026.md),
comp. the anti-dualistic assertion in [Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007).md). The one God is the Lord among
these numberless legions, who commands their reverence, and maintains
unity among them; and over whom does not His light arise? Umbr.
explains: who does not His light, which He communicates to the hosts of
heaven, vanquish (קוּם על in the usual warlike meaning: to rise against
any one); but this is a thought that is devoid of purpose in this
connection. אורהו with the emphatic suff. hu (as [Job
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#023), עיניהוּ.md) at any rate refers
directly to God: His light in distinction from the derived light of the
hosts of heaven. This distinction is better brought out if we interpret
(Merc., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm., and others): over whom does (would) not
His light arise? i.e., all receive their light from His, and do but
reflect it back. But יקוּם = יזרח cannot be justified by [Job
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017.md). Therefore we interpret with Ew.
and Hlgst. thus: whom does not His light surpass, or, literally, over
whom (i.e., which of these beings of light) does it not rise, leaving it
behind and exceeding it in brightness (יקוּם as synon. of ירוּם)? How
then could a mortal be just with God, i.e., at His side or standing up
before Him; and how could one of woman born be spotless! How could he
(which is hereby indirectly said) enter into a controversy with God, who
is infinitely exalted above him, and maintain before Him a moral
character faultless, and therefore absolutely free from condemnation! In
the heights of heaven God's decision is revered; and should man, the
feeble one, and born flesh of flesh (vid., [Job
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001).md), dare to contend with God?
Behold, עד־ירח (עד, as usually when preceded by a negation, adeo, ne ...
quidem, e.g., [Exo 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028.md), comp. [Nah
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010.md), where J. H. Michaelis correctly
renders: adeo up spinas perplexitate aequent, and אל used in the same
way, [Job 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#005), Ew. 219, c.md), even as to
the moon, it does not (ולא with Waw apod., Ges. 145, 2, although there
is a reading לא without ו) shine bright, יאחיל = יהל, from אהל = הלל.

(Note: It is worthy of observation, that hilâl signifies in Arabic the
new moon (comp. Genesis, S. 307); and the Hiphil ahalla, like the Kal
halla, is used of the appearing and shining of the new moon.)

Thus lxx, Targ. Jer., and Gecatilia translate; whereas Saadia
translates: it turns not in (Arab. lâ ydchl), or properly, it does not
pitch its tent, fix its habitation. But to pitch one's tent is אהל or
אהל, whence יהל, [Isa 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md), = יאהל;
and what is still more decisive, one would naturally expect יאהיל שׁם in
connection with this thought. We therefore render אהל as a form for once
boldly used in the scriptural language for הלל, as in [Isa
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028.md) אדשׁ once occurs for דּוּשׁ.
Even the moon is only a feeble light before God, and the stars are not
clean in His eyes; there is a vast distance between Him and His highest
and most glorious creatures - how much more between Him and man, the
worm of the dust!

The friends, as was to be expected, are unable to furnish any solution
of the mystery, why the ungodly often live and die happily; and yet they
ought to be able to give this solution, if the language which they
employ against Job were authorized. Bildad alone speaks in the above
speech, Zophar is silent. But Bildad does not utter a word that affects
the question. This designed omission shows the inability of the friends
to solve it, as much as the tenacity with which they firmly maintain
their dogma; and the breach that has been made in it, either they will
not perceive or yet not acknowledge, because they think that thereby
they are approaching too near to the honour of God. Moreover, it must be
observed with what delicate tact, and how directly to the purpose in the
structure of the whole, this short speech of Bildad's closes the
opposition of the friends. Two things are manifest from this last speech
of the friends: First, that they know nothing new to bring forward
against Job, and nothing just to Job's advantage; that all their darts
bound back from Job; and that, though not according to their judgment,
yet in reality, they are beaten. This is evident from the fact that
Bildad is unable to give any answer to Job's questions, but can only
take up the one idea in Job's speech, that he confidently and boldly
thinks of being able to approach God's throne of judgment; he repeats
with slight variation what Eliphaz has said twice already, concerning
the infinite distance between man and God, [Job
4:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017.md); [Job
15:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014.md), and is not even denied by
Job himself, [Job 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002.md); [Job
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004.md). But, secondly, the poet cannot
allow us to part from the friends with too great repugnance; for they
are Job's friends notwithstanding, and at the close we see them
willingly obedient to God's instruction, to go to Job that he may pray
for them and make sacrifice on their behalf. For this reason he does not
make Bildad at last repeat those unjust incriminations which were put
prominently forward in the speech of Eliphaz, [Job
22:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#005.md). Bildad only reminds Job of
the universal sinfulness of the human race once again, without direct
accusation, in order that Job may himself derive from it the admonition
to humble himself; and this admonition Job really needs, for his
speeches are in many ways contrary to that humility which is still the
duty of sinful man, even in connection with the best justified
consciousness of right thoughts and actions towards the holy God.
