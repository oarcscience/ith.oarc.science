Removal of the Ark to Jerusalem - 2 Samuel 6

After David had selected the citadel of Zion, or rather Jerusalem, as
the capital of the kingdom, he directed his attention to the
organization and improvement of the legally established worship of the
congregation, which had fallen grievously into decay since the death of
Eli, in consequence of the separation of the ark from the tabernacle. He
therefore resolved first of all to fetch out the ark of the covenant, as
the true centre of the Mosaic sanctuary, from its obscurity and bring it
up to Zion; and having deposited it in a tent previously prepared to
receive it, to make this a place of worship where the regular worship of
God might be carried on in accordance with the instructions of the law.
That he should make the capital of his kingdom the central point of the
worship of the whole congregation of Israel, followed so naturally from
the nature of the kingdom of God, and the relation in which David stood,
as the earthly monarch of that kingdom, towards Jehovah the God-king,
that there is no necessity whatever to seek for even a partial
explanation in the fact that David felt it desirable to have the high
priest with the Urim and Thummim always close at hand. But why did not
David remove the Mosaic tabernacle to Mount Zion at Jerusalem at the
same time as the ark of the covenant, and so restore the divinely
established sanctuary in its integrity? This question can only be
answered by conjectures. One of the principal motives for allowing the
existing separation of the ark from the tabernacle to continue, may have
been that, during the time the two sanctuaries had been separated, two
high priests had arisen, one of whom officiated at the tabernacle at
Gibeon, whilst the other, namely Abiathar, who escaped the massacre of
the priests at Nob and fled at once to David, had been the channel of
all divine communications to David during the time of his persecution by
Saul, and had also officiated as high priest in his camp; so that he
could no more think of deposing him from the office which he had
hitherto filled, in consequence of the reorganization of the legal
worship, than he could of deposing Zadok, of the line of Eleazar, the
officiating high priest at Gibeon. Moreover, David may from the very
first have regarded the service which he instituted in connection with
the ark upon Zion as merely a provisional arrangement, which was to
continue till his kingdom was more thoroughly consolidated, and the way
had been thereby prepared for erecting a fixed house of God, and so
establishing the worship of the nation of Jehovah upon a more durable
foundation. David may also have cherished the firm belief that in the
meantime the Lord would put an end to the double priesthood which had
grown out of the necessities of the times, or at any rate give him some
direct revelation as to the arrangements which he ought to make.

We have a parallel account of the removal of the ark of the covenant to
Zion in [Ch1 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005.md) and [Ch1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006.md), which agrees for the most part
verbatim, at all events in all essential points, with the account before
us; but the liturgical side of this solemn act is very elaborately
described, especially the part taken by the Levites, whereas the account
given here is very condensed, and is restricted in fact to an account of
the work of removing the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Jerusalem as carried
out by David. David composed the 24th Psalm for the religious ceremonies
connected with the removal of the ark to Mount Zion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 6:1</span></span>

[Sa2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001.md)

The ark fetched from Kirjath-jearim. - [Sa2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001.md). "David assembled together again
all the chosen men in Israel, thirty thousand." יסף for יאסף is the Kal
of אסף, as in [Sa1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md); [Psa
104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md). עוד, again, once more, points
back to [Sa2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md), [Sa2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003.md), where all Israel is said to have
assembled for the first time in Hebron to anoint David king. It is true
that that assembly was not convened directly by David himself; but this
was not the point in question, but merely their assembling a second time
(see Bertheau on [Ch1 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005).md). בּחוּר
does not mean "the young men" here (νεάνια, lxx), or "the fighting men,"
but, according to the etymology of the word, "the picked men." Instead
of thirty thousand, the lxx have seventy chiliads, probably with an
intentional exaggeration, because the number of men in Israel who were
capable of bearing arms amounted to more than thirty thousand. The whole
nation, through a very considerable body of representatives, was to take
part in the removal of the ark. The writer of the Chronicles gives a
more elaborate account of the preparations for these festivities ([Ch1
13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001).md); namely, that David took
counsel with the heads of thousands and hundreds, and all the leaders,
i.e., all the heads of families and households, and then with their
consent collected together the whole nation from the brook of Egypt to
Hamath, of course not every individual, but a large number of heads of
households as representatives of the whole. This account in the
Chronicles is not an expansion of the brief notice given here; but the
account before us is a condensation of the fuller description given in
the sources that were employed by both authors.

[Sa2 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md)

"David went with all the people that were with him to Baale-Jehuda, to
fetch up the ark of God from thence." The words והוּדה מבּעליcause some
difficulty on account of the מן, which is used instead of the accusative
with ה loc., like בּעלתה in the Chronicles; yet the translators of the
Septuagint, Chaldee, Vulgate, and other versions, all had the reading מן
in their text, and בּעלי has therefore been taken as an appellative and
rendered ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχότων Ἰουδά ("from the rulers of Judah"), or as
Luther renders it, "from the citizens of Judah." This is decidedly
incorrect, as the word "thence" which follows is perfectly
unintelligible on any other supposition than that Baale-Jehudah is the
name of a place. Baale-Jehudah is another name of the city of
Kirjath-jearim ([Jos 15:60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060.md); [Jos
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#014).md), which is called Baalah in [Jos
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009.md) and [Ch1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006.md), according to its Canaanitish
name, instead of which the name Kirjath-jearim (city of the woods) was
adopted by the Israelites, though without entirely supplanting the old
name. The epithet "of Judah" is a contraction of the fuller expression
"city of the children of Judah" in [Jos
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#014.md), and is added to distinguish
this Baal city, which was situated upon the border of the tribe of
Judah, from other cities that were also named after Baal, such as Baal
or Baalath-beer in the tribe of Simeon ([Ch1
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#033.md); [Jos
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#008).md), Baalath in the tribe of Dan
([Jos 19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044).md), the present Kuryet el
Enab (see at [Jos 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017)). The מן (from.md)
is either a very ancient error of the pen that crept by accident into
the text, or, if genuine and original, it is to be explained on the
supposition that the historian dropped the construction with which he
started, and instead of mentioning Baale-Jehudah as the place to which
David went, gave it at once as the place from which he fetched the ark;
so that the passage is to be understood in this way: "And David went,
and all the people who were with him, out of Baale-Jehudah, to which
they had gone up to fetch the ark of God" (Kimchi). In the sentence
which follows, a difficulty is also occasioned by the repetition of the
word שׁם in the clause עליו ... נקרא עשׁר, "upon which the name is
called, the name of Jehovah of hosts, who is enthroned above the
cherubim." The difficulty cannot be solved by altering the first שׁם
into שׁם, as Clericus, Thenius, and Bertheau suggest: for if this
alteration were adopted, we should have to render the passage "where the
name of Jehovah of hosts is invoked, who is enthroned above the cherubim
(which are) upon it (i.e., upon the ark);" and this would not only
introduce an unscriptural thought into the passage, but it would be
impossible to find any suitable meaning for the word עליו, except by
making very arbitrary interpolations. Throughout the whole of the Old
Testament we never meet with the idea that the name of Jehovah was
invoked at the ark of the covenant, because no one was allowed to
approach the ark for the purpose of invoking the name of the Lord there;
and upon the great day of atonement the high priest was only allowed to
enter the most holy place with the cloud of incense, to sprinkle the
blood of the atoning sacrifice upon the ark. Moreover, the standing
expression for "call upon the name of the Lord" is יי בשׁם קרא; whereas
פּ על יי שׁם נקרא signifies "the name of Jehovah is called above a
person or thing." Lastly, even if עליו belonged to הכּרבים ישׁב, it
would not only be a superfluous addition, occurring nowhere else in
connection with הך ישׁב, not even in [Ch1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006.md) (vid., [Sa1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004.md); [Kg2
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#015.md); [Isa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016.md); [Psa
99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001).md), but such an addition if made at
all would necessarily require עליו אשׁר ע (vid., [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022).md). The only way in which we can
obtain a biblical thought and grammatical sense is by connecting עליו
with the אשׁר before נקרא: "above which (ark) the name of
Jehovah-Zebaoth is named," i.e., above which Jehovah reveals His glory
or His divine nature to His people, or manifests His gracious presence
in Israel. "The name of God denotes all the operations of God through
which He attests His personal presence in that relation into which He
has entered to man, i.e., the whole of the divine self-manifestation, or
of that side of the divine nature which is turned towards men" (Oehler,
Herzog's Real-Encycl. x. p. 197). From this deeper meaning of "the name
of God" we may probably explain the repetition of the word שׁם, which is
first of all written absolutely (as at the close of [Lev
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016).md), and then more fully defined as
"the name of the Lord of hosts."

[Sa2 6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003.md)

"They set the ark of God upon a new cart, and took it away from the
house of Abinadab." הרכּיב means here "to put (load) upon a cart," and
נשׂא dn to take away, i.e., drive off: for there are grammatical (or
syntactical) reasons which make it impossible to render וישּׂאהוּ as a
pluperfect ("they had taken"), on account of the previous וירכבו.

The ark of the covenant had been standing in the house of Abinadab from
the time when the Philistines had sent it back into the land of Israel,
i.e., about seventy years (viz., twenty years to the victory at Ebenezer
mentioned in [Sa1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md)., forty years
under Samuel and Saul, and about ten years under David: see the
chronological table). The further statement, that "Uzzah and Ahio, sons
of Abinadab, drove the cart," may easily be reconciled with this. These
two sons were either born about the time when the ark was first taken to
Abinadab's house, or at a subsequent period; or else the term sons is
used, as is frequently the case, in the sense of grandsons. The words
from חדשׁה (the last word in [Sa2 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003).md)
to Gibeah in [Sa2 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#004.md) are wanting in
the Septuagint, and can only have been introduced through the error of a
copyist, whose eye wandered back to the first עגלה in [Sa2
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003.md), so that he copied a whole line
twice over; for they not only contain a pure tautology, a merely verbal
and altogether superfluous and purposeless repetition, but they are
altogether unsuitable to the connection in which they stand. Not only is
there something very strange in the repetition of the חדשׁה without an
article after העגלה; but the words which follow, ארון ה עם (with the ark
of God), cannot be made to fit on to the repeated clause, for there is
no sense whatever in such a sentence as this: "They brought it (the ark)
out of the house of Abinadab, which is upon the hill, with the ark of
God." The only way in which the words "with the ark" can be made to
acquire any meaning at all, is by omitting the repetition referred to,
and connecting them with the new cart in [Sa2
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003.md) : "Uzzah and Ahio ... drove the
cart with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark." נהג, to drive
(a carriage), is construed here with an accusative, in [Ch1
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#007.md) with בּ, as in [Isa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md).

[Sa2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005.md)

And David and all the house (people) of Israel were משׂחקים, sporting,
i.e., they danced and played, before Jehovah. ברושׁים עצי בּכל, "with
all kinds of woods of cypresses." This could only mean, with all kinds
of instruments made of cypress wood; but this mode of expression would
be a very strange one even if the reading were correct. In the
Chronicles, however ([Sa2 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008).md),
instead of this strange expression, we find וּבשׁירים בּכל־עז, "with all
their might and with songs." This is evidently the correct reading, from
which our text has sprung, although the latter is found in all the old
versions, and even in the Septuagint, which really combines the two
readings thus: ἐν ὀργάνοις ἡρμοσμένοις ἐν ισχύΐ καὶ ἐν ᾠδαῖς, where ἐν
ὀργάνοις ἡρμοσμένοις is evidently the interpretation of ברושׁים עצי
בּכל; for the text of the Chronicles cannot be regarded as an
explanation of Samuel. Moreover, songs would not be omitted on such a
festive occasion; and two of the instruments mentioned, viz., the kinnor
and nebel (see at [Sa1 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005).md), were
generally played as accompaniments to singing. The vav before בּשׁירים,
and before the different instruments, corresponds to the Latin et ...
et, both ... and. תּף, the timbrel. וּבצלצלים בּמנענעים, sistris et
cymbalis (Vulg., Syr.), "with bells and cymbals" (Luther). מנענעים, from
נוּע, are instruments that are shaken, the σεῖστρα, sistra, of the
ancients, which consisted of two iron rods fastened together at one end,
either in a semicircle or at right angels, upon which rings were hung
loosely, so as to make a tinkling sound when they were shaken. צלצלים =
מצלתּים are cymbals or castanets. Instead of מנענעים, we find חצצרות,
trumpets, mentioned in the Chronicles in the last rank after the
cymbals. It is possible that sistra were played and trumpets blown, so
that the two accounts complete each other.

[Sa2 6:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006.md)

When the procession had reached the threshing-floor of Nachon, Uzzah
stretched out his hand to lay hold of the ark, i.e., to keep it from
falling over with the cart, because the oxen slipped. And the wrath of
the Lord was kindled, and God slew Uzzah upon the spot. Goren nachon
means "the threshing-floor of the stroke" (nachon from נכה, not from
כּוּן); in the Chronicles we have goren chidon, i.e., the
threshing-floor of destruction or disaster (כּידון = כּיד, [Job
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#020).md). Chidon is probably only an
explanation of nachon, so that the name may have been given to the
threshing-floor, not from its owner, but from the incident connected
with the ark which took place there. Eventually, however, this name was
supplanted by the name Perez-uzzah ([Sa2
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008).md). The situation of the
threshing-floor cannot be determined, as all that we can gather from
this account is that the house of Obed-edom the Gathite was somewhere
near it; but no village, hamlet, or town is mentioned.

(Note: If it were possible to discover the situation of Gath-rimmon, the
home of Obed-edom (see at [Sa2 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#010).md),
we might probably decide the question whether Obed-edom was still living
in the town where he was born or not. But according to the Onom.,
Kirjath-jearim was ten miles from Jerusalem, and Gath-rimmon twelve,
that is to say, farther off. Now, if these statements are correct,
Obed-edom's house cannot have been in Gath-rimmon.)

Jerome paraphrases הבּקר שׁמטוּ כּי thus: "Because the oxen kicked and
turned it (the ark over." But שׁמט does not mean to kick; its true
meaning is to let go, or let lie ([Exo
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011.md); [Deu
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002).md), hence to slip or stumble. The
stumbling of the animals might easily have turned the cart over, and
this was what Uzzah tried to prevent by laying hold of the ark. God
smote him there "on account of the offence" (שׁל, ἁπ. λεγ. from שׁלה, in
the sense of erring, or committing a fault). The writer of the
Chronicles gives it thus: "Because he had stretched out his hand to the
ark," though of course the text before us is not to be altered to this,
as Thenius and Bertheau suggest.

[Sa2 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008.md)

"And David was angry, because Jehovah had made a rent on Uzzah, and
called the place Perez-uzzah" (rent of Uzzah). פּרץ פּרץ, to tear a
rent, is here applied to a sudden tearing away from life. ל יחר is
understood by many in the sense of "he troubled himself;" but this
meaning cannot be grammatically sustained, whilst it is quite possible
to become angry, or fall into a state of violent excitement, at an
unexpected calamity. The burning of David's anger was not directed
against God, but referred to the calamity which had befallen Uzzah, or
speaking more correctly, to the cause of this calamity, which David
attributed to himself or to his undertaking. As he had not only resolved
upon the removal of the ark, but had also planned the way in which it
should be taken to Jerusalem, he could not trace the occasion of Uzzah's
death to any other cause than his own plans. He was therefore angry that
such misfortune had attended his undertaking. In his first excitement
and dismay, David may not have perceived the real and deeper ground of
this divine judgment. Uzzah's offence consisted in the fact that he had
touched the ark with profane feelings, although with good intentions,
namely to prevent its rolling over and falling from the cart. Touching
the ark, the throne of the divine glory and visible pledge of the
invisible presence of the Lord, was a violation of the majesty of the
holy God. "Uzzah was therefore a type of all who with good intentions,
humanly speaking, yet with unsanctified minds, interfere in the affairs
of the kingdom of God, from the notion that they are in danger, and with
the hope of saving them" (O. v. Gerlach). On further reflection, David
could not fail to discover where the cause of Uzzah's offence, which he
had atoned for with his life, really had lain, and that it had actually
arisen from the fact that he (David) and those about him had decided to
disregard the distinct instructions of the law with regard to the
handling of the ark. According to Num 4 the ark was not only to be moved
by none but Levites, but it was to be carried on the shoulders, not in a
carriage; and in [Num 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015.md), even the
Levites were expressly forbidden to touch it on pain of death. But
instead of taking these instructions as their rule, they had followed
the example of the Philistines when they sent back the ark ([Sa1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#007)..md), and had placed it upon a new
cart, and directed Uzzah to drive it, whilst, as his conduct on the
occasion clearly shows, he had no idea of the unapproachable holiness of
the ark of God, and had to expiate his offence with his life, as a
warning to all the Israelites.

[Sa2 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#009.md)

David's excitement at what had occurred was soon changed into fear of
the Lord, so that he said, "How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?" If
merely touching the ark of God is punished in this way, how can I have
it brought near me, up to the citadel of Zion? He therefore relinquished
his intention of bringing it into the city of David, and placed it in
the house of Obed-edom the Gathite. Obed-edom was a Levite of the family
of the Korahites, who sprang from Kohath (compare [Exo
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#021.md); [Exo
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#016.md), and [Ch1
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#004).md), and belonged to the class of
Levitical doorkeepers, whose duty it was, in connection with other
Levites, to watch over the ark in the sacred tent ([Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018.md), [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024).md). He is called the Gittite or
Gathite from his birthplace, the Levitical city of Gath-rimmon in the
tribe of Dan ([Jos 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#024.md); [Jos
19:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#045).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 6:11</span></span>

Removal of the ark of God to the city of David (cf. 1 Chron 15). - [Sa2
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011.md), [Sa2
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012.md). When the ark had been in the
house of Obed-edom for three months, and David heard that the Lord had
blessed his house for the sake of the ark of God, he went thither and
brought it up to the city of David with gladness i.e., with festal
rejoicing, or a solemn procession. (For שׂמהה, in the sense of festal
rejoicing, or a joyous fte, see [Gen
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#027.md); [Neh
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#043), etc..md) On this occasion,
however, David adhered strictly to the instructions of the law, as the
more elaborate account given in the Chronicles clearly shows. He not
only gathered together all Israel at Jerusalem to join in this solemn
act, but summoned the priests and Levites, and commanded them to
sanctify themselves, and carry the ark "according to the right," i.e.,
as the Lord had commanded in the law of Moses, and to offer sacrifices
during the procession, and sin songs, i.e., psalms, with musical
accompaniment. In the very condensed account before us, all that is
mentioned is the carrying of the ark, the sacrificing during the march,
and the festivities of the king and people. But even from these few
facts we see that David had discovered his former mistake, and had given
up the idea of removing the ark upon a carriage as a transgression of
the law.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 6:13</span></span>

The bearers of the ark are not particularly mentioned in this account;
but it is very evident that they were Levites, as the Chronicles affirm,
from the fact that the ark was carried this time, and not driven, as
before. "And it came to pass, when the bearers of the ark of Jehovah had
gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatted calf" (i.e., had them
sacrificed). These words are generally understood as meaning, that
sacrifices of this kind were offered along the whole way, at the
distance of six paces apart. This would certainly have been a possible
thing, and there would be no necessity to assume that the procession
halted every six paces, until the sacrificial ceremony was completed,
but the ark might have continued in progress, whilst sacrifices were
being offered at the distances mentioned. And even the immense number of
sacrificial animals that would have been required is no valid objection
to such an assumption. We do not know what the distance really was: all
that we know is, that it was not so much as ten miles, as Kirjath-jearim
was only about twelve miles from Jerusalem, so that a few thousand oxen,
and the same number of fatted calves, would have been quite sufficient.
But the words of the text do not distinctly affirm that sacrifices were
offered whenever the bearers advanced six paces, but only that this was
done was soon as the bearers had taken the first six steps. So that,
strictly speaking, all that is stated is, that when the procession had
started and gone six paces, the sacrifice was offered, namely, for the
purpose of inaugurating or consecrating the solemn procession. In 1
Chron 15 this fact is omitted; and it is stated instead ([Ch1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026).md), that "when God helped the
Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they offered
seven bullocks and seven rams," i.e., at the close of the procession,
when the journey was ended, to praise God for the fact that the Levites
had been enabled to carry the ark of God to the place appointed for it,
without suffering the slightest harm.

(Note: There is no discrepancy, therefore, between the two different
accounts; but the one supplements the other in a manner perfectly in
harmony with the whole affair, - at the outset, a sacrifice consisting
of one ox and one fatted calf; and at the close, one of seven oxen and
seven rams. Consequently there is no reason for altering the text of the
verse before us, as Thenius proposes, according to the senseless
rendering of the lxx, καὶ ἦσαν μετ ̓ αὐτοῦ αἴροντες τὴν κιβωτὸν ἑπτὰ
χοροί, καὶ θῦμα μόσχος καὶ ἄρνες ("with David there were bearers of the
ark, seven choirs, and sacrifices of a calf and lambs"), which has also
found its way into the Vulgate, though Jerome has rendered our Hebrew
text faithfully afterwards (i.e., after the gloss, which was probably
taken from the Itala, and inserted in his translation).)

"And David danced with all his might before the Lord (i.e., before the
ark), and was girded with a white ephod (shoulder-dress)." Dancing, as
an expression of holy enthusiasm, was a customary thing from time
immemorial: we meet with it as early as at the festival of thanksgiving
at the Red Sea ([Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020).md); but
there, and also at subsequent celebrations of the different victories
gained by the Israelites, none but women are described as taking part in
it ([Jdg 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md); [Jdg
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019.md); [Sa1
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006).md). The white ephod was, strictly
speaking, a priestly costume, although in the law it is not prescribed
as the dress to be worn by them when performing their official duties,
but rather as the dress which denoted the priestly character of the
wearer (see at [Sa1 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018).md); and for
this reason it was worn by David in connection with these festivities in
honour of the Lord, as the head of the priestly nation of Israel (see at
[Sa1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018).md). In [Sa2
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015.md) it is still further related, that
David and all the house (nation) of Israel brought up the ark of the
Lord with jubilee and trumpet-blast. תּרוּעה is used here to signify the
song of jubilee and the joyous shouting of the people. In the Chronicles
([Ch1 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#028).md) the musical instruments
played on the occasion are also severally mentioned.

When the ark came (i.e., was carried) into the city of David, Michal the
daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and there she saw king David
leaping and dancing before Jehovah, and despised him in her heart. והיה,
"and it came to pass," for ויהי, because there is no progress made, but
only another element introduced. בּא is a perfect: "the ark had come,
... and Michal looked through the window, ... there she saw," etc.
Michal is intentionally designated the daughter of Saul here, instead of
the wife of David, because on this occasion she manifested her father's
disposition rather than her husband's. In Saul's time people did not
trouble themselves about the ark of the covenant ([Ch1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#003).md); public worship was neglected,
and the soul for vital religion had died out in the family of the king.
Michal possessed teraphim, and in David she only loved the brave hero
and exalted king: she therefore took offence at the humility with which
the king, in his pious enthusiasm, placed himself on an equality with
all the rest of the nation before the Lord.

When the ark was brought to the place appointed for it upon Mount Zion,
and was deposited in the tent which David had prepared for it, he
offered burnt-offerings and thank-offerings before the Lord. "In its
place" is still further defined as "in the midst of the tent which
David," etc., i.e., in the Most Holy Place; for the tent would certainly
be constructed according to the type of the Mosaic tabernacle. The
burnt-offerings and peace-offerings were offered to consecrate the newly
erected house of God.

When the offering of sacrifice was over, David blessed the people in the
name of the Lord, as Solomon did afterwards at the dedication of the
temple ([Kg1 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#055).md), and gave to all
the (assembled) people, both men and women, to every one a slice of
bread, a measure (of wine), and a cake for a festal meal, i.e., for the
sacrificial meal, which was celebrated with the shelamim after the
offering of the sacrifices, and after the king had concluded the
liturgical festival with a benediction. לחם חלּת is a round cake of
bread, baked for sacrificial meals, and synonymous with כּכּר־לחם ([Ch1
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#003).md), as we may see from a comparison
of [Exo 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#023.md) with [Lev
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#026.md) (see the commentary on [Lev
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#002).md). But the meaning of the ἁπ. λεγ.
אשׁפּר is uncertain, and has been much disputed. Most of the Rabbins
understand it as signifying a piece of flesh or roast meat, deriving the
word from אשׁ and פּר; but this is certainly false. There is more to be
said in favour of the derivation proposed by L. de Dieu, viz., from the
Ethiopic שׁפר, netiri, from which Gesenius and Roediger (Ges. Thes. p.
1470) have drawn their explanation of the word as signifying a measure
of wine or other beverage. For אשׁישׁה, the meaning grape-cake or
raisin-cake is established by Son of [Sol
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005.md) and [Hos
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md) (vid., Hengstenberg, Christol. on
[Hos 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001).md). The people returned home
after the festal meal.

When David returned home to bless his house, as he had previously
blessed the people, Michal came to meet him with scornful words, saying,
"How has the king of Israel glorified himself to-day, when he stripped
himself before the eyes of the maids of his servants, as only one of the
loose people strips himself!" The unusual combination נגלות כּהגּלות is
explained by Ewald (240, e., p. 607) in this manner, that whilst, so far
as the sense of the clause is concerned, the second verb ought to be in
the infinitive absolute, they were both written with a very slight
change of form in the infinitive construct; whereas others regard נגלות
as an unusual form of the infinitive absolute (Ges. Lehrgeb. p. 430), or
a copyist's error for נגלה (Thenius, Olsh. Gr. p. 600). The proud
daughter of Saul was offended at the fact, that the king had let himself
down on this occasion to the level of the people. She availed herself of
the shortness of the priests' shoulder-dress, to make a contemptuous
remark concerning David's dancing, as an impropriety that was unbecoming
in a king. "Who knows whether the proud woman did not intend to sneer at
the rank of the Levites, as one that was contemptible in her eyes, since
their humble service may have looked very trivial to her?" (Berleb.
Bible.)

[Sa2 6:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#021.md)

David replied, "Before Jehovah, who chose me before thy father and all
his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel,
before Jehovah have I played (lit. joked, given utterance to my joy).
And I will be still more despised, and become base in my eyes: and with
the maidens of whom thou hast spoken, with them will I be honoured." The
copula vav before שׂהקתּי serves to introduce the apodosis, and may be
explained in this way, that the relative clause appended to "before
Jehovah" acquired the power of a protasis on account of its length; so
that, strictly speaking, there is an anakolouthon, as if the protasis
read thus: "Before Jehovah, as He hath chosen me over Israel, I have
humbled myself before Jehovah" (for "before him"). With the words "who
chose me before thy father and all his house," David humbles the pride
of the king's daughter. His playing and dancing referred to the Lord,
who had chosen him, and had rejected Saul on account of his pride. He
would therefore let himself be still further despised before the Lord,
i.e., would bear still greater contempt from men than that which he had
just received, and be humbled in his own eyes (vid., [Psa
131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001).md): then would he also with the
maidens attain to honour before the Lord. For whoso humbleth himself,
him will God exalt ([Mat 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#012).md).
בּעיני is not to be altered into בּעיניך, as in the lxx. This alteration
has arisen from a total misconception of the nature of true humility,
which is of no worth in its own eyes. The rendering given by De Wette is
at variance with both the grammar and the sense ("with the maidens, ...
with them will I magnify myself"); and so also is that of Thenius ("with
them will I be honoured, i.e., indemnify myself for thy foolish
contempt!").

[Sa2 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023.md)

Michael was humbled by God for her pride, and remained childless to the
time of her death.
