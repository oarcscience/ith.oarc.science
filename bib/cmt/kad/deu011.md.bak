### [Deuteronomy Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 11:1</span></span>

In [Deu 11:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001.md) the other feature in
the divine requirements ([Deu 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012).md),
viz., love to the Lord their God, is still more fully developed. Love
was to show itself in the distinct perception of what had to be observed
towards Jehovah (to "keep His charge," see at [Lev
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035).md), i.e., in the perpetual
observance of His commandments and rights. The words, "and His
statutes," etc., serve to explain the general notion, "His charge." "All
days," as in [Deu 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010.md).

[Deuteronomy 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 11:2</span></span>

To awaken this love they were now to know, i.e., to ponder and lay to
heart, the discipline of the Lord their God. The words from "for (I
speak) not" to "have not seen" are a parenthetical clause, by which
Moses would impress his words most strongly upon the hearts of the older
generation, which had witnessed the acts of the Lord. The clause is
without any verb or predicate, but this can easily be supplied from the
sense. The best suggestion is that of Schultz, viz., ההוּא הדּבר, "for
it is not with your children that I have to do," not to them that this
admonition applies. Moses refers to the children who had been born in
the desert, as distinguished from those who, though not twenty years old
when the Israelites came out of Egypt, had nevertheless seen with their
own eyes the plagues inflicted upon Egypt, and who were now of mature
age, viz., between forty and sixty years old, and formed, as the older
and more experienced generation, the stock and kernel of the
congregation assembled round him now. To the words, "which have not
known and have not seen," it is easy to supply from the context, "what
ye have known and seen." The accusatives from "the chastisement" onwards
belong to the verb of the principal sentence, "know ye this day." The
accusatives which follow show what we are to understand by "the
chastisement of the Lord," viz., the mighty acts of the Lord to Egypt
and to Israel in the desert. The object of them all was to educate
Israel in the fear and love of God. In this sense Moses calls them מוּסר
(Eng. Ver. chastisement), παιδεία, i.e., not punishment only, but
education by the manifestation of love as well as punishment (like יסּר
in [Deu 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#036.md); cf. [Pro
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002.md), [Pro
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008.md); [Pro
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001), etc..md). "His greatness," etc., as
in [Deu 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#024.md) and [Deu
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md). On the signs and acts in Egypt,
see at [Deu 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md); [Deu
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#022.md); and on those at the Red Sea, at
Ex 14. פּניהם - הצּיף אשׁר, "over whose face He made the waters of the
Red Sea to flow;" cf. [Exo 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#026.md). - By
the acts of God in the desert ([Deu
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#005).md) we are not to understand the
chastenings in Num 11-15 either solely or pre-eminently, but all the
manifestations of the omnipotence of God in the guidance of Israel,
proofs of love as well as the penal wonders. Of the latter, the
miraculous destruction of the company of Korah is specially mentioned in
[Deu 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006.md) (cf. [Num
16:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#031).md). Here Moses only mentions
Dathan and Abiram, the followers of Korah, and not Korah himself,
probably from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth
along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of
Korah. "Everything existing, which was in their following" (see [Exo
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008).md), does not mean their
possessions, but their servants, and corresponds to "all the men who
belonged to Korah" in [Num 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#032.md),
whereas the possessions mentioned there are included here in the
"tents." היקוּם is only applied to living beings, as in [Gen
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#004.md) and [Gen
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#023.md). - In [Deu
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#007.md) the reason is given for the
admonition in [Deu 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#002.md) : the elders
were to know (discern) the educational purpose of God in those mighty
acts of the Lord, because they had seen them with their own eyes.

[Deuteronomy 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 11:8</span></span>

And this knowledge was to impel them to keep the law, that they might be
strong, i.e., spiritually strong ([Deu
1:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#038).md), and not only go into the
promised land, but also live long therein (cf. [Deu
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026.md); [Deu
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#003).md). - In [Deu
11:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010.md) Moses adduces a fresh motive
for his admonition to keep the law with fidelity, founded upon the
peculiar nature of the land. Canaan was a land the fertility of which
was not dependent, like that of Egypt, upon its being watered by the
hand of man, but was kept up by the rain of heaven which was sent down
by God the Lord, so that it depended entirely upon the Lord how long its
inhabitants should live therein. Egypt is described by Moses as a land
which Israel sowed with seed, and watered with its foot like a garden of
herbs. In Egypt there is hardly any rain at all (cf. Herod. ii. 4, Diod.
Sic. i. 41, and other evidence in Hengstenberg's Egypt and the Books of
Moses, pp. 217ff.). The watering of the land, which produces its
fertility, is dependent upon the annual overflowing of the Nile, and, as
this only lasts for about 100 days, upon the way in which this is made
available for the whole year, namely, by the construction of canals and
ponds throughout the land, to which the water is conducted from the Nile
by forcing machines, or by actually carrying it in vessels up to the
fields and plantations.

(Note: Upon the ancient monuments we find not only the draw-well with
the long rope, which is now called Shaduf, depicted in various ways (see
Wilkinson, i. p. 35, ii. 4); but at Beni-Hassan there is a
representation of two men carrying a water-vessel upon a pole on their
shoulders, which they fill from a draw-well or pond, and then carry to
the field (cf. Hengstenberg, Egypt and the Books of Moses, pp. 220-1).)

The expression, "with thy foot," probably refers to the large pumping
wheels still in use there, which are worked by the feet, and over which
a long endless rope passes with pails attached, for drawing up the water
(cf. Niebuhr, Reise, i. 149), the identity of which with the ἕλιξ
described by Philo as ὑδρηλὸν ὄργανον (de confus. ling. i. 410) cannot
possibly be called in question; provided, that is to say, we do not
confound this ἕλιξ with the Archimedean water-screw mentioned by Diod.
Sic. i. 34, and described more minutely at v. 37, the construction of
which was entirely different (see my Archaeology, ii. pp. 111-2). - The
Egyptians, as genuine heathen, were so thoroughly conscious of this
peculiar characteristic of their land, which made its fertility far more
dependent upon the labour of human hands than upon the rain of heaven or
divine providence, that Herodotus (ii. 13) represents them as saying,
"The Greeks, with their dependence upon the gods, might be disappointed
in their brightest hopes and suffer dreadfully from famine." The land of
Canaan yielded no support to such godless self-exaltation, for it was "a
land of mountains and valleys, and drank water of the rain of heaven" (ל
before מטר, to denote the external cause; see Ewald, 217, d.); i.e., it
received its watering, the main condition of all fertility, from the
rain, by the way of the rain, and therefore through the providential
care of God.

[Deuteronomy 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 11:12</span></span>

It was a land which Jehovah inquired after, i.e., for which He cared
(דּרשׁ, as in [Pro 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#013.md); [Job
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#004).md); His eyes were always directed
towards it from the beginning of the year to the end; a land, therefore,
which was dependent upon God, and in this dependence upon God peculiarly
adapted to Israel, which was to live entirely to its God, and upon His
grace alone.

[Deuteronomy 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 11:13</span></span>

This peculiarity in the land of Canaan led Moses to close the first part
of his discourse on the law, his exhortation to fear and love the Lord,
with a reference to the blessing that would follow the faithful
fulfilment of the law, and a threat of the curse which would attend
apostasy to idolatry.

[Deu 11:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#013.md)

If Israel would serve its God in love and faithfulness, He would give
the land early and latter rain in its season, and therewith a plentiful
supply of food for man and beast (see [Lev
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003.md) and [Lev
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005.md); and for the further expansion of
this blessing, [Deu 28:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001).md).

[Deu 11:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#016.md)

But if, on the other hand, their heart was foolish to turn away from the
Lord and serve other gods, the wrath of the Lord would burn against
them, and God would shut up the heaven, that no rain should fall and the
earth should yield no produce, and they would speedily perish (cf. [Lev
26:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md), and [Deu
28:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023).md). Let them therefore impress
the words now set before them very deeply upon themselves and their
children ([Deu 11:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018.md), in which
there is in part a verbal repetition of [Deu
6:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006).md). The words, "as the days of the
heaven above the earth," i.e., as long as the heaven continues above the
earth, - in other words, to all eternity (cf. [Psa
89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md); Job. [Deu
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#012).md), - belong to the main sentence,
"that your days may be multiplied," etc. ([Deu
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#021).md). "The promise to give the land
to Israel for ever was not made unconditionally; an unconditional
promise is precluded by the words, 'that your days may be multiplied'"
(Schultz). (For further remarks, see at [Deu
30:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003)..md) For ([Deu
11:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#022).md) if they adhered faithfully
to the Lord, He would drive out before them all the nations that dwelt
in the land, and would give them the land upon which they trod in all
its length and breadth, and so fill the Canaanites with fear and terror
before them, that no one should be able to stand against them. (On [Deu
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#023.md), cf. [Deu
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md); [Deu
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001.md), and [Deu
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028)..md) The words, "every place whereon
the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours," are defined more
precisely, and restricted to the land of Canaan on both sides of the
Jordan by the boundaries which follow: "from the desert (of Arabia on
the south), and Lebanon (on the north), and from the river Euphrates (on
the east) to the hinder sea" (the Mediterranean on the west; see [Num
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006).md). The Euphrates is given as the
eastern boundary, as in [Deu 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md),
according to the promise in [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md). (On [Deu
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#025.md), cf. [Deu
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#024.md); [Deu
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025.md), and [Exo
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027)..md)

[Deu 11:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#026.md)

Concluding summary. "I set before you this day the blessing and the
curse." The blessing, if (אשׁר, ὅτε, as in [Lev
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022).md) ye hearken to the commandments
of your God; the curse, if ye do not give heed to them, but turn aside
from the way pointed out to you, to go after other gods. To this there
are added instructions in [Deu 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#029.md)
and [Deu 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#030.md), that when they took
possession of the land they should give the blessing upon Mount Gerizim
and the curse upon Mount Ebal, i.e., should give utterance to them
there, and as it were transfer them to the land to be apportioned to its
inhabitants according to their attitude towards the Lord their God. (For
further comment, see at [Deu 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#014)..md)
The two mountains mentioned were selected for this act, no doubt because
they were opposite to one another, and stood, each about 2500 feet high,
in the very centre of the land not only from west to east, but also from
north to south. Ebal stands upon the north side, Gerizim upon the south;
between the two is Sichem, the present Nabulus, in a tolerably elevated
valley, fertile, attractive, and watered by many springs, which runs
from the south-east to the north-west from the foot of Gerizim to that
of Ebal, and is about 1600 feet in breadth. The blessing was to be
uttered upon Gerizim, and the curse upon Ebal; though not, as the
earlier commentators supposed, because the peculiarities of these
mountains, viz., the fertility of Gerizim and the barrenness of Ebal,
appeared to accord with this arrangement: for when seen from the valley
between, "the sides of both these mountains are equally naked and
sterile;" and "the only exception in favour of the former is a small
ravine coming down, opposite the west end of the town, which is indeed
full of foundations and trees" (Rob. Pal. iii. 96, 97). The reason for
selecting Gerizim for the blessings was probably, as Schultz supposes,
the fact that it was situated on the south, towards the region of the
light. "Light and blessing are essentially one. From the light-giving
face of God there come blessing and life ([Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011).md)." - In [Deu
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#030.md) the situation of these mountains
is more clearly defined: they were "on the other side of the Jordan,"
i.e., in the land to the west of the Jordan, "behind the way of the
sunset," i.e., on the other side of the road of the west, which runs
through the land on the west of the Jordan, just as another such road
runs through the land on the east (Knobel). The reference is to the main
road which ran from Upper Asia through Canaan to Egypt, as was shown by
the journeys of Abraham and Jacob ([Gen
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md); [Gen
33:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#017).md). Even at the present day the
main road leads from Beisan to Jerusalem round the east side of Ebal
into the valley of Sichem, and then again eastwards from Gerizim through
the Mukra valley on towards the south (cf. Rib. iii. 94; Ritter,
Erdkunde, xvi. pp. 658-9). "In the land of the Canaanite who dwells in
the Arabah." By the Arabah, Knobel understands the plain of Nabulus,
which is not much less than four hours' journey long, and on an average
from a half to three-quarters broad, "the largest of all upon the
elevated tract of land between the western plain and the valley of the
Jordan" (Rob. iii. p. 101). This is decidedly wrong, however, as it is
opposed to the fixed use of the word, and irreconcilable with the
character of this plain, which, Robinson says, "is cultivated throughout
and covered with the rich green of millet intermingled with the yellow
of the ripe corn, which the country people were just reaping" (Pal. iii.
93). The Arabah is the western portion of the Ghor (see at [Deu
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001).md), and is mentioned here as that
portion of the land on the west of the Jordan which lay stretched out
before the eyes of the Israelites who were encamped in the steppes of
Moab. "Over against Gilgal," i.e., not the southern Gilgal between
Jericho and the Jordan, which received its name for the first time in
[Jos 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#020.md) and [Jos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009.md); but probably the Gilgal mentioned
in [Jos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006.md); [Jos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006.md)., and very frequently in the
history of Samuel, Elijah, and Elisha, which is only about twelve and a
half miles from Gerizim in a southern direction, and has been preserved
in the large village of Jiljilia to the south-west of Sinjil, and which
stands in such an elevated position, "close to the western brow of the
high mountain tract," that you "have here a very extensive prospect over
the great lower plain, and also over the sea, whilst the mountains of
Gilead are seen in the east" (Rob. Pal. iii. 81). Judging from this
description of the situation, Mount Gerizim must be visible from this
Gilgal, so that Gerizim and Ebal might very well be described as over
against Gilgal.

(Note: There is much less ground for the opinion of Winer, Knobel, and
Schultz, that Gilgal is the Jiljule mentioned by Robinson (Pal. iii. 47;
and Bibl. Researches, p. 138), which evidently corresponds to the
Galgula placed by Eusebius and Jerome six Roman miles from Antipatris,
and is situated to the south-east of Kefr Saba (Antipatris), on the road
from Egypt to Damascus. For this place is not only farther from Gerizim
and Ebal, viz., about seventeen miles, but from its position in the
lowland by the sea-shore it presents no salient point for determining
the situation of the mountains of Gerizim and Ebal. Still less can we
agree with Knobel, who speaks of the village of Kilkilia, to the
north-east of Kefr Saba, as the name itself has nothing in common with
Gilgal.)

The last definition, "beside the terebinths of Moreh," is intended no
doubt to call to mind the consecration of that locality even from the
times of the patriarchs (Schultz: see at [Gen
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md), and [Gen
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004).md).

[Deu 11:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#031.md)

[Deu 11:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#031.md) contain the reason for
these instructions, founded upon the assurance that the Israelites were
going over the Jordan and would take possession of the promised land,
and should therefore take care to keep the commandments of the Lord (cf.
[Deu 4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#005).md).
