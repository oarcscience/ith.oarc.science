Resignation to God When Foes Crowd in upon One

Concerning this Psalm, which is placed next to the preceding Psalm by
reason of several points of mutual relationship (cf. [Psa
62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008.md) with [Psa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md), [Psa
61:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008.md); [Psa
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009.md) with [Psa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004); Ps 62:13b with Psalms 61:9.md), as
being a product of the time of the persecution by Absalom, and also
concerning על־יוּתוּן, we have spoken already in the introduction to
[Psa 39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md), which forms with it a
twin pair. The particle אך occurs there four times, and in this Psalm
even as many as six times. The strophic structure somewhat resembles
that of [Psa 39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md), in that here we
also have longer strophes which are interspersed by tristichs.

[Psalms 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 62:1</span></span>

The poet, although apparently irrecoverably lost, does not nevertheless
despair, but opposes one thing to the tumultuous crowding in upon him of
his many foes, viz., quiet calm submission - not, however, a fatalistic
resignation, but that which gives up everything to God, whose hand
(vid., [Sa2 12:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#007).md) can be distinctly
recognised and felt in what is now happening to him. אך (yea, only,
nevertheless) is the language of faith, with which, in the face of all
assault, established truths are confessed and confirmed; and with which,
in the midst of all conflict, resolutions, that are made and are to be
firmly kept, are deliberately and solemnly declared and affirmed. There
is no necessity for regarding דּוּמיּה (not דּומיּה), which is always a
substantive (not only in [Psa 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003.md);
[Psa 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#003.md), but also in this instance
and in [Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002).md), and which is
related to דּוּמה, silence, [Psa
94:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017.md); [Psa
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md), just as עליליּה, [Jer
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019.md), is related to עלילה, as an
accus. absol.: in silent submission (Hupfeld). Like תּפּלּה in [Psa
109:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004.md), it is a predicate: his soul is
silent submission, i.e., altogether resigned to God without any purpose
and action of its own. His salvation comes from God, yea, God Himself is
his salvation, so that, while God is his God, he is even already in
possession of salvation, and by virtue of it stands imperturbably firm.
We see clearly from [Psa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024.md), what
the poet means by רבּה. He will not greatly, very much, particularly
totter, i.e., not so that it should come to his falling and remaining
down. רבּה is an adverb like רבּת, [Psa
123:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004.md), and הרבּה, [Ecc
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#019.md).

There is some difficulty about the ἅπαξ λεγομ. תּהותתוּ .לןדו ([Psa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004).md). Abulwald, whom Parchon, Kimchi,
and most others follow, compares the Arabic hatta 'l-rajul, the man
brags; but this Arab. ht (intensive form htht) signifies only in a
general way to speak fluently, smoothly and rapidly one word after
another, which would give too poor an idea here. There is another Arab.
htt (cogn. htk, proscindere) which has a meaning that is even better
suited to this passage, and one which is still retained in the spoken
language of Syria at the present day: hattani is equivalent to "he
compromised me" (= hataka es-sitra ‛annı̂, he has pulled my veil down),
dishonoured me before the world by speaking evil concerning me; whence
in Damascus el-hettât is the appellation for a man who without any
consideration insults a person before others, whether he be present or
absent at the time. But this Arab. htt only occurs in Kal and with an
accusative of the object. The words עד־אנה תהותתו על־אישׁ find their
most satisfactory explanation in the Arab. hwwt in common use in
Damascus at the present day, which is not used in Kal, but only in the
intensive form. The Piel Arab. hwwt ‛lâ flân signifies to rush upon any
one, viz., with a shout and raised fist in order to intimidate him.

(Note: Neshwn and the Kms say: "hawwata and hajjata bi-fulân-in
signifies to call out to any one in order to put him in terror (Arab.
ṣâḥ bh);" "but in Syria," as Wetzstein goes on to say, "the verb does
not occur as med. Jod, nor is hawwata there construed with Arab. b, but
only with ‛lâ. A very ready phrase with the street boys in Damascus is
Arab. l-'yy š' thwwt ‛lı̂, 'why dost thou threaten me?' ")

From this הוּת, of which even the construction with Arab. ‛lâ, together
with the intensive form is characteristic, we here read the Pil. הותת,
which is not badly rendered by the lxx ἐπιτίθεσθε, Vulgate irruitis.

In [Psa 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004.md) it is a question whether
the reading תּרצּחוּ of the school of Tiberias or the Babylonian
תּרצּחוּ is to be preferred. Certainly the latter; for the former (to be
rendered, "may you" or "ye shall be broken in pieces, slain") produces a
thought that is here introduced too early, and one that is inappropriate
to the figures that follow. Standing as it still does under the regimen
of עד־אנה, תרצחו is to be read as a Piel; and, as the following figures
show, is to be taken, after [Psa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011.md), in its primary signification
contundere (root רץ).

(Note: The reading of Ben-Asher תּרצּחוּ is followed by Aben-Ezra,
Kimchi, and others, taking this form (which could not possibly be
anything else) as Pual. The reading of Ben-Naphtali תּרצּחוּ is already
assumed in B. Sanhedrin 119a. Besides these the reading תּרצּחוּ without
Dag.) is also found, which cannot be taken as a resolved Piel, since the
Metheg is wanting, but is to be read terotzchu, and is to be taken (as
also the reading מלשׁני, [Psa 101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005.md),
and ויּחלקם, [Ch1 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#006.md); [Ch1
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003).md) as Poal (vid., on [Psa
94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020.md); [Psa
109:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#010))..md)

The sadness of the poet is reflected in the compressed, obscure, and
peculiar character of the expression. אישׁ and כּלּכם (a single one-ye
all) stand in contrast. כּקיר וגו, sicut parietem = similem parieti (cf.
[Psa 63:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#006).md), forms the object to
תּרצּחוּ. The transmitted reading גּדר הדּחוּיה, although not incorrect
in itself so far as the gender ([Pro
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#031).md) and the article are concerned
(Ges. 111, 2, a), must apparently be altered to גּדרה דחוּיה (Olshausen
and others) in accordance with the parallel member of the verse, since
both גּדרה and גּדר are words that can be used of every kind of
surrounding or enclosure. To them David seems like a bent, overhanging
wall, like a wall of masonry that has received the thrust that must
ultimately cause its fall; and yet they rush in upon him, and all
together they pursue against the one man their work of destruction and
ruin. Hence he asks, with an indignation that has a somewhat sarcastic
tinge about it, how long this never-satiated self-satisfying of their
lust of destruction is meant to last. Their determination (יעץ as in
[Isa 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024).md) is clear. It aims only or
entirely (אך, here tantummodo, prorsus) at thrusting down from his high
position, that is to say from the throne, viz., him, the man at whom
they are always rushing (להדּיח = להדּיחו). No means are too base for
them in the accomplishment of their object, not even the mask of the
hypocrite. The clauses which assume a future form of expression are,
logically at least, subordinate clauses (EW. 341, b). The Old Testament
language allows itself a change of number like בּפיו instead of בּפיהם,
even to the very extreme, in the hurry of emotional utterance. The
singular is distributive in this instance: suo quisque ore, like לו in
[Isa 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020.md), ממּנּו, [Isa
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023.md), cf. [Isa
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022.md), [Zac
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012.md). The pointing יקללוּ follows the
rule of יהללו, [Psa 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027.md), ירננו, [Psa
149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md), and the like (to which the only
exceptions are הנני, חקקי, רננת).

[Psalms 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 62:5</span></span>

The beginning of the second group goes back and seizes upon the
beginning of the first. אך is affirmative both in [Psa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#006.md) and in [Psa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#007.md). The poet again takes up the
emotional affirmations of [Psa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md),
[Psa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003.md), and, firm and defiant in
faith, opposes them to his masked enemies. Here what he says to his soul
is very similar to what he said of his soul in [Psa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md), inasmuch as he makes his own
soul objective and exalts himself above her; and it is just in this that
the secret of personality consists. He here admonishes her to that
silence which in [Psa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md) he has
already acknowledged as her own; because all spiritual existence as
being living remains itself unchanged only by means of a perpetual
"becoming" (mittelst steten Werdens), of continuous, self-conscious
renovation. The "hope" in [Psa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#006.md) is
intended to be understood according to that which forms its substance,
which here is nothing more nor less than salvation, [Psa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md). That for which he who resigns
himself to God hopes, comes from God; it cannot therfore fail him, for
God the Almighty One and plenteous in mercy is surety for it. David
renounces all help in himself, all personal avenging of his own honour -
his salvation and his honour are על־אלהים (vid., on [Psa
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011).md). The rock of his strength, i.e.,
his strong defence, his refuge, is בּאלהים; it is where Elohim is,
Elohim is it in person (בּ as in [Isa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004).md). By עם, [Psa
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009.md), the king addresses those who
have reamined faithful to him, whose feeble faith he has had to chide
and sustain in other instances also in the Psalms belonging to this
period. The address does not suit the whole people, who had become for
the most part drawn into the apostasy. Moreover it would then have been
עמּי (my people). עם frequently signifies the people belonging to the
retinue of a prince ([Jdg 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#018).md), or in
the service of any person of rank ([Kg1
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#021).md), or belonging to any union of
society whatever ([Kg2 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042)..md). David
thus names those who cleave to him; and the fact that he cannot say "my
people" just shows that the people as a body had become alienated from
him. But those who have remained to him of the people are not therefore
to despair; but they are to pour out before God, who will know how to
protect both them and their king, whatever may lie heavily upon their
heart.

[Psalms 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 62:9</span></span>

Just as all men with everything earthly upon which they rely are
perishable, so also the purely earthly form which the new kingship has
assumed carries within itself the germ of ruin; and God will decide as
Judge, between the dethroned and the usurpers, in accordance with the
relationship in which they stand to Him. This is the internal connection
of the third group with the two preceding ones. By means of the strophe
vv. 10-13, our Psalm is brought into the closest reciprocal relationship
with [Psa 39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md). Concerning בּני־אדם
and בּני־אישׁ vid., on [Psa 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#003.md); [Psa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md). The accentuation divides [Psa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010.md) quite correctly. The Athnach
does not mark בּמאזנים לעלות as an independent clause: they are upon the
balance לעלות, for a going up; they must rise, so light are they
(Hengstenberg). Certainly this expression of the periphrastic future is
possible (vid., on [Psa 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md); [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001) :17.md), still we feel the want
here of the subject, which cannot be dispensed within the clause as an
independent one. Since, however, the combining of the words with what
follows is forbidden by the fact that the infinitive with ל in the sense
of the ablat. gerund. always comes after the principal clause, not
before it (Ew. 280, d), we interpret: upon the balances ad ascendendum =
certo ascensuri, and in fact so that this is an attributive that is
co-ordinate with כּזב. Is the clause following now meant to affirm that
men, one and all, belong to nothingness or vanity (מן partitivum), or
that they are less than nothing (מן comparat.)? Umbreit, Stier, and
others explain [Isa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017.md) also in the
latter way; but parallels like [Isa
41:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#024.md) do not favour this rendering,
and such as [Isa 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#011.md) are opposed to
it. So also here the meaning is not that men stand under the category of
that which is worthless or vain, but that they belong to the domain of
the worthless or vain.

The warning in [Psa 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011.md) does not
refer to the Absalomites, but, pointing to these as furnishing a
salutary example, to those who, at the sight of the prosperous condition
and joyous life on that side, might perhaps be seized with envy and
covetousness. Beside בּטח בּ the meaning of הבל בּ is nevertheless not:
to set in vain hope upon anything (for the idea of hoping does not exist
in this verb in itself, [Job 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012.md);
[Jer 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005.md), nor in this construction of
the verb), but: to be befooled, blinded by something vain (Hitzig). Just
as they are not to suffer their heart to be befooled by their own unjust
acquisition, so also are they not, when the property of others increases
(נוּב, root נב, to raise one's self, to mount up; cf. Arabic nabata, to
sprout up, grow; nabara, to raise; intransitive, to increase, and many
other verbal stems), to turn their heart towards it, as though it were
something great and fortunate, that merited special attention and
commanded respect. Two great truths are divinely attested to the poet.
It is not to be rendered: once hath God spoken, now twice ([Job
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#005.md); [Kg2
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#010).md) have I heard this; but after
[Psa 89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md) : One thing hath God
spoken, two things (it is) that I have heard; or in accordance with the
interpunction, which here, as in [Psa
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#008.md) (cf. on [Psa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016).md), is not to be called in
question: these two things have I heard. Two divine utterances actually
do follow. The two great truths are: (1) that God has the power over
everything earthly, that consequently nothing takes place without Him,
and that whatever is opposed to Him must sooner or later succumb; (2)
that of this very God, the sovereign Lord (אדני), is mercy also, the
energy of which is measured by His omnipotence, and which does not
suffer him to succumb upon whom it is bestowed. With כּי the poet
establishes these two revealed maxims which God has impressed upon his
mind, from His righteous government as displayed in the history of men.
He recompenses each one in accordance with his doing, κατὰ τὰ ἔργα
αὐτοῦ, as Paul confesses ([Rom 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006).md) no
less than David, and even (vid., lxx) in the words of David. It shall be
recompensed unto every man according to his conduct, which is the issue
of his relationship to God. He who rises in opposition to the will and
order of God, shall feel God's power (עז) as a power for punishment that
dashes in pieces; and he who, anxious for salvation, resigns his own
will to the will of God, receives from God's mercy or loving-kindness
(חסד), as from an overflowing fulness, the promised reward of
faithfulness: his resignation becomes experience, and his hoping
attainment.
