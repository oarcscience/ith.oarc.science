### [Amos Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001.md)

[Amos 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 2:1</span></span>

Moab. - [Amo 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001.md). "Thus saith Jehovah:
for three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I shall not reverse it,
because it has burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime, [Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002.md). I send fire into Moab, and it
will devour the palaces of Kirioth, and Moab will perish in the tumult,
in the war-cry, in the trumpet-blast. [Amo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#003.md). And I cut off the judge from the
midst thereof, and all its princes do I strangle with it, saith
Jehovah." The burning of the bones of the king of Edom is not burning
while he was still alive, but the burning of the corpse into lime, i.e.,
so completely that the bones turned into powder like lime (D. Kimchi),
to cool his wrath still further upon the dead man (cf. [Kg2
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016).md). This is the only thing blamed,
not his having put him to death. No record has been preserved of this
event in the historical books of the Old Testament; but it was no doubt
connected with the war referred to in 2 Kings 3, which Joram of Israel
and Jehoshaphat of Judah waged against the Moabites in company with the
king of Edom; so that the Jewish tradition found in Jerome, viz., that
after this war the Moabites dug up the bones of the king of Edom from
the grace, and heaped insults upon them by burning them to ashes, is
apparently not without foundation. As Amos in the case of all the other
nations has mentioned only crimes that were committed against the
covenant nation, the one with which the Moabites are charged must have
been in some way associated with either Israel or Judah, that is to say,
it must have been committed upon a king of Edom, who was a vassal of
Judah, and therefore not very long after this war, since the Edomites
shook off their dependence upon Judah in less than ten years from that
time ([Kg2 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020).md). As a punishment for
this, Moab was to be laid waste by the fire of war, and Keriyoth with
its palaces to be burned down. הקּריּות is not an appellative noun (τῶν
πόλεων αὐτῆς, lxx), but a proper name of one of the chief cities of Moab
(cf. [Jer 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024.md), [Jer
48:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#041).md), the ruins of which have been
discovered by Burckhardt (Syr. p. 630) and Seetzen (ii. p. 342, cf. iv.
p. 384) in the decayed town of Kereyat or Krrit. The application of the
term מת to Moab is to be explained on the supposition that the nation is
personified. שׁאון signifies war tumult, and בּתרוּעה is explained as in
[Amo 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014.md) by בּקול שׁופר, blast of the
trumpets, the signal for the assault or for the commencement of the
battle. The judge with all the princes shall be cut off miqqirbâh, i.e.,
out of the land of Moab. The feminine suffix refers to Moab as a land or
kingdom, and not to Keriyoth. From the fact that the shōphēt is
mentioned instead of the king, it has been concluded by some that Moab
had no king at that time, but had only a shōphēt as its ruler; and they
have sought to account for this on the ground that Moab was at that time
subject to the kingdom of the ten tribes (Hitzig and Ewald). But there
is no notice in the history of anything of the kind, and it cannot
possibly be inferred from the fact that Jeroboam restored the ancient
boundaries of the kingdom as far as the Dead Sea ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md). Shōphēt is analogous to tōmēkh
shēbhet in [Amo 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md), and is probably
nothing more than a rhetorical expression applied to the מלך, who is so
called in the threat against Ammon, and simply used for the sake of
variety. The threatening prophecies concerning all the nations and
kingdoms mentioned from [Amo 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md)
onwards were fulfilled by the Chaldeans, who conquered all these
kingdoms, and carried the people themselves into captivity. For fuller
remarks upon this point, see at Jeremiah 48 and [Eze
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md).

[Amos 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 2:4</span></span>

Judah. - [Amo 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004.md). "Thus saith
Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I shall not
reverse it, because they have despised the law of Jehovah, and have not
kept His ordinances, and their lies led them astray, after which their
fathers walked, [Amo 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#005.md). I send fire
into Judah, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem." With the
announcement that the storm of the wrath of God will also burst upon
Judah, Amos prepares the way for passing on to Israel, the principal
object of his prophecies. In the case of Judah, he condemns its contempt
of the law of its God, and also its idolatry. Toorh is the sum and
substance of all the instructions and all the commandments which Jehovah
had given to His people as the rule of life. Chuqqı̄m are the separate
precepts contained in the thōrâh, including not only the ceremonial
commands, but the moral commandments also; for the two clauses are not
only parallel, but synonymous. כּזביהם, their lies, are their idols, as
we may see from the relative clause, since "walking after" (bâlakh
'achărē) is the standing expression for idolatry. Amos calls the idols
lies, not only as res quae fallunt (Ges.), but as fabrications and
nonentities ('ĕlı̄hı̄m and hăbhâlı̄m), having no reality in themselves, and
therefore quite unable to perform what was expected of them. The
"fathers" who walked after these lies were their forefathers generally,
since the nation of Israel practised idolatry even in the desert (cf.
[Amo 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026).md), and was more or less
addicted to it ever afterwards, with the sole exception of the times of
Joshua, Samuel, David, and part of the reign of Solomon, so that even
the most godly kings of Judah were unable to eradicate the worship upon
the high places. The punishment threatened in consequence, namely, that
Jerusalem should be reduced to ashes, was carried out by Nebuchadnezzar.

[Amos 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 2:6</span></span>

After this introduction, the prophet's address turns to Israel of the
ten tribes, and in precisely the same form as in the case of the nations
already mentioned, announces the judgment as irrevocable. At the same
time, he gives a fuller description of the sins of Israel, condemning
first of all the prevailing crimes of injustice and oppression, of
shameless immorality and daring contempt of God ([Amo
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006).md); and secondly, its scornful
contempt of the benefits conferred by the Lord ([Amo
2:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009).md), and threatening inevitable
trouble in consequence ([Amo 2:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013).md).
[Amo 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006.md). "Thus saith Jehovah: For
three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I shall not reverse it,
because they sell the righteous for money, and the poor for a pair of
shoes. [Amo 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007.md). They who pant after
dust of the earth upon the head of the poor, and bend the way of the
meek: and a man and his father go to the same girl, to desecrate my holy
name. [Amo 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008.md). And they stretch
themselves upon pawned clothes by every altar, and they drink the wine
of the punished in the house of their God." The prophet condemns four
kinds of crimes. The first is unjust treatment, or condemnation of the
innocent in their administration of justice. Selling the righteous for
silver, i.e., for money, refers to the judges, who were bribed to punish
a man as guilty of the crime of which he was accused, when he was really
tsaddı̄q, i.e., righteous in a judicial, not in a moral sense, or
innocent of any punishable crime. Bakkeseph, for money, i.e., either to
obtain money, or for the money which they had already received, viz.,
from the accuser, for condemning the innocent. בּעבוּר, on account of,
is not synonymous with ב pretii; for they did not sell the poor man
merely to get a pair of sandals for him, as the worst possible slave was
certainly worth much more than this (cf. [Exo
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032).md); but the poor debtor who could
not pay for a pair of shoes, i.e., for the merest trifle, the judge
would give up to the creditor for a salve, on the strength of the law in
[Lev 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md) (cf. [Kg2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001).md).

As a second crime, Amos reproves in v. 7a their thirst for the
oppression of the quiet in the land. דּלּים, ταπεινοί, and ענוים,
πραεῖς. The address is carried on in participles, in the form of lively
appeal, instead of quiet description, as is frequently the case in Amos
(cf. [Amo 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md); [Amo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003.md)., 13, [Amo
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014).md), and also in other books (cf.
[Isa 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022.md), [Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026.md); [Psa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011).md). In the present instance, the
article before the participle points back to the suffix in מכרם, and the
finite verb is not introduced till the second clause. שׁאף, to gasp, to
pant, to long eagerly for earth-dust upon the head of the poor, i.e., to
long to see the head of the poor covered with earth or dust, or to bring
them into such a state of misery, that they scatter dust upon their head
(cf. [Job 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012.md); [Sa2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#002).md). The explanation given by Hitzig
is too far-fetched and unnatural, viz., that they grudge the man in
distress even the handful of dust that he has strewn upon his head, and
avariciously long for it themselves. To bend the way of the meek, i.e.,
to bring them into a trap, or cast them headlong into destruction by
impediments and stumblingblocks laid in their path. The way is the way
of life, their outward course. The idea that the way refers to the
judgment or legal process is too contracted. The third crime is their
profanation of the name of God by shameless immorality ([Amo
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007).md); and the fourth, desecration of
the sanctuary by drinking carousals ([Amo
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008).md). A man and his father, i.e., both
son and father, go to the girl, i.e., to the prostitute. The meaning is,
to one and the same girl; but 'achath is omitted, to preclude all
possible misunderstanding, as though going to different prostitutes was
allowed. This sin was tantamount to incest, which, according to the law,
was to be punished with death (cf. [Lev
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007.md), [Lev
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#015.md), and [Lev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011)). Temple girls (qedēshōth.md) are
not to be thought of here. The profanation of the name of God by such
conduct as this does not indicate prostitution in the temple itself,
such as was required by the licentious worship of Baal and Asherah
(Ewald, Maurer, etc.), but consisted in a daring contempt of the
commandments of God, as the original passage ([Lev
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#032).md) from which Amos took the words
clearly shows (cf. [Jer 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#016).md). By
lema‛an, in order that (not "so that"), the profanation of the holy name
of God is represented as intentional, to bring out the daring character
of the sin, and to show that it did not arise from weakness or
ignorance, but was practised with studious contempt of the holy God.
Begâdı̄m chăbhulı̄m, pawned clothes, i.e., upper garments, consisting of a
large square piece of cloth, which was wrapt all around, and served the
poor for a counterpane as well. If a poor man was obliged to pawn his
upper garment, it was to be returned to him before night came on ([Exo
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025).md), and a garment so pawned was
not to be slept upon ([Deu 24:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#012).md).
But godless usurers kept such pledges, and used them as cloths upon
which they stretched their limbs at feasts (yattū, hiphil, to stretch
out, sc. the body or its limbs); and this they did by every altar, at
sacrificial meals, without standing in awe of God. It is very evident
that Amos is speaking of sacrificial feasting, from the reference in the
second clause of the verse to the drinking of wine in the house of God.
עמוּשׁים, punished in money, i.e., fined. Wine of the punished is wine
purchased by the produce of the fines. Here again the emphasis rests
upon the fact, that such drinking carousals were held in the house of
God. 'Elōhēhem, not their gods (idols), but their God; for Amos had in
his mind the sacred places at Bethel and Dan, in which the Israelites
worshipped Jehovah as their God under the symbol of an ox (calf). The
expression col-mizbēăch (every altar) is not at variance with this; for
even if col pointed to a plurality of altars, these altars were still
bāmōth, dedicated to Jehovah. If the prophet had also meant to condemn
actual idolatry, i.e., the worship of heathen deities, he would have
expressed this more clearly; to say nothing of the fact, that in the
time of Jeroboam II there was no heathenish idolatry in the kingdom of
the ten tribes, or, at any rate, it was not publicly maintained.

[Amos 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 2:9</span></span>

And if this daring contempt of the commandments of God was highly
reprehensible even in itself, it became perfectly inexcusable if we bear
in mind that Israel was indebted to the Lord its God for its elevation
into an independent nation, and also for its sacred calling. For this
reason, the prophet reminds the people of the manifestations of grace
which it had received from its God ([Amo
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009).md). [Amo
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009.md). "And yet I destroyed the Amorite
before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and who was
strong as the oaks; and I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots
from beneath. [Amo 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#010.md). And yet I
brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the
desert, to take possession of the land of the Amorite." The repeated
ואנכי is used with peculiar emphasis, and serves to bring out the
contrast between the conduct of the Israelites towards the Lord, and the
fidelity of the Lord towards Israel. Of the two manifestations of divine
grace to which Israel owed its existence as an independent nation, Amos
mentions first of all the destruction of the former inhabitants of
Canaan ([Exo 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md)., [Exo
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#011).md); and secondly, what was earlier
in point of time, namely, the deliverance out of Egypt and guidance
through the Arabian desert; not because the former act of God was
greater than the latter, but in order to place first what the Lord had
done for the nation, that he may be able to append to this what He still
continues to do ([Amo 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011).md). The
nations destroyed before Israel are called Amorites, from the most
powerful of the Canaanitish tribes, as in [Gen
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md); [Jos
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015.md), etc. To show, however, that
Israel was not able to destroy this people by its own strength, but that
Jehovah the Almighty God alone could accomplish this, he proceeds to
transfer to the whole nation what the Israelitish spies reported as to
their size, more especially as to the size of particular giants ([Num
13:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032).md), and describes the Amorites
as giants as lofty as trees and as strong as trees, and, continuing the
same figure, depicts their utter destruction or extermination as the
destruction of their fruit and of their roots. For this figure of
speech, in which the posterity of a nation is regarded as its fruit, and
the kernel of the nation out of which it springs as the root, see [Eze
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#009.md); [Hos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md); [Job
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md). These two manifestations of
divine mercy Moses impressed more than once upon the hearts of the
people in his last addresses, to urge them in consequence to hold fast
to the divine commandments and to the love of God (cf. [Deu
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md)., [Deu
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001.md); [Deu
29:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#001).md).

[Amos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 2:11</span></span>

But Jehovah had not only put Israel into possession of Canaan; He had
also continually manifested Himself to it as the founder and promoter of
its spiritual prosperity. [Amo 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011.md).
"And I raised up some of your sons as prophets, and some of your young
men as dedicated ones (Naziraeans). Ah, is it not so, ye sons of Israel?
is the saying of Jehovah. [Amo 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#012.md).
But ye made the dedicated drink wine, and ye commanded the prophets,
saying, Ye shall not prophesy." The institution of prophecy and the law
of the Nazarite were gifts of grace, in which Israel had an advantage
over every other nation, and by which it was distinguished above the
heathen as the nation of God and the medium of salvation. Amos simply
reminds the people of these, and not of earthly blessings, which the
heathen also enjoyed, since the former alone were real pledges of the
covenant of grace made by Jehovah with Israel; and it was in the
contempt and abuse of these gifts of grace that the ingratitude of the
nation was displayed in the most glaring light. The Nazarites are placed
by the side of the prophets, who proclaimed to the nation the counsel
and will of the Lord, because, although as a rule the condition of a
Nazarite was merely the consequence of his own free will and the
fulfilment of a particular vow, it was nevertheless so far a gift of
grace from the Lord, that the resolution to perform such a vow proceeded
from the inward impulse of the Spirit of God, and the performance itself
was rendered possible through the power of this Spirit alone. (For a
general discussion of the law of the Nazarite, see the commentary on
[Num 6:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002.md), and my biblical
Antiquities, 67.) The raising up of Nazarites was not only intended to
set before the eyes of the people the object of their divine calling, or
their appointment to be a holy nation of God, but also to show them how
the Lord bestowed the power to carry out this object. But instead of
suffering themselves to be spurred on by these types to strive earnestly
after sanctification of life, they tempted the Nazarites to break their
vow by drinking wine, from which they were commanded to abstain, as
being irreconcilable with the seriousness of their sanctification (see
my Bibl. Ant. 67); and the prophets they prohibited from prophesying,
because the word of God was burdensome to them (cf. [Amo
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010.md).; [Mic
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006).md).

[Amos 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 2:13</span></span>

This base contempt of their covenant mercies the Lord would visit with a
severe punishment. [Amo 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013.md). "Behold,
I will press you down, as the cart presses that is filled with sheaves.
[Amo 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014.md). And the flight will be lost
to the swift, and the strong one will not fortify his strength, and the
hero will not deliver his soul. [Amo
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#015.md). And the carrier of the bow will
not stand, and the swift-footed will not deliver, and the rider of the
horse will not save his soul. [Amo
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#016.md). And the courageous one among the
heroes will flee away naked in that day, is the saying of Jehovah." The
Lord threatens as a punishment a severe oppression, which no one will be
able to escape. The allusion is to the force of war, under which even
the bravest and most able heroes will succumb. העיק, from עוּק, Aramaean
for צוּק, to press, construed with tachath, in the sense of κατὰ,
downwards, to press down upon a person, i.e., to press him down (Winer,
Ges., Ewald). This meaning is established by עקה in [Psa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#004.md), and by מוּעקה in [Psa
66:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#011.md); so that there is no necessity
to resort to the Arabic, as Hitzig does, or to alterations of the text,
or to follow Baur, who gives the word the meaning, "to feel one's self
pressed under another," for which there is no foundation in the
language, and which does not even yield a suitable sense. The comparison
instituted here to the pressure of a cart filled with sheaves, does not
warrant the conclusion that Jehovah must answer to the cart; the simile
is not to be carried out to this extent. The object to תּעיק is wanting,
but may easily be supplied from the thought, namely, the ground over
which the cart is driven. The להּ attached to המלאה belongs to the
latitude allowed in ordinary speech, and gives to מלאה the reflective
meaning, which is full in itself, has quite filled itself (cf. Ewald,
315, a). In [Amo 2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014.md) the effects
of this pressure are individualized. No one will escape from it. אבד
מנוס, flight is lost to the swift, i.e., the swift will not find time
enough to flee. The allusion to heroes and bearers of the bow shows that
the pressure is caused by war. קל בּרגליו belong together: "He who is
light in his feet." The swift-footed will no more save his life than the
rider upon a horse. נפשׁו .esroh in [Amo
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#015.md) belongs to both clauses. אמּץ
לבּו, the strong in his heart, i.e., the hearty, courageous. ערום,
naked, i.e., so as to leave behind him his garment, by which the enemy
seizes him, like the young man in [Mar
14:52](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#052.md). This threat, which implies that
the kingdom will be destroyed, is carried out still further in the
prophet's following addresses.
