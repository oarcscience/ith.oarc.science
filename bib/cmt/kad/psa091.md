Talismanic Song in Time of War and Pestilence

The primeval song is followed by an anonymous song (inscribed by the lxx
without any warrant τῷ Δαυίδ), the time of whose composition cannot be
determined; and it is only placed in this order because the last verse
accords with the last verse but one of Ps 90. There the revelation of
Jahve's work is prayed for, and here Jahve promises: I will grant him to
see My salvation; the "work of Jahve" is His realized "salvation." The
two Psalms also have other points of contact, e.g., in the מעון referred
to God (vid., Symbolae, p. 60).

In this Psalm, the Invocavit Psalm of the church, which praises the
protecting and rescuing grace which he who believingly takes refuge in
God experiences in all times of danger and distress,

(Note: Hence in J. Shabbath 8, col. 2, and Midrash Shocher tob on [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md) and elsewhere, it is called,
together with [Psa 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001), (פגעים.md) שיר
פגועין, a song of occurrences, i.e., a protective (or talismanic) song
in times of dangers that may befall one, just as Sebald Heyden's
Psalm-song, "He who is in the protection of the Most High and resigns
himself to God," is inscribed "Preservative against the pestilence.")

the relation of [Psa 91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002.md) to [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md) meets us at the very beginning as
a perplexing riddle. If we take [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md) as a clause complete in itself,
then it is tautological. If we take אמר in [Psa
91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002) as a participle (Jerome, dicens.md)
instead of אמר, ending with Pathach because a construct from (cf. [Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009.md); [Psa
136:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#006).md), then the participial subject
would have a participial predicate: "He who sitteth is saying," which is
inelegant and also improbable, since אמר in other instances is always
the 1st pers. fut. If we take אמר as 1st pers. fut. and [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md) as an apposition of the subject
expressed in advance: as such an one who sitteth.... I say, then we
stumble against יתלונן; this transition of the participle to the finite
verb, especially without the copula (וּבצל), is confusing. If, however,
we go on and read further into the Psalm, we find that the same
difficulty as to the change of person recurs several times later on,
just as in the opening. Olshausen, Hupfeld, and Hitzig get rid of this
difficulty by all sorts of conjectures. But a reason for this abrupt
change of the person is that dramatic arrangement recognised even in the
Targum, although awkwardly indicated, which, however, as first of all
clearly discerned by J. D. Michaelis and Maurer. There are, to wit, two
voices that speak (as in [Psa
121:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001).md), and at last the voice of
Jahve comes in as a third. His closing utterance, rich in promise,
forms, perhaps not unaccidentally, a seven-line strophe. Whether the
Psalm came also to be executed in liturgical use thus with several
voices, perhaps by three choirs, we cannot tell; but the poet certainly
laid it out dramatically, as the translation represents it. In spite of
the many echoes of earlier models, it is one of the freshest and most
beautiful Psalms, resembling the second part of Isaiah in its
light-winged, richly coloured, and transparent diction.

[Psalms 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 91:1</span></span>

As the concealing One, God is called עליון, the inaccessibly high One;
and as the shadowing One שׁדּי, the invincibly almighty One. Faith,
however, calls Him by His covenant name (Heilsname) יהוה and, with the
suffix of appropriation, אלהי (my God). In connection with [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001.md) we are reminded of the
expressions of the Book of Job, [Job
39:28](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#028.md), concerning the eagle's building
its nest in its eyrie. According to the accentuation, [Psa
91:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002.md) ought to be rendered with Geier,
"Dicit: in Domino meo (or Domini) latibulum, etc." But the combination
אמר לה is more natural, since the language of address follows in both
halves of the verse.

[Psalms 91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 91:3</span></span>

יקושׁ, as in [Pro 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#005.md); [Jer
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026.md), is the dullest toned from for
יקושׁ or יוקשׁ, [Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md). What is
meant is death, or "he who has the power of death," [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md), cf. [Ti2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md). "The snare of the fowler" is a
figure for the peril of one's life, [Ecc
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012.md). In connection with [Psa
91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md) we have to call to mind [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md) : God protects His own as an
eagle with its large strong wing. אברה is nom. unitatis, a pinion, to
אבר, [Isa 40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031.md); and the Hiph. הסך,
from סכך, with the dative of the object, like the Kal in [Psa
140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008.md), signifies to afford covering,
protection. The ἅπαξ λεγ. סחרה, according to its stem-word, is that
which encompasses anything round about, and here beside צנּה, a weapon
of defence surrounding the body on all sides; therefore not
corresponding to the Syriac sḥārtā', a stronghold (סהר, מסגּרת), but to
Syriac sabrā', a shield. The Targum translates צנּה with תּריסא, θυρεός,
and סחרה with עגילא, which points to the round parma. אמתּו is the truth
of the divine promises. This is an impregnable defence (a) in war-times,
[Psa 91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md), against nightly surprises,
and in the battle by day; (b) in times of pestilence, [Psa
91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md), when the destroying angel, who
passes through and destroys the people ([Exo
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004).md), can do no harm to him who has
taken refuge in God, either in the midnight or the noontide hours. The
future יהלך is a more rhythmical and, in the signification to rage (as
of disease) and to vanish away, a more usual form instead of ילך. The
lxx, Aquila, and Symmachus erroneously associate the demon name שׁד with
ישׁוּד. It is a metaplastic (as if formed from שׁוּד morf de) future for
ישׁד, cf. [Pro 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#006.md), ירוּן, and [Isa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md), ירוּץ, frangetur. [Psa
91:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#007.md) a hypothetical protasis: si
cadant; the preterite would signify cediderint, Ew. 357, b. With רק that
which will solely and exclusively take place is introduced. Burk
correctly renders: nullam cum peste rem habebis, nisi ut videas. Only a
spectator shalt thou be, and that with thine own eyes, being they self
inaccessible and left to survive, conscious that thou thyself art a
living one in contrast with those who are dying. And thou shalt behold,
like Israel on the night of the Passover, the just retribution to which
the evil-doers fall a prey. שׁלּמה, recompense, retribution, is a
hapaxlegomenon, cf. שׁלּמים, [Isa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008.md). Ascribing the glory to God, the
second voice confirms or ratifies these promises.

[Psalms 91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 91:9</span></span>

The first voice continues this ratification, and goes on weaving these
promises still further: thou hast made the Most High thy dwelling-place
(מעון); there shall not touch thee.... The promises rise ever higher and
higher and sound more glorious. The Pual אנּה, prop. to be turned
towards, is equivalent to "to befall one," as in [Pro
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#021.md); Aquila well renders: ου ̓
μεταχθήσεται πρὸς σὲ κακία. לא־יקרב reminds one of [Isa
54:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#014.md), where אל follows; here it is
בּ, as in [Jdg 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#013.md). The angel
guardianship which is apportioned to him who trusts in God appears in
[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md), [Psa
91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md) as a universal fact, not as a
solitary fact and occurring only in extraordinary instances. Haec est
vera miraculorum ratio, observes Brentius on this passage, quod semel
aut iterum manifeste revelent ea quae Deus semper abscondite operatur.
In ישּׂאוּנך the suffix has been combined with the full form of the
future. The lxx correctly renders [Psa
91:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md): μήποτε προσκόψῃς πρὸς λίθον τὸν
πόδα σου, for נגף everywhere else, and therefore surely here too and in
[Pro 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#023.md), has a transitive
signification, not an intransitive (Aquila, Jerome, Symmachus), cf. [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016.md). [Psa
91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md) tells what he who trusts in God
has power to do by virtue of this divine succour through the medium of
angels. The promise calls to mind [Mar
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018.md), ὄφεις ἀροῦσι, they shall take
up serpents, but still more [Luk 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019.md)
: Behold, I give you power to tread ἐπάνω ὄφεων καὶ σκορπίων καὶ ἐπὶ
πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ ἐχθροῦ. They are all kinds of destructive powers
belonging to nature, and particularly to the spirit-world, that are
meant. They are called lions and fierce lions from the side of their
open power, which threatens destruction, and adders and dragons from the
side of their venomous secret malice. In [Psa
91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md) it is promised that the man who
trusts in God shall walk on over these monsters, these malignant foes,
proud in God and unharmed; in [Psa
91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md), that he shall tread them to the
ground (cf. [Rom 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020).md). That which
the divine voice of promise now says at the close of the Psalm is, so
far as the form is concerned, an echo taken from Ps 50. [Psa
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015.md), [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md) of that Psalm sound almost word
for word the same. [Gen 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#004.md), and more
especially [Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md), are to be
compared on [Psa 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015.md). In B. Taanith
16a it is inferred from this passage that God compassionates the
suffering ones whom He is compelled by reason of His holiness to chasten
and prove. The "salvation of Jahve," as in [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md), is the full reality of the
divine purpose (or counsel) of mercy. To live to see the final glory was
the rapturous thought of the Old Testament hope, and in the apostolic
age, of the New Testament hope also.
