### [Psalms Chapter 135](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 135:0</span></span>

Four-Voiced Hallelujah to the God of Israel, the God of Gods

Psalms 135 is here and there (vid., Tsefth Pesachim 117a) taken together
with [Psa 134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001) as one Psalm. The
combining of Ps 115 with [Psa 114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001)
is a misapprehension caused by the inscriptionless character of Ps 115,
whereas Ps 135 and [Psa 134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001)
certainly stand in connection with one another. For the Hallelujah
Psalms 135 is, as the mutual relation between the beginning and close of
[Psa 134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001) shows, a Psalm-song
expanded out of this shorter hymn, that is in part drawn from Ps 115.

It is a Psalm in the mosaic style. Even the Latin poet Lucilius
transfers the figure of mosaic-work to style, when he says: quam lepide
lexeis compostae ut tesserulae omnes... In the case of Psalms 135 it is
not the first time that we have met with this kind of style. We have
already had a glimpse of it in [Psa
97:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001) and [Psa
98:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001). These Psalms were composed
more especially of deutero-Isaianic passages, whereas Psalms 135 takes
its tesserulae out of the Law, Prophets, and Psalms.

[Psalms 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 135:1</span></span>

The beginning is taken from [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001); [Psa
135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002) recalls [Psa
116:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#019) (cf. [Psa
92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014)); and [Psa
135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004) is an echo of [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006). The servants of Jahve to whom the
summons is addressed, are not, as in [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001)., His official servants in
particular, but according to [Psa
135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002), where the courts, in the
plural, are allotted to them as their standing-place, and according to
[Psa 135:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019), those who fear Him as
a body. The threefold Jahve at the beginning is then repeated in Jāh
(הללוּ־יהּ, cf. note 1 to Ps[Psa
104:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035)), Jahve, and Jāh. The subject
of כּי נעים is by no means Jahve (Hupfeld), whom they did not dare to
call נעים in the Old Testament, but either the Name, according to Ps
54:8 (Luther, Hitzig), or, which is favoured by [Psa
147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001) (cf. [Pro
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#018)), the praising of His Name
(Appolinaris: ἐπεὶ τόδε καλὸν ἀείδειν): His Name to praise is a
delightful employ, which is incumbent on Israel as the people of His
choice and of His possession.

[Psalms 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 135:5</span></span>

The praise itself now begins. כּי in [Psa
135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004) set forth the ground of the
pleasant duty, and the כי that begins this strophe confirms that which
warrants the summons out of the riches of the material existing for such
a hymn of praise. Worthy is He to be praised, for Israel knows full well
that He who hath chosen it is the God of gods. The beginning is taken
from [Psa 115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003), and [Psa
135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007) from [Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013) ([Psa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016)). Heaven, earth, and water are
the three kingdoms of created things, as in [Exo
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004). נשׂיא signifies that which is
lifted up, ascended; here, as in Jeremiah, a cloud. The meaning of
בּרקים למּטר עשׂה is not: He makes lightnings into rain, i.e., resolves
them as it were into rain, which is unnatural; but either according to
[Zac 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001) : He produces lightnings in
behalf of rain, in order that the rain may pour down in consequence of
the thunder and lightning, or poetically: He makes lightnings for the
rain, so that the rain is announced (Apollinaris) and accompanied by
them. Instead of מוצא (cf. [Psa 78:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#016);
[Psa 105:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#043)), which does not admit of
the retreating of the tone, the expression is מוצא, the ground-form of
the part. Hiph. for plurals like מחצרים, מחלמים, מעזרים, perhaps not
without being influenced by the ויּוצא in Jeremiah, for it is not מוצא
from מצא that signifies "producing," but מוציא = מפיק. The metaphor of
the treasuries is like [Job 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022).
What is intended is the fulness of divine power, in which lie the
grounds of the origin and the impulses of all things in nature.

[Psalms 135:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 135:8</span></span>

Worthy is He to be praised, for He is the Redeemer out of Egypt. בּתוככי
as in [Psa 116:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#019), cf. [Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027).

[Psalms 135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 135:10</span></span>

Worthy is He to be praised, for He is the Conqueror of the Land of
Promise. in connection with [Psa
135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010) one is reminded of [Deu
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#038); [Deu
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001); [Deu
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001); [Deu
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#023); [Jos
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#009). גּוים רבּים are here not many,
but great peoples (cf. גּדלים in [Psa
136:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#017)), since the parallel word
עצוּמים is by no means intended of a powerful number, but of powerful
might (cf. [Isa 53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012)). As to the rest
also, the poet follows the Book of Deuteronomy: viz., לכל ממלכות as in
[Deu 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#021), and נתן נחלה as in [Deu
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#038) and other passages. It is all
Deuteronomic with the exception of the שׁ, and the ל e in [Psa
135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011) as the nota accus. (as in [Psa
136:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#019)., cf. [Psa
69:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006); [Psa
116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016); [Psa
129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)); the construction of הרג is
just as Aramaizing in [Job 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#002); [Sa2
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#030) (where [Sa2
3:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#030), like [Sa2
3:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#036), are a later explanatory
addition). The הרג alternating with הכּה is, next to the two kings, also
referred to the kingdoms of Canaan, viz., their inhabitants. Og was also
an Amoritish king, [Deu 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008).

[Psalms 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 135:13</span></span>

This God who rules so praiseworthily in the universe and in the history
of Israel is the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever. Just as [Psa
135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013) (cf. [Psa
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013)) is taken from [Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015), so [Psa
135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014) is taken from [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036), cf. [Psa
90:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#013), and vid., on [Heb
10:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030).

[Psalms 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 135:15</span></span>

For the good of His proved church He ever proves Himself to be the
Living God, whereas idols and idol-worshippers are vain - throughout
following [Psa 115:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004), but with some
abridgments. Here only the אף used as a particle recalls what is said
there of the organ of smell (אף) of the idols that smells not, just as
the רוּח which is here (as in [Jer
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014)) denied to the idols recalls the
הריח denied to them there. It is to be rendered: also there is not a
being of breath, i.e., there is no breath at all, not a trace thereof,
in their mouth. It is different in [Sa1
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009), where אין ישׁ (not אין) is meant
to be equivalent to the Aramaic אין אית, num (an) est; אין is
North-Palestinian, and equivalent to the interrogatory אם (after which
the Targum renders אלּוּ אית).

[Psalms 135:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 135:19</span></span>

A call to the praise of Jahve, who is exalted above the gods of the
nations, addressed to Israel as a whole, rounds off the Psalm by
recurring to its beginning. The threefold call in [Psa
115:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009); [Psa
118:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#002), is rendered fourfold here by
the introduction of the house of the Levites, and the wishing of a
blessing in [Psa 134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003) is turned into
an ascription of praise. Zion, whence Jahve's self-attestation, so rich
in power and loving-kindness, is spread abroad, is also to be the place
whence His glorious attestation by the mouth of men is spread abroad.
History has realized this.
