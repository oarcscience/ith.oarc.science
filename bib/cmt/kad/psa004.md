### [Psalms Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 4:0</span></span>

(In the Hebrew, v.1 is the designation 'To the leader:...'; from then on
v.1-8 in English translation corresponds to v.2-9 in the Hebrew)

Evening Hymn of One Who Is Unmoved before Backbiters and Men of Little
Faith

The Davidic morning hymn is now followed by a Davidic evening hymn. It
is evident that they belong together from the mutual relation of [Psa
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007.md) with [Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md), and [Psa
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006.md) with Ps 4:9. They are the only two
Psalms in which the direct words of others are taken up into a prayer
with the formula "many say," רבים אמרים. The history and chronological
position of the one is explained from the inscription of the other. From
the quousque [Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md), and the words
of the feeble-faiths [Psa 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007.md), it
follows that [Psa 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md) is the later
of the two.

It is at the head of this Psalm that we are first met by למנצּח (or
למנצּח with Gaja, [Hab 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019).md), which
still calls for investigation. It is found fifty five times in the
Psalter, not 54 as is usually reckoned: viz., 19 times in book 1, 25
times in book 2, 8 times in book 3, 3 times in book 4. Only two of the
Psalms, at the head of which it is found, are anonymous: viz., Ps 66,
[Psa 67:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md). All the others bear the
names of David and of the psalmists celebrated from David's time, viz.,
39 of David, 9 of the Korahites, 5 of Asaph. No fewer than 30 of these
Psalms are Elohimic. למנצח is always the first word of the inscription;
only in Ps 88, which is easily liable to be overlooked in reckoning, is
it otherwise, because there two different inscriptions are put together.

The meaning of the verb נצּח is evident from the Chronicles and the Book
of Ezra, which belongs to them. The predilection of the chronicler for
the history of religious worship and antiquarian lore is also of use in
reference to this word. He uses it in the history of the time of David,
of Solomon, of Josiah, of Zerubbabel and Joshua, and always in
connection with the accounts of the Temple-service and the building of
single parts of the Temple. To discharge the official duties of the
Temple-service is called נצּח על־מלאכת בּית־ה [Ch1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md) (comp. [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001).md), and the expression is used in
[Ezr 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md). of the oversight of the work
and workmen for the building of the Temple. The same 3300 (3600)
overseers, who are called הרדים בּעם העשׂים בּמּלאכה in [Kg1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005.md) are described by the chronicler
([Ch2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001).md) as מנצּחים עליהם. In
connection with the repair of the Temple under Josiah we read that
Levites were appointed לנצּח ([Ch2
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012).md), namely לכל עשׂה מלאכה ([Ch2
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#013).md), instead of which we find it
said in [Ch2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017.md) להעביד, to keep the
people at their work. The primary notion of נצח is that of shining, and
in fact of the purest and most dazzling brightness; this then passes
over to the notion of shining over to outshining, and in fact both of
uninterrupted continuance and of excellence and superiority (vid.,
Ithpa. [Dan 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#004.md), and cf. [Ch1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md) with [Psa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013.md); [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md) with [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008).md). Thus, therefore, מנצּח is one
who shows eminent ability in any department, and then it gains the
general signification of master, director, chief overseer. At the head
of the Psalms it is commonly understood of the direct of the
Temple-music. מנצּח est dux cantus - Luther says in one place - quem nos
dicimus den Kappellenmeister the band-master, qui orditur et gubernat
cantum, ἔξαρχος (Opp. lat. xvii. 134 ed. Erl.). But 1st, even the Psalms
of Asaph have this למנצח at the beginning, and he was himself a director
of the Temple-music, and in fact the chief-director (חראשׁ) [Ch1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005.md), or at any rate he was one of the
three (Heman, Asaph, Ethan), to whom the 24 classes of the 4000 Levite
singers under the Davidico-Salomonic sanctuary were subordinate; 2ndly,
the passage of the chronicler ([Ch1
15:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017).md) which is most prominent in
reference to this question, does not accord with this explanation.
According to this passage the three directors of the Temple-music
managed the cymbals להשׁמיע, to sound aloud; eight other musicians of
high rank the nablas and six others the citherns לנצּח. This expression
cannot mean "to direct," for the direction belonged to the three, and
the cymbals were also better adapted to it than the citherns. It means
"to take the lead in the playing": the cymbals directed and the
citherns, better adapted to take the lead in the playing, were related
to them, somewhat as the violins to the clarinets now-a-days. Hence
מנצּח is not the director of the Temple-music but in general the master
of song, and למנצח addresses the Psalm to him whose duty it is to
arrange it and to train the Levite choristers; it therefore defines the
Psalm as belonging to the songs of the Temple worship that require
musical accompaniment. The translation of the Targum (Luther) also
corresponds to this general sense of the expression: לשׁבּחא "to be sung
liturgically," and the lxx: εἰς τὸ τέλος, if this signifies "to the
execution" and does not on the contrary ascribe an eschatological
meaning to the Psalm.

(Note: Thus e.g., Eusebius: εἰς τὸ τέλος ὡς ἂν μακροῖς ὕστερον χρόνοις
ἐπὶ συντελείᾳ τοῦ αἰῶνος μελλόντων πληροῦαθαι, and Theodoret: σημαίνει
τὸ εἰς τὸ τέλος ὅτι μακροῖς ὕστερον χρόνοις πληρωθήσεται τὰ
προφητευόμενα, with which accords Pesachim 117a ניצוח ונגון לעתיד לבא,
i.e., Psalms with למנצח and בנגינות refer to the last days. Gregory of
Nyssa combines the different translations by rendering: εἰς τέλος ὅπερ
ἐστὶν ἡ νἰκη. Ewald's view, that τέλος in this formula means
consecration, celebration, worship, is improbable; in this signification
it is not a Septuagint word.)

The בּנגינות which is added is not governed by it. This can be seen at
once from [Hab 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019.md) : to the chief
singer, with an accompaniment of my stringed instruments (vid., my
Commentary), which Hitzig renders: to the chief singer of my musical
pieces; but נצּח בּ is not a phrase that can be supported, and נגינה
does not mean a piece of music. The Piel, נגּן, complete with בּיר,
signifies to touch the strings (cogn. נגע), to play a stringed
instrument. Whence comes נגיות ([Psa
77:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#007.md); [Isa
38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020).md) which is almost always used as
a pluralet.: the play of the stringed instruments, and the superscribed
בּנגינות [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md); [Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md); [Psa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001.md); [Psa
67:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md); [Psa
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md) : with an accompaniment of the
stringed instruments; and b is used as in [Psa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md), [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md), [Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md). The hymn is to be sung in
company with, probably with the sole accompaniment of, the stringed
instruments. The fact of the inscribed words למנצח בנגינות preceding
מזמור לדוד probably arises from the fact of their being written
originally at the top over the chief title which gave the generic name
of the hymn and the author.

[Psalms 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 4:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 4:2) Jahve is אלהי צדק, the possessor of righteousness, the
author of righteousness, and the vindicator of misjudged and persecuted
righteousness. This God of righteousness David believingly calls his God
(cf. [Psa 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005.md); [Psa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011).md); for the righteousness he
possesses, he possesses in Him, and the righteousness he looks for, he
looks for in Him. That this is not in vain, his previous experience
assures him: Thou hast made a breadth (space) for me when in a strait.
In connection with this confirmatory relation of בּצּר הרהבתּ לּי it is
more probable that we have before us an attributive clause (Hitz.), than
that we have an independent one, and at any rate it is a retrospective
clause. הרחבת is not precative (Bttch.), for the perf. of certainty with
a precative colouring is confined to such exclamatory utterances as [Job
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016) (which see.md). He bases his prayer
on two things, viz., on his fellowship with God, the righteous God, and
on His justifying grace which he has already experienced. He has been
many times in a strait already, and God has made a broad place for him.
The idea of the expansion of the breathing (of the stream of air) and of
space is attached to the ח, Arab. ḥ, of רחב, root רח (Deutsch. Morgenl.
Zeitschr. xii. 657). What is meant is the expansion of the straitened
heart, [Psa 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017.md). [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md), and the widening of a straitened
position, [Psa 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md); [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md). On the Dag. in לּי vid., on
[Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 4:2</span></span>

(Heb.: 4:3-4) Righteous in his relation to God he turns rebukingly
towards those who contemn his whose honour is God's honour, viz., to the
partisans of Absolom. In contrast with בּני אדם, men who are lost in the
multitude, בּני אישׁ denotes such as stand prominently forward out of
the multitude; passages like [Psa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#003.md); [Psa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010.md); [Pro
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#004.md); [Isa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md); [Isa
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015.md), show this distinction. In this
and the preceding Psalm David makes as little mention of his degenerate
son as he does of the deluded king in the Psalms belonging to the period
of his persecution by Saul. The address is directed to the aristocratic
party, whose tool Absolom has become. To these he days: till when (עד־מה
beside the non-guttural which follows with Segol, without any manifest
reason, as in [Psa 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013.md); [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005.md); [Jer
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010).md), i.e., how long shall my honour
become a mockery, namely to you and by you, just as we can also say in
Latin quousque tandem dignitas mea ludibrio? The two following members
are circumstantial clauses subordinate to the principal clause with
עד־מה (similar to [Isa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005.md); Ew. 341,
b). The energetic fut. with Nun parag. does not usually stand at the
head of independent clauses; it is therefore to be rendered: since ye
love ריק, that which is empty - the proper name for their high rank is
hollow appearance - how long will ye pursue after כּזב, falsehood?-they
seek to find out every possible lying pretext, in order to trail the
honour of the legitimate king in the dust. The assertion that the
personal honour of David, not his kingly dignity, is meant by כּבודי,
separates what is inseparable. They are eager to injure his official at
the same time as his personal reputation. Therefore David appeals in
opposition to them ([Psa 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004).md) not only
to the divine choice, but also to his personal relationship to God, on
which that choice is based. The ו of וּדעוּ is, as in [Kg2
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#041.md), the ו of sequence: so know then.
The Hiph. חפלה (from פּלה = פּלא, cogn. פּלל, prop. to divide) to make a
separation, make a distinction [Exo
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#004.md); [Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md), then to distinguish in an
extraordinary and remarkable way [Exo
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018.md), and to show [Psa
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md), cf. [Psa
31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022.md), so that consequently what is
meant is not the mere selection (בּחר), but the remarkable selection to
a remarkable position of honour (lxx, Vulg. mirificavit, Windberg
translation of the Psalms gewunderlichet). לו belongs to the verb, as in
[Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004.md), and the principal accent
lies on חסיד: he whom Jahve Himself, not men, has thus remarkably
distinguished is a חסיד, a pious man, i.e., either, like the Syriac
חסידא = רהימא: God's favourite, or, according to the biblical usage of
the language (cf. [Psa 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002.md) with [Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001).md), in an active signification like
פּליט, פּריץ, and the like: a lover of God, from חסד (root חס Arab. ḥs,
stringere, whence ḥassa to curry, maḥassa a curry-comb) prop. to feel
one's self drawn, i.e., strongly affected (comp. ḥiss is mental
impression), in Hebrew, of a strong ardent affection. As a חסיד he does
not call upon God in vain, but finds a ready hearing. Their undertaking
consequently runs counter to the miraculously evidenced will of God and
must fail by reason of the loving relationship in which the dethroned
and debased one stands to God.

[Psalms 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 4:4</span></span>

(Heb.: 4:5-6) The address is continued: they are to repent and cleave to
Jahve instead of allowing themselves to be carried away by arrogance and
discontent. The lxx has rendered it correctly: ὀργίζεσθε καὶ μὴ
ἁμαρτάνετε (cf. [Eph 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026).md): if ye will
be angry beware of sinning, viz., backbiting and rebellion (cf. the
similar paratactic combinations [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md); [Jos
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#018.md); [Isa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md). In connection with the
rendering contremiscite we feel to miss any expression of that before
which they are to tremble (viz., the sure punishment which God decrees).
He warns his adversaries against blind passion, and counsels them to
quiet converse with their own hearts, and solitary meditation, in order
that they may not imperil their own salvation. To commune with one's own
heart, without the addition of the object, is equivalent to to think
alone by one's self, and the bed or resting-place, without requiring to
be understood literally, points to a condition of mind that is
favourable to quiet contemplation. The heart is the seat of the
conscience, and the Spirit of God (as Hamann, Werke i. 98, observes on
this subject) disguises itself as our own voice that we may see His
exhortation, His counsel, and His wisdom well up out of our own stony
heart. The second imper. continues the first: and cease, prop. be still
(דּמם from the sound of the closed mouth checking the discourse), i.e.,
come to your right mind by self-examination, cease your tumult-a warning
coming with the semblance of command by reason of the consciousness of
innocence on his part; and this impression has to be rendered here by
the striking in of the music. The dehortation passes over into
exhortation in [Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md). Of course the
sacrifices were continued in the sanctuary while David, with his
faithful followers, was a fugitive from Jerusalem. Referring to this,
David cries out to the Absolomites: offer זבחי־צדק. Here at least these
are not offerings consisting of actions which are in accordance with the
will of God, instead of slaughtered animals, but sacrifices offered with
a right mind, conformed to the will of God, instead of the hypocritical
mind with which they consecrate their evil doings and think to flatter
God. In Ps 51:21, [Deu 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019.md) also,
"the sacrifices of righteousness" are real sacrifices, not merely
symbols of moral acts. Not less full of meaning is the exhortation
וּבטחוּ אל־ה. The verb בּטח is construed with אל as in [Psa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#007.md); [Psa
56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md); [Psa
86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002.md), combining with the notion of
trusting that of drawing near to, hanging on, attaching one's self to
any one. The Arabic word bṭḥ, expandere, has preserved the primary
notion of the word, a notion which, as in the synon. Arab. bsṭ, when
referred to the effect which is produced on the heart, countenance and
whole nature of the man by a joyous cheerful state of mind, passes over
to the notion of this state of mind itself, so that בּטח (like the Arab.
inbasaṭa to be cheerful, fearless, bold, lit., expanded \[cf. רהב [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005)\] = unstraitened.md) consequently
signifies to be courageous, confident. They are to renounce the
self-trust which blinds them in their opposition to the king who is
deprived of all human assistance. If they will trustingly submit
themselves to God, then at the same time the murmuring and rancorous
discontent, from which the rebellion has sprung, will be stilled. Thus
far the address to the rebellious magnates goes.

[Psalms 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 4:6</span></span>

(Heb.: 4:7-8) Looking into his own small camp David is conscious of a
disheartened feeling which is gaining power over him. The words: who
will make us see, i.e., (as in [Psa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013).md) experience any good? can be
taken as expressive of a wish according to [Sa2
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#015.md); [Isa
42:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#023.md); but the situation gives it the
character of a despondent question arising from a disheartened view of
the future. The gloom has now, lasted so long with David's companions in
tribulation that their faith is turned to fear, their hope to despair.
David therefore prays as he looks upon them: Oh lift upon us
(נסה־עלינוּ)

(Note: The Metheg which stands in the second syllable before the tone
stands by the Sheb, in the metrical books, if this syllable is the first
in a word marked with a greater distinctive without any conjunctive
preceding it, and beginning with Sheb; it is, therefore, not נסה־עלינוּ
but נסה־עלינוּ, cf. [Psa 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002.md) בּבוא־,
[Psa 69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028.md) תּנה־, [Psa
81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003.md) שׂאו־, [Psa
116:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#017.md) לך־, [Psa
119:175](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#175.md) תּחי־. The reason and object
are the same as stated in note p. \*84 supra.)

the light of Thy countenance. The form of the petition reminds one of
the priestly benediction in Num 6. There it is: פּניו יאר ה in the
second portion, in the third פּניו ישּׂא ה, here these two wishes are
blended into one prayer; and moreover in נסה there is an allusion to
neec a banner, for the imper. of נשׂא, the regular form of which is שׂא,
will also admit of the form נשׂא ([Psa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012).md), but the mode of writing נסה
(without example elsewhere, for נסּה [Job
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#002) signifies "to be attempted".md) is
only explained by the mingling of the verbs נשׂא and נסס, Arab. nṣṣ,
extollere ([Psa 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006).md); נסּי ה (cf.
[Psa 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006).md) is, moreover, a primeval
word of the Tra ([Exo 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015).md). If we
may suppose that this mingling is not merely a mingling of forms in
writing, but also a mingling of the ideas in those forms, then we have
three thoughts in this prayer which are brought before the eye and ear
in the briefest possible expression: may Jahve cause His face to shine
upon them; may He lift upon them the light of His countenance so that
they may have it above them like the sun in the sky, and may that light
be a banner promising them the victory, around which they shall rally.

David, however, despite the hopelessness of the present, is even now at
peace in His God. The joy which Jahve has put into his heart in the
midst of outward trial and adversity is מעת דּגנם ותירושׁם רבּוּ. The
expression is as concise as possible: (1) gaudium prae equivalent to
gaudium magnum prae -majus quam; then (2) מעת after the analogy of the
comparatio decurtata (e.g., [Psa 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md)
my feet are like hinds, i.e., like the feet of hinds) is equivalent to
משּׂמחת עת; (3) אשׁר is omitted after עת according to Ges. 123, 3, for
עת is the construct state, and what follows is the second member of the
genitival relation, dependent upon it (cf. [Psa
90:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#015.md); [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001).md); the plurality of things: corn
and new wine, inasmuch as it is the stores of both that are specially
meant, is exceptionally joined with the plur. instead of the sing., and
the chief word raabbu stands at the end by way of emphasis. The suff.
does not refer to the people of the land in general (as in [Psa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010).md), but, in accordance with the
contrast, to the Absolomites, to those of the nation who have fallen
away from David. When David came to Mahanaim, while the rebels were
encamped in Gilead, the country round about him was hostile, so that he
had to receive provisions by stealth, [Sa2
17:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#026.md). Perhaps it was at the time
of the feast of tabernacles. The harvest and the vintage were over. A
rich harvest of corn and new wine was garnered. The followers of Absolom
had, in these rich stores which were at their disposal, a powerful
reserve upon which to fall back. David and his host were like a band of
beggars or marauders. But the king brought down from the sceptre of the
beggar's staff is nevertheless happier than they, the rebels against
him. What he possesses in his heart is a richer treasure than all that
they have in their barns and cellars.

[Psalms 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 4:8</span></span>

(Heb.: 4:9) Thus then he lies down to sleep, cheerfully and peacefully.
The hymn closes as it began with a three line verse. יחדּוּ (lit., in
its unions = collectively, Olshausen, 135, c, like כּלּו altogether,
בּעתּו at the right time) is by no means unemphatic; nor is it so in
[Psa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010.md) where it means "all
together, without exception." With synonymous verbs it denotes the
combination of that which they imply, as [Isa
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md). It is similar in [Psa
141:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#010.md) where it expresses the
coincidence of the fall of his enemies and the escape of the persecuted
one. So here: he wishes to go to sleep and also at once he falls asleep
(ואישׁן in a likewise cohortative sense = ואישׁנה). His God makes him to
dwell in seclusion free of care. לברד is a first definition of
condition, and לבטח a second. The former is not, after [Deu
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#012.md), equivalent to לבדּך, an
addition which would be without any implied antithesis and consequently
meaningless. One must therefore, as is indeed required by the situation,
understand לבדד according to [Num
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md); [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md); [Jer
49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md). He needs no guards for he is
guarded round about by Jahve and kept in safety. The seclusion, בּדד, in
which he is, is security, בּטח, because Jahve is near him. Under what a
many phases and how sweetly the nature of faith is expressed in this and
the foregoing Psalm: his righteousness, exaltation, joy, peace,
contentment in God! And how delicately conceived is the rhythm! In the
last line the evening hymn itself sinks to rest. The iambics with which
it closes are like the last strains of a lullaby which die away softly
and as though falling asleep themselves. Dante is right when he says in
his Convito, that the sweetness of the music had harmony of the Hebrew
Psalter is lost in the Greek and Latin translations.
