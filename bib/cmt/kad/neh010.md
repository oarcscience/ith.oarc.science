### [Nehemiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 10:1</span></span>

(10:2)

A covenant made (vv. 1-32), and an engagement entered into, to furnish
what was needed for the maintenance of the temple, its services, and
ministers ([Neh 10:33-39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#033).md). - Vv. 1-28.
For the purpose of giving a lasting influence to this day of prayer and
fasting, the assembled people, after the confession of sin (given in Neh
9), entered into a written agreement, by which they bound themselves by
an oath to separate from the heathen, and to keep the commandments and
ordinances of God, - a document being prepared for this purpose, and
sealed by the heads of their different houses.

And because of all this we make and write a sure covenant; and our
princes, Levites, and priests sign the sealed (document). בּכל־זאת does
not mean post omne hoc, after all that we have done this day (Schmid,
Bertheau, and others); still less, in omni hoc malo, quod nobis
obtigerat (Rashi, Aben Ezra), but upon all this, i.e., upon the
foundation of the preceding act of prayer and penitence, we made אמנה,
i.e., a settlement, a sure agreement (the word recurs [Neh
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#023).md); hence כּרת is used as with
בּרית, [Neh 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#008.md). אמנה may again be
taken as the object of כּתבים, we write it; החתוּם ועל be understood as
"our princes sealed." החתוּם is the sealed document; comp. [Jer
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011.md), [Jer
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014.md). החתוּם על means literally, Upon
the sealed document were our princes, etc.; that is, our princes sealed
or signed it. Signing was effected by making an impression with a seal
bearing a name; hence originated the idiom החתוּם על אשׁר, "he who was
upon the sealed document," meaning he who had signed the document by
sealing it. By this derived signification is the plural חחתוּמים על
([Neh 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002).md), "they who were upon the
document," explained: they who had signed or sealed the document.

[Nehemiah 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 10:2</span></span>

(10:3-10)

At the head of the signatures stood Nehemiah the Tirshatha, as governor
of the country, and Zidkijah, a high official, of whom nothing further
is known, perhaps (after the analogy of [Ezr
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#009.md), [Ezr
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#017).md) secretary to the governor. Then
follow (in vv. 3-9) twenty-one names, with the addition: these, the
priests. Of these twenty-one names, fifteen occur in [Neh
12:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#002.md) as chiefs of the priests who
came up with Joshua and Zerubbabel from Babylon, and in [Neh
12:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#011.md) as heads of priestly houses.
Hence it is obvious that all the twenty-one names are those of heads of
priestly classes, who signed the agreement in the names of the houses
and families of their respective classes. Seraiah is probably the prince
of the house of God dwelling at Jerusalem, mentioned [Neh
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#011.md), who signed in place of the high
priest. For further remarks on the orders of priests and their heads,
see [Neh 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001.md).

[Nehemiah 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 10:10</span></span>

(10:11-15)

The Levites who sealed were: Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the
sons of Henadad, Kadmiel, and their brethren, fourteen names. Sons of
Jeshua and Kadmiel returned, together with seventy-four other Levites,
with Zerubbabel and Jeshua; [Ezr 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#004.md);
[Neh 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#042.md). Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel,
and Sherebiah are also named in [Neh
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#008.md) as heads of orders of Levites. Of
the rest nothing further is known, but we may regard them as heads of
Levitical houses.

[Nehemiah 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 10:15</span></span>

(10:16-29)

The heads of the people. Forty-four names, thirteen of which are found
in the list (Ezra 2) of the kindreds who returned with Zerubbabel; see
Ezra 2. The rest are names either of the heads of the different houses
into which these kindreds were divided, or of the elders of the smaller
towns of Benjamin and Judah. The fact that, while only thirty-three
kindreds and placed are enumerated in Ezra 2, forty-four occur here, -
although names of kindreds mentioned in Ezra 2, e.g., Shephatiah, Arah,
Zaccai, etc., are wanting here, - is to be explained partly by the
circumstance that these kindreds included several houses whose different
heads all subscribed, and partly by fresh accessions during the course
of years to the number of houses.

[Nehemiah 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">neh 10:29</span></span>

(10:30-33)

All the members of the community acceded to the agreement thus signed by
the princes of the people, and the heads of the priests and Levites, and
bound themselves by an oath to walk in the law of the Lord, and to
separate themselves from the heathen.

[Neh 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029.md)

And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the door-keepers,
the singers, the Nethinim, and all that had separated themselves from
the people of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons,
and their daughters, all who had knowledge and understanding, held with
their brethren, their nobles, and entered into an oath and curse, etc.
מצזיקים is the predicate of the subjects in [Neh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029.md) : they were holding with their
brethren, i.e., uniting with them in this matter. "The rest of the
people, the priests," etc., are the members of the community, exclusive
of the princes and heads of the priestly and Levitical orders. The
Nethinim, to whom belonged the servants of Solomon (see rem. on [Ezr
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043)..md), were probably also represented
in the assembly by the heads of the Levites. To these are added all who
had separated themselves, etc., i.e., the descendants of those
Israelites who had been left in the land, and who now joined the new
community; see rem. on [Ezr 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#021.md). The
connection of נבדּל with אל־תּורת is significant: separated from the
heathen to the law of God, i.e., to live according thereto; comp. [Ezr
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#021.md). Not, however, the men only, but
also women and children of riper years, acceded to the covenant.
כּל־יודע מבין, every one knowing, understanding (מבין and יודע being
connected as an asyndeton, to strengthen the meaning), refers to sons
and daughters of an age sufficient to enable them to understand the
matter. אדּרריהם, their nobles, is connected in the form of an
apposition with אחיהם, instead of the adjective האדּירים. The princes
and the heads of the community and priesthood are intended. באלה בּוא,
to enter into an oath, comp. [Eze
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013.md). אלה is an oath of
self-imprecation, grievous punishments being imprecated in case of
transgression; שׁבוּעה, a promissory oath to live conformably with the
law. We hence perceive the tenor of the agreement entered into and
sealed by the princes. Non subscripsit quidem populus, remarks Clericus,
sed ratum habuit, quid-quid nomine totius populi a proceribus factum
erat, juravitque id a se observatum iri. Besides the general obligation
to observe all the commandments, judgments, and statutes of God, two
points, then frequently transgressed, are specially mentioned in [Neh
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#031.md) and [Neh
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#023.md). In [Neh
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#031.md) : that we would not give our
daughters to the people of the lands, etc.; see rem. on [Ezr
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#002.md). In [Neh
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#032.md) : that if the people of the land
brought wares or any victuals on the Sabbath-day to sell, we would not
buy if of them on the Sabbath, or on a holy day; and would let the
seventh year lie, and the loan of every hand. The words וגו הארץ עמּי
are prefixed absolutely, and are afterwards subordinated to the
predicate of the sentence by מהם. מקּחות, wares for sale, from לקח, to
take, in the sense of to buy, occurs only here. מהם נקּח, to take from
them, i.e., to buy. קדשׁ יום beside שׁבּת means the other holy days, the
annual festivals, on which, according to the law, Num 28 and 29, no work
was to be done. To the sanctification of the Sabbath pertained the
celebration of the sabbatical year, which is therefore named immediately
afterwards. The words השׁ את־השּׁנה נטשׁ, to let the seventh year lie,
i.e., in the seventh year to let the land lie untilled and unsown, is an
abbreviation taken from the language of the law, [Exo
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#010.md). כל־יד משּׁא also depends upon
נטּשׁ. This expression (משּׁא, not משּׂא, being the reading of the best
editions) is to be explained from [Deu
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002.md), and means the loan, that which
the hand has lent to another; see rem. on [Deu
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002.md).

[Nehemiah 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">neh 10:33</span></span>

(10:34-40)

Agreement to provide for the expenses of the temple and its ministers. -
If the community seriously intended to walk by the rule of God's law,
they must take care that the temple service, as the public worship of
the community, should be provided for according to the law and a firm
footing and due solemnity thus given to religion. For this purpose, it
was indispensable to guarantee the contributions prescribed for the
necessary expenses of the temple worship, and the support of its
ministers. Hence this entering into a solemn agreement to observe the
law was regarded as a suitable occasion for regulating the services
prescribed by the law with respect to the temple and its ministers, and
mutually binding themselves to their observance.

[Neh 10:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#033.md)

We ordained for ourselves (עלינוּ, upon us, inasmuch as such things are
spoken of as are taken upon one). עלינוּ לתת, to lay upon ourselves the
third part of a shekel yearly for the service of the house of our God.
It is not said who were to be bound to furnish this contribution, but it
is assumed that it was a well-known custom. This appointed payment is
evidently only a revival of the Mosaic precept, [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md), that every man of twenty years
of age and upwards should give half a shekel as a תּרוּמה to the Lord, -
a tribute which was still paid in Christ's days, [Mat
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024.md). In consideration, however, of
the poverty of the greater portion of the community, it was now lowered
to a third of a shekel. The view of Aben Ezra, that a third of a shekel
was to be paid in addition to the half shekel levied in conformity with
the law, is unsupported by the text. העבודה, the service of the house of
God, is not the building and repairs of the temple, but the regular
worship. For, according to [Neh 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#034.md),
the tax was to be applied to defraying the expenses of worship, to
supplying the shew-bread, the continual meat and burnt offerings ([Num
28:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003).md), the sacrifices for the
Sabbaths, new moons ([Num 28:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009).md),
and festivals ([Num 28:16-29](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#016), 38.md), -
for the קדשׁים, holy gifts, by which, from their position between the
burnt-offering and the sin-offering, we may understand the
thank-offerings, which were offered in the name of the congregation, as
e.g., the two lambs at Pentecost, [Lev
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#019.md), and the offerings brought at
feasts of dedication, comp. [Exo 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md);
[Ezr 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#017.md), - for the sin-offerings
which were sacrificed at every great festival; and finally for all the
work of the house of our God, i.e., whatever else was needful for
worship (ל must be supplied from the context before כּל־מלאכת). The
establishment of such a tax for the expenses of worship, does not
justify the view that the contributions promised by Artaxerxes in his
edict, [Ezr 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#020.md)., of things necessary
to worship had ceased, and that the congregation had now to defray the
expenses from their own resources. For it may readily be supposed, that
besides the assistance afforded by the king, the congregation might also
esteem it needful to furnish a contribution, to meet the increased
requirements of worship, and thus to augment the revenues of the temple,
- the royal alms being limited to a certain amount (see [Ezr
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#022).md).

[Neh 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#035.md)

"And we cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people for the
wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after our houses,
at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of the Lord our
God, as it is written in the law." In the law we merely find it
prescribed that wood should be constantly burning on the altar, and that
the priest should burn wood on it every morning, and burn thereon the
burnt-offering ([Lev 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#012)..md). The law
gave no directions concerning the procuring of the wood; yet the rulers
of the people must, at all events, have always provided for the regular
delivery of the necessary quantity. Nehemiah now gives orders, as he
himself tells us, [Neh 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031.md), which
make this matter the business of the congregation, and the several
houses have successively to furnish a contribution, in the order decided
by casting lots. The words, "at times appointed, year by year," justify
the conclusion that the order was settled for several years, and not
that all the different houses contributed in each year.

(Note: Josephus (bello Jud. ii. 17. 6) speaks of a τῶν ξυλοφορίων ἑορτή,
which he places on the fourteenth day of the month Λῶος, i.e., Ab, the
fifth month of the Jewish year. From this Bertheau infers that the
plural מזמּנים עתּים, here and [Neh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031.md), denotes the one season or day
of delivery in each year. But though the name of this festival is
derived from the present verse, the lxx translating העצים קרבּן העצי על,
πιρὶ κλήρον ξυλοφορίας, it appears even from what Josephus says of this
feast, ἐν ᾗ πᾶσιν ἕθος ὕλην τῷ βωμῷ προσφέρειν, that the feast of
wood-carrying does not designate that one day of the year on which the
wood was delivered for the service of the altar. According to Mishna
Taanit, ch. 4 (in Lightfoot's horae hebraicae in Matth. i. 1), nine days
in the year were appointed for the delivery of wood, viz., 1st Nisan,
20th Tammuz, 5th, 7th, and 10th Ab, etc. Further particulars are given
in Lundius, jd. Heiligtmer, p. 1067f. The feast of wood-carrying may be
compared with our harvest festival; and Bertheau's inference is not more
conclusive than would be the inference that our harvest festival denotes
the one day in the year on which the harvest is gathered in.)

[Neh 10:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#036.md)

It was also arranged to contribute the first-fruits prescribed in the
law. The infinitive להביא depends on העמדנוּ, and is co-ordinate with
לתת, [Neh 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#033.md). The first-fruits of
the ground, comp. [Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); [Exo
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026.md); [Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md); the first-fruits of all fruit
trees, comp. [Num 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#013.md); [Lev
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023.md); the first-born of our sons who
were redeemed according to the estimation of the priest, [Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016.md), and of our cattle (i.e., in the
case of the unclean, the required redemption, [Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012.md)., [Num
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015).md), and the firstlings of the
herds and of the flocks, the fat of which was consumed on the altar, the
flesh becoming the share of the priests, [Num
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#017.md). In [Neh
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#038.md) the construction is altered, the
first person of the imperfect taking the place of the infinitive: and we
will bring the first-fruits. ערסות, probably groats or ground flour; see
rem. on [Num 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#020.md), etc. תרוּמות,
heave-offerings, the offering in this connection, is probably that of
wheat and barley, [Eze 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013.md), or of
the fruits of the field, which are suitably followed by the "fruit of
all manner of trees." On "the first of the wine and oil," comp. [Num
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012.md). These offerings of first-fruits
were to be brought into the chambers of the house of God, where they
were to be kept in store, and distributed to the priests for their
support. "And the tithes of our ground (will we bring) to the Levites;
and they, the Levites, receive the tithes in all our country towns.
([Neh 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#039).md) And a priest, a son of
Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites take tithes; and the
Levites shall bring the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God,
into the chambers of the treasury." The parenthetical sentences in these
verses, המעשׂרים הלויּם והם and הלויּם בּעשׂר, have been variously
understood. עשׂר in the Piel and Hiphil meaning elsewhere to pay tithe,
comp. [Deu 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md); [Deu
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md); [Gen
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022.md), many expositors adhere to this
meaning in these passages also, and translate [Neh
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#038.md) : for they, the Levites, must
give again the tenth (to the priests); and [Neh
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#039.md) : when the Levites give the
tenth; while the lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, Rashi, Aben Ezra, Clericus,
Bertheau, and others, take עשּׂר and העשׂיר in these sentences as
signifying to collect tithe. We prefer the latter view, as giving a more
suitable sense. For the remark that the Levites must give back the tenth
([Neh 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#038).md) does not present so
appropriate a motive for the demand that the tithes should be paid, as
that the tithes are due to the Levites. Still less does the addition, in
our agricultural towns, suit the sentence: the Levites must give back
the tithe to the priests. Again, the fact that it is not said till [Neh
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#039.md) that the Levites have to give
the tenth of the tenth to the priests, speaks still more against this
view. A priest is to be present when the Levites take the tenth, so that
the share of the priests may not be lessened. On "the tenth of the
tenth," comp. [Num 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#026.md). Hezekiah had
provided store-chambers in the temple, in which to deposit the tithes,
[Ch2 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#011.md).

[Neh 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#039.md)

[Neh 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#039.md) is confirmatory of the
preceding clause: the Levites were to bring the tithe of the tithes for
the priests into the chambers of the temple; for thither are both the
children of Israel and the Levites, to bring all heave-offerings of
corn, new wine, and oil: for there are the holy vessels for the service
of the altar (comp. [Num 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015).md), and
the priests that minister, and the doorkeepers and the singers, for
whose maintenance these gifts provide. "And we will not forsake the
house of our God," i.e., we will take care that the service of God's
house shall be provided for; comp. [Neh
13:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#011.md).
