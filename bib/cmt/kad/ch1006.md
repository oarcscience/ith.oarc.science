The Families of Levi, and Their Cities - 1 Chronicles 6

1 Chronicles 6

(5:27-6:66). As to the tribe of Levi, we have several communications:
(1.) the genealogy of the high-priestly family of Aaron, down to
Jehozadak, who was led away into exile by Nebuchadnezzar ([Ch1
6:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001)); (2..md) a short register of the
families of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, which does not extend far into
later times ([Ch1 6:16-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016)); (3..md) the
genealogies of the musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan (1 Chron 6:31-47),
with remarks on the service of the other Levites ([Ch1
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#048.md), [Ch1
6:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#049)); (4..md) a register of the high
priests from Eleazar to Ahimaaz the son of Zadok ([Ch1
6:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#050).md), with a register of the
cities of the Levites (1 Chron 6:54-81). If we look into these
genealogies and registers, we see, both from a repetition of a part of
the genealogy of the high priest ([Ch1
6:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#050).md), and also from the name of
the eldest son of Levi appearing in two different forms - in [Ch1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md). Gershon; in [Ch1
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016.md), [Ch1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020.md), etc., Gershom - that the
register in [Ch1 6:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md) is drawn from
another source than the registers in 1 Chron 6, which, with the
exception of the genealogies of David's chief musicians, are throughout
fragmentary, and in parts corrupt, and were most probably found by the
author of the Chronicle in this defective state.

[1 Chronicles 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 6:1</span></span>

(5:27-41). The family of Aaron, or the high-priestly line of Aaron, to
the time of the Babylonian exile. - [Ch1
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md). In order to exhibit the
connection of Aharon (or Aaron) with the patriarch Levi, the enumeration
begins with the three sons of Levi, who are given in [Ch1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md) as in [Gen
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#011.md); [Exo
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016.md), and in other passages. Of Levi's
grandchildren, only the four sons of Kohath ([Ch1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002).md) are noticed; and of these, again,
Amram is the only one whose descendants - Aaron, Moses, and Miriam - are
named ([Ch1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#003).md); and thereafter only
Aaron's sons are introduced, in order that the enumeration of his family
in the high-priestly line of Eleazar might follow. With [Ch1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002.md) cf. [Exo
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#018.md), and on [Ch1
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#034.md) see the commentary on [Exo
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md). With the sons of Aaron ([Ch1
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044).md) compare besides [Exo
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md), also [Num
3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#002.md), and [Ch1
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md). As Nadab and Abihu were slain
when they offered strange fire before Jahve ([Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001)..md), Aaron's race was continued
only by his sons Eleazar and Ithamar. After Aaron's death, his eldest
son Eleazar was chosen by God to be his successor in the high priest's
office, and thus the line of Eleazar came into possession of the
high-priestly dignity.

[Ch1 6:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004.md)

(5:30-41). In [Ch1 6:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004.md) the
descendants of Eleazar are enumerated in twenty-two generations; the
word הוליד, "he begat," being repeated with every name. The son so
begotten was, when he lived after his father, the heir of the
high-priestly dignity. Thus Phinehas the son of Eleazar ([Exo
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#025).md) is found in possession of it in
[Jdg 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028.md). From this the older
commentators have rightly drawn the inference that the purpose of the
enumeration in [Ch1 6:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004.md) was to
communicate the succession of high priests from Eleazar, who died
shortly after Joshua ([Jos 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#033).md), to
Jehozadak, whom Nebuchadnezzar caused to be carried away into Babylon.
From the death of Aaron in the fortieth year after Israel came forth
from Egypt, till the building of the temple in the fourth year of the
reign of Solomon, 400 years elapsed (480 - \_40 = 440, [Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001).md). From the building of the temple
to the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple by the Chaldaeans
there was an interval of 423 years (36 years under Solomon, and 387
years during which the kingdom of Judah existed; see the chronological
table to 1 Kings 12). Between the death of Aaron, therefore, and the
time when Jehozadak was led away into captivity, supposing that that
event occurred only under Zedekiah, lay a period of 440 + 423 = 863
years. For this period twenty-two generations appear too few, for then
the average duration of each life would be 39 1/4 years. Such an
estimate would certainly appear a very high one, but it does not pass
the bounds of possibility, as cases may have occurred in which the son
died before the father, when consequently the grandson would succeed the
grandfather in the office of high priest, and the son would be omitted
in our register. The ever-recurring הוליד cannot be brought forward in
opposition to this supposition, because הוליד esuace in the genealogical
lists may express mediate procreation, and the grandson may be
introduced as begotten by the grandfather. On the supposition of the
existence of such cases, we should have to regard the average above
mentioned as the average time during which each of the high priests held
the office. But against such an interpretation of this list of the
posterity of Eleazar two somewhat serious difficulties are raised. The
less serious of these consists in this, that in the view of the author
of our register, the line of Eleazar remained an uninterrupted
possession of the high-priestly dignity; but in the historical books of
the Old Testament another line of high priests, beginning with Eli, is
mentioned, which, according to [Ch1
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005.md), and Joseph. Ant. v. 11. 5,
belonged to the family of Ithamar. The list is as follows: Eli ([Sa1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#020).md); his son Phinehas, who, however,
died before Eli ([Sa1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011.md); his son
Ahitub ([Sa1 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003).md); his son Ahijah,
who was also called Ahimelech ([Sa1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md); [Sa1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md), [Sa1
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#011.md), [Sa1
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020).md); his son Abiathar ([Sa1
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020).md), from whom Solomon took away
the high-priesthood ([Kg1 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026)..md), and
set Zadok in his place ([Kg1 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035).md).
According to Josephus, loc. cit., the high-priestly dignity remained
with the line of Eleazar, from Eleazar to Ozi (עזּי, [Ch1
6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004).md); it then fell to Eli and his
descendants, until with Zadok it returned to the line of Eleazar. These
statements manifestly rest upon truthful historical tradition; for the
supposition that at the death of Ozi the high-priesthood was transferred
from the line of Eleazar to the line of Ithamar through Eli, is
supported by the circumstance that from the beginning of the judgeship
of Eli to the beginning of the reign of Solomon a period of 139 years
elapsed, which is filled up in both lines by five names, - Eli,
Phinehas, Ahitub, Ahijah, and Abiathar in the passages above quoted; and
Zerahiah, Meraioth, Amariah, Ahitub, and Zadok in [Ch1
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#006.md) of our chapter. But the further
opinion expressed by Joseph. Antt. viii. 1. 3, that the descendants of
Eleazar, during the time in which Eli and his descendants were in
possession of the priesthood, lived as private persons, plainly rests on
a conjecture, the incorrectness of which is made manifest by some
distinct statements of the Old Testament: for, according to [Sa2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017.md) and [Sa2
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025.md), Zadok of Eleazar's line, and
Abiathar of the line of Ithamar, were high priests in the time of David;
cf. [Ch1 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005.md). The transfer of the
high-priestly dignity, or rather of the official exercise of the
high-priesthood, to Eli, one of Ithamar's line, after Ozi's death, was,
as we have already remarked on [Sa1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md)., probably brought about by
circumstances or relations which are not now known to us, but without an
extinction of the right of Ozi's descendants to the succession in
dignity. But when the wave of judgment broke over the house of Eli, the
ark was taken by the Philistines; and after it had been sent back into
the land of Israel, it was not again placed beside the tabernacle, but
remained during seventy years in the house of Abinadab (1 Sam 4:4-7:2).
Years afterwards David caused it to be brought to Jerusalem, and erected
a separate tent for it on Zion, while the tabernacle had meanwhile been
transferred to Gibeon, where it continued to be the place where
sacrifices were offered till the building of the temple.

Thus there arose two places of worship, and in connection with them
separate spheres of action for the high priests of both lines, - Zadok
performing the duties of the priestly office at Gibeon ([Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039.md); cf. [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004)..md), while Abiathar discharged its
functions in Jerusalem. But without doubt not only Zadok, but also his
father Ahitub before him, had discharged the duties of high priest in
the tabernacle at Gibeon, while the connection of Eli's sons with the
office came to an end with the slaughter of Ahijah (Ahimelech) and all
the priesthood at Nob (1 Sam 22); for Abiathar, the only son of
Ahimelech, and the single survivor of that massacre, fled to David, and
accompanied him continuously in his flight before Saul ([Sa1
22:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020).md). But, not content with the
slaughter of the priests in Nob, Saul also smote the city itself with
the edge of the sword; whence it is probable, although all definite
information to that effect is wanting, that it was in consequence of
this catastrophe that the tabernacle was removed to Gibeon and the
high-priesthood entrusted to Zadok's father, a man of the line of
Eleazar, because the only son of Ahimelech, and the only representative
of Ithamar's line, had fled to David. If this view be correct, of the
ancestors of Ahitub, only Amariah, Meraioth, and Zerahiah did not hold
the office of high priest. But if these had neither been supplanted by
Eli nor had rendered themselves unworthy of the office by criminal
conduct; if the only reason why the possession of the high-priesthood
was transferred to Eli was, that Ozi's son Zerahiah was not equal to the
discharge of the duties of the office under the difficult circumstances
of the time; and if Eli's grandson Ahitub succeeded his grandfather in
the office at a time when God had already announced to Eli by prophets
the approaching ruin of his house, then Zerahiah, Meraioth, and Amariah,
although not de facto in possession of the high-priesthood, might still
be looked upon as de jure holders of the dignity, and so be introduced
in the genealogies of Eleazar as such. In this way the difficulty is
completely overcome.

But it is somewhat more difficulty to explain the other fact, that our
register on the one hand gives too many names for the earlier period and
too few for the later time, and on the other hand is contradicted by
some definite statements of the historical books. We find too few names
for the time from the death of Aaron to the death of Uzzi (Ozi), when
Eli became high priest, - a period of 299 years (vide the Chronological
View of the Period of the Judges, ii. 1, S. 217). Five high priests -
Eleazar, Phinehas, Abishua, Bukki, and Uzzi - are too few; for in that
case each one of them must have discharged the office for 60 years, and
have begotten the son who succeeded him in the office only in his 60th
year, or the grandson must have regularly succeeded the grandfather in
the office, - all of which suppositions appear somewhat incredible.
Clearly, therefore, intermediate names must have been omitted in our
register. To the period from Eli till the deposition of Abiathar, in the
beginning of Solomon's reign - which, according to the chronological
survey, was a period of 139 years - the last five names from Zerahiah to
Zadok correspond; and as 24 years are thus assigned to each, and Zadok
held the office for a number of years more under Solomon, we may reckon
an average of 30 years to each generation. For the following period of
about 417 years from Solomon, or the completion of the temple, till the
destruction of the temple by the Chaldaeans, the twelve names from
Ahimaaz the son of Zadok to Jehozadak, who was led away into captivity,
give the not incredible average of from 34 to 35 years for each
generation, so that in this part of our register not many breaks need be
supposed. But if we examine the names enumerated, we find (1) that no
mention is made of the high priest Jehoiada, who raised the youthful
Joash to the throne, and was his adviser during the first years of his
reign (2 Kings 11, and [Ch2 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010.md);
[Ch2 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#002).md), and that under Ahaz,
Urijah, who indeed is called only הכּהן, but who was certainly high
priest ([Kg2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010)..md), is omitted; and
(2) we find that the name Azariah occurs three times ([Ch1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#009.md), [Ch1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010.md), and [Ch1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#011).md), on which Berth. remarks:
"Azariah is the name of the high priest in the time of Solomon ([Kg1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002).md), in the time of Uzziah ([Ch2
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017).md), and in the time of Hezekiah
([Ch2 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#010).md)." Besides this, we meet
with an Amariah, the fifth after Zadok, whom Lightf., Oehler, and others
consider to be the high priest of that name under Jehoshaphat, [Ch2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#011). And finally, (3.md) in the
historical account in [Kg2 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004.md).,
Hilkiah is mentioned as high priest under Josiah, while according to our
register ([Ch1 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#013).md) Hilkiah begat
Azariah; whence we must conclude either that Hilkiah is not the high
priest of that name under Josiah, or Azariah is not the person of that
name who lived in the time of Hezekiah. As regards the omission of the
names Urijah and Jehoiada in our register, Urijah may have been passed
over as an unimportant man; but Jehoiada had exerted far too important
an influence on the fate of the kingdom of Judah to allow of his being
so overlooked. The only possibilities in his case are, either that he
occurs in our register under another name, owing to his having had, like
so many others, two different names, or that the name יהוידע has fallen
out through an old error in the transcription of the genealogical list.
The latter supposition, viz., that Jehoiada has fallen out before
Johanan, is the more probable. Judging from [Kg2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#003.md) and [Ch2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#002.md), Jehoiada died under Joash, at
least five or ten years before the king, and consequently from 127 to
132 years after Solomon, at the advanced age of 130 years ([Ch2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015).md). He was therefore born shortly
before or after the death of Solomon, being a great-grandson of Zadok,
who may have died a considerable time before Solomon, as he had filled
the office of high priest at Gibeon under David for a period of 30
years.

Then, if we turn our attention to the thrice recurring name Azariah, we
see that the Azariah mentioned in [Kg1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002.md) cannot be regarded as the high
priest; for the word כּהן in this passage does not denote the high
priest, but the viceroy of the kingdom (vide on the passage). But
besides, this Azariah cannot be the same person as the Azariah in [Ch1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#009.md) of our genealogy, because he is
called a son of Zadok, while our Azariah is introduced as the son of
Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, and consequently as a grandson of Zadok; and
the grandson of Zadok who is mentioned as being high priest along with
Abiathar, [Kg1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#004.md), could not have
occupied in this grandfather's time the first place among the highest
public officials of Solomon. The Azariah mentioned in [Kg1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002.md) as the son of Zadok must not be
considered to be a brother of the Ahimaaz of our register, for we very
seldom find a nephew and uncle called by the same name. As to the
Azariah of [Ch1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010.md), the son of
Johanan, it is remarked, "This is he who was priest (or who held the
priest's office; כּהן, cf. [Exo 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#013.md);
[Lev 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#032)) in the house (temple.md)
which Solomon had built in Jerusalem." R. Sal. and Kimchi have connected
this remark with the events narrated in [Ch2
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017.md), referring it to the special
jealousy of King Uzziah's encroachments on the priest's office, in
arrogating to himself in the temple the priestly function of offering
incense in the holy place. Against this, indeed, J. H. Mich. has raised
the objection, quod tamen chronologiae rationes vix admittunt; and it is
true that this encroachment of Uzziah's happened 200 years after
Solomon's death, while the Azariah mentioned in our register is the
fourth after Zadok. But if the name Jehoiada has been dropped out before
Johanan, and the Jehoiada held the high priest's office for a
considerable time under Joash, the high-priesthood of his grandson
Azariah would coincide with Uzziah's reign, when of course the
chronological objection to the above-mentioned explanation of the words
וגו כּהן אשׁר הוּא is removed.

(Note: Bertheau's explanation is inadmissible. He says: "If we consider
that in the long line of the high priests, many of them bearing the same
name, it would naturally suggest itself to distinguish the Azariah who
first discharged the duties of his office in the temple, in order to
bring a fixed chronology into the enumeration of the names; and if we
recollect that a high priest Azariah, the son, or according to our
passage more definitely the grandson, of Zadok, lived in the time of
Solomon; and finally, if we consider the passage [Ch1
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#032.md), we must hold that the words, 'He
it is who discharged the duties of priest in the temple which Solomon
had built in Jerusalem,' originally stood after the name Azariah in v.
9; cf. [Kg1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002.md)." All justification of
the proposed transposition is completely taken away by the fact that the
Azariah of [Kg1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002.md) was neither high
priest nor the same person as the Azariah in v. 10 of our register; and
it is impossible that a grandson of Zadok whom Solomon appointed to the
high-priesthood, instead of Abiathar, can have been the first who
discharged the duties of high priest in the temple. Oehler's opinion (in
Herzog's Realencyklop. vi. 205), that the Amariah who follows Azariah
([Ch1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#011).md) is identical with the
Amariah under Jehoshaphat, is not less improbable; for Jehoshaphat was
king sixty-one years after Solomon's death, and during these sixty-one
years the four high priests who are named between Zadok and Amariah
could not have succeeded each other.)

But lastly, the difficulty connected with the fact that in our passage
Azariah follows Hilkiah, while in [Kg2
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004.md). and [Ch2
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#010.md), [Ch2
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#013.md), Azariah occurs as high priest
under King Hezekiah, and Hilkiah in the time of his great-grandson
Josiah, cannot be cleared away by merely changing the order of the names
Hilkiah and Azariah. For, apart altogether from the improbability of
such a transposition having taken place in a register formed as this is,
"Shallum begat Hilkiah, and Hilkiah begat Azariah, and Azariah begat,"
the main objection to it is the fact that between Azariah, [Ch1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#013.md), who lived under Uzziah, and
Hilkiah four names are introduced; so that on this supposition, during
the time which elapsed between Uzziah's forcing his way into the temple
till the passover under Hezekiah, i.e., during a period of from 55 to 60
years, four generations must have followed one another, which is quite
impossible. In addition to this, between Hezekiah and Josiah came the
reigns of Manasseh and Amon, who reigned 55 years and 2 years
respectively; and from the passover of Hezekiah to the finding of the
book of the law by the high priest Hilkiah in the eighteenth year of
Josiah, about 90 years had elapsed, whence it is clear that on
chronological grounds Hilkiah cannot well have been the successor of
Azariah in the high-priesthood. The Azariah of v. 11f., therefore,
cannot be identified with the Azariah who was high priest under Hezekiah
([Ch2 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#010).md); and no explanation seems
possible, other than the supposition that between Ahitub and Zadok the
begetting of Azariah has been dropped out. On this assumption the
Hilkiah mentioned in v. 13 may be the high priest in the time of Josiah,
although between him and the time when Jehozadak was led away into exile
three names, including that of Jehozadak, are mentioned, while from the
eighteenth year of Josiah till the destruction of the temple by the
Chaldaeans only 30 years elapsed. For Hilkiah may have been in the
eighteenth year of Josiah's reign very old; and at the destruction of
Jerusalem, not Jehozadak, but his father Seraiah the grandson of
Hilkiah, was high priest, and was executed at Riblah by Nebuchadnezzar
([Kg2 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md), [Kg2
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021).md), from which we may conclude
that Jehozadak was led away captive in his early years. The order in
which the names occur in our register, moreover, is confirmed by [Ezr
7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001.md), where, in the statement as to
the family of Ezra, the names from Seraiah onwards to Amariah
ben-Azariah occur in the same order. The correspondence would seem to
exclude any alterations of the order, either by transposition of names
or by the insertion of some which had been dropped; but yet it only
proves that both these genealogies have been derived from the same
authority, and does not at all remove the possibility of this authority
itself having had some defects. The probability of such breaks as we
suppose in the case of Jehoiada and Azariah, who lived under Hezekiah,
is shown, apart altogether from the reasons which have been already
brought forward in support of it, by the fact that our register has only
eleven generations from Zadok, the contemporary of Solomon, to Seraiah,
who was slain at the destruction of Jerusalem; while the royal house of
David shows seventeen generations, viz., the twenty kings of Judah,
omitting Athaliah, and Jehoahaz and Zedekiah, the last two as being
brothers of Jehoiakim ([Ch1 3:10-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010).md).
Even supposing that the king's sons were, as a rule, earlier married,
and begat children earlier than the priests, yet the difference between
eleven and seventeen generations for the same period is too great, and
is of itself sufficient to suggest that in our register of the high
priests names are wanting, and that the three or four high priests known
to us from the historical books who are wanting - Amariah under
Jehoshaphat, Jehoiada under Joash, (Urijah under Ahaz,) and Azariah
under Hezekiah - were either passed over or had fallen out of the list
made use of by the author of the Chronicle.

(Note: The extra-biblical information concerning the prae-exilic high
priests in Josephus and the Seder Olam, is, in so far as it differs from
the account of the Old Testament, without any historical warrAnt. Vide
the comparison of these in Lightfoot, Ministerium templi, Opp. ed. ii.
vol. i. p. 682ff.; Selden, De success, in pontific. lib. i.; and Reland,
Antiquitatt. ss. ii. c. 2.)

(5:41). Jehozadak is the father of Joshua who returned from exile with
Zerubbabel, and was the first high priest in the restored community
([Ezr 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md); [Ezr
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002.md); [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001).md). After הלך, "he went forth,"
בּגּולה is to be supplied from וגו בּהגלות, "he went into exile" to
Babylon; cf. [Jer 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md).

(Ch. 6). The families and cities of the Levites. - Vv. 1-34. Register of
the families of the Levites. - This is introduced by an enumeration of
the sons and grandsons of Levi ([Ch1
6:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016).md), which is followed by lists
of families in six lines of descent: (a) the descendants of Gershon
([Ch1 6:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020).md), of Kohath ([Ch1
6:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022).md), and of Merari ([Ch1
6:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#029)); and (b.md) the genealogies of
David's chief musicians ([Ch1 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#031.md),
[Ch1 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#032).md), of Heman the Kohathite
([Ch1 6:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033).md), of Asaph the
Gershonite ([Ch1 6:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039).md), and of
Ethan the Merarite ([Ch1 6:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044).md); and
in [Ch1 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#048.md), [Ch1
6:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#049.md), some notes as to the service
performed by the other Levites and the priests are added.

(6:1-4). The sons of Levi are in [Ch1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md) again enumerated as in [Ch1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md); then in [Ch1
6:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016.md) the sons of these three sons,
i.e., the grandsons of Levi, are introduced, while in [Ch1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md) only the sons of Kohath are
mentioned. The only object of this enumeration is to make quite clear
the descent of the Levitic families which follow. The name of the first
son of Levi is in [Ch1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016.md), [Ch1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#017.md), [Ch1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020.md), etc. of this chapter גּרשׁם,
which was the name of Moses' son, cf. [Ch1
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#015.md).; whereas in [Ch1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md) and in the Pentateuch we find a
different pronunciation, viz., גּרשׁון. The names of Levi's grandsons in
[Ch1 6:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#017.md) coincide with the
statements of the Pentateuch, [Exo
6:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#017.md), and [Num
3:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#017.md), cf. [Num
26:57](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#057.md). Bertheau and other commentators
consider the words in [Ch1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#017.md), "and
these are the families of Levi according to their fathers," to be a
"concluding subscription" to the statements of [Ch1
6:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015.md), and would remove ו before
אלּה, as not compatible with this supposition. But in this he is wrong:
for although the similar statement in [Exo
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md) is a subscription, yet it is in
[Num 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#020.md) a superscription, and must
in our verse also be so understood; for otherwise the enumeration of the
descendants of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, which follows, would be
brought in very abruptly, without any connecting particle, and the ו
before אלּה points to the same conclusion.

[1 Chronicles 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 6:20</span></span>

(6:5-15). The three lists of the descendants of Gershon, Kohath, and
Merari are similar to one another in plan, and in all, each name is
connected with the preceding by בּנו, "his son," but they differ greatly
in the number of the names.

[Ch1 6:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020.md)

(6:5-6). The ל before גּרשׁום is introductory: "as to Gershom." Those of
his descendants who are here enumerated belong to the family of his
oldest son Libni, which is traced down through seven generations to
Jeaterai, a name not elsewhere met with. Of the intermediate names,
Johath, Zimmah, and Zerah occur also among the descendants of Asaph, who
is descended from the line of Shimei, [Ch1
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039.md).

[Ch1 6:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022.md)

(6:7-13). The genealogy of the descendants of Kohath consists of three
lists of names, each of which commences afresh with בּני, [Ch1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022.md), [Ch1
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#035.md), and [Ch1
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#038.md); yet we learn nothing from it as
to the genealogical connection of these three lines. The very beginning,
"The sons of Kohath, Amminidab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,"
is somewhat strange. For, according to [Exo
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018.md), [Exo
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#021.md), and [Exo
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#024.md), Kohath's second son is called
Izhar, whose son was Korah, whose sons were Assir, Elkanah, and
Abiasaph. Amminidab is nowhere met with as a son of Kohath; but among
the descendants of Uzziel, a prince of a father's-house is met with in
the time of David who bore this name. The name Amminidab occurs also in
the time of Moses, in the genealogies of the tribe of Judah, [Ch1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#010.md); [Num
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#007.md); [Rut
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#019.md), as that of the father of the
prince Nahshon, and of Elisheba, whom Aaron took to wife, [Exo
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md). But since the names Korah and
Assir point to the family of Izhar, the older commentators supposed the
Amminidab of our verse to be only another name for Izhar; while
Bertheau, on the contrary, conjectures "that as an Amminidab occurs in
the lists of the descendants of Kohath as father-in-law of Aaron,
Amminidab has been substituted for Izhar by an ancient error, which
might very easily slip into an abridgment of more detailed lists." But
we have here no trace of an abridgment of more detailed lists. According
to [Exo 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#021.md) and [Exo
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#024.md), Korah was a son of Izhar, and
Assir a son of Korah; and consequently in our genealogies only the name
Izhar is wanting between Korah and Kohath, while instead of him we have
Amminidab. An exchange or confusion of the names of Izhar and Amminidab
the father-in-law of Aaron, is as improbable as the supposition that
Amminidab is another name for Izhar, since the genealogies of the
Pentateuch give only the name Izhar. Yet no third course is open, and we
must decide to accept either one or the other of these suppositions. For
that our verses contain a genealogy, or fragments of genealogies, of the
Kohathite line of Izhar there can be no doubt, when we compare them with
the genealogy ([Ch1 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033).md) of the
musician Heman, a descendant of Kohath, which also gives us the means of
explaining the other obscurities in our register. In [Ch1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022.md) and [Ch1
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#023.md) the names of Assir, Elkanah, and
Abiasaph, and again Assir, follow that of Korah, with בּנו after each.
This בּנו cannot be taken otherwise than as denoting that the names
designate so many consecutive generations; and the only peculiarity in
the list is, that the conjunction w is found before Abiasaph and the
second Assir, while the other names do not have it. But if we compare
the genealogy in Ex 6 with this enumeration, we find that there, in [Ch1
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039.md), the same three names, Assir,
Elkanah, and Abiasaph, which are here enumerated as those of the son,
grandson, and great-grandson of Korah, were said to be the names of the
sons of the Izharite Korah. Further, from Heman's genealogy in [Ch1
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#037.md), we learn that the second Assir
of our list is a son of Abiasaph, and, according to [Ch1
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#037.md) and [Ch1
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#023.md), had a son Tahath. Assir,
Elkanah, and Abiasaph must consequently be held to have been brothers,
and the following Assir a son of the last-named Abiasaph, whose family
is in [Ch1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#009.md) further traced through
four generations (Tahath, Uriel, Uzziah, and Shaul). Instead of these
four, we find in [Ch1 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#037.md) and [Ch1
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#036.md) the names Tahath, Zephaniah,
Azariah, and Joel. Now although the occurrence of Uzziah and Azariah as
names of the same king immediately suggests that in our register also
Uzziah and Azariah are two names of the same person, yet the divergence
in the other names, on the one hand Zephaniah for Joel, and on the other
Uriel for Shaul, is strongly opposed to this conjecture. The discrepancy
can scarcely be naturally explained in any other way, than by supposing
that after Tahath the two genealogies diverge-ours introducing his son
Uriel and his descendants; the other, in [Ch1
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#036.md), mentioning a second son of
Tohath, Zephaniah, of whose race Heman came.

[Ch1 6:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#025.md)

(6:10-15). "And the sons of Elkanah, Amasai and Ahimoth." As it is clear
that with אלק וּבני אל a new list begins, and that the preceding
enumeration is that of the descendants of Abiasaph, it is at once
suggested that this Elkanah was the brother of the Abiasaph mentioned in
[Ch1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015.md). If, however, we compare the
genealogy of Heman, we find there ([Ch1
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#036.md) and [Ch1
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#035).md) a list of the descendants of
Joel in an ascending line, thus, - Elkanah, Amasai, Mahath, Elkanah,
Zuph; from which it would seem to follow that our Elkanah is the son of
Moel mentioned in [Ch1 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#036.md), for
Ahimoth may be without difficulty considered to be another form of the
name Mahath. This conclusion would be assured if only the beginning of
[Ch1 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#026.md) were in harmony with it. In
this verse, indeed, בּנו אלקנה, as we read in the Kethibh, may be
without difficulty taken to mean that Elkanah was the son of Ahimoth,
just as in [Ch1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020.md) Elkanah is
introduced as son of Mahath. But in this way no meaning can be assigned
to the אלקנה which follows בני, and Bertheau accordingly is of opinion
that this אלקנה has come into the text by an error. The Masoretes also
felt the difficulty, and have substituted for the Kethibh בנו the Keri
בּני, but then nothing can be made of the first אלקנה in [Ch1
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#026.md). Beyond doubt the traditional
text is here corrupt, and from a comparison of [Ch1
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#035.md) and [Ch1
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#034.md) the only conclusion we can draw
with any certainty is that the list from צופי onwards contains the names
of descendants of Elkanah the son of Mahath, which is so far favourable
to the Keri אלקנה בּני. The name Elkanah, on the contrary, which
immediately precedes בנו, seems to point to a hiatus in the text, and
gives room for the conjecture that in [Ch1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010.md) the sons of Elkanah, the brother
of Abiasaph and Assir, were named, and that there followed thereupon an
enumeration of the sons or descendants of the Elkanah whom we meet with
in [Ch1 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#036.md) as son of Joel, after
which came the names Elkanah בּנו, Zophai בּנו, etc. נחת and אליאב we
consider to be other forms of תּוח and אליאל, [Ch1
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#034.md), and צופי is only another form of
צוּף. The succeeding names, Jeroham and Elkanah ([Ch1
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#027).md), agree with those in [Ch1
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#034.md); but between the clauses "Elkanah
his son" ([Ch1 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#027).md), and "and the
sons of Samuel" ([Ch1 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028).md), the
connecting link בּנו שׁמוּאל, cf. [Ch1
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md), is again wanting, as is also,
before or after הבּכר ([Ch1 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028).md), the
name of the first-born, viz., Joel; cf. [Ch1
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md) with [Sa1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002.md). Now, although the two
last-mentioned omissions can be supplied, they yet show that the
enumeration in [Ch1 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022.md) is not a
continuous list of one Kohathite family, but contains only fragments of
several Kohathite genealogies. - In [Ch1
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#029.md) and [Ch1
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#030.md), descendants of Merari follow;
sons of Mahli in six generations, who are not mentioned elsewhere.
Bertheau compares this list of names, Mahli, Libni, Shimei, Uzza,
Shimea, Haggiah, and Asaiah, with the list contained in [Ch1
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044.md), Mushi, Mahli, Shamer, Bani,
Amzi, Hilkiah, and Amaziah, and attempts to maintain, notwithstanding
the great difference in the names, that the two lists were originally
identical, in order to find support for the hypothesis "that the three
lists in [Ch1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020.md) have not found a
place in the Chronicle from their own intrinsic value, or, in other
words, have not been introduced there in order to give a register of the
ancestors of Jeaterai, the sons of Samuel and Asaiah, but have been
received only because they bring us to Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [Ch1
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#034.md), [Ch1
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039.md), [Ch1
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044.md), in another fashion than the
lists of names in [Ch1 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md)." But this
hypothesis is shown to be false, apart altogether from the other
objections which might be raised against it, by the single fact of the
total discrepancy between the names of the Merarites in [Ch1
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#029.md) and [Ch1
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#030.md) and those found in [Ch1
6:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044.md). Of all the six names only
Mahli is found in both cases, and he is carefully distinguished in both
- in the genealogy of Ethan as the son of Mushi and grandson of Merari;
in our list as the son of Merari. When we remember that Merari had two
sons, Mahli and Mushi, after whom the father's-houses into which his
descendants divided themselves were named ([Num
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#020.md); [Num
26:58](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#058).md), and that the same names very
frequently occur in different families, it would never suggest itself to
any reader of our register to identify the line of Mushi with the line
of Mahli, seeing that, except the name of Mahli the son of Mushi, which
is the same as that of his uncle, all the other names are different.
[Ch1 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#029.md) and [Ch1
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#030.md) contain a register of the family
of Mahli, while the ancestors of Ethan, [Ch1
6:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044.md), belonged to the family of
Mushi. Our list then absolutely cannot be intended to form a transition
to Ethan or Ethan's ancestors. The same may be said of the two other
lists [Ch1 6:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020.md) and [Ch1
6:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#023.md), and this transition
hypothesis is consequently a mere airspun fancy. The three lists are
certainly not embodied in the Chronicle on account of the persons with
whose names they end-Jeaterai, the sons of Samuel, and Asaiah; but the
author of the Chronicle has thought them worthy of being received into
his work as registers of ancient families of the three sons of Levi
which had been transmitted from ancient times.

conduct it. הערון ממּנוח, "from the resting of the ark," i.e., from the
time that the ark of the covenant, which in the prae-Davidic time had
been carried about from one place to another, had received a permanent
resting-place on Zion, and had become the centre of the worship
instituted by David, [Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md). "And
they served before the dwelling of the tabernacle with song." משׁכּן
לפני, "before the dwelling," for the sacrificial worship, with which the
singing of psalms was connected, was performed in the court before the
dwelling. The genitive מועד אהל is to be taken as explanatory: "The
dwelling (of Jahve), which was the tent of the meeting (of God with His
people)." מועד אהל was the usual designation of the tabernacle built by
Moses, which was at first set up in Shiloh, then in the time of Saul at
Nob, and after the destruction of that city by Saul (1 Sam 22) in Gibeon
([Ch1 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029).md). It denotes here the tent
which David had erected upon Mount Zion for the ark of the covenant,
because from its containing the ark, and by the institution of a settled
worship in it (cf. [Ch1 16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001)..md), it
thenceforth took the place of the Mosaic tabernacle, although the Mosaic
sanctuary at Gibeon continued to be a place of worship till the
completion of the temple ([Kg1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md);
[Ch2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003).md), - "till Solomon built the
house of Jahve in Jerusalem," into which the ark was removed, and to
which the whole of the religious services were transferred. In their
services they stood כּמשׁפּטם, according to their right, i.e., according
to the order prescribed for them by David; cf. 1 Chron 16:52ff.

[Ch1 6:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md)

(6:18-23). "These (following three men, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan) are
they who stood (in service) with their sons." The three were the heads
of the three Levitic families, to whom the execution of the liturgic
singing was entrusted. The names of their sons, vide [Ch1
25:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md). The object of the following
genealogies is to show their descent from Levi. "Of the sons of the
Kohathite family (is) Heman the singer." המשׁורר, ὁ ψαλτῳδός lxx. Heman
is named first as being the head of the choir of singers who stood in
the centre, while Asaph and his choir stood on his right hand, and on
the left Ethan and his choir, so that when they sang in concert the
conducting of the whole fell to Heman. His family is traced back in [Ch1
6:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md) through twenty members to
"Kohath the son of Levi, then son of Israel" (Jacob).

[Ch1 6:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039.md)

(6:24-28). "His brother Asaph," who is Heman's brother only in the more
general sense of being closely connected with him, partly by their
common descent from Levi, partly by their common calling, was a
descendant of Gershon from his younger son Shimei. His genealogy
contains only fifteen names to Gershon, five less than that of his
contemporary Heman, probably because here and there intermediate names
are omitted.

[Ch1 6:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044.md)

which stood on the left hand) were Ethan and his sons." As in the case
of Asaph, so also in that of Ethan, וּבניהם ([Ch1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#018).md) is omitted, but is to be
supplied; when the introductory clause "and the sons of Merari" is at
once explained. Ethan is a Merarite of the younger line of Mushi (see
above). The name of his father is here קישׁי, and in [Ch1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017.md) it is קוּשׁיהוּ, which latter is
clearly the original form, which has been shortened into Kishi. Instead
of the name Ethan (איתן) as here and in [Ch1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019.md), we find in other passage a
Jeduthun mentioned as third chief-musician, along with Heman and Asaph
(cf. [Ch1 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md); [Ch2
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015.md); [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017.md), cf. [Ch1
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#041).md); from which we see that Jeduthun
was another name for Ethan, probably a by-name - ידוּתוּן, "praiseman" -
which he had received from his calling, although nothing is said in the
Old Testament as to the origin of this name. His genealogy contains only
twelve names to Merari, being thus still more abridged than that of
Asaph.

[Ch1 6:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#048.md)

(6:33-34). "And their brethren the Levites," i.e., the other Levites
besides the singers just mentioned, "were נתוּנים given for every
service of the dwelling of the house of God," i.e., given to Aaron and
his sons (the priests) for the performance of service in the carrying on
of the worship; cf. [Num 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#009.md); [Num
8:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#016.md); [Num
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#006.md). But Aaron and his sons had three
duties to perform: (1) they burnt the offerings on the altar of
burnt-offering and on the altar of incense, cf. [Num
18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001); (2.md) they looked after all the
service of the holy place; (3) they had to atone for Israel by offering
the atoning-sacrifices, and performing the cleansings according to all
that Moses commanded. This last clause refers to all the three
above-mentioned duties of the priests. Moses is called the servant of
God, as in [Deu 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#005.md); [Jos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md), [Jos
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#013.md).

[1 Chronicles 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">ch1 6:50</span></span>

(6:35-38). The remarks as to the service of the priests are followed by
a catalogue of the high priests, which runs from Eleazar to Ahimaaz the
son of Zadok (cf. [Sa2 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#027).md), who
probably succeeded his father in the high-priesthood even in the time of
Solomon. This genealogy is similar in form to the genealogies given in
[Ch1 6:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020.md), and has therefore most
probably been derived from the same source as this, and has been drawn
in here to form a transition to the enumeration of the cities of the
Levites; for it begins in [Ch1 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044.md)
with the dwelling-places of the sons of Aaron, and the אהרן
לבני...מושׁבותם ואלּה of [Ch1 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044.md)
corresponds to the אהרן בּני ואלּה of [Ch1
6:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#049.md). The order of the names coincides
exactly with that of the longer register in 1 Chr 5:30-34.

[1 Chronicles 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">ch1 6:54</span></span>

(6:39-66). Register of the cities of the Levites, which agrees on the
whole with the register in Josh 21, if we except different forms of some
names of cities, and many corruptions of the text, but differing in many
ways from it in form; whence we gather that it is not derived from the
book of Joshua, but from some other ancient authority.

[Ch1 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md)

(6:39). [Ch1 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md) contains the
superscription, "These are their dwelling-places according to their
districts, in their boundaries." So far the superscription belongs to
the whole catalogue of cities. The suffixes point back to the לוי בּני,
[Ch1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md). טירה, from טוּר, to surround
in a circle, signifies in the older language a "nomad village" (cf. [Gen
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016.md); [Num
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#010).md); here, on the contrary, it is
sued in a derivative sense for "district," to denote the circle of
dwellings which were granted to the Levites in the cities of the other
tribes. The following words, "For the sons of Aaron of the family of
Kohath," etc., are the superscription to [Ch1
6:54-61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md), and together with the
confirmatory clause, "for to him the (first) lot had fallen," are a
repetition of [Jos 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#010.md), where,
however, ראשׁנה is found after הגּורל, and has perhaps been here dropped
out.

[Ch1 6:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#055.md)

(6:40-41). [Ch1 6:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#055.md) and [Ch1
6:56](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#056.md) correspond almost verbally with
[Jos 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#011.md) and [Jos
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#012.md), as [Ch1
6:57-60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#057.md) also do with [Jos
21:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013.md). As we have already in our
remarks on Joshua commented upon the whole catalogue, it will not be
necessary to do more here than to group together the errors and defects
of our text.

[Ch1 6:57-60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#057.md)

(6:42-45). The plural המּקלט ערי is incorrect, for only one of the
cities thereafter named, viz., Hebron, was a city of refuge for
homicides, and in [Jos 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013.md) it is
correctly written מקלט עיר. After יתּיר retfA the usual addition
ואת־מגרשׁיה is omitted, [Ch1 6:59](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#059.md).
Before Bethshemesh the name Juttah has been lost, and before Geba ([Ch1
6:60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#060).md) the name Gibeon, so that only
eleven cities are mentioned, but the sum is rightly given as thirteen.
Instead of the name חילן, [Ch1 6:58](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#058.md),
there is found in [Jos 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#015.md) and [Jos
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#051.md) חלן; instead of עין, [Jos
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#016.md), we have in [Ch1
6:59](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#059.md) the more correct name עשׁן; and
the name עלּמת, [Ch1 6:60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#060.md), is in [Jos
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#018.md) עלמון.

[Ch1 6:61-63](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md)

(6:46-48). Summary statements of the number of cities which the
remaining Kohathites, the Gershonites, and the Merarites received in the
domains of the various tribes, corresponding to [Jos
21:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#005.md). In [Ch1
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md) occurs a hiatus; between המּטּה
and ממּחצית the words "Ephraim and of the tribe of Dan and" have been
omitted. In [Ch1 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#048.md) the words "of
the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan" are quite intelligible without חצי,
which is found in Joshua.

[Ch1 6:64-65](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#064.md)

(6:49-50). [Ch1 6:64](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#064.md) and [Ch1
6:65](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#065.md) are not here in their proper
place; for their contents show that they should be in the middle of the
thirty-ninth verse, after the general superscription, and before the
words "for the sons of Aaron." They are found also in [Jos
21:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#008.md), as a superscription before the
enumeration by name of the cities assigned to the priests; but how the
confusion has arisen in our text cannot be certainly ascertained.
Bertheau thinks "the wish to make mention of the cities of the
high-priestly family at the beginning of the enumeration, has induced
the author of the Chronicle to communicate the introductory remarks
belonging to the lists of cities with other statements as to the tribal
domains, only after the enumeration of the cities of the sons of Aaron."
By that supposition the position of [Ch1
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md) is certainly explained, but not
that of [Ch1 6:64](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#064.md) and [Ch1
6:65](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#065.md); for even with the supposed
desire, [Ch1 6:64](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#064.md) and [Ch1
6:65](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#065.md) should have been placed before
[Ch1 6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md). But besides, this, the
clause וגו אהרן לבני in [Ch1 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md)
neither has anything to connect it with the preceding superscription nor
a verb; and the subject of ויּתּנוּ, [Ch1
6:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#055.md), is also wanting. That which was
missed before [Ch1 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md) and in [Ch1
6:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#055.md) is contained in [Ch1
6:64](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#064.md) and [Ch1
6:65](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#065.md); whence it is manifest that [Ch1
6:64](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#064.md) and [Ch1
6:65](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#065.md) ought to stand before [Ch1
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md), and have by some inexplicable
accident fallen out of their proper place, and have come into an
unsuitable position after [Ch1 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#063.md).
The plurals יקראוּ and שׁמות, instead of the singulars יקרא and שׁם, as
in [Jos 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#009.md), bring the words into
more manifest correspondence with the circumstances, since the subject
of יקראוּ, "the sons of Israel," may be easily supplied from [Ch1
6:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#053.md), and many names of cities are
mentioned. The masc. אתהם instead of the fem. אתהן is probably only an
oversight. With [Ch1 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#066.md) begins the
enumeration of the cities of the other Levitic families only summarily
given in [Ch1 6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md), which forms a very
suitable continuation of [Ch1 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#063.md).

[Ch1 6:66-70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#066.md)

(6:51-55). The cities of the remaining Kohathites; cf. [Jos
21:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#020.md). For וּממּשׁפּחות we must
read וּלמשׁפּחות, for the preposition מן gives no suitable sense: it is
never used to introduce a subject. The sense is, "as regards the
families of the sons of Kohath, the cities of their dominion in the
tribe of Ephraim were (the following). They gave them." The plur. המּקלט
ערי instead of the sing., as in [Ch1
6:57](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#057.md). As to the four cities of the
tribe of Ephraim, [Ch1 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#052.md), [Ch1
6:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#053.md), see on [Jos
21:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#021.md), where instead of יקמעם we
find the name קבצים. Before [Ch1 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md)
a whole verse has been lost, which was as follows: "And of the tribe of
Dan, Eltekeh and her pastures, Gibbethon and her pastures;" cf. [Jos
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#023.md). Then follows [Ch1
6:69](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#069.md), which contains the names of the
two other cities of the tribe of Dan. In [Ch1
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070.md) we have the names of the cities
of half Manasseh, Aner and Bileam, i.e., Ibleam ([Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011).md), correctly given; but the names
Taanach and Gath-rimmon in [Jos 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025.md)
are incorrect, and have been inserted through a transcriber's error,
arising from the copyist's eye having wandered to the preceding verse.
The singular למשׁפּחת, [Ch1 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070.md), is
incorrect; and the plural למשׁפּחות is to be substituted (as in [Ch1
6:66](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#066).md). The words וגו לבני למשׁפּחות
are a subscription, which corresponds to להם ויּתּנוּ in [Ch1
6:67](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#067.md).

[Ch1 6:71-76](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#071.md)

(6:56-61). The cities of the Gershonites; cf. [Jos
21:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#027.md). "To the sons of Gershon
(they gave) out of the family of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan and
Ashtaroth;" see on [Jos 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#027.md). In [Ch1
6:72](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#072.md), קדשׁ is a mistake for קשׁיון,
[Jos 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#028.md) (see on [Jos
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#020).md); in [Ch1
6:73](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#073.md), ראמות for the more correct
ירמות, [Jos 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#029.md), a city which was
also called רמת, [Jos 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#021.md), or had
been so called originally; and ענם for עין־גּנּים (Josh.), as the city
is called also in [Jos 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#021.md). It
cannot be determined whether ענם is a transcriber's error, or another
name for עין־גּנּים. In [Ch1 6:74](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#074.md),
משׁל (which should perhaps be pointed משׁל) is a contracted form of
משׁאל, Josh. 31:30; [Jos 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026.md); and in
[Ch1 6:75](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#075.md), חוּקק is probably an error
for חלקת, [Jos 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#031.md); [Jos
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#025.md), occasioned by its being
confounded with חקּק in the tribe of Naphtali, [Jos
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034.md). In [Ch1
6:76](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#076.md) the fact that Kadesh was a city
of refuge is not mentioned, as it is in [Jos
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032.md). חמּון is a shortened form of
חמּות־דּאר, [Jos 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032.md); for this city
is called in [Jos 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035.md) חמּת, from the
warm springs in the neighbourhood. Finally, Kirjathaim is contracted in
[Jos 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032.md) into קרתּן.

[Ch1 6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077.md)

(6:62). The cities of the Merarites; cf. [Jos
21:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034.md). "To the sons of Merari the
remaining," sc. Levites. In [Jos 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034.md)
it is more clearly put הנּותרים הלויּם, for the remaining Merarites are
not spoken of. What is intended to be said is, that the Merarites, alone
of the Levites, are still to be mentioned. In the tribe of Zebulun, in
[Ch1 6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077.md), only two cities are named,
Rimmon and Tabor, instead of the four - Jokneam, Karthah, Dimnah, and
Nahalal - in [Jos 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034.md). The first two
names have been dropped out of our text, while רמּונו corresponds to the
דּמנה of Joshua, but is a more correct reading, since רמּון occurs in
[Jos 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013.md) among the cities of
Zebulun, while דּמנה is not mentioned; and תּבור must consequently
correspond to the נהלל in Joshua. Nahalal occurs in [Jos
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md) and in [Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md), in the form Nahalol, among the
cities of Zebulun, and consequently seems to be the more correct name,
but has not yet been pointed out with certainty, since its
identification with Mlul (Arabic m‛lûl), south-west from Nazareth, rests
upon very slender foundation. Bertheau's conjecture that the name of the
city has been dropped out, and that of a more exact description of its
position, perhaps תּבר כּסלת גּבוּל על, [Jos
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012.md), only the last word has
remained, is no more probable than that of Movers, that instead of the
name of the city, only the neighbourhood in which the city lay, viz.,
Mount Tabor, is mentioned.

[Ch1 6:78-79](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#078.md)

(6:63-64). [Ch1 6:78-79](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#078.md) are wanting in
some editions of the book of Joshua, but are found in many MSS and in
the oldest printed copies, and have been omitted only by an oversight;
see on [Jos 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#030.md)., note 2. As to the
city Bezer, see on [Deu 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043.md); and
concerning Jahzah, Kedemoth, Mephaath, vide on [Jos
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018.md).

[Ch1 6:80-81](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#080.md)

(6:65-66). For Ramoth in Gilead, a city of refuge ([Jos
21:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036).md), and Mahanaim, see on [Jos
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md); and for Heshbon and Jazer, on
[Num 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028.md), [Num
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#032.md).
