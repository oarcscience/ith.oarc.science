X. History of Jacob - Genesis 37-50Its Substance and Character

The history (tholedoth) of Isaac commenced with the founding of his
house by the birth of his sons (p. 171); but Jacob was abroad when his
sons were born, and had not yet entered into undisputed possession of
his inheritance. Hence his tholedoth only commence with his return to
his father's tent and his entrance upon the family possessions, and
merely embrace the history of his life as patriarch of the house which
he founded. In this period of his life, indeed, his sons, especially
Joseph and Judah, stand in the foreground, so that "Joseph might be
described as the moving principle of the following history." But for all
that, Jacob remains the head of the house, and the centre around whom
the whole revolves. This section is divided by the removal of Jacob to
Egypt, into the period of his residence in Canaan (Gen 37-45), and the
close of his life in Goshen (Gen 46-50). The first period is occupied
with the events which prepared the way for, and eventually occasioned,
his migration into Egypt. The way was prepared, directly by the sale of
Joseph (Gen 37), indirectly by the alliance of Judah with the Canaanites
(Gen 38), which endangered the divine call of Israel, inasmuch as this
showed the necessity for a temporary removal of the sons of Israel from
Canaan. The way was opened by the wonderful career of Joseph in Egypt,
his elevation from slavery and imprisonment to be the ruler over the
whole of Egypt (Gen 39-41). And lastly, the migration was occasioned by
the famine in Canaan, which rendered it necessary for Jacob's sons to
travel into Egypt to buy corn, and, whilst it led to Jacob's recovery of
the son he had mourned for as dead, furnished an opportunity for Joseph
to welcome his family into Egypt (Gen 42-45). The second period
commences with the migration of Jacob into Egypt, and his settlement in
the land of Goshen (Gen 46-47:27). It embraces the patriarch's closing
years, his last instructions respecting his burial in Canaan ([Gen
47:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#028).md), his adoption of Joseph's
sons, and the blessing given to his twelve sons (Gen 49), and extends to
his burial and Joseph's death (Gen 50).

Now if we compare this period of the patriarchal history with the
previous ones, viz., those of Isaac and Abraham, it differs from them
most in the absence of divine revelations-in the fact, that from the
time of the patriarch's entrance upon the family inheritance to the day
of his death, there was only one other occasion on which God appeared to
him in a dream, viz., in Beersheba, on the border of the promised land,
when he had prepared to go with his whole house into Egypt: the God of
his father then promised him the increase of his seed in Egypt into a
great nation, and their return to Canaan ([Gen
46:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#002).md). This fact may be easily
explained on the ground, that the end of the divine manifestations had
been already attained; that in Jacob's house with his twelve sons the
foundation was laid for the development of the promised nation; and that
the time had come, in which the chosen family was to grow into a
nation-a process for which they needed, indeed, the blessing and
protection of God, but no special revelations, so long at least as this
growth into a nation took its natural course. That course was not
interrupted, but rather facilitated by the removal into Egypt. But as
Canaan had been assigned to the patriarchs as the land of their
pilgrimage, and promised to their seed for a possession after it had
become a nation; when Jacob was compelled to leave this land, his faith
in the promise of God might have been shaken, if God had not appeared to
him as he departed, to promise him His protection in the foreign land,
and assure him of the fulfilment of His promises. More than this the
house of Israel did not need to know, as to the way by which God would
lead them, especially as Abraham had already received a revelation from
the Lord ([Gen 15:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013).md).

In perfect harmony with the character of the time thus commencing for
Jacob-Israel, is the use of the names of God in this last section of
Genesis: viz., the fact, that whilst in Gen 37 (the sale of Joseph) the
name of God is not met with at all, in Gen 38 and 39 we find the name of
Jehovah nine times and Elohim only once ([Gen
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009).md), and that in circumstances in
which Jehovah would have been inadmissible; and after [Gen
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#001.md), the name Jehovah almost entirely
disappears, occurring only once in Gen 40-50 ([Gen
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018), where Jacob uses it.md), whereas
Elohim is used eighteen times and Ha-Elohim seven, not to mention such
expressions as "your God" ([Gen
43:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#023).md), or "the God of his, or your
father" ([Gen 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md), [Gen
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003).md). So long as the attention is
confined to this numerical proportion of Jehovah, and Elohim or
Ha-Elohim, it must remain "a difficult enigma." But when we look at the
way in which these names are employed, we find the actual fact to be,
that in Gen 38 and 39 the writer mentions God nine times, and calls Him
Jehovah, and that in Gen 40-50 he only mentions God twice, and then
calls Him Elohim ([Gen 46:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001).md),
although the God of salvation, i.e., Jehovah, is intended. In every
other instance in which God is referred to in Gen 40-50, it is always by
the persons concerned: either Pharaoh ([Gen
41:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038).md), or Joseph and his brethren
([Gen 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#008.md); [Gen
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#016.md), [Gen
41:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#051.md), etc., Elohim; and [Gen
41:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#025.md), [Gen
41:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#028.md), [Gen
41:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#032), etc., Ha-Elohim.md), or by Jacob
([Gen 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#011.md), [Gen
48:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020), Elohim.md). Now the
circumstance that the historian speaks of God nine times in Gen 38-39
and only twice in Gen 40-50 is explained by the substance of the
history, which furnished no particular occasion for this in the last
eleven chapters. But the reason why he does not name Jehovah in Gen
40-50 as in Gen 38-39, but speaks of the "God of his (Jacob's) father
Isaac," in [Gen 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md), and directly
afterwards of Elohim ([Gen 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#002).md),
could hardly be that the periphrasis "the God of his father" seemed more
appropriate than the simple name Jehovah, since Jacob offered sacrifice
at Beersheba to the God who appeared to his father, and to whom Isaac
built an altar there, and this God (Elohim) then appeared to him in a
dream and renewed the promise of his fathers. As the historian uses a
periphrasis of the name Jehovah, to point out the internal connection
between what Jacob did and experienced at Beersheba and what his father
experienced there; so Jacob also, both in the blessing with which he
sends his sons the second time to Egypt ([Gen
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014).md) and at the adoption of Joseph's
sons ([Gen 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#003).md), uses the name El
Shaddai, and in his blessings on Joseph's sons ([Gen
43:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#015).md) and on Joseph himself ([Gen
49:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024).md) employs rhetorical
periphrases for the name Jehovah, because Jehovah had manifested Himself
not only to him ([Gen 35:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#011).md), but
also to his fathers Abraham and Isaac ([Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md) and [Gen
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#003).md) as El Shaddai, and had proved
Himself to be the Almighty, "the God who fed him," "the Mighty One of
Jacob," "the Shepherd and Rock of Israel." In these set discourses the
titles of God here mentioned were unquestionably more significant and
impressive than the simple name Jehovah. and when Jacob speaks of Elohim
only, not of Jehovah, in [Gen 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#011.md),
[Gen 48:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020.md), the Elohim in [Gen
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#011.md) and [Gen
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#021.md) may be easily explained from the
antithesis of Jacob to both man and God, and in [Gen
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020.md) from the words themselves, which
contain a common and, so to speak, a stereotyped saying. Wherever the
thought required the name Jehovah as the only appropriate one, there
Jacob used this name, as [Gen 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md)
will prove. But that name would have been quit unsuitable in the mouth
of Pharaoh in [Gen 41:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038.md), in the
address of Joseph to the prisoners ([Gen
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#008).md) and to Pharaoh ([Gen
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#016.md), [Gen
41:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#025.md), [Gen
41:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#028.md), [Gen
41:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#032).md), and in his conversation with
his brethren before he made himself known ([Gen
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#018.md); [Gen
43:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#029).md), and also in the appeal of
Judah to Joseph as an unknown Egyptian officer of state ([Gen
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#016).md). In the meantime the brethren
of Joseph also speak to one another of Elohim ([Gen
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#028).md); and Joseph not only sees in
the birth of his sons merely a gift of Elohim ([Gen
41:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#051.md); [Gen
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#009).md), but in the solemn moment in
which he makes himself known to his brethren ([Gen
45:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#005).md) he speaks of Elohim alone:
"Elohim did send me before you to preserve life" ([Gen
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#005).md); and even upon his death-bed he
says, "I die, and Elohim will surely visit you and bring you out of this
land" ([Gen 50:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#024).md). But the reason
of this is not difficult to discover, and is no other than the
following: Joseph, like his brethren, did not clearly discern the ways
of the Lord in the wonderful changes of his life; and his brethren,
though they felt that the trouble into which they were brought before
the unknown ruler of Egypt was a just punishment from God for their
crime against Joseph, did not perceive that by the sale of their brother
they had sinned not only against Elohim (God the Creator and Judge of
men), but against Jehovah the covenant God of their father. They had not
only sold their brother, but in their brother they had cast out a member
of the seed promised and given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the
fellowship of the chosen family, and sinned against the God of salvation
and His promises. But this aspect of their crime was still hidden from
them, so that they could not speak of Jehovah. In the same way, Joseph
regarded the wonderful course of his life as a divine arrangement for
the preservation or rescue of his family, and he was so far acquainted
with the promises of God, that he regarded it as a certainty, that
Israel would be led out of Egypt, especially after the last wish
expressed by Jacob. But this did not involve so full and clear an
insight into the ways of Jehovah, as to lead Joseph to recognise in his
own career a special appointment of the covenant God, and to describe it
as a gracious work of Jehovah.

(Note: The very fact that the author of Genesis, who wrote in the light
of the further development and fuller revelation of the ways of the Lord
with Joseph and the whole house of Jacob, represents the career of
Joseph as a gracious interposition of Jehovah (Gen 39), and yet makes
Joseph himself speak of Elohim as arranging the whole, is by no means an
unimportant testimony to the historical fidelity and truth of the
narrative; of which further proofs are to be found in the faithful and
exact representation of the circumstances, manners, and customs of
Egypt, as Hengstenberg has proved in his Egypt and the Books of Moses,
from a comparison of these accounts of Joseph's life with ancient
document and monuments connected with this land.)

The disappearance of the name Jehovah, therefore, is to be explained,
partly from the fact that previous revelations and acts of grace had
given rise to other phrases expressive of the idea of Jehovah, which not
only served as substitutes for this name of the covenant God, but in
certain circumstances were much more appropriate; and partly from the
fact that the sons of Jacob, including Joseph, did not so distinctly
recognise in their course the saving guidance of the covenant God, as to
be able to describe it as the work of Jehovah. This imperfect insight,
however, is intimately connected with the fact that the direct
revelations of God had ceased; and that Joseph, although chosen by God
to be the preserver of the house of Israel and the instrument in
accomplishing His plans of salvation, was separated at a very early
period from the fellowship of his father's house, and formally
naturalized in Egypt, and though endowed with the supernatural power to
interpret dreams, was not favoured, as Daniel afterwards was in the
Chaldaean court, with visions or revelations of God. Consequently we
cannot place Joseph on a level with the three patriarchs, nor assent to
the statement, that "as the noblest blossom of the patriarchal life is
seen in Joseph, as in him the whole meaning of the patriarchal life is
summed up and fulfilled, so in Christ we see the perfect blossom and
sole fulfilment of the whole of the Old Testament dispensation" (Kurtz,
Old Covenant ii. 95), as being either correct or scriptural, so far as
the first portion is concerned. For Joseph was not a medium of salvation
in the same way as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was indeed a
benefactor, not only to his brethren and the whole house of Israel, but
also to the Egyptians; but salvation, i.e., spiritual help and culture,
he neither brought to the Gentiles nor to the house of Israel. In
Jacob's blessing he is endowed with the richest inheritance of the
first-born in earthly things; but salvation is to reach the nations
through Judah. We may therefore without hesitation look upon the history
of Joseph as a "type of the pathway of the Church, not of Jehovah only,
but also of Christ, from lowliness to exaltation, from slavery to
liberty, from suffering to glory" (Delitzsch); we may also, so far as
the history of Israel is a type of the history of Christ and His Church,
regard the life of Joseph, as believing commentators of all centuries
have done, as a type of the life of Christ, and use these typical traits
as aids to progress in the knowledge of salvation; but that we may not
be seduced into typological trifling, we must not overlook the fact,
that neither Joseph nor his career is represented, either by the
prophets or by Christ and His apostles, as typical of Christ, - in
anything like the same way, for example, as the guidance of Israel into
and out of Egypt ([Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md) cf. [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015).md), and other events and persons in
the history of Israel.

[Genesis 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 37:1</span></span>

[Gen 37:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001.md)

The statement in [Gen 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001.md), which
introduces the tholedoth of Jacob, "And Jacob dwelt in the land of his
father's pilgrimage, in the land of Canaan," implies that Jacob had now
entered upon his father's inheritance, and carries on the patriarchal
pilgrim-life in Canaan, the further development of which was determined
by the wonderful career of Joseph. This strange and eventful career of
Joseph commenced when he was 17 years old. The notice of his age at the
commencement of the narrative which follows, is introduced with
reference to the principal topic in it, viz., the sale of Joseph, which
was to prepare the way, according to the wonderful counsel of God, for
the fulfilment of the divine revelation to Abraham respecting the future
history of his seed ([Gen 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013)..md).
While feeding the flock with his brethren, and, as he was young, with
the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, who were nearer his age than the sons of
Leah, he brought an evil report of them to his father (רעה intentionally
indefinite, connected with דּבּתם without an article). The words נער
והוּא, "and he a lad," are subordinate to the main clause: they are not
to be rendered, however, "he was a lad with the sons," but, "as he was
young, he fed the flock with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah."

[Gen 37:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#003.md)

"Israel (Jacob) loved Joseph more than all his (other) sons, because he
was born in his old age," as the first-fruits of the beloved Rachel
(Benjamin was hardly a year old at this time). And he made him פּסּים
כּתנת: a long coat with sleeves (χιτὼν ἀστραγάλειος, Aqu., or
ἀστραγαλωτός, lxx at [Sa2 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#018.md),
tunica talaris, Vulg. ad Sam.), i.e., an upper coat reaching to the
wrists and ankles, such as noblemen and kings' daughters wore, not "a
coat of many colours" ("bunter Rock," as Luther renders it, from the
χιτῶνα ποικίλον, tunicam polymitam, of the lxx and Vulgate). This
partiality made Joseph hated by his brethren; so that they could not
"speak peaceably unto him," i.e., ask him how he was, offer him the
usual salutation, "Peace be with thee."

[Genesis 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 37:5</span></span>

This hatred was increased when Joseph told them of two dreams that he
had had: viz., that as they were binding sheaves in the field, his sheaf
"stood and remained standing," but their sheaves placed themselves round
it and bowed down to it; and that the sun (his father), and the moon
(his mother, "not Leah, but Rachel, who was neither forgotten nor
lost"), and eleven stars (his eleven brethren) bowed down before him.
These dreams pointed in an unmistakeable way to the supremacy of Joseph;
the first to supremacy over his brethren, the second over the whole
house of Israel. The repetition seemed to establish the thing as certain
(cf. [Gen 41:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#032).md); so that not only did
his brethren hate him still more "on account of his dreams and words"
([Gen 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#008).md), i.e., the substance of
the dreams and the open interpretation of them, and become jealous and
envious, but his father gave him a sharp reproof for the second, though
he preserved the matter, i.e., retained it in his memory (שׁמר lxx
διετήρησε, cf. συνετήρει, [Luk 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#019).md).
The brothers with their ill-will could not see anything in the creams
but the suggestions of his own ambition and pride of heart; and even the
father, notwithstanding his partiality, was grieved by the second dream.
The dreams are not represented as divine revelations; yet they are not
to be regarded as pure flights of fancy from an ambitious heart, but as
the presentiments of deep inward feelings, which were not produced
without some divine influence being exerted upon Joseph's mind, and
therefore were of prophetic significance, though they were not inspired
directly by God, inasmuch as the purposes of God were still to remain
hidden from the eyes of men for the saving good of all concerned.

[Genesis 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 37:12</span></span>

In a short time the hatred of Joseph's brethren grew into a crime. On
one occasion, when they were feeding their flock at a distance from
Hebron, in the neighbourhood of Shechem (Nablus, in the plain of
Mukhnah), and Joseph who was sent thither by Jacob to inquire as to the
welfare (shalom, valetudo) of the brethren and their flocks, followed
them to Dothain or Dothan, a place 12 Roman miles to the north of
Samaria (Sebaste), towards the plain of Jezreel, they formed the
malicious resolution to put him, "this dreamer," to death, and throw him
into one of the pits, i.e., cisterns, and then to tell (his father) that
a wild beast had slain him, and so to bring his dreams to nought.

[Genesis 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 37:21</span></span>

Reuben, who was the eldest son, and therefore specially responsible for
his younger brother, opposed this murderous proposal. He dissuaded his
brethren from killing Joseph (נפשׁ פ הכּה ), and advised them to throw
him "into this pit in the desert," i.e., into a dry pit that was near.
As Joseph would inevitably perish even in that pit, their malice was
satisfied; but Reuben intended to take Joseph out again, and restore him
to his father. As soon, therefore, as Joseph arrived, they took off his
coat with sleeves and threw him into the pit, which happened to be dry.

[Genesis 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 37:25</span></span>

Reuben had saved Joseph's life indeed by his proposal; but his intention
to send him back to his father was frustrated. For as soon as the
brethren sat down to eat, after the deed was performed, they saw a
company of Ishmaelites from Gilead coming along the road which leads
from Beisan past Jenin (Rob. Pal. iii. 155) and through the plain of
Dothan to the great caravan road that runs from Damascus by Lejun
(Legio, Megiddo), Ramleh, and Gaza to Egypt (Rob. iii. 27, 178). The
caravan drew near, laden with spices: viz., נכאת, gum-tragacanth; צרי,
balsam, for which Gilead was celebrated ([Gen
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#011.md); [Jer
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022.md); [Jer
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011).md); and לט, ladanum, the fragrant
resin of the cistus-rose. Judah seized the opportunity to propose to his
brethren to sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites. "What profit have we," he
said, "that we slay our brother and conceal his blood? Come, let us sell
him to the Ishmaelites; and our hand, let it not lay hold of him (sc.,
to slay him), for he is our brother, our flesh." Reuben wished to
deliver Joseph entirely from his brothers' malice. Judah also wished to
save his life, though not from brotherly love so much as from the
feeling of horror, which was not quite extinct within him, at incurring
the guilt of fratricide; but he would still like to get rid of him, that
his dreams might not come true. Judah, like his brethren, was probably
afraid that their father might confer upon Joseph the rights of the
first-born, and so make him lord over them. His proposal was a welcome
one. When the Arabs passed by, the brethren fetched Joseph out of the
pit and sold him to the Ishmaelites, who took him into Egypt. The
different names given to the traders - viz., Ishmaelites ([Gen
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025.md), [Gen
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#027.md), and [Gen
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028).md), Midianites ([Gen
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028).md), and Medanites ([Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036).md) - do not show that the account
has been drawn from different legends, but that these tribes were often
confounded, from the fact that they resembled one another so closely,
not only in their common descent from Abraham ([Gen
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#015.md) and [Gen
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002).md), but also in the similarity of
their mode of life and their constant change of abode, that strangers
could hardly distinguish them, especially when they appeared not as
tribes but as Arabian merchants, such as they are here described as
being: "Midianitish men, merchants." That descendants of Abraham should
already be met with in this capacity is by no means strange, if we
consider that 150 years had passed by since Ishmael's dismissal from his
father's house, - a period amply sufficient for his descendants to have
grown through marriage into a respectable tribe. The price, "twenty
(sc., shekels) of silver," was the price which Moses afterwards fixed as
the value of a boy between 5 and 20 ([Lev
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#005).md), the average price of a slave
being 30 shekels ([Exo 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032).md). But the
Ishmaelites naturally wanted to make money by the transaction.

[Genesis 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 37:29</span></span>

The business was settled in Reuben's absence; probably because his
brethren suspected that he intended to rescue Joseph. When he came to
the pit and found Joseph gone, he rent his clothes (a sign of intense
grief on the part of the natural man) and exclaimed: "The boy is no
more, and I, whither shall I go!" - how shall I account to his father
for his disappearance! But the brothers were at no loss; they dipped
Joseph's coat in the blood of a goat and sent it to his father, with the
message, "We have found this; see whether it is thy son's coat or not."
Jacob recognised the coat at once, and mourned bitterly in mourning
clothes (שׂק) for his son, whom he supposed to have been devoured and
destroyed by a wild beast (טרף טרף inf. abs. of Kal before Pual, as an
indication of undoubted certainty), and refused all comfort from his
children, saying, "No (כּי immo, elliptical: Do not attempt to comfort
me, for) I will go down mourning into Sheol to my son." Sheol denotes
the place where departed souls are gathered after death; it is an
infinitive form from שׁאל to demand, the demanding, applied to the place
which inexorably summons all men into its shade (cf. [Pro
30:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md); [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md); [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005).md). How should his sons comfort him,
when they were obliged to cover their wickedness with the sin of lying
and hypocrisy, and when even Reuben, although at first beside himself at
the failure of his plan, had not courage enough to disclose his
brothers' crime?

But Joseph, while his father was mourning, was sold by the Midianites to
Potiphar, the chief of Pharaoh's trabantes, to be first of all brought
low, according to the wonderful counsel of God, and then to be exalted
as ruler in Egypt, before whom his brethren would bow down, and as the
saviour of the house of Israel. The name Potiphar is a contraction of
Poti Pherah ([Gen 41:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#050).md); the lxx
render both Πετεφρής or Πετεφρῆ (vid., [Gen
41:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#050)). סריס (eunuch.md) is used here, as
in [Sa1 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#015.md) and in most of the
passages of the Old Testament, for courtier or chamberlain, without
regard to the primary meaning, as Potiphar was married. "Captain of the
guard" (lit., captain of the slaughterers, i.e., the executioners),
commanding officer of the royal body-guard, who executed the capital
sentences ordered by the king, as was also the case with the Chaldeans
([Kg2 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md); [Jer
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009.md); [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md). See my Commentary on the Books
of Kings, vol. i. pp. 35, 36, Eng. Tr.).
