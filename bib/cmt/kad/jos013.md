II\. Division of the Land of Canaan Among the Tribes of Israel - Joshua
13-24

The distribution of the conquered land among the Israelites is
introduced by the command of the Lord to Joshua to enter upon this work,
now that he was old, although different portions of land were still
unconquered ([Jos 13:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001)); and to this
there is appended a description of the land on the east of the Jordan
which had already been conquered and divided among the two tribes and a
half (Josh 13:8-33). The distribution of the land on this side among the
nine tribes and a half is related in its historical order; so that not
only are the territories assigned by lot to the different tribes
described according to their respective boundaries and towns, but the
historical circumstances connected with the division and allotting of
the land are also introduced into the description. These historical
accounts are so closely connected with the geographical descriptions of
the territory belonging to the different tribes, that the latter alone
will explain the course pursued in the distribution of the land, and the
various ways in which the different territories are described (see the
remarks on [Jos 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001)). For example, in
the account of the inheritance which fell to the lot of the tribes of
Judah and Benjamin, not only are the boundaries most carefully traced,
but the towns are also enumerated one by one (Josh 15 and Josh
18:11-28); whereas in the tribe of Joseph (Ephraim and half Manasseh)
the list of the towns is altogether wanting ([Jos
16:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001) and 17); and in the
possessions of the other tribes, either towns alone are mentioned, as in
the case of Simeon and Dan ([Jos
19:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001), [Jos
19:40-48](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040)), or the boundaries and towns
are mixed up together, but both of them given incompletely, as in the
case of Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali ([Jos
19:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010), [Jos
19:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#017), [Jos
19:24-31](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#024), [Jos
19:32-39](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#032)). This incompleteness,
particularly in the territories of the tribes mentioned last, may be
explained from the fact, that in northern Canaan there were still very
many tracts of land in the hands of the Canaanites, and the Israelites
had not acquired a sufficiently exact or complete knowledge of the
country, either through Joshua's campaign in the north, or through the
men who were sent out to survey the northern land before it was divided
([Jos 18:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#004)), to enable them to
prepare a complete account of the boundaries and towns at the very
outset. In the same way, too, we may explain the absence of the list of
towns in the case of the tribes of Ephraim and half Manasseh-namely,
from the fact that a large portion of the territory assigned to the
tribe of Joseph was still in the possession of the Canaanites (vid.,
[Jos 17:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014)); whilst the omission of
any account of the boundaries in the case of Simeon and Dan is
attributable to the circumstance that the former received its
inheritance within the tribe of Judah, and the latter between Judah and
Ephraim, whilst the space left for the Danites was so small, that
Ephraim and Judah had to gave up to them some of the town in their own
territory. Thus the very inequality and incompleteness of the
geographical accounts of the possessions of the different tribes
decidedly favour the conclusion, that they are the very lists which were
drawn up at the time when Joshua divided the land. There is nothing to
preclude this supposition in the fact that several towns occur with
different names, e.g., Beth-shemesh and Ir-shemesh ([Jos
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010); [Jos
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#041); [Jos
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#016)), Madmannah and Beth-marcaboth,
Sansanna and Hazar-susa ([Jos 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031);
[Jos 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#005)), Shilchim and Sharuchen
([Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032); [Jos
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#006)), Remeth and Jarmuth ([Jos
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#021); [Jos
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#029)), or in other smaller
differences. For variations of this kind may be sufficiently explained
from the fact that such places were known by two different names, which
could be used promiscuously; whilst in other cases the difference in the
name amounts to nothing more than a different mode of writing or
pronouncing it: e.g., Kattah and Kartah ([Jos
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015); [Jos
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034)), Eshtemoh and Eshtemoa ([Jos
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#050); [Jos
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#014)), Baalah and Balah ([Jos
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#029); [Jos
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#003)); or simply in the contraction of
a composite name, such as Ramoth in Gilead for Ramoth-mizpeh ([Jos
21:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036); [Jos
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026)); Bealoth and Baalath-beer ([Jos
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024); [Jos
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#008)), Lebaoth and Beth-lebaoth ([Jos
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032); [Jos
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#006)), Hammath and Hammoth-dor ([Jos
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035); [Jos
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032)).

If the author, on the other hand, had drawn from later sources, or had
simply given the results of later surveys, as Knobel supposes, there can
be no doubt that much greater uniformity would be found in the different
lists.

(Note: The arguments employed by Knobel in support of his assertion,
consist on the one had of inconclusive and incorrect assertions, and are
founded on the other hand upon arbitrary assumptions. In the first
place, for example, he asserts that "a large number of towns are omitted
from the lists, which were within the boundaries mentioned and were in
existence in the very earliest times, viz., in the south, Tamar ([Gen
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007)), Arad ([Num
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001)), Atbach, Rachal, Aroer, and
Siphamoth ([Sa1 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#028).), Gerar (Gen.
20:26); in the Shephelah, Gaza, Askalon, Gath, Ashdod, Jabne, and Joppa
(see [Jos 15:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#045).); in Benjamin,
Michmash and Nob ([Sa1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002)., [Jos
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#019)); in the north, Aphek, Lassaron,
Madon, Shimron-meron, and Merom ([Jos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#005); [Jos
12:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018)), as well as Meroz and
Ajjalon ([Jdg 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#023); [Jdg
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#012)); and these with other places
would assuredly not be wanting here, if Joshua and his associates had
distributed the towns as well as the land, and furnished our author with
the lists." But it would be difficult to bring forward the proofs of
this, since Knobel himself acknowledges that there are gaps in the lists
which have come down to us, some of which can be proved to be the fault
of the copyists, - such, for example, as the want of a whole section
after [Jos 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#019) and [Jos
21:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#035). Moreover, the Philistine towns
of Ashdod and Gaza are really mentioned in [Jos
15:46](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#046), and the others at all events
hinted at; whereas Knobel first of all arbitrarily rejects [Jos
15:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#045) from the text, in order that
he may afterwards be able to speak of it as omitted. Again, with many of
the places mentioned as omissions, such as Atbach, Rachal, Siphamoth,
etc., it is very questionable whether they were towns at all in Joshua's
time, or, at all events, such towns as we should expect to find
mentioned. And lastly, not only are no catalogues of towns given at all
in the case of Ephraim and Manasseh, but we have only imperfect
catalogues in the case of Zebulun, Asher, and Naphtali; and, as we have
already observed, this incompleteness and these gaps can be
satisfactorily explained from the historical circumstances under which
the allotment of the land took place. Secondly, Knobel also maintains,
that "Joshua's conquests did not extend to the Lebanon ([Jos
13:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004)), and yet the author mentions
towns of the Asherites there ([Jos
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028), [Jos
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030)): Bethel was not taken till
after the time of Joshua ([Jdg 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#022).),
and this was also the case with Jerusalem ([Jdg
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008)), and in the earliest times of the
judges they had no Hebrew inhabitants ([Jdg
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#012)), yet the author speaks of both
places as towns of the Benjamites ([Jos
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#022), [Jos
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028)); Jericho and Ai were lying in
ruins in Joshua's time ([Jos 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#024);
[Jos 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028)), yet they are spoken of
here as towns of Benjamin that had been rebuilt ([Jos
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021), [Jos
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023)); it is just the same with Hazor
in Naphtali ([Jos 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#013); [Jos
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#036)); and according to [Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001), [Jdg
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#010)., Hebron and Debir also were not
conquered till after Joshua's time." But all this rests (1) upon the
false assumption, that the only towns which Joshua distributed by lot
among the tribes of Israel were those which he permanently conquered,
whereas, according to the command of God, he divided the whole land
among the Israelites, whether it was conquered or not; (2) upon the
erroneous opinion, that the towns which had been destroyed, such as
Jericho, Ai, and Hazor, were allotted to the Israelites as "rebuilt,"
whereas there is not a word about this in the text. It is just the same
with the arguments used by Knobel in proof of the composition of Josh
13-21 from three different documents. The material discrepancies have
been forced upon the text, as we shall see when we come to an
explanation of the passages in question; and the verbal differences
prove nothing more than that the geographical account of the boundaries
and towns contains no allusion to the priesthood, to sacrifice, or to
certain other things which no one would think of looking for here.)

[Joshua 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 13:1</span></span>

Introduction to the Division of the Land. - [Jos
13:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001). Command of the Lord to Joshua
to distribute the land of Canaan by lot among the nine tribes and a
half. [Jos 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001) contains only the
commencement of the divine command; the conclusion follows in [Jos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007). [Jos
13:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002) form a parenthesis of several
clauses, defining the last clause of [Jos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001) more fully. When Joshua had grown
old, the Lord commanded him, as he was advanced in years, and there was
still much land to be taken, to divide "this land," i.e., the whole of
the land of Canaan, for an inheritance to the nine tribes and a half,
and promised him at the same time that He would drive out the Canaanites
from those portions of the land that were not yet conquered ([Jos
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006)). The words "grown old and come
into years" (vid., [Gen 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#001); [Gen
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#011), etc.) denote advanced age in
its different stages up to the near approach of death (as, for example,
in [Jos 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001)). Joshua might be ninety
or a hundred years old at this time. The allusion to Joshua's great age
serves simply to explain the reason for the command of God. As he was
already old, and there still remained much land to be taken, he was to
proceed to the division of Canaan, that he might accomplish this work to
which he was also called before his death; whereas he might very
possibly suppose that, under existing circumstances, the time for
allotting the land had not yet arrived. - In [Jos
13:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002) the districts that were not yet
conquered are enumerated separately.

[Jos 13:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002)

All the circles of the Philistines (geliloth, circles of well-defined
districts lying round the chief city). The reference is to the five
towns of the Philistines, whose princes are mentioned in [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003). "And all Geshuri:" not the
district of Geshur in Peraea ([Jos
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#011), [Jos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013), [Jos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005); [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014)), but the territory of the
Geshurites, a small tribe in the south of Philistia, on the edge of the
north-western portion of the Arabian desert which borders on Egypt; it
is only mentioned again in [Sa1 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008).
The land of the Philistines and Geshurites extended from the Sichor of
Egypt (on the south) to the territory of Ekron (on the north). Sichor
(Sihor), lit. the black river, is not the Nile, because this is always
called היאר (the river) in simple prose ([Gen
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001), [Gen
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#003); [Exo
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#022)), and was not "before Egypt,"
i.e., to the east of it, but flowed through the middle of the land. The
"Sichor before Egypt" was the brook (Nachal) of Egypt, the Ῥινοκοροῦρα,
the modern Wady el Arish, which is mentioned in [Jos
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#004), [Jos
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#047), etc., as the southern border of
Canaan towards Egypt (see at [Num
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#005)). Ekron (Ἀρρακών, lxx), the most
northerly of the five chief cities of the Philistines, was first of all
allotted to the tribe of Judah ([Jos
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#011), [Jos
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#045)), then on the further
distribution it was given to Dan ([Jos
19:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#043)); after Joshua's death it was
conquered by Judah ([Jdg 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018)), though
it was not permanently occupied. It is the present Akr, a considerable
village in the plain, two hours to the south-west of Ramlah, and on the
east of Jamnia, without ruins of any antiquity, with the exception of
two old wells walled round, which probably belong to the times of the
Crusaders (see Rob. Pal. iii. p. 23). "To the Canaanites is reckoned
(the territory of the) five lords of the Philistines," i.e., it was
reckoned as belonging to the land of Canaan, and allotted to the
Israelites like all the rest. This remark was necessary because the
Philistines were not descendants of Canaan (see at [Gen
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#014)), but yet were to be driven out
like the Canaanites themselves as being invaders of Canaanitish
territory (cf. [Deu 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023)). סרני, from
סרן, the standing title of the princes of the Philistines (vid., [Jdg
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003); [Jdg
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#005).; [Sa1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#008)), does not mean kings, but
princes, and is interchangeable with שׂרים (cf. [Sa1
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006) with [Sa1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004), [Sa1
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#009)). At any rate, it was the native
or Philistian title of the Philistine princes, though it is not derived
from the same root as Sar, but is connected with seren, axis rotae, in
the tropical sense of princeps, for which the Arabic furnishes several
analogies (see Ges. Thes. p. 972).

The capitals of these five princes were the following. Azzah (Gaza,
i.e., the strong): this was allotted to the tribe of Judah and taken by
the Judaeans ([Jos 15:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#047); [Jdg
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018)), but was not held long. It is at
the present time a considerable town of about 15,000 inhabitants, with
the old name of Ghazzeh, about an hour from the sea, and with a seaport
called Majuma; it is the farthest town of Palestine towards the
south-west (see Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 374ff.; Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 35ff.;
Stark, Gaza, etc., pp. 45ff.). Ashdod (Ἄζωτος, Azotus): this was also
allotted to the tribe of Judah ([Jos
15:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#046)), the seat of Dagon-worship,
to which the Philistines carried the ark ([Sa1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001).). It was conquered by Uzziah
([Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006)), was afterwards taken by
Tartan, the general of Sargon ([Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001)), and was besieged by
Psammetichus for twenty-nine years (Herod. ii. 157). It is the present
Esdud, a Mahometan village with about a hundred or a hundred and fifty
miserable huts, upon a low, round, wooded height on the road from Jamnia
to Gaza, two miles to the south of Jamnia, about half an hour from the
sea (vid., Rob. i. p. 368). Ashkalon: this was conquered by the Judaeans
after the death of Joshua ([Jdg
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008)); but shortly afterwards
recovered its independence (vid., [Jdg
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019); [Sa1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#017)). It is the present Askuln on the
sea-shore between Gaza and Ashdod, five hours to the north of Gaza, with
considerable and widespread ruins (see v. Raum. pp. 173-4; Ritter, xvi.
pp. 69ff.). Gath (Γέθ): this was for a long time the seat of the
Rephaites, and was the home of Goliath ([Jos
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#022); [Sa1
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#004), [Sa1
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#023); [Sa2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#019).; [Ch1
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#005).); it was thither that the
Philistines of Ashdod removed the ark, which was taken thence to Ekron
([Sa1 5:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#007)). David was the first to
wrest it from the Philistines ([Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001)). In the time of Solomon it was a
royal city of the Philistines, though no doubt under Israelitish
supremacy ([Kg1 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#039); [Kg1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001)). It was fortified by Rehoboam
([Ch2 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#008)), was taken by the Syrians
in the time of Joash ([Kg2 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018)), and
was conquered again by Uzziah ([Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006); [Amo
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002)); but no further mention is made
of it, and no traces have yet been discovered

(Note: According to the Onom. (s. v. Geth), it was a place five Roman
miles from Eleutheropolis towards Diospolis, whereas Jerome (on Mic 1)
says: "Gath was near the border of Judaea, and on the road from
Eleutheropolis to Gaza; it is still a very large village;" whilst in the
commentary on Jer 25 he says: "Gath was near to and conterminous with
Azotus," from which it is obvious enough that the situation of the
Philistine city of Gath was altogether unknown to the Fathers. Hitzig
and Knobel suppose the Βαιτογάβρα of Ptolemy (5:16, 6), Betogabri in
Tab. Peuting. ix. e. (the Eleutheropolis of the Fathers, and the present
Beit Jibrin, a very considerable ruin), to be the ancient Gath, but this
opinion is only founded upon very questionable etymological
combinations; whereas Thenius looks for it on the site of the present
Deir Dubban, though without any tenable ground.)

(see Rob. ii. p. 420, and v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 191-2). "And the Avvites
(Avvaeans) towards the south." Judging from [Deu
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023), the Avvim appear to have
belonged to those tribes of the land who were already found there by the
Canaanites, and whom the Philistines subdued and destroyed when they
entered the country. They are not mentioned in [Gen
10:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015) among the Canaanitish tribes.
At the same time, there is not sufficient ground for identifying them
with the Geshurites as Ewald does, or with the Anakites, as Bertheau has
done. Moreover, it cannot be decided whether they were descendants of
Ham or Shem (see Stark. Gaza, pp. 32ff.). מתּימן (from, or on, the
south) at the commencement of [Jos
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004) should be attached to [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003), as it is in the Septuagint,
Syriac, and Vulgate, and joined to העוּים (the Avvites). The Avvaeans
dwelt to the south of the Philistines, on the south-west of Gaza. It
gives no sense to connect with the what follows, so as to read "towards
the south all the land of the Canaanites;" for whatever land to the
south of Gaza, or of the territory of the Philistines, was still
inhabited by Canaanites, could not possibly be called "all the land of
the Canaanites." If, however, we were disposed to adopt the opinion held
by Masius and Rosenmller, and understand these words as relating to the
southern boundaries of Canaan, "the possessions of the king of Arad and
the neighbouring petty kings who ruled in the southern extremity of
Judaea down to the desert of Paran, Zin, Kadesh," etc., the fact that
Arad and the adjoining districts are always reckoned as belonging to the
Negeb would at once be decisive against it (compare [Jos
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021). with [Jos
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040); [Jos
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#016), also [Num
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001)). Moreover, according to [Jos
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040), [Jos
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021), and [Jos
11:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#016), Joshua had smitten the whole
of the south of Canaan from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza and taken it; so that
nothing remained unconquered there, which could possibly have been
mentioned in this passage as not yet taken by the Israelites. For the
fact that the districts, which Joshua traversed so victoriously and took
possession of, were not all permanently held by the Israelites, does not
come into consideration here at all. If the author had thought of
enumerating all these places, he would have had to include many other
districts as well.

Beside the territory of the Philistines on the south-west, there still
remained to be taken ([Jos 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004), [Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005)) in the north, "all the land of
the Canaanites," i.e., of the Phoenicians dwelling on the coast, and
"the caves which belonged to the Sidonians unto Aphek." Mearah (the
cave) is the present Mugr Jezzin, i.e., cave of Jezzin, on the east of
Sidon, in a steep rocky wall of Lebanon, a hiding-place of the Druses at
the present time (see at [Num 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008);
also F. v. Richter, Wallfahrten in Morgenland, p. 133). Aphek, or Aphik,
was allotted to the tribe of Asher ([Jos
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030); [Jdg
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031)); it was called Ἄφακα by the
Greeks; there was a temple of Venus there, which Constantine ordered to
be destroyed, on account of the licentious nature of the worship (Euseb.
Vita Const. iii. 55). It is the present Afka, a small village, but a
place of rare beauty, upon a terrace of Lebanon, near the chief source
of the river Adonis (Nahr Ibrahim), with ruins of an ancient temple in
the neighbourhood, surrounded by groves of the most splendid walnut
trees on the north-east of Beirut (see O. F. v. Richter, pp. 106-7; Rob.
Bibl. Res. p. 663; and V. de Velde, Reise. ii. p. 398). "To the
territory of the Amorites:" this is obscure. We cannot imagine the
reference to be to the territory of Og of Bashan, which was formerly
inhabited by Amorites, as that did not extend so far north; and the
explanation given by Knobel, that farther north there were not
Canaanites, but Amorites, who were of Semitic origin, rests upon
hypotheses which cannot be historically sustained.

[Jos 13:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005)

There still remained to be taken (2) "the land of the Giblites," i.e.,
the territory of the population of Gebal ([Kg1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018); [Eze
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009)), the Byblos of the classics, on
the Mediterranean Sea, to the north of Beirut, called Jebail by the
Arabs, and according to Edrisi (ed. Jaubert, i. p. 356), "a pretty town
on the sea-shore, enclosed in good walls, and surrounded by vineyards
and extensive grounds planted with fruit trees" (see also Abulfed. Tab.
Syr. p. 94). It is still a town with an old wall, some portions of which
apparently belong to the time of the Crusades (see Burckhardt, Syr. p.
296, and Ritter, Erdk. xvii. pp. 60ff.).

(Note: The evidence adduced by Movers (Phnizier, ii. 1, p. 103), that
the Giblites did not belong to the Canaanites, has more plausibility
than truth.)

"And all Lebanon toward the sunrising:" i.e., not Antilibanus (Knobel),
but the Lebanon which is to the east of the territory of Gebal, "from
Baal-gad under Mount Hermon," i.e., Paneas Banjas at the foot of Hermon
(see at [Jos 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017)), "unto the
entering in to Hamath," i.e., as far up as the territory of the kingdom
of Hamath, with the capital of the same name on the Orontes (see at [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008)). Lastly, there still remained
(3) "all the inhabitants of the mountains, from Lebanon to
Misrephothmaim," i.e., the promontory of Nakura (see at [Jos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008)), namely "all the Sidonians,"
i.e., all the Phoenicians who dwelt from Lebanon southwards, from the
boundary of the territory of Hamath down to the promontory of Nakura.
According to ancient usage, the Sidonians stand for the Phoenicians
generally, as in Homer, on account of Sidon being the oldest capital of
Phoenicia (see Ges. on Isa. i. pp. 724ff.). All these the Lord would
root out before Israel, and therefore Joshua was to divide the whole of
northern Canaan, which was inhabited by Phoenicians, among the
Israelites. "only divide thou it by lot for an inheritance," etc. רק,
only, i.e., although thou hast not yet taken it. הפּיל, to cause it to
fall, here used with reference to the lot, i.e., to divide by lot.
"Fulfil thy duty in the distribution of the land, not even excepting
what is still in the firm grasp of the enemy; for I will take care to
perform what I have promised. From this we may learn to rely so
perfectly upon the word of God, when undertaking any duty, as not to be
deterred by doubts of fears" (Calvin).

[Jos 13:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008)

To the command of God to divide the land on this side the Jordan among
the nine tribes and a half ([Jos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007)), the historian appends the
remark, that the other two tribes and a half had already received their
inheritance from Moses on the other side ([Jos
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008)). This he proceeds to describe in
its full extent ([Jos 13:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009)), and
then observes that the tribe of Levi alone received no landed
inheritance, according to the word of the Lord ([Jos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014)). After this he gives a
description in vv. 15-33 of the land assigned by Moses to each of the
two tribes and a half.

(Note: Knobel's remark, that [Jos
13:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008) anticipate the following
section (vv. 15-33) in an unsuitable manner, rests upon a thorough
misunderstanding of the whole; for the account of the division of the
land to the east of the Jordan among the two tribes and a half (vv.
15-33) could not be introduced in a more appropriate manner than by a
description of the circumference of the land and of its principal parts
([Jos 13:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009)).)

The remark in [Jos 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008) is so closely
connected with what precedes by the expression "with whom" (lit., with
it), that this expression must be taken as somewhat indefinite: "with
whom," viz., with half Manasseh, really signifying with the other half
of Manasseh, with which the Reubenites and Gadites had received their
inheritance (see Num 32 and [Deu
3:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008)). The last words of [Jos
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008), "as Moses the servant of Jehovah
gave them," are not a tautological repetition of the clause "which Moses
gave them," but simply affirm that these tribes received the land given
them by Moses, in the manner commanded by Moses, without any alteration
in his arrangements. The boundaries of the land given in [Jos
13:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009) really agree with those given
in [Jos 12:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002) and [Deu
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008), although the expression varies in
some respects. The words of [Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009),
"the city that is in the midst of the river," i.e., the city in the
valley, viz., Ar, are more distinct than those of [Jos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002), "and from the middle of the
river." "All the plain" is the Amoritish table-land, a tract of land for
the most part destitute of trees, stretching from the Arnon to Heshbon,
and towards the north-east to Rabbath-Ammn (see at [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010)), which is called in [Num
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020) the field of Moab Medeba, now
called Medaba (see at [Num 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030)).
Dibon, now a ruin called Dibn, to the north of Arnon (see at [Num
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020)). - [Jos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#010), as in [Jos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002).

[Jos 13:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#011)

Gilead is the whole country of that name on both sides of the Jabbok
(see at [Jos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002) and [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010)), the present Belka and Jebel
Ajlun, for the description of which see the remarks at [Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001). "The territory of the Geshurites
and Maachathites" is referred to in [Jos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005) as the boundary of the kingdom of
Og, and in [Deu 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014) as the boundary
of the land which was taken by Jair the Manassite; here it is included
in the inheritance of the tribes on the other side of the Jordan, but it
was never really taken possession of by the Israelites, and (according
to [Jos 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013)) it had probably never
been really subject to king Og. The other notices in [Jos
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#011) and [Jos
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#012) are the same as in [Jos
12:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004).

[Jos 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014)

The tribe of Levi was to receive no land, but the firings of Jehovah,
i.e., the offerings, including the tithes and first-fruits ([Lev
27:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030), compared with [Num
18:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021)), were to be its inheritance;
so that the God of Israel himself is called the inheritance of Levi in
[Jos 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#033) as in [Num
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020), to which the words "as He said
unto them" refer (see the commentary on [Num
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020)).

[Joshua 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 13:15</span></span>

The Possessions of the Two Tribes and a Half. - [Jos
13:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015). The tribe of Reuben received
its inheritance in the south-namely, the territory from Aror in the
Arnon valley, and from Ar in that valley, onwards, and the plain
(table-land) by Medeba (see [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009)), with Heshbon the capital and
her towns, i.e., the towns dependent upon it, in the plain. Heshbon,
almost in the centre between the Arnon and the Jabbok, was situated upon
the border of the inheritance of the Reubenites, and was ceded to the
Gadites, who gave it up to the Levites ([Jos
21:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#039); [Ch1
6:66](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#066) : see at [Num
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037)). Dibon, called Dibon of Gad in
[Num 33:45](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#045), because the Gadites had
built, i.e., fortified it, was on the south of Heshbon, only an hour
from Aror, on the Arnon ([Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009)).
Bamoth-baal, also called Bamoth simply ([Num
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020); [Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002)), is to be sought for on the
Jebel Attarus (see at [Num 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020)). It
was thence that Balaam saw the end of the Israelitish camp ([Num
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041)). Bethbaal-meon, the present
ruin of Myun, three-quarters of an hour S.E. of Heshbon (see at [Num
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038)). Jahza, where Sihon was
defeated, was to the east of Medeba, according to the Onom.; and Dibon
was on the border of the desert (see at [Num
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023)). Kedemoth, on the border of the
desert, to the north-west of Kalaat Balua, is to be sought on the
northern bank of the Balua, or upper Arnon (see at [Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013)). Mephaath, where there was a
garrison stationed (according to the Onom.) as a defence against the
inhabitants of the desert, is to be sought for in the neighbourhood of
Jahza, with which it is always associated ([Jer
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#021)). Kedemoth and Mephaath were
given up to the Levites ([Jos 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#037);
[Ch1 6:64](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#064)).

[Joshua 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 13:19</span></span>

Kirjathaim, where Chedorlaomer defeated the Emim, is probably to be
found in the ruins of et-Teym, half an hour to the west of Medaba (see
at [Gen 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005)). Sibmah ([Num
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038)), according to Jerome (on [Isa
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008)), only 500 paces from Heshbon,
appears to have hopelessly disappeared. Zereth-hashachar, i.e., splendor
aurorae, which is only mentioned here, was situated "upon a mountain of
the valley." According to [Jos 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027),
the valley was the Jordan valley, or rather (according to [Gen
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#003), [Gen
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#008)) the vale of Siddim, a valley
running down on the eastern side of the Dead Sea. Seetzen conjectures
that the town referred to is the present ruin of Sar, on the south of
Zerka Maein. - Beth-peor, opposite to Jericho, six Roman miles higher
than (to the east of) Libias: see at [Num
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028). The "slopes of Pisgah" ([Jos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003); [Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017)): to the south of the former, on
the north-eastern shore of the Dead Sea (see at [Num
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012)). Beth-jeshimoth ([Jos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003)), in the Ghor el Seisabn, on the
north-east side of the Dead Sea (see at [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001)). In [Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021), the places which Reuben
received in addition to those mentioned by name are all summed up in the
words, "and all the (other) towns of the plain, and all the kingdom of
Sihon," sc., so far as it extended over the plain. These limitations of
the words are implied in the context: the first in the fact that towns
in the plain are mentioned in [Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017); the second in the fact that,
according to [Jos 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027), "the rest of
the kingdom of Sihon," i.e., the northern portion of it, was given to
the Gadites. The allusion to Sihon induced the author to mention his
defeat again; see at Num 31, where the five Midianitish vassals who were
slain with Sihon are noticed in [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008), and the death of Balaam is also
mentioned. "Dukes of Sihon," properly vassals of Sihon; נסיכים does not
signify anointed, however, but means literally poured out, i.e., cast,
moulded, enfeoffed. The word points to the "creation of a prince by the
communication or pouring in of power" (Gusset, s. v.).

[Joshua 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 13:23</span></span>

"And (this) was the boundary of the sons of Reuben, the Jordan and its
territory," i.e., the Jordan, or rather land adjoining it. The meaning
is, that the territory of Reuben, viz., with the places mentioned last
([Jos 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#020)), reached to the territory
of the Jordan; for so far as the principal part was concerned, it was on
the east of the Dead Sea, as it only reached from the Arnon to Heshbon,
i.e., up to the latitude of the northern extremity of the Dead Sea. "The
towns and their villages." חצר, farm premises, used, as in [Lev
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#031), to denote places not enclosed
by a wall.

[Joshua 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 13:24</span></span>

Inheritance of the tribe of Gad. - This tribe received Jazer (probably
es Szyr: see at [Num 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#032)) and "all
the towns of Gilead," i.e., of the southern half of Gilead, which
belonged to the kingdom of Sihon; for the northern half, which belonged
to the kingdom of Og, was given to the Manassites ([Jos
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#031)), "and the half of the land of
the sons of Ammon, to Aror before Rabbah," i.e., that portion of the
land of the Ammonites between the Arnon and the Jabbok, which the
Amorites under Sihon had taken from the Ammonites, namely, the land on
the east of Gilead, on the western side of the upper Jabbok (Nahr Ammn:
[Deu 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#037); [Deu
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016); cf. [Jdg
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013)); for the land of the Ammonites,
i.e., the land which they still held in the time of Moses, on the
eastern side of Nahr Ammn, the Israelites were not allowed to attack
([Deu 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019)). Aror before Rabbah, i.e.,
Ammn (see [Deu 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011)), is Aror of Gad,
and must be distinguished from Aror of Reuben on the Arnon ([Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016)). It is only mentioned again in
[Jdg 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033) and [Sa2
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#005), and was situated, according to 2
Sam., in the valley of Gad, that is to say, in a wady or valley through
which Gesenius supposes an arm of the Jabbok to have flowed, and Thenius
the Jabbok itself, though neither of them has sufficient ground for his
conjecture. It is also not to be identified with the ruin of Ayra to the
south-west of Szalt, as this is not in a wady at all; but in all
probability it is to be sought for to the north-east of Rabbah, in the
Wady Nahr Ammn, on the side of the Kalat Zerka Gadda, the situation of
which suits this verse and [Jdg 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033).
- In [Jos 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026) the extent of the
territory of Gad is first of all described from north to south: viz.,
from Heshbon (see [Jos 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017)) to
Ramath-mizpeh, or Ramoth in Gilead ([Jos
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008)), probably on the site of the
present Szalt (see at [Deu 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043)), "and
Betonim," probably the ruin of Batneh, on the mountains which bound the
Ghor towards the east between the Wady Shaib and Wady Ajlun, in the same
latitude as Szalt (V. de Velde, Mem. p. 298); and then, secondly, the
northern boundary is described from west to east, "from Mahanaim to the
territory of Lidbir." Mahanaim (double-camp: [Gen
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002)), which was given up by Gad to
the Levites ([Jos 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#030)), in which
Ishbosheth was proclaimed king ([Sa2
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008)), and to which David fled from
Absalom ([Sa2 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#024), [Sa2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027); [Kg1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008)), is not to be sought for, as
Knobel supposes, in the ruins of Meysera, to the south of Jabbok, four
hours and a half from Szalt, but was on the north of the Jabbok, since
Jacob did not cross the ford of the Jabbok till after the angel had
appeared to him at Mahanaim ([Gen
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003), [Gen
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#023)). It was in or by the valley of
the Jordan (according to [Sa2
18:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#023)), and has probably been
preserved in the ruins of Mahneh, the situation of which, however, has
not yet been determined (see at [Gen
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003)). Lidbir is quite unknown; the
lamed, however, is not to be taken as a prefix, but forms part of the
word. J. D. Michaelis and Knobel suppose it to be the same as Lo-debar
in [Sa2 9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#004); [Sa2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027), a place from which provisions
were brought to David at Mahanaim on his flight from Absalom, and which
is to be sought for on the east of Mahanaim.

[Joshua 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jos 13:27</span></span>

On the north, the territory of Gad seems to have extended to the Jabbok,
and only to have stretched beyond the Jabbok at Mahanaim, which formed
the boundary of half-Manasseh, according to [Jos
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#030). In the valley of the Jordan, on
the other hand, the boundary reached to the Sea of Galilee. "The valley"
is the valley of the Jordan, or the Arabah from Wady Hesbn above the
Dead Sea up to the Sea of Galilee, along the east side of the Jordan,
which belonged to the kingdom of Sihon ([Jos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003); [Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017)). The northern boundary of the
tribe of Reuben must have touched the Jordan in the neighbourhood of the
Wady Hesbn. In the Jordan valley were Beth-haram, the future Libias, and
present er Rameh (see at [Num 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#036));
Beth-nimra, according to the Onom. five Roman miles to the north, the
present ruin of Nimrein (see at [Num
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#036)); Succoth, according to the
Onom. trans Jordanem in parte Scythopoleos (see at [Gen
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#017)); Zaphon (i.e., north), probably
not far from the southern extremity of the Sea of Galilee. "The rest of
the kingdom of Sihon," the other part having been given to the
Reubenites ([Jos 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021)).

[Joshua 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 13:29</span></span>

The territory of the half tribe of Manasseh extended from Mahanaim
onwards, and embraced all Bashan, with the sixty Jair towns and the
(northern) half of Gilead (see the comm. on [Deu
3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013)).

[Joshua 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jos 13:32</span></span>

[Jos 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#032) is the concluding formula.
(For the fact itself, see [Num
34:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#014).) [Jos
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#033) is a repetition of [Jos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014).
