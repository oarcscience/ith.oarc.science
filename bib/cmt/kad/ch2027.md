### [2 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 27:1</span></span>

Jotham having ascended the throne at the age of twenty-five, reigned
altogether in the spirit and power of his father, with the single
limitation that he did not go into the sanctuary of Jahve (cf. [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016)..md). This remark is not found in 2
Kings 15, because there Uzziah's intrusion into the temple is also
omitted. The people still did corruptly (cf. [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016).md). This refers, indeed, to the
continuation of the worship in the high places, but hints also at the
deep moral corruption which the prophets of that time censure (cf.
especially [Isa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#005.md)., [Ch2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#007.md).; [Mic
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005.md); [Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001)..md).

[2 Chronicles 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 27:3</span></span>

He built the upper gate of the house of Jahve, i.e., the northern gate
of the inner or upper court (see on [Kg2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035).md); the only work of his reign
which is mentioned in the book of Kings. But besides this, he continued
the fortifying of Jerusalem, which his father had commenced; building
much at the wall of the Ophel. העפל was the name of the southern slope
of the temple mountain (see on [Ch2
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014).md); the wall of Ophel is
consequently the wall connecting Zion with the temple mountain, at which
Uzziah had already built (see on [Ch2
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009).md). He likewise carried on his
father's buildings for the protection of the herds ([Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010).md), building the cities in the
mountains of Judah, and castles (בּירניּות, [Ch2
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#012).md) and towers in the forests of
the mountains of Judah (חרשׁים from חרשׁ, a thicket).

[2 Chronicles 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 27:5</span></span>

He made war upon the king of the Ammonites, and overcame them. The
Ammonites had before paid tribute to Uzziah. After his death they would
seem to have refused to pay this tribute; and Jotham made them again
tributary by force of arms. They were compelled to pay him after their
defeat, in that same year, 100 talents of silver, 10,000 cor of wheat,
and a similar quantity of barley, as tribute. לו השׁיבוּ זאת: this they
brought to him again, i.e., they paid him the same amount as tribute in
the second and third years of their subjection also. After three years,
consequently, they would seem to have again become independent, or
refused the tribute, probably in the last years of Jotham, in which,
according to [Kg2 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037.md), the Syrian
king Rezin and Pekah of Israel began to make attacks upon Judah.

[Ch2 27:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#006.md)

By all these undertakings Jotham strengthened himself, sc. in the
kingdom, i.e., he attained to greater power, because he made his ways
firm before Jahve, i.e., walked stedfastly before Jahve; did not incur
guilt by falling away into idolatry, or by faithless infringement of the
rights of the Lord (as Uzziah did by his interference with the rights of
the priesthood). From the כּל־מלחמתיו in the concluding remark ([Ch2
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#007).md) we learn that he had waged still
other successful wars. The older commentators reckon among these wars,
the war against Rezin and Pekah, which kings the Lord began in his days
to send against Judah (see [Kg2
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037).md), but hardly with justice. The
position of this note, which is altogether omitted in the Chronicle, at
the end of the account of Jotham in [Kg2
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037.md), appears to hint that this war
broke out only towards the end of Jotham's reign, so that he could not
undertake anything important against this foe.

[Ch2 27:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#008.md)

The repetition of the chronological statement already given in [Ch2
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001.md) is probably to be explained by
supposing that two authorities, each of which contained this remark,
were used.
