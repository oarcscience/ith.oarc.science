The Nearness of the Judge with the Cup of Wrath

That for which Ps 74 prays: Arise, Jahve, plead Thine own cause ([Psa
74:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022)..md), [Psa
75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md) beholds; the judgment of God
upon the proud sinners becomes a source of praise and of a triumphant
spirit to the psalmist. The prophetic picture stands upon a lyrical
groundwork of gold; it emerges out of the depth of feeling, and it is
drawn back again into it. The inscription: To the Precentor, (after the
measure:) Destroy not (vid., on [Psa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001).md), a Psalm by Asaph, a Song, is
fully borne out. The Sela shows that the Psalm, as מזמור שׁיר says, is
appointed to be sung with musical accompaniment; and to the לאסף
corresponds its thoroughly Asaphic character, which calls Ps 50 to mind
with especial force. But from this Psalm [Psa
75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md) differs, however, in this
particular, viz., that a more clearly defined situation of affairs
manifests itself through the hope of the judicial interposition of God
which is expressed in it with prophetic certainty. According to
appearances it is the time of the judgment of the nations in the person
of Assyria; not, however, the time immediately following the great
catastrophe, but prior to this, when Isaiah's prophecy concerning the
shattering of the Assyrian power against Jerusalem had gone forth, just
as Hengstenberg also regards this Psalm as the lyrical companion of the
prophecies which Isaiah uttered in the presence of the ruin which
threatened from Assyria, and as a testimony to the living faith with
which the church at that time received the word of God. Hitzig, however,
assigns both [Psa 75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md) and [Psa
76:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md) to Judas Maccabaeus, who
celebrates the victory over Apollonius in the one, and the victory over
Seron in the other: "we may imagine that he utters the words of Ps 75:11
whilst he brandishes the captured sword of the fallen Apollonius." But
the probability that it refers to the Assyrian period is at least
equally balanced with the probability that it refers to the Maccabaean
(vid., [Psa 75:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#007.md); [Psa
76:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005).md); and if the time of Hezekiah
were to be given up, then we might sooner go back to the time of
Jehoshaphat, for both songs are too original to appear as echoes and not
much rather as models of the later prophecy. The only influence that is
noticeable in [Psa 75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md) is that of
the Song of Hannah.

[Psalms 75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 75:1</span></span>

The church in anticipation gives thanks for the judicial revelation of
its God, the near approach of which He Himself asserts to it. The
connection with ו in וקרוב שׁמך presents a difficulty. Neither here nor
anywhere else is it to be supposed that ו is synonymous with כּי; but at
any rate even כי might stand instead of it. For Hupfeld's attempt to
explain it: and "near is Thy name" Thy wonders have declared; and
Hitzig's: and Thou whose Name is near, they declare Thy wondrous works -
are past remedy. Such a personification of wonders does not belong to
the spirit of Hebrew poetry, and such a relative clause lies altogether
beyond the bounds of syntax. If we would, however, take וקרוב שׁמך,
after [Psa 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md), as a result of the
thanksgiving (Campensis), then that for which thanks are rendered would
remain undefined; neither will it do to take קרוב as referring to the
being inwardly present (Hengstenberg), since this, according to [Jer
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#002.md) (cf. [Deu
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#014).md), would require some addition,
which should give to the nearness this reference to the mouth or to the
heart. Thus, therefore, nothing remains for us but to connect the
nearness of the Name of God as an outward fact with the earnest giving
of thanks. The church has received the promise of an approaching
judicial, redemptive revelation of God, and now says, "We give Thee
thanks, we give thanks and near is Thy Name;" it welcomes the future act
of God with heartfelt thanksgiving, all those who belong to it declare
beforehand the wonders of God. Such was really the position of matters
when in Hezekiah's time the oppression of the Assyrians had reached its
highest point - Isaiah's promises of a miraculous divine deliverance
were at that time before them, and the believing ones saluted
beforehand, with thanksgiving, the "coming Name of Jahve" ([Isa
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027).md). The כּי which was to be
expected after הודינו (cf. e.g., [Psa
100:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#004)..md) does not follow until [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md). God Himself undertakes the
confirmation of the forthcoming thanksgiving and praise by a direct
announcement of the help that is hailed and near at hand ([Psa
85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010).md). It is not to be rendered,
"when I shall seize," etc., for [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md) has not the structure of an
apodosis. כּי is confirmatory, and whatever interpretation we may give
to it, the words of the church suddenly change into the words of God.
מועד in the language of prophecy, more especially of the apocalyptic
character, is a standing expression fore the appointed time of the final
judgment (vid., on [Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003).md). When
this moment or juncture in the lapse of time shall have arrived, then
God will seize or take possession of it (לקח in the unweakened original
sense of taking hold of with energy, cf. [Psa
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017.md); [Gen
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#015).md): He Himself will then interpose
and hold judgment according to the strictly observed rule of right
(מישׁרים, adverbial accusative, cf. במישׁרים, [Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009), and frequently.md). If it even
should come to pass that the earth and all its inhabitants are melting
away (cf. [Isa 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031.md); [Exo
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015.md); [Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009).md), i.e., under the pressure of
injustice (as is to be inferred from [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003).md), are disheartened, scattered
asunder, and are as it were in the act of dissolution, then He (the
absolute I, אנכי) will restrain this melting away: He setteth in their
places the pillars, i.e., the internal shafts ([Job
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006).md), of the earth, or without any
figure: He again asserts the laws which lie at the foundation of its
stability. תכּנתּי is a mood of certainty, and [Psa
75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md) is a circumstantial clause placed
first, after the manner of the Latin ablative absolute. Hitzig
appropriately compares [Pro 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#009.md); [Isa
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md) may also be understood according
to this bearing of the case.

The utterance of God is also continued after the Sela. It is not the
people of God who turn to the enemies with the language of warning on
the ground of the divine promise (Hengstenberg); the poet would then
have said אמרנוּ, or must at least have said על־כּן אמרתּי. God Himself
speaks, and His words are not yet peremptorily condemning, as in [Psa
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016.md)., cf. [Psa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#011.md), but admonitory and threatening,
because it is not He who has already appeared for the final judgment who
speaks, but He who announces His appearing. With אמרתּי He tells the
braggarts who are captivated with the madness of supposed greatness, and
the evil-doers who lift up the horn or the head,

(Note: The head is called in Sanscrit iras, in Zend aranh, = κάρα; the
horn in Sanscrit, ringa, i.e., (according to Burnlouf, Etudes, p. 19)
that which proceeds from and projects out of the head (iras), Zend rva =
κέρας, קרן (ḳarn).)

hat He will have once for all said to them, and what they are to suffer
to be said to them for the short space of time till the judgment. The
poet, if we have assigned the right date to the Psalm, has Rabshakeh and
his colleagues before his mind, cf. [Isa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023.md). The ל, as in that passage, and
like אל in [Zac 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004) (vid., Khler.md), has
the idea of a hostile tendency. אל rules also over [Psa
75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006.md): "speak not insolence with a
raised neck." It is not to be construed עתק בצוּאר, with a stiff neck.
Parallel passages like [Psa 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md);
[Psa 94:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#004.md), and more especially the
primary passage [Sa1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#003.md), show that
עתק is an object-notion, and that בצוּאר by itself (with which, too, the
accentuation harmonizes, since Munach here is the vicarius of a
distinctive), according to [Job 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#026.md),
has the sense of τραχηλιῶτες or ὑπεραυχοῦντες.

[Psalms 75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 75:6</span></span>

The church here takes up the words of God, again beginning with the כּי
of [Psa 75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md) (cf. the כּי in [Sa1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003).md). A passage of the Midrash says
הרים חוץ מזה כל הרים שׁבמקרא (everywhere where harim is found in
Scripture it signifies harim, mountains, with the exception of this
passage), and accordingly it is explained by Rashi, Kimchi, Alshch, and
others, that man, whithersoever he may turn, cannot by strength and
skill attain great exaltation and prosperity.

(Note: E.g., Bamidbar Rabba ch. xxii.; whereas according to Berêshı̂th
Rabba ch. lii. הרים is equivalent to דּרום.)

Thus it is according to the reading ממּדבּר, although Kimchi maintains
that it can also be so explained with the reading ממּדבּר, by pointing
to מרמס ([Isa 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006).md) and the like. It
is, however, difficult to see why, in order to express the idea "from
anywhere," three quarters of the heavens should be used and the north
left out. These three quarters of the heavens which are said to
represent the earthly sources of power (Hupfeld), are a frame without
the picture, and the thought, "from no side (viz., of the earth) cometh
promotion" - in itself whimsical in expression - offers a wrong
confirmation for the dissuasive that has gone before. That, however,
which the church longs for is first of all not promotion, but
redemption. On the other hand, the lxx, Targum, Syriac, and Vulgate
render: a deserto montium (desertis montibus); and even Aben-Ezra
rightly takes it as a Palestinian designation of the south, when he
supplements the aposiopesis by means of מי שׁיושׁיעם (more biblically
יבע עזרנוּ, cf. [Psa 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001)..md). The fact
that the north is not mentioned at all shows that it is a northern power
which arrogantly, even to blasphemy, threatens the small Israelitish
nation with destruction, and against which it looks for help neither
from the east and west, nor from the reed-staff of Egypt ([Isa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006).md) beyond the desert of the
mountains of Arabia Petraea, but from Jahve alone, according to the
watchword of Isaiah: שׁפטנוּ ה ([Isa
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022).md). The negative thought is left
unfinished, the discourse hurrying on to the opposite affirmative
thought. The close connection of the two thoughts is strikingly
expressed by the rhymes הרים and ידים. The כּי of [Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md) gives the confirmation of the
negation from the opposite, that which is denied; the כּי of [Psa
75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md) confirms this confirmation. If it
were to be rendered, "and the wine foams," it would then have been
היּין; מסך, which is undoubtedly accusative, also shows that yayin is
also not considered as anything else: and it (the cup) foams (חמר like
Arab. 'chtmr, to ferment, effervesce) with wine, is full of mixture.
According to the ancient usage of the language, which is also followed
by the Arabic, this is wine mixed with water in distinction from merum,
Arabic chamr memzûg'e. Wine was mixed with water not merely to dilute
it, but also to make it more pleasant; hence מסך signifies directly as
much as to pour out (vid., Hitzig on [Isa
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022).md). It is therefore unnecessary to
understand spiced wine (Talmudic קונדיטון, conditum), since the
collateral idea of weakening is also not necessarily associated with the
admixture of water. מזּה refers to כּוס, which is used as masculine, as
in [Jer 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md); the word is feminine
elsewhere, and changes its gender even here in שׁמריה (cf. [Eze
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#034).md). In the fut. consec. ויּגּר the
historical signification of the consecutive is softened down, as is
frequently the case. אך affirms the whole assertion that follows. The
dregs of the cup - a dira necessitas - all the wicked of the earth shall
be compelled to sip ([Isa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017).md), to
drink out: they shall not be allowed to drink and make a pause, but,
compelled by Jahve, who has appeared as Judge, they shall be obliged to
drink it out with involuntary eagerness even to the very last ([Eze
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#034).md). We have here the primary
passage of a figure, which has been already hinted at in [Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005.md), and is filled in on a more and
more magnificent and terrible scale in the prophets. Whilst Obadiah
([Oba 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#016.md), cf. [Job
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#020).md) contents himself with a mere
outline sketch, it is found again, in manifold applications, in Isaiah,
Habakkuk, and Ezekiel, and most frequently in Jeremiah ([Jer
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md)., [Jer
48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026.md); [Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012).md), where in [Psa
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015.md). it is embodied into a
symbolical act. Jahve's cup of intoxication (inasmuch as חמה and חמר,
the burning of anger and intoxicating, fiery wine, are put on an
equality) is the judgment of wrath which is meted out to sinners and
given them to endure to the end.

[Psalms 75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 75:9</span></span>

The poet now turns back thankfully and cheerfully from the prophetically
presented future to his own actual present. With ואני he contrasts
himself as a member of the now still oppressed church with its proud
oppressors: he will be a perpetual herald of the ever memorable deed of
redemption. לעולם, says he, for, when he gives himself up so entirely to
God the Redeemer, for him there is no dying. If he is a member of the
ecclesia pressa, then he will also be a member of the ecclesia
triumphans; for ει ̓ ὑπομένομεν, καὶ συμβασιλεύσομεν ([Ti2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012).md). In the certainty of this
συμβασιλεύειν, and in the strength of God, which is even now mighty in
the weak one, he measures himself in v. 11 by the standard of what he
expresses in [Psa 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md) as God's own
work. On the figure compare [Deu
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md); [Lam
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003.md), and more especially the four
horns in the second vision of Zechariah, [Zac
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md). [Zac
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018.md).. The plural is both קרנות and
קרני, because horns that do not consist of horn are meant. Horns are
powers for offence and defence. The spiritual horns maintain the
sovereignty over the natural. The Psalm closes as subjectively as it
began. The prophetic picture is set in a lyric frame.
