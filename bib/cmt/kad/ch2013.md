[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 13:0</span></span>

The Reign of Abijah - 2 Chronicles 13

In the book of Kings it is merely remarked in general, that the hostile
relationship between Jeroboam and Rehoboam continued during his whole
life, and that between Abijah and Jeroboam there was war ([Ch2
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#006.md) and [Ch2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#007).md); but not one of his enterprises
is recounted, and only his attitude towards the Lord is exactly
characterized. In our chapter, on the contrary, we have a vivid and
circumstantial narrative of the commencement, course, and results of a
great war against Jeroboam, in which Abijah, with the help of the Lord,
inflicted a crushing defeat on the great army of the Israelites, and
conquered several cities.

[2 Chronicles 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 13:1</span></span>

The commencement and duration of the reign, as in [Kg1
15:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001.md). Abijah's mother is here ([Ch2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002).md) called Michaiah instead of
Maachah, as in [Ch2 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020.md) and [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002.md), but it can hardly be a second
name which Maachah had received for some unknown reason; probably מיכיהו
is a mere orthographical error for מעכה. She is here called, not the
daughter = granddaughter of Abishalom, but after her father, the
daughter of Uriel of Gibeah; see on [Ch2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020.md).

(Note: Against this Bertheau remarks, after the example of Thenius:
"When we consider that the wife of Abijah and mother of Asa was also
called Maachah, [Kg1 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013.md); [Ch2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016.md), and that in [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002.md) this Maachah is again called the
daughter of Abishalom, and that this latter statement is not met with in
the Chronicle, we are led to conjecture that Maachah, the mother of
Abijah, the daughter of Abishalom, has been confounded with Maachah the
mother of Asa, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah, and that in our passage
Asa's mother is erroneously named instead of the mother of Abijah." This
conjecture is a strange fabric of perverted facts and inconsequential
reasoning. In [Kg1 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002.md) Abijam's
mother is called Maachah the daughter of Abishalom, exactly as in [Ch2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020.md) and [Ch2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021.md); and in [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013.md), in perfect agreement with [Ch2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016.md), it is stated that Asa removed
Maachah from the dignity of Gebira because she had made herself a
statute of Asherah. This Maachah, deposed by Asa, is called in [Kg1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010.md) the daughter of Abishalom, and
only this latter remark is omitted from the Chronicle. How from these
statements we must conclude that the mother of Abijah, Maachah the
daughter of Abishalom, has been confounded with Maachah the mother of
Asa, the daughter of Uriel, we cannot see. The author of the book of
Kings knows only one Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom, whom in [Ch2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#002.md) he calls mother, i.e., גּבירה,
i.e., Sultana Walide of Abijah, and in [Ch2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#010.md) makes to stand in the same
relationship of mother to Asa. From this, however, the only natural and
logically sound conclusion which can be drawn is that Abijam's mother,
Rehoboam's wife, occupied the position of queen-mother, not merely
during the three years' reign of Abijam, but also during the first years
of the reign of his son Asa, as his grandmother, until Asa had deprived
her of this dignity because of her idolatry. It is nowhere said in
Scripture that this woman was Abijam's wife, but that is a conclusion
drawn by Thenius and Bertheau only from her being called אמּו, his
(Asa's) mother, as if אם could denote merely the actual mother, and not
the grandmother. Finally, the omission in the Chronicle of the statement
in [Kg1 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010.md), "The name of his mother
was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom," does not favour in the very
least the conjecture that Asa's mother has been confounded with the
mother of Abijah; for it is easily explained by the fact that at the
accession of Asa no change was made in reference to the dignity of
queen-mother, Abijah's mother still holding that position even under
Asa.)

[2 Chronicles 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 13:3</span></span>

The War between Abijah and Jeroboam. - היתה מלחמה, war arose, broke out.

[Ch2 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#003.md)

Abijah began the war with an army of 400,000 valiant warriors. בּחוּר
אישׁ, chosen men. את מ אסר, to bind on war, i.e., to open the war.
Jeroboam prepared for the war with 800,000 warriors. The number of
Jeroboam's warriors is exactly that which Joab returned as the result,
as to Israel, of the numbering of the people commanded by David, while
that of Abijah's army is less by 100,000 men than Joab numbered in Judah
([Sa2 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#009).md).

[Ch2 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#004.md)

When the two armies lay over against each other, ready for the combat,
Abijah addressed the enemy, King Jeroboam and all Israel, in a speech
from Mount Zemaraim. The mountain צמרים is met with only here; but a
city of this name is mentioned in [Jos
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#022.md), whence we would incline to the
conclusion that the mountain near or upon which this city lay was
intended. But if this city was situated to the east, not only of Bethel,
but also of Jerusalem, on the road to Jericho (see on [Jos
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#022).md), as we may conclude from its
enumeration between Beth-arabah and Bethel in Josh. loc. cit., it will
not suit our passage, at least if Zemaraim be really represented by the
ruin el Sumra to the east of Khan Hadur on the way from Jerusalem to
Jericho. Robinson (Phys. Geog. S. 38) conjectures Mount Zemaraim to the
east of Bethel, near the border of the two kingdoms, to which Mount
Ephraim also extends. Abijah represented first of all ([Ch2
13:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#005).md) to Jeroboam and the Israelites
that their kingdom was the result of a revolt against Jahve, who had
given the kingship over Israel to David and his sons for ever.

[Ch2 13:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#005.md)

"Is it not to you to know?" i.e., can it be unknown to you? מלח בּרית,
accus. of nearer definition: after the fashion of a covenant of salt,
i.e., of an irrevocable covenant; cf. on [Lev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013.md) and [Num
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019.md). "And Jeroboam, the servant of
Solomon the son of David (cf. [Kg1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#011).md), rebelled against his lord,"
with the help of frivolous, worthless men (רקים as in [Jdg
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004.md); [Jdg
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#003.md); בליּעל בּני as in [Kg1
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md), [Kg1
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013.md) -not recurring elsewhere in the
Chronicle), who gathered around him, and rose against Rehoboam with
power. על התאמּץ, to show oneself powerful, to show power against any
one. Against this rising Rehoboam showed himself not strong enough,
because he was an inexperienced man and soft of heart. נער denotes not
"a boy," for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he entered upon his
reign, but "an inexperienced young man," as in [Ch1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001.md). לבב רך, soft of heart, i.e.,
faint-hearted, inclined to give way, without energy to make a stand
against those rising insolently against him. lp' התחזק ולא, and showed
himself not strong before them, proved to be too weak in opposition to
them. This representation does not conform to the state of the case as
narrated in 2 Chron 10. Rehoboam did not appear soft-hearted and
compliant in the negotiation with the rebellious tribes at Sichem; on
the contrary, he was hard and defiant, and showed himself youthfully
inconsiderate only in throwing to the winds the wise advice of the older
men, and in pursuance of the rash counsel of the young men who had grown
up with him, brought about the rupture by his domineering manner. But
Abijah wishes to justify his father as much as possible in his speech,
and shifts all the guilt of the rebellion of the ten tribes from the
house of David on to Jeroboam and his worthless following.

[Ch2 13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#008.md)

Abijah then points out to his opponents the vanity of their trust in the
great multitude of their warriors and their gods, while yet they had
driven out the priests of Jahve. "And now ye say," scil. in your heart,
i.e., you think to show yourself strong before the kingdom of Jahve in
the hands of the sons of David, i.e., against the kingdom of Jahve ruled
over by the sons of David, by raising a great army in order to make war
upon and to destroy this kingdom. רב המון ואתּם, and truly ye are a
great multitude, and with you are the golden calves, which Jeroboam hath
made to you for gods; but trust not unto them, for Jahve, the true God,
have ye not for you as a helper.

[Ch2 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#009.md)

"Yea, ye have cast out the priests of Jahve, the sons of Aaron, and made
you priests after the manner of the nations of the lands. Every one who
has come, to fill his hand with a young bullock and ... he has become a
priest to the no-god." ידו מלּא, to fill his hand, denotes, in the
language of the law, to invest one with the priesthood, and connected
with ליהוה it signifies to provide oneself with that which is to be
offered to Jahve. To fill his hand with a young bullock, etc., therefore
denotes to come with sacrificial beasts, to cause oneself to be
consecrated priest. The animals mentioned also, a young bullock and
seven rams, point to the consecration to the priesthood. In Ex 29 a
young bullock as a sin-offering, a ram as a burnt-offering, and a ram as
a consecratory-offering, are prescribed for this purpose. These
sacrifices were to be repeated during seven days, so that in all seven
rams were required for consecratory-sacrifices. Abijah mentions only one
young bullock along with these, because it was not of any importance for
him to enumerate perfectly the sacrifices which were necessary. But by
offering these sacrifices no one becomes a priest of Jahve, and
consequently the priests of Jeroboam also are only priests for
Not-Elohim, i.e., only for the golden calves made Elohim by Jeroboam, to
whom the attributes of the Godhead did not belong.

[Ch2 13:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#010.md)

While, therefore, the Israelites have no-gods in their golden calves,
Judah has Jahve for its God, whom it worships in His temple in the
manner prescribed by Moses. "But in Jahve is our God, and we have not
forsaken Him," in so far, viz., as they observed the legal
Jahve-worship. So Abijah himself explains his words, "as priests serve
Him the sons of Aaron (who were chosen by Jahve), and the Levites are
בּמלאכת, in service," i.e., performing the service prescribed to them.
As essential parts of that service of God, the offering of the daily
burnt-offering and the daily incense-offering ([Exo
29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md)., [Ch2
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#007).md), the laying out of the
shew-bread ([Exo 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030.md); [Lev
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005)..md), the lighting of the lamps of
the golden candlesticks ([Exo 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037.md);
[Exo 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020)..md), are mentioned. In this
respect they keep the יהוה משׁמרת (cf. [Lev
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035).md).

[Ch2 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#012.md)

Abijah draws from all this the conclusion: "Behold, with us at our head
are (not the two calves of gold, but) God (האלהים with the article, the
true God) and His priests, and the alarm-trumpets to sound against you."
He mentions the trumpets as being the divinely appointed pledges that
God would remember them in war, and would deliver them from their
enemies, [Num 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md). Then he closes
with a warning to the Israelites not to strive with Jahve, the God of
their fathers.

[Ch2 13:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#013.md)

The war; Judah's victory, and the defeat of Jeroboam and the Israelites.
- [Ch2 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#013.md). Jeroboam caused the
ambush (the troops appointed to be an ambush) to go round about, so as
to come upon their rear (i.e., of the men of Judah); and so they (the
main division of Jeroboam's troops) were before Judah, and the ambush in
their rear (i.e., of the men of Judah); and the men of Judah, when they
turned themselves (scil. to attack), saw war before and behind them,
i.e., perceived that they were attacked in front and rear. In this
dangerous position the men of Judah cried to the Lord, and the priests
blew the trumpets ([Ch2 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#015).md); and as
they raised this war-cry, God smote their enemies so that they took to
flight. In ויּריעוּ and בּהריע the loud shout of the warriors and the
clangour of the trumpets in the hands of the priests are comprehended;
and הריע is neither to be taken to refer only to the war-cry raised by
the warriors in making the attack, nor, with Bertheau, to be referred
only to the blowing of the trumpets.

[Ch2 13:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#016.md)

So Abijah and his people inflicted a great blow (defeat) on the
Israelites, so that 500,000 of them, i.e., more than the half of
Jeroboam's whole army, fell.

[Ch2 13:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#018.md)

The results of this victory. The Israelites were bowed down, their power
weakened; the men of Judah became strong, mighty, because they relied
upon Jahve their God. Following up his victory, Abijah took from
Jeroboam several cities with their surrounding domains: Bethel, the
present Beitin, see on [Jos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md);
Jeshanah, occurring only here, and the position of which has not yet
been ascertained; and Ephron (עפרון, Keth.; the Keri, on the contrary,
עפרין). This city cannot well be identified with Mount Ephron, [Jos
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009.md); for that mountain was situated
on the southern frontier of Benjamin, not far from Jerusalem, while the
city Ephron is to be sought much farther north, in the neighbourhood of
Bethel. C. v. Raumer and others identify Ephron or Ephrain both with
Ophrah of Benjamin, which, it is conjectured, was situated near or in
Tayibeh, to the east of Bethel, and with the Ἐφραΐ́μ, [Joh
11:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#054.md), whither Jesus withdrew into the
wilderness, which, according to Josephus, Bell. Jud. iv. 9. 9, lay in
the neighbourhood of Bethel. See on [Jos
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023.md).

(Note: The account of this war, which is peculiar to the Chronicle, and
which de Wette declared, on utterly insufficient grounds, to be an
invention of the chronicler (cf. against him my apol. Vers. ber die
Chron. S. 444ff.), is thus regarded by Ewald (Gesch. Isr. iii. S. 466,
der 2 Aufl.): "The chronicler must certainly have found among his
ancient authorities an account of this conclusion of the war, and we
cannot but believe that we have here, in so far, authentic tradition;"
and only the details of the description are the results of free
expansion by the chronicler, but in the speech [Ch2
13:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#004.md) every word and every thought
is marked by the peculiar colouring of the Chronicle. But this last
assertion is contradicted by Ewald's own remark, i. S. 203, that "in
[Ch2 13:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#004.md), [Ch2
13:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md), an antiquated manner of
speech and representation appears, while in the other verses, on the
contrary, those usual with the chronicler are found," - in support of
which he adduces the words בליּעל בּני, [Ch2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#007.md), and מלח בּרית, [Ch2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#005.md). According to this view, Abijah's
speech cannot have been freely draughted by the chronicler, but must
have been derived, at least so far as the fundamental thoughts are
concerned, from an ancient authority, doubtless the Midrash of the
prophet Iddo, cited in [Ch2 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#022.md). But
Ewald's further remark (iii. S. 466), that the author of the Chronicle,
because he regarded the heathenized Samaria of his time as the true
representative of the old kingdom of the ten tribes, seized this
opportunity to put into King Abijah's mouth a long denunciatory and
didactic speech, addressed at the commencement of the battle to the
enemy as rebels not merely against the house of David, but also against
the true religion, is founded upon the unscriptural idea that the
calf-worship of the Israelites was merely a somewhat sensuous form of
the true Jahve-worship, and was fundamentally distinct from the heathen
idolatry, and also from the idolatry of the later Samaritans. In the
judgment of all the prophets, not only of Hosea and Amos, but also of
the prophetic author of the book of Kings, the calf-worship was a
defection from Jahve, the God of the fathers, - a forsaking of the
commands of Jahve, and a serving of the Baals; cf. e.g., 1 Kings 13; 2
Kings 17:7-23. What Abijah says of the calf-worship of the Israelites,
and of Judah's attitude to Jahve and His worship in the temple, is
founded on the truth, and is also reconcilable with the statement in
[Kg1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003.md), that Abijah's heart was not
wholly devoted to the Lord, like David's heart. Abijah had promoted the
legal temple-worship even by consecratory gifts ([Kg1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015).md), and could consequently quite
well bring forward the worship of God in Judah as the true worship, in
contrast to the Israelitic calf-worship, for the discouragement of his
enemies, and for the encouragement of his own army; and we may
consequently regard the kernel, or the essential contents of the speech,
as being historically well-founded. The account of the war, moreover, is
also shown to be historical by the exact statement as to the conquered
cities in [Ch2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md), which evidently
has been derived from ancient authorities. Only in the statements about
the number of warriors, and of the slain Israelites, the numbers are not
to be estimated according to the literal value of the figures; for they
are, as has been already hinted in the commentary, only an expression in
figures of the opinion of contemporaries of the war, that both kings had
made a levy of all the men in their respective kingdoms capable of
bearing arms, and that Jeroboam was defeated with such slaughter that he
lost more than the half of his warriors.)

[Ch2 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#020.md)

Jeroboam could not afterwards gain power (כּוח עצר, as in [Ch1
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014).md): "And Jahve smote him, and he
died." The meaning of this remark is not clear, since we know nothing
further of the end of Jeroboam's life than that he died two years after
Abijah. ויּגּפהוּ can hardly refer to the unfortunate result of the war
([Ch2 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#015)..md), for Jeroboam outlived
the war by several years. We would be more inclined to understand it of
the blow mentioned in [Kg1 14:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001.md),
when God announced to him by Ahijah the extermination of his house, and
took away his son Abijah, who was mourned by all Israel.

[2 Chronicles 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 13:21</span></span>

Wives and children of Abijah. His death. - [Ch2
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#021.md). While Jeroboam was not able to
recover from the defeat he had suffered, Abijah established himself in
his kingdom (יתחזּק, cf. [Ch2 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#013).md),
and took to himself fourteen wives. The taking of these wives is not to
be regarded as later in time than his establishment of his rule after
the victory over Jeroboam. Since Abijah reigned only three years, he
must have already had the greater number of his wives and children when
he ascended the throne, as we may gather also from [Ch2
11:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021.md). The ו consec. with ישּׂא
serves only to connect logically the information as to his wives and
children with the preceding, as the great increase of his family was a
sign of Abijah's increase in strength, while Jeroboam's dynasty was soon
extirpated.

[Ch2 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#022.md)

As to the מדרשׁ of the prophet Iddo, see the Introduction.

13:23 ([Ch2 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001).md). This is remarked
here, because this rest was also a result of Abijah's great victory over
Jeroboam.
