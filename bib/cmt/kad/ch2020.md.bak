### [2 Chronicles Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 20:0</span></span>

Jehoshaphat's victory over the Moabites, Ammonites, and other nations;
and the remaining items of information as to his reign. - Vv. 1-30. The
victory over the hostile peoples who invaded Judah. In the succeeding
time, the Moabites and Ammonites, in alliance with other tribes of Mount
Seir, invaded Judah with the purpose of driving the people of God out of
their country, and extirpating them ([Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001).md). On being informed of this
invasion, Jehoshaphat sought help of the Lord, while he proclaimed a
fast in the land, and in the temple before the assembled people prayed
God for His help ([Ch2 20:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002).md); and
received by the mouth of the prophet Jahaziel the promise that God would
fight for Judah, and that king and people would next day behold the help
the Lord would give ([Ch2 20:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#013).md).
And so it happened. On the following day, when the Judaean army, with
the Levitic singers and players at their head, came into the wilderness
Jeruel, their enemies had by the dispensation of God mutually destroyed
each other ([Ch2 20:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019).md), so that
Jehoshaphat and his people found the proposed battle-field full of
corpses, and gathered spoil for three days, and then on the fourth day,
in the Valley of Blessing, they praised the Lord for the wonderful
deliverance; thereafter returning to Jerusalem with joy, again to thank
the Lord in the house of God for His help ([Ch2
20:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#025).md).

[2 Chronicles 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 20:1</span></span>

By אהרי־כן, postea, the war which follows is made to fall in the latter
part of Jehoshaphat's reign, but certainly not in the last year in which
he reigned alone, two years before his death, but only somewhat later
than the events in 2 Chron 18 and [Ch2
19:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001.md), which occurred six or seven
years before his death. Along with the Moabites and Ammonites there
marched against Jehoshaphat also מהעמּונים. This statement is obscure.
Since מן has unquestionably a partitive or local signification, we might
take the word to signify, enemies who dwelt aside from the Ammonites (מן
as in [Sa1 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#022.md), [Sa1
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#037).md), which might possibly be the
designation of tribes in the Syro-Arabic desert bordering upon the
country of the Ammonites on the north and east; and מארם in [Ch2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md) would seem to favour this idea.
But [Ch2 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md) and [Ch2
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md). are scarcely reconcilable with
this interpretation, since there, besides or along with the sons of
Ammon and Moab, inhabitants of Mount Seir are named as enemies who had
invaded Judah. Now the Edomites dwelt on Mount Seir; but had the
Edomites only been allies of the Ammonites and Moabites, we should
expect simply אדם בּני or אדומים, or שׂעיר בּני (cf. [Ch2
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#011.md), [Ch2
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014).md). Nor can it be denied that the
interpretation which makes מהעמּונים to denote peoples dwelling beyond
the Ammonites is somewhat artificial and far-fetched. Under these
circumstances, the alteration proposed by Hiller in Onomast. p. 285
commends itself, viz., the change of מהעמונים into מהמּעוּנים, Maunites
or Maonites, - a tribe whose headquarters were the city Maan in the
neighbourhood of Petra, to the east of the Wady Musa; see on [Ch1
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041.md). Maan lay upon Mount Seir, i.e.,
in the mountainous district to the west of the Arabah, which stretches
upwards from the head of the Dead Sea to the Elanitic Gulf, now called
Jebl (Gebalene) in its northern part, and es-Sherah in the south. The
Maunites were consequently inhabitants of Mount Seir, and are here
mentioned instead of the Edomites, as being a people dwelling on the
southern side of the mountain, and probably of non-Edomitic origin, in
order to express the idea that not merely the Edomites took part in the
campaign of the Ammonites and Moabites, but also tribes from all parts
of Mount Seir. In [Ch2 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007.md) the
מעוּנים are mentioned along with Arabs and Philistines as enemies of
Israel, who had been conquered by Uzziah. These circumstances favour the
proposed alteration; while, on the contrary, the fact that the lxx have
here ἐκ τῶν Μιναίων for מהעמּונים proves little, since these translators
have rendered העמּונים in [Ch2 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008.md)
also by οἱ Μιναῖοι, there erroneously making the Ammonites Minaiites.

[2 Chronicles 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 20:2</span></span>

Then they came and announced to Jehoshaphat, sc. messengers or
fugitives; the subject is indefinite, and is to be supplied from the
context. "Against thee there cometh a great multitude from beyond the
(Dead) sea." מארם also has no suitable sense here, since in the whole
narrative nothing is said of enemies coming out of Syria; we should read
מאדם with Calmet and others. As the enemy made their attack from the
south end of the Dead Sea, the messengers announce that they were come
from Edom. "Behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar," i.e., Engedi, the
present Ain Jidy, midway along the west coast of the Dead Sea (see on
[Jos 15:62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062.md) and [Gen
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007).md), about fifteen hours from
Jerusalem.

[2 Chronicles 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 20:3</span></span>

This report filled Jehoshaphat with fear, and he resolved to seek help
of the Lord. ??????? נתן = שׂוּם , cf. [Kg2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018.md); [Jer
42:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#015.md), to direct the face to anything,
i.e., to purpose something, come to a determination. He proclaimed a
fast in all Judah, that the people might bow themselves before God, and
supplicate His help, as was wont to be done in great misfortunes; cf.
[Jdg 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md); [Sa1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006.md); [Isa
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#015.md). In consequence of the royal
appeal, Judah came together to seek of the Lord, i.e., to pray for help,
by fasting and prayer in the temple; and it was not only the inhabitants
of Jerusalem who thus assembled, for they came out of all the cities of
the kingdom. מיהוה בּקּשׁ, to seek of the Lord, sc. help, is expressed
in the last clause by את־יהוה בּקּשׁ to seek the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 20:5</span></span>

When the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem had assembled themselves in
the house of God, Jehoshaphat came forth before the new court and made
supplication in fervent prayer to the Lord. The new court is the outer
or great court of the temple, which Solomon had built ([Ch2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009).md). It is here called the new court,
probably because it had been restored or extended under Jehoshaphat or
Asa. This court was the place where the congregation assembled before
God in the sanctuary. Jehoshaphat placed himself before it, i.e., at the
entrance into the court of the priests, so that the congregation stood
opposite to him.

[2 Chronicles 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 20:6</span></span>

The prayer which Jehoshaphat directed to Jahve the God of the fathers,
as the almighty Ruler over all kingdoms, consists of a short
representation of the circumstances of the case. Jahve had given the
land to His people Israel for an everlasting possession, and Israel had
built a sanctuary to His name therein ([Ch2
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007.md) and [Ch2
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#008).md); but they had in no way provoked
the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites to fall upon them, and to drive
them out of their land ([Ch2 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md) and
[Ch2 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#011).md). On these two facts
Jehoshaphat founds his prayer for help, in a twofold manner: in respect
to the first, calling to mind the divine promise to hear the prayers
offered up to God in the temple ([Ch2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#009).md); and in reference to the second,
laying emphasis upon the inability of Israel to fight against so
numerous an enemy ([Ch2 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#012).md). In his
manner of addressing Jahve, "God of our fathers," there is contained a
reason why God should protect His people in their present distress. Upon
Him, who had given the land to the fathers for a possession, it was
incumbent to maintain the children in the enjoyment of it, if they had
not forfeited it by their sins. Now Jahve as a covenant God was bound to
do this, and also as God and ruler of heaven and earth He had the
requisite power and might; cf. [Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003.md). להתיצּב עמּך אין, there is none
with Thee who could set himself, i.e., could withstand Thee: cf. the
similar phrase, [Ch2 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#010.md); and for
the thought, see [Ch1 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#012.md). - On [Ch2
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007.md), cf. [Jos
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#009.md); [Jos
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#012.md); [Exo
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md)., etc.; on [Ch2
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007.md), cf. [Gen
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015.md)., [Ch2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#018.md), etc.; on אהבך, [Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008.md).

[2 Chronicles 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 20:8</span></span>

In this land they dwelt, and built Thee therein a sanctuary for Thy
name; cf. [Ch2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#005.md), [Ch2
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#008.md). לאמר, saying, i.e., at the
consecration of this house, having expressed the confident hope
contained in the following words ([Ch2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#009).md). In this verse, the cases
enumerated in Solomon's dedicatory prayer, in which supplication is made
that God would hear in the temple, are briefly summed up. By referring
to that prayer, Jehoshaphat presupposes that Jahve had promised that He
would answer prayer offered there, since He had filled the temple with
His glory; see [Ch2 7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md). The name
שׁפות, which occurs only here, between דּבר and חרב, denotes in this
connection a punitive judgment.

[2 Chronicles 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 20:10</span></span>

ועתּה, and now, the contrary of this has occurred. Peoples into whose
midst (בהם לבוא...אשׁר) Thou didst not allow Israel to come, i.e., into
whose land Thou didst not allow Israel to enter when they came out of
the land of Egypt, for they (the Israelites under Moses) turned from
them and destroyed them not (cf. as to the fact, [Num
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014.md).; [Deu
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004.md); [Deu
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#019).md); behold, these peoples
recompense us by coming to cast us out of our possession which Thou hast
given us (הורישׁ, to give as a possession, as in [Jdg
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024).md). There follows hereupon in [Ch2
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#012.md) the prayer: "Our God, wilt Thou
not judge," i.e., do right upon them, for we have not strength before
(to withstand) this multitude? We know not what to do, sc. against so
many enemies; but our eyes are turned to Thee, i.e., to Thee we look for
help; cf. [Psa 123:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#002.md); [Psa
141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008.md).

[2 Chronicles 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 20:13</span></span>

Thus all Judah, with their king, stood praying before the Lord. They
had, moreover, brought with them their little ones, their wives, and
their sons, to pray for deliverance for them from the enemy; cf. Judith
4:9.

[2 Chronicles 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 20:14</span></span>

The Lord's answer by the prophet Jahaziel. - [Ch2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md). In the midst of the assembly
the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel, a Levite of the sons of
Asaph, and promised miraculous assistance to king and people. Jahaziel's
descent is traced back for five generations to the Levite Mattaniah of
the sons of Asaph. This Mattaniah is not the same person as the
Mattaniah in [Ch1 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md), [Ch1
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#016.md), who lived in David's time, for
he belonged to the sons of Heman; but perhaps (as Movers conjectures, S.
112) he is identical with the Asaphite Nethaniah, [Ch1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md), [Ch1
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#012.md), since מ and נ might easily be
confounded.

[Ch2 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#015.md)

Jehaziel announced to the king and people that they need not fear before
the great multitude of their foes; "for the war is not yours, but
Jahve's," i.e., you have not to make war upon them, for the Lord will do
it; cf. [Sa1 17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047.md).

[Ch2 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#016.md)

"To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the height
Hazziz; and ye will find them at the end of the valley, before the
desert Jeruel." The wilderness Jeruel was, without doubt, the name of a
part of the great stretch of flat country, bounded on the south by the
Wady el Ghr, and extending from the Dead Sea to the neighbourhood of
Tekoa, which is now called el Hasasah, after a wady on its northern
side. The whole country along the west side of the Dead Sea, "where it
does not consist of mountain ridges or deep valley, is a high
table-land, sloping gradually towards the east, wholly waste, merely
covered here and there with a few bushes, and without the slightest
trace of having ever been cultivated" (Robinson's Pal. sub voce). The
name הצּיץ מעלה, ascent or height of Hazziz, has perhaps remained
attached to the Wady el Hasasah. lxx have rendered הצּיץ by Ἀσσεῖς;
Josephus (Antt. ix. 1. 2) has ἀναβάσεως λεγομένης ἐξοχῆς, in accordance
with which Robinson (loc. cit.) takes the way "upwards from Ziz" to be
the pass which at present leads from Ain Jidy to the table-land. Yet it
is described by him as a "fearful pass,"

(Note: He remarks: "The path winds up in zig-zags, often at the steepest
gradient which horses could ascend, and runs partly along projecting
walls of rock on the perpendicular face of the cliff, and then down the
heaps of dbris, which are almost as steep. When one looks back at this
part from below, it seems quite impossible that there could be any
pathway; but by skilful windings the path has been carried down without
any unconquerable difficulties, so that even loaded camels often go up
and down.")

and it can hardly be thought of here, even if the enemy, like the
Bedouins now when on their forays, may be supposed to have marched along
the shore of the sea, and ascended to the table-land only at Engedi; for
the Israelites did not meet the enemy in this ascent, but above upon the
table-land. Josephus' translation of הצּיץ by ἐξοχή is also very
questionable, for it is not necessary that the ה should be the article
(Ew. Gesch. iii. S. 475, der 2 Aufl.).

[Ch2 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#017.md)

Ye have not to fight therein (בּזאת); only come hither, stand and see
the help of the Lord (who is) with you. You need do nothing more, and
therefore need not fear.

[Ch2 20:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#018.md)

For this comforting assurance the king and people thanked the Lord,
falling down in worship before Him, whereupon the Levites stood up to
praise God with a loud voice. Levites "of the sons of Kohath, yea, of
the Korahites," for they were descended from Kohath ([Ch1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022).md).

[2 Chronicles 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 20:20</span></span>

The fulfilment of the divine promise. - [Ch2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md). On the next morning the
assembled men of Judah marched, in accordance with the words of the
prophet, to the wilderness of Tekoa. As they marched forth, Jehoshaphat
stood, probably in the gate of Jerusalem, where those about to march
forth were assembled, and called upon them to trust firmly in the Lord
and His prophets (האמינוּ and תּאמנוּ, as in [Isa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009).md). After he had thus counselled the
people (אל יוּעץ, shown himself a counsellor; cf. [Kg2
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008).md), he ordered them to march, not
for battle, but to assure themselves of the wonderful help of the Lord.
He placed singers of the Lord (ל before יהוה as a periphrasis for the
genitive), singing praise in holy ornaments, in the marching forth
before the army, and saying; i.e., he commanded the Levitic singers to
march out before the army, singing and playing in holy ornaments
(להדרת־ק, clad in holy ornaments, = בּהדרת in [Ch1
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#029); cf. Ew. 217, a.md), to praise the
Lord for the help He had vouchsafed.

[2 Chronicles 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 20:22</span></span>

And at the time when they (having come into the neighbourhood of the
hostile camp) began with singing and praising, Jahve directed liers in
wait against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who were come
against Judah, and they were smitten. מארבים denotes liers in wait, men
hidden in ambush and lying in wait ([Jdg
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#025).md). Who are here meant cannot be
ascertained with certainty. Some of the older commentators, Ew. and
Berth., think it refers to powers, angels sent by God, who are called
insidiatores, because of the work they had to do in the army of the
hostile peoples. But the passages where the interposition of heavenly
powers is spoken of are different (cf. [Kg2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017.md); [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md), and it is not probable that
heavenly powers would be called מארבים. Most probably earthly liers in
wait are meant, who unexpectedly rushed forth from their ambush upon the
hostile army, and raised a panic terror among them; so that, as is
narrated in [Ch2 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023.md)., the Ammonites
and Moabites first turned their weapons against the inhabitants of Mount
Seir, and after they had exterminated them, began to exterminate each
other. But the ambush cannot have been composed of men of Judah, because
they were, according to [Ch2 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#015.md) and
[Ch2 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#017.md), not to fight, but only to
behold the deliverance wrought by the Lord. Probably it was liers in
wait of the Seirites, greedy of spoil, who from an ambush made an attack
upon the Ammonites and Moabites, and by the divine leading put the
attacked in such fear and confusion, that they turned furiously upon the
inhabitants of Mount Seir, who marched with them, and then fell to
fighting with each other; just as, in [Jdg
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md)., the Midianites were, under
divine influence, so terrified by the unexpected attack of the small
band led by Gideon, that they turned their swords against and mutually
destroyed each other. שׂ בּיושׁבי וּככלּותם, and when they had come to
an end (were finished) among the inhabitants of Seir, when they had
massacred these, they helped the one against the other to destruction
(משׁחית is a substantive, as [Ch2
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#004.md); [Eze
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#016), etc..md).

[2 Chronicles 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 20:24</span></span>

Now, when Judah came to the height in the wilderness (מצפּה, specula,
watch-tower, here a height in the wilderness of Tekoa, whence one might
look out over the wilderness Jeruel, [Ch2
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#016).md), and turned, or was about to
turn, against the multitude of the enemy (ההמון referring back to [Ch2
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#012).md), behold, they saw "corpses
lying upon the earth, and none had escaped," i.e., they saw corpses in
such multitude lying there, that to all appearance none had escaped.

[2 Chronicles 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 20:25</span></span>

So Jehoshaphat, with his people, came (as Jahaziel had announced, not to
fight, but only to make booty) and found among them (בּהם, among or by
the fallen) in abundance both wealth and corpses and precious vessels.
The mention of פּגרים as part of the booty, between רכוּשׁ and the
precious vessels, is somewhat surprising. Some Codd. (4 Kennic. and 3 de
Rossi) and various ancient editions (Complut., the Brixenian used by
Luther, the Bomberg. of date 1518 and 21, and the Mnster) have, instead
of it, בּנדים; but it is very questionable if the lxx and Vulg. have it
(cf. de Rossi Variae Lectt. ad h. l.). בּגדים, garments, along with
רכוּשׁ, moveable property (cattle, tents, etc.), seems to suit better,
and is therefore held by Dathe and Berth. to be the correct and original
reading. Yet the proofs of this are not decisive, for פגרים is much
better attested, and we need not necessarily take רכוּשׁ to mean living
and dead cattle; but just as רכוּשׁ denotes property of any kind, which,
among nomadic tribes, consists principally in cattle, we may also take
פּגרים in the signification of slain men and beasts - the clothes of the
men and the accoutrements and ornaments of the beasts (cf. [Jdg
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#026).md) being a by no means worthless
booty. Garments as such are not elsewhere met with in enumerations of
things taken as booty, in [Jdg 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#026.md)
only the purple robes of the Midianite princes being spoken of; and to
the remark that the before-mentioned פּגרים has given rise to the
changing of בּגדים into פּגרים, we may oppose the equally well-supported
conjecture, that the apparently unsuitable meaning of the word פגרים may
have given rise to the alteration of it into בּגדים. חמדות כּלי are
probably in the main gold and silver ornaments, such as are enumerated
in [Jdg 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#025.md). And they spoiled for
themselves משּׂא לאין, "there was not carrying," i.e., in such abundance
that it could not be carried away, removed, and plundered in three days,
because the booty was so great. The unusually large quantity of booty is
accounted for by the fact that these peoples had gone forth with all
their property to drive the Israelites out of their inheritance, and to
take possession of their land for themselves; so that this invasion of
Judah was a kind of migration of the peoples, such as those which, at a
later time, have been repeated on a gigantic scale, and have poured
forth from Central Asia over the whole of Europe. In this, the purpose
of the hostile hordes, we must seek the reason for their destruction by
a miracle wrought of God. Because they intended to drive the people of
Israel out of the land given them by God, and to destroy them, the Lord
was compelled to come to the help of His people, and to destroy their
enemies.

[2 Chronicles 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#026.md)

On the fourth day the men of Judah gathered themselves together, to give
thanks to God the Lord for this blessing, in a valley which thence
received the name בּרכה עמק (valley of blessing), and which cannot have
been far from the battle-field. Thence they joyfully returned, with
Jehoshaphat at their head, to Jerusalem, and went up, the Levites and
priests performing solemn music, to the house of God, to render further
thanks to the Lord for His wondrous help ([Ch2
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#027)..md). The ancient name בּרכה still
exists in the Wady Bereikut, to the west of Tekoa, near the road which
leads from Hebron to Jerusalem. "A wide, open valley, and upon its west
side, on a small rising ground, are the ruins of Bereikut, which cover
from three to four acres" (Robinson's New Biblical Researches, and Phys.
Geogr. S. 106; cf. v. de Velde, Memoir, p. 292). Jerome makes mention of
the place in Vita Paulae, where he narrates that Paula, standing in
supercilio Caphar baruca, looked out thence upon the wide desert, and
the former land of Sodom and Gomorrah (cf. Reland, Pal. illustr. pp. 356
and 685). There is no ground, on the other hand, for the identification
of the valley of blessing with the upper part of the valley of Kidron,
which, according to [Joe 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md), [Joe
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#012.md), received the name of Valley of
Jehoshaphat (see on [Joe 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002).md). - On
[Ch2 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#027.md), cf. [Ezr
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022.md); [Neh
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#043.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch2 20:29</span></span>

The fame of this victory of the Lord over the enemies of Israel caused
the terror of God to be spread abroad over all the kingdoms of the
surrounding lands, in consequence of which the kingdom of Judah had rest
(cf. [Ch2 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#010).md). On the last clause
of [Ch2 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#030.md), cf. [Ch2
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#015.md). This wonderful acts of the Lord
is made the subject of praise to God in the Korahite Psalms, [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md), [Psa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md), and [Psa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md), and perhaps also in Ps 83,
composed by an Asaphite, perhaps Jahaziel (see Del. Introduction to
these Psalms).

Concluding notes on Jehoshaphat's reign, which are found also in [Kg1
22:41-51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#041.md), where they, supplemented by
some notes ([Kg1 22:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#045.md), [Kg1
22:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#048.md), and [Kg1
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049).md) which are wanting in the
Chronicle, form the whole account of his reign. In the statements as to
Jehoshaphat's age at his accession, and the length and character of his
reign, both accounts agree, except that the author of the Chronicle has,
instead of the stereotyped formula, "and the people still sacrificed and
offered incense upon the high places," a remark more significant of the
state of affairs: "and the people had not yet determinedly turned their
heart to the God of their fathers" ([Ch2
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#033).md). The notice that Jehoshaphat
made peace with the king of Israel ([Kg1
22:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#045).md) is not found in the Chronicle,
because that would, as a matter of course, follow from Jehoshaphat's
having joined affinity with the royal house of Ahab, and had been
already sufficiently attested by the narrative in 2 Chron 18, and is so
still further by the undertaking spoken of in [Ch2
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035.md). For the same reason, the clause
introduced in [Kg1 22:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#046.md) about the
valiant acts and the wars of Jehoshaphat is omitted in the Chronicle, as
these acts have been specially narrated here. As to Jehu's speeches,
which were put into the book of Kings, see the Introduction. Further,
the remark on the driving out of the remaining Sodomites (קדשׁ) from the
land, [Kg1 22:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#047.md), which refers back to
[Kg1 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012.md), is wanting here, because
this speciality is not mentioned in the case of Asa. Finally, the remark
that Edom had no king, but only a viceroy or deputy, serves in [Kg1
22:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#048.md) only as an introduction to the
succeeding account of Jehoshaphat's attempt to open up anew the sea
traffic with Ophir. But on that subject the author of the Chronicle only
recounts in [Ch2 20:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035.md) that
Jehoshaphat allied himself with the godless Ahaziah the king of Israel
to build in Ezion-gaber ships to go to Tarshish, was censured for it by
the prophet Eliezer, who announced to him that Jahve would destroy his
work, and that thereupon the ships were broken, doubtless by a storm,
and so could not go upon the voyage. אהרי־כן does not definitely fix the
time (cf. [Ch2 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001).md), but only states
that the alliance with Ahaziah took place after the victory over the
Ammonites and Moabites. Ahaziah ascended the throne in the seventeenth
year of Jehoshaphat, and reigned scarcely two years, and the enterprise
under discussion falls in that period. אתחבּר is an Aramaic form for
התחבּר.

The last clause of v. 38, "he did wickedly," Bertheau refers to
Jehoshaphat: he did wrong; because the context shows that these words
are intended to contain a censure on Jehoshaphat for his connection with
the king of the northern kingdom. But this remark, though substantially
correct, by no means proves that הוּא refers to Jehoshaphat. The words
contain a censure on Jehoshaphat on account of his alliance with
Ahaziah, even if they describe Ahaziah's conduct. We must, with the
older commentators, take the words to refer to Ahaziah, for הרשׁיע is
much too strong a word for Jehoshaphat's fault in the matter. The author
of the Chronicle does indeed use the word הרשׁיע of Jehoshaphat's
grandson Ahaziah, [Ch2 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#003.md), in the
clause, "his mother, a daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, was for הרשׁיע his
counsellor," but only that he may characterize the acts of the Ahabic
house. Jehoshaphat allied himself with the wicked Ahaziah to build ships
תּרשׁישׁ ללכת, to go to Tarshish; and they built ships at Ezion-gaber,
i.e., on the Red Sea. Instead of this, we have in [Kg1
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049.md) : Jehoshaphat built Tarshish
ships to go to Ophir for gold. Hence it is manifest that in both
passages the same undertaking is spoken of, and the expression "Tarshish
ships" is paraphrased in the Chronicle by "ships to go to Tarshish."
This periphrasis is, however, a mistake; for Tarshish ships are merely
ships which, like those going to Tarshish, were built for long sea
voyages, for Jehoshaphat merely desired to renew the voyages to Ophir.
With the exception of this erroneous interpretation of the words,
Tarshish ships, the two narratives agree, if we only keep in mind the
fact that both are incomplete extracts from a more detailed account of
this enterprise. The Chronicle supplies us with an explanatory
commentary on the short account in [Kg1
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049.md), both in the statement that
Jehoshaphat allied himself with Ahaziah of Israel for the preparation of
the ships, and also in communicating the word of the prophet Eliezer as
to the enterprise, which makes clear to us the reason for the
destruction of the ships; while in [Kg1
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049.md) merely the fact of their
destruction is recorded. Of the prophet Eliezer nothing further is known
than the saying here communicated. His father's name, Dodavahu, is
analogous in form to Hodavya, Joshavya (see on [Ch1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#024).md), so that there is no good ground
to alter it into דּודיּהוּ, friend of Jahve, after the Doodi'a of the
lxx. As to Mareshah, see on [Ch2 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#008.md).
The perfect פּרץ is prophetic: Jahve will rend thy work asunder. The
words which follow record the fulfilment. עצר as in [Ch2
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#020.md); [Ch2
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#010.md). With this the chronicler's
account of this enterprise concludes; while in [Kg1
22:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#050.md) it is further stated that, after
the destruction of the ships first built, Ahaziah called upon
Jehoshaphat still to undertake the Ophir voyage in common with him, and
to build new ships for the purpose, but Jehoshaphat would not. The
ground of his refusal may easily be gathered from [Ch2
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#037.md) of the Chronicle.
