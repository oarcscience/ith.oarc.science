The Royal Throne above the Sea of the Peoples

Side by side with those Psalms which behold in anticipation the
Messianic future, whether it be prophetically or only typically, or
typically and prophetically at the same time, as the kingship of Jahve's
Anointed which overcomes and blesses the world, there are others in
which the perfected theocracy as such is beheld beforehand, not,
however, as an appearing (parusia) of a human king, but as the appearing
of Jahve Himself, as the kingdom of God manifest in all its glory. These
theocratic Psalms form, together with the christocratic, two series of
prophecy referring to the last time which run parallel with one another.
The one has for its goal the Anointed of Jahve, who rules out of Zion
over all peoples; the other, Jahve sitting above the cherubim, to whom
the whole world does homage. The two series, it is true, converge in the
Old Testament, but do not meet; it is the history that fulfils these
types and prophecies which first of all makes clear that which flashes
forth in the Old Testament only in certain climaxes of prophecy and of
lyric too (vid., on [Psa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001).md), viz.,
that the parusia of the Anointed One and the parusia of Jahve is one and
the same.

Theocracy is an expression coined by Josephus. In contrast with the
monarchical, oligarchical, and democratic form of government of other
nations, he calls the Mosaic form θεοκρατία, but he does so somewhat
timidly, ὡς ἂν τις εἴποι βιασάμενος τὸν λόγον \[c. Apion. ii. 17\]. The
coining of the expression is thankworthy; only one has to free one's
self from the false conception that the theocracy is a particular
constitution. The alternating forms of government were only various
modes of its adjustment. The theocracy itself is a reciprocal
relationship between God and men, exalted above these intermediary
forms, which had its first manifest beginning when Jahve became Israel's
King ([Deu 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005.md), cf. [Exo
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#018).md), and which will be finally
perfected by its breaking through this national self-limitation when the
King of Israel becomes King of the whole world, that is overcome both
outwardly and spiritually. Hence the theocracy is an object of
prediction and of hope. And the word מלך is used with reference to Jahve
not merely of the first beginning of His imperial dominion, and of the
manifestation of the same in facts in the most prominent points of the
redemptive history, but also of the commencement of the imperial
dominion in its perfected glory. We find the word used in this lofty
sense, and in relation to the last time, e.g., in [Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md); [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md), and most unmistakeably in [Rev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017.md); [Psa
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006.md). And in this sense יהוה מלך is
the watchword of the theocratic Psalms. Thus it is used even in [Psa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md); but the first of the Psalms
beginning with this watchword is [Psa
93:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md). They are all post-exilic. The
prominent point from which this eschatological perspective opens out is
the time of the new-born freedom and of the newly restored state.

Hitzig pertinently says: "This Psalm is already contained in nuce in
[Psa 92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md) of the preceding Psalm,
which surely comes from the same author. This is at once manifest from
the jerking start of the discourse in [Psa
93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003.md) (cf. [Psa
92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010).md), which resolves the thought
into two members, of which the first subsides into the vocative יהוה."
The lxx (Codd. Vat. and Sin.) inscribes it: Εἰς τὴν ἡμέρην τοῦ
προσαββάτου, ὅτε κατῴκισται ἡ γῆ, αἶνος ᾠδῆς τῷ Δαυίδ. The third part of
this inscription is worthless. The first part (for which Cod. Alex.
erroneously has: τοῦ σαββάτου) is corroborated by the Talmudic
tradition. [Psa 93:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md) was really the
Friday Psalm, and that, as is said in Rosh ha-shana 31a, ומלך עליהן
(בשׁשׁי) על שׁם שׁגמר מלאכתו, because God then (on the sixth day) had
completed His creative work and began to reign over them (His
creatures); and that ὅτε κατῴκισται (al. κατῴκιστο) is to be explained
in accordance therewith: when the earth had been peopled (with
creatures, and more especially with men).

(Note: It is well known that his pausal form of the 3rd masc. praet.

with them in his grammar Michlol); with Tarcha in [Isa

Munach in [Sa1 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017) (שׁפט.md), and
according to Abulwald with Mercha in [Kg1

is historical, and it stands in the middle between the present מלך ה and
the future מלך :ה Jahve has entered upon the kingship and now reigns
Jahve's rule heretofore, since He has given up the use of His
omnipotence, has been self-abasement and self-renunciation: how,
however, He shows Himself in all His majesty, which rises aloft above
everything; He has put this on like a garment; He is King, and now too
shows Himself to the world in the royal robe. The first לבשׁ has
Olewejored; then the accentuation takes לבשׁ ה together by means of
Dech, and עז התאזּר together by means of Athnach. עז, as in [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md), points to the enemies; what
is so named is God's invincibly triumphant omnipotence. This He has put
on ([Isa 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009).md), with this He has
girded Himself - a military word ([Isa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009).md): Jahve makes war against
everything in antagonism to Himself, and casts it to the ground with the
weapons of His wrathful judgments. We find a further and fuller
description of this עז התאזר in [Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md); [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md)., cf. [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md).

(Note: These passages, together with [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md); [Psa
104:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001.md), are cited in Cant. Rabba 26b
(cf. Debarim Rabba 29d), where it is said that the Holy One calls Israel
כלה (bride) ten times in the Scriptures, and that Israel on the other
hand ten times assigns kingly judicial robes to Him.)

That which cannot fail to take place in connection with the coming of
this accession of Jahve to the kingdom is introduced with אף. The world,
as being the place of the kingdom of Jahve, shall stand without
tottering in opposition to all hostile powers ([Psa
96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010).md). Hitherto hostility towards God
and its principal bulwark, the kingdom of the world, have disturbed the
equilibrium and threatened all God-appointed relationships with
dissolution; Jahve's interposition, however, when He finally brings into
effect all the abundant might of His royal government, will secure
immoveableness to the shaken earth (cf. [Psa
75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004).md). His throne stands, exalted
above all commotion, מאז; it reaches back into the most distant past.
Jahve is מעולם; His being loses itself in the immemorial and the
immeasurable. The throne and nature of Jahve are not incipient in time,
and therefore too are not perishable; but as without beginning, so also
they are endless, infinite in duration.

[Psalms 93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 93:3</span></span>

All the raging of the world, therefore, will not be able to hinder the
progress of the kingdom of God and its final breaking through to the
glory of victory. The sea with its mighty mass of waters, with the
constant unrest of its waves, with its ceaseless pressing against the
solid land and foaming against the rocks, is an emblem of the Gentile
world alienated from and at enmity with God; and the rivers (floods) are
emblems of worldly kingdoms, as the Nile of the Egyptian ([Jer
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#007)..md), the Euphrates of the Assyrian
([Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007)..md), or more exactly, the
Tigris, swift as an arrow, of the Assyrian, and the tortuous Euphrates
of the Babylonian empire ([Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md).
These rivers, as the poet says whilst he raises a plaintive but
comforted look upwards to Jahve, have lifted up, have lifted up their
murmur, the rivers lift up their roaring. The thought is unfolded in a
so-called "parallelism with reservation." The perfects affirm what has
taken place, the future that which even now as yet is taking place. The
ἅπαξ λεγ. דּכי signifies a striking against (collisio), and a noise, a
din. One now in [Psa 93:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#004.md) looks for
the thought that Jahve is exalted above this roaring of the waves. מן
will therefore be the min of comparison, not of the cause: "by reason of
the roar of great waters are the breakers of the sea glorious" (Starck,
Geier), - which, to say nothing more, is a tautological sentence. But if
מן is comparative, then it is impossible to get on with the accentuation
of אדירים, whether it be with Mercha (Ben-Asher) or Dechמ
(Ben-Naphtali). For to render: More than the roar of great waters are
the breakers of the sea glorious (Mendelssohn), is impracticable, since
מים רבים are nothing less than ים ([Isa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012)..md), and we are prohibited from
taking אדירים משׁברי־ים as a parenthesis (Kצster), by the fact that it
is just this clause that is exceeded by אדיר במרום ה. Consequently
אדירים has to be looked upon as a second attributive to מים brought in
afterwards, and משׁבּרי־ים (the waves of the sea breaking upon the
rocks, or even only breaking upon one another) as a more minute
designation of these great and magnificent waters (אדירים, according to
[Exo 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#010).md),

(Note: A Talmudic enigmatical utterance of R. Azaria runs: באדירים יבא
אדיר ויפרע לאדירים מאדירים, Let the glorious One (Jahve, [Psa
93:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#004.md), cf. [Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034.md); [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021).md) come and maintain the right of
the glorious ones (Israel, [Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003).md)
against the glorious ones (the Egyptians, [Exo
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#010.md) according to the construction of
the Talmud) in the glorious ones (the waves of the sea, [Psa
93:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#004)).).md),

and it should have been accented: מים רבים אדירים משברי ים

מקלות. Jahve's celestial majesty towers far above all the noisy
majesties here below, whose waves, though lashed never so high, can
still never reach His throne. He is King of His people, Lord of His
church, which preserves His revelation and worships in His temple. This
revelation, by virtue of His unapproachable, all-overpowering kingship,
is inviolable; His testimonies, which minister to the establishment of
His kingdom and promise its future manifestation in glory, are λόγοι
πιστοί καὶ ἀληθινοί, [Rev 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009.md); [Rev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006.md). And holiness becometh His temple
(נאוה־קדשׁ, 3rd praet. Pilel, or according to the better attested
reading of Heidenheim and Baer, נאוה;

(Note: The Masora on Ps 147 reckons four נאוה, one ונאוה, and one נאוה
eno d, and therefore our נאוה is one of the יז מלין דמפקין אלף וכל חד
לית מפיק (cf. Frensdorf's Ochla we-Ochla, p. 123), i.e., one of the
seventeen words whose Aleph is audible, whilst it is otherwise always
quiescent; e.g., כּמוצאת, otherwise מוצאת.)

therefore the feminine of the adjective with a more loosened syllable
next to the tone, like יחשׁב־לּי in Ps 40:18), that is to say, it is
inviolable (sacrosanct), and when it is profaned, shall ever be
vindicated again in its holiness. This clause, formulated after the
manner of a prayer, is at the same time a petition that Jahve in all
time to come would be pleased to thoroughly secure the place where His
honour dwells here below against profanation.
