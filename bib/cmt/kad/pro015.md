### [Proverbs Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 15:1</span></span>

We take these verses together as forming a group which begins with a
proverb regarding the good and evil which flows from the tongue, and
closes with a proverb regarding the treasure in which blessing is found,
and that in which no blessing is found.

[Pro 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001.md)

1 A soft answer turneth away wrath,

And a bitter word stirreth up anger.

In the second line, the common word for anger (אף, from the breathing
with the nostrils, [Pro 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#017).md) is
purposely placed, but in the first, that which denotes anger in the
highest degree (חמה from יחם, cogn. חמם, Arab. hamiya, to glow, like
שׁנה from ישׁן): a mild, gentle word turns away the heat of anger
(excandescentiam), puts it back, cf. [Pro
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#015.md). The Dagesh in רּך follows the
rule of the דחיק, i.e., of the close connection of a word terminating
with the accented eh, aah, ah with the following word (Michlol 63b). The
same is the meaning of the Latin proverb:

Frangitur ira gravis

Quando est responsio suavis.

The דבר־עצב produces the contrary effect. This expression does not mean
an angry word (Ewald), for עצב is not to be compared with the Arab.
ghaḍab, anger (Umbreit), but with Arab. 'aḍb, cutting, wounding, paining
(Hitzig), so that דבר מעציב is meant in the sense of [Psa
78:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040.md) : a word which causes pain (lxx
λυπηρός, Theod. πονικός), not after the meaning, a word provoking to
anger (Gesenius), but certainly after its effect, for a wounding word
"makes anger arise." As one says of anger שׁב, "it turns itself" (e.g.,
[Isa 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011).md), so, on the other hand,
עלה, "it rises up," [Ecc 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md). The lxx
has a third line, ὀργὴ ἀπόλλυσι καὶ φρονίμους, which the Syr. forms into
a distich by the repetition of [Pro
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032.md), the untenableness of which is
at once seen.

[Pro 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002.md)

The πραΰ́της σοφίας ([Jam 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013).md)
commended in [Pro 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001.md) is here
continued:

The tongue of the wise showeth great knowledge,

And the mouth of fools poureth forth folly.

As היטיב נגּן, [Isa 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#016.md), means to
strike the harp well, and היטיב לכת, [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md), to go along merrily, so היטיב
דּעת, to know in a masterly manner, and here, where the subject is the
tongue, which has only an instrumental reference to knowledge: to bring
to light great knowledge (cf. 7a). In 2b the lxx translate στόμα δὲ
ἀφρόνων ἀναγγέλλει κακά. From this Hitzig concludes that they read רעות
as 28b, and prefers this phrase; but they also translated in [Pro
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#016.md); [Pro
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#028.md); [Pro
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011.md), אוּלת by κακίαν, for they
interpreted the unintelligible word by combination with עולת, and in
[Pro 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#023.md) by ἀραῖς, for they thought
they had before them אלות (from אלה).

[Pro 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003.md)

3 The eyes of Jahve are in every place,

Observing the evil and the good.

The connection of the dual עינים with the plur. of the adjective, which
does not admit of a dual, is like [Pro
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#017.md), cf. 18. But the first line is a
sentence by itself, to which the second line gives a closer
determination, as showing how the eyes of God are everywhere (cf. [Ch2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009.md), after [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010).md) abroad over the whole earth,
viz., beholding with penetrating look the evil and the good (צפה, to
hold to, to observe, cf. ἐπιβλέποντες, Sir. 23:19), i.e., examining men
whether they are good or evil, and keeping them closely before His eyes,
so that nothing escapes him. This universal inspection, this omniscience
of God, has an alarming but also a comforting side. The proverb seeks
first to warn, therefore it speaks first of the evil.

[Pro 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004.md)

4 Gentleness of the tongue is a tree of life;

But falseness in it is a wounding to the spirit.

Regarding מרפּא, vid., at [Pro 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#018.md),
and regarding סלף, at [Pro 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003.md); this
latter word we derive with Fleischer from סלף, to subvert, overthrow,
but not in the sense of "violence, asperitas, in as far as violent
speech is like a stormy sea," but of perversity, perversitas (Venet.
λοξότης), as the contrast to truthfulness, rectitude, kindness.
Gentleness characterizes the tongue when all that it says to a
neighbour, whether it be instruction or correction, or warning or
consolation, it says in a manner without rudeness, violence, or
obtrusiveness, by which it finds the easiest and surest acceptance,
because he feels the goodwill, the hearty sympathy, the humility of him
who is conscious of his own imperfection. Such gentleness is a tree of
life, whose fruits preserve life, heal the sick, and raise up the bowed
down. Accordingly, שׁבר בּרוּח is to be understood of the effect which
goes forth from perversity or falseness of the tongue upon others.
Fleischer translates: asperitas autem in ea animum vulnerat, and
remarks, "שׁבר ברוח, abstr. pro concreto. The verb שׁבר, and the n.
verbale שׁבר derived from it, may, in order to render the meaning
tropical, govern the prep. בּ, as the Arab. kaser baḳlby, he has broken
my heart (opp. Arab. jabar baḳlaby), cf. בּפניו, [Pro
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#029.md), vid., De Glossis Habichtianis,
p. 18; yet it also occurs with the accus., [Psa
69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021.md), and the corresponding gen. שׁבר
רוּח, [Isa 65:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#014.md)." In any case, the
breaking (deep wounding) is not meant in regard to his own spirit, but
to that of the neighbour. Rightly Luther: but a lying (tongue) makes
heart-sorrow (elsewhere, a false one troubles the cheerful); Euchel: a
false tongue is soul-wounding; and the translation of the year 1844:
falsehood is a breach into the heart. Only for curiosity's sake are two
other interpretations of 4a and 4b mentioned: the means of safety to the
tongue is the tree of life, i.e., The Tor (Erachin 15b); and: perversity
suffers destruction by a breath of wind, after the proverb, כל שׁישׁ בו
גסות רוח רוח קימעא שׁוברתו, a breath of wind breaks a man who is puffed
up

(Note: Vid., Duke's Rabbinische Blumenlese, p. 176, where the rendering
is somewhat different.)

(which Meri presents for choice, vid., also Rashi, who understands רוח
of the storm of judgment). The lxx translates, in 4b, a different text:
ὁ δὲ συντηρῶν αὐτὴν πλησθήσεται πνεύματος; but the ישׂבּע רוּח here
supposed cannot mean "to be full of spirit," but rather "to eat full of
wind." Otherwise the Syr. and Targ.: and he who eateth of his own fruit
is satisfied (Heb. ואכל מפּריו ישׂבּע) - an attempt to give to the
phrase ישׂבע a thought correct in point of language, but one against
which we do not give up the Masoretic text.

[Pro 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#005.md)

5 A fool despiseth his father's correction;

But he that regardeth reproof is prudent.

We may with equal correctness translate: he acts prudently (after [Sa1
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#022).md); and, he is prudent (after [Pro
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025).md). We prefer, with Jerome,
Venet., and Luther, the latter, against the lxx, Syr., and Targ.,
because, without a doubt, the יערם is so thought of at [Pro
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025.md) : the contrast is more
favourable to the former. It is true that he who regardeth reproof is
not only prudent, but also that he is prudent by means of observing it.
With line first cf. [Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md) and [Pro
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#030.md), and with line second, [Pro
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#001.md). Luther translates: the fool
calumniates...; but of the meanings of abuse (properly pungere) and
scorn, the second is perhaps here to be preferred.

[Pro 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#006.md)

6 The house of the righteous is a great treasure-chamber;

But through the gain of the wicked comes trouble.

The contrast shows that חסן does not here mean force or might (lxx,
Syr., Targ., Jerome, and Venet.), which generally this derivative of the
verb חסן never means, but store, fulness of possession, prosperity
(Luther: in the house of the righteous are goods enough), in this sense
(cf. [Pro 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024).md) placing itself, not
with the Arab. ḥasuna, to be firm, fastened (Aram. ḥsn, חסן), but with
Arab. khazan, to deposit, to lay up in granaries, whence our "Magazin."
חסן may indeed, like חיל, have the meaning of riches, and חסן does
actually mean, in the Jewish-Aram., to possess, and the Aphel אחסן, to
take into possession (κρατεῖν); but the constant use of the noun חסן in
the sense of store, with the kindred idea of laying up, e.g., [Jer
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#005.md), and of the Niph. נחסן, which
means, [Isa 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md), with נאצר, "to be
magazined," gives countenance to the idea that חסן goes back to the
primary conception, recondere, and is to be distinguished from חסון,
חסין, and other derivatives after the fundamental conception. We may not
interpret בּית, with Fleischer, Bertheau, and Zckler, as accus.: in the
house (cf. בּית, [Pro 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002).md), nor
prepositionally as chez = casa; but: "the house of the righteous is a
great store," equivalent to, the place of such. On the contrary,
destruction comes by the gain of the wicked. It is impossible that
נעכּרת can have the house as the subject (Lwenstein), for בּית is
everywhere mas. Therefore Abulwald, followed by Kimchi and the Venet.
(ὄλεθρος), interprets נעכרת as subst., after the form of the Mishnic
נברכת, a pool, cf. נחרצה, peremptorily decided, decreed; and if we do
not extinguish the ב of וּבתבוּאת (the lxx according to the second
translation of this doubly-translated distich, Syr., and Targ.), there
remains then nothing further than to regard נעכרת either as subst. neut.
overturned = overthrow (cf. such part. nouns as מוּסדה, מוּעקה, but
particularly נסבּה, [Ch2 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#015).md), or as
impers. neut. pass.: it is overthrown = there is an overthrow, like
נשׂערה, [Psa 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md) : it is stormed = a
storm rages. The gain of the wicked has overthrow as its consequence,
for the greed of gain, which does not shrink from unrighteous, deceitful
gain, destroys his house, עכר בּיתו, [Pro
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#027.md) (vid., regarding עצר, [Pro
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#029).md). Far from enriching the house,
such gain is the cause of nothing but ruin. The lxx, in its first
version of this distich, reads, in 6a, בּרבות צדק (ἐν πλεοναζούσῃ
δικαιοσύνῃ), and in 6b, וּבתבוּאת רשׁע נעכּר (and together with the
fruit the godless is rooted out, ὁλόῤῥιζοι ἐκ γῆς ἀπολοῦνται); for, as
Lagarde has observed, it confounds עכר with עקר (to root, privativ: to
root up).

[Proverbs 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 15:7</span></span>

A second series which begins with a proverb of the power of human
speech, and closes with proverbs of the advantages and disadvantages of
wealth.

[Pro 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#007.md)

7 The lips of the wise spread knowledge;

But the direction is wanting to the heart of fools.

It is impossible that לא־כן can be a second object. accus. dependent on
יזרוּ (dispergunt, not יצּרוּ, [Pro
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#028.md); φυλάσσουσι, as Symmachus
translates): but the heart of fools is unrighteous (error or falsehood)
(Hitzig after [Isa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006).md); for then why
were the lips of the wise and the heart of the fools mentioned? לא־כן
also does not mean οὐχ οὕτως (an old Greek anonymous translation,
Jerome, Targ., Venet., Luther): the heart of the fool is quite different
from the heart of the wise man, which spreads abroad knowledge (Zckler),
for it is not heart and heart, but lip and heart, that are placed
opposite to each other. Better the lxx οὐκ ἀσφαλεῖς, and yet better the
Syr. lo kinı̂n (not right, sure). We have seen, at [Pro
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#019.md), that כן as a participial adj.
means standing = being, continuing, or also standing erect = right,
i.e., rightly directed, or having the right direction; כּן־צדקה means
there conducting oneself rightly, and thus genuine rectitude. What,
after 7a, is more appropriate than to say of the heart of the fool, that
it wants the receptivity for knowledge which the lips of the wise
scatter abroad? The heart of the fool is not right, it has not the right
direction, is crooked and perverse, has no mind for wisdom; and that
which proceeds from the wise, therefore, finds with him neither
estimation nor acceptance.

[Pro 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md)

8 The sacrifice of the godless is an abhorrence to Jahve;

But the prayer of the upright is His delight.

Although the same is true of the prayer of the godless that is here said
of their sacrifice, and of the sacrifice of the righteous that is here
said of their prayer (vid., [Pro 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009.md),
and cf. [Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md) with [Psa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006).md), yet it is not by accident that
here (line first = [Pro 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027).md) the
sacrifice is ascribed to the godless and the prayer to the upright. The
sacrifice, as a material and legally-required performance, is much more
related to dead works than prayer freely completing itself in the word,
the most direct expression of the personality, which, although not
commanded by the law, because natural to men, as such is yet the soul of
all sacrifices; and the Chokma, like the Psalms and Prophets, in view of
the ceremonial service which had become formal and dead in the opus
operatum, is to such a degree penetrated by the knowledge of the
incongruity of the offering up of animals and of plants, with the object
in view, that a proverb like "the sacrifice of the righteous is pleasing
to God" never anywhere occurs; and if it did occur without being
expressly and unavoidably referred to the legal sacrifice, it would have
to be understood rather after [Psa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018.md). than Ps. 51:20f., rather after
[Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md) than after [Psa
66:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013.md). זבח, which, when it is
distinguished from עולה, means (cf. [Pro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014).md) the sacrifice only in part
coming to the altar, for the most part applied to a sacrificial feast,
is here the common name for the bloody, and, per synecdochen, generally
the legally-appointed sacrifice, consisting in external offering. The
לרצין, [Lev 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md), used in the Tra of
sacrifices, is here, as at Ps. 19:15, transferred to prayer. The
fundamental idea of the proverb is, that sacrifices well-pleasing to
God, prayers acceptable to God (that are heard, [Pro
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#029).md), depend on the relations in
which the heart and life of the man stand to God.

[Pro 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#009.md)

Another proverb with the key-word תועבת

An abomination to Jahve is the way of the godless;

But He loveth him who searcheth after righteousness.

The manner and rule of life is called the way. מרדּף is the heightening
of רדף, [Pro 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#021.md), and can be used
independently in bonam, as well as in malam partem ([Pro
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#019.md), cf. [Pro
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#021).md). Regarding the form יאהב, vid.,
Fleischer in Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitsch. xv. 382.

[Pro 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#010.md)

10 Sharp correction is for him who forsaketh the way;

Whoever hateth instruction shall die.

The way, thus absolute, is the God-pleasing right way ([Pro
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#013).md), the forsaking of which is
visited with the punishment of death, because it is that which leadeth
unto life ([Pro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017).md). And that which
comes upon them who leave it is called מוּסר רע, castigatio dura, as
much as to say that whoever does not welcome instruction, whoever
rejects it, must at last receive it against his will in the form of
peremptory punishment. The sharp correction (cf. [Isa
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028.md), [Isa
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019).md) is just the death under which
he falls who accepts of no instruction ([Pro
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023).md), temporal death, but that as a
token of wrath which it is not for the righteous ([Pro
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032).md).

[Pro 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011.md)

11 The underworld \[Sheol\] and the abyss are before Jahve;

But how much more the hearts of the children of men!

A syllogism, a minori ad majus, with אף כּי (lxx τῶς οὐχὶ καὶ, Venet.
μᾶλλον οὖν), like 12:32.

(Note: In Rabbin. this concluding form is called קל וחמר (light and
heavy over against one another), and דּין (judgment, viz., from
premisses, thus conclusion), κατ ̓ ἐξ. Instead of the biblical אף כי,
the latter form of the language has כּל־שׁכּן (all speaks for it that it
is so), על־אחת כּמּה וכמּה (so much the more), אינו דּין, or also קל
וחמר (as minori ad majus = quanto magis); vid., the Hebr. Rmerbrief, p.
14.)

אבדּון has a meaning analogous to that of τάρταρος (cf. ταρταροῦν, [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004), to throw down into the τάρταρος.md),
which denotes the lowest region of Hades (שׁאול תּחתּית or תּחתּיּה
'שׁ), and also in general, Hades. If אבדון and מות are connected, [Job
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md), and if אבדון is the parallel
word to קבר, [Psa 88:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#012.md), or also to
שׁאול, as in the passage similar to this proverb, [Job
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006.md) (cf. [Job
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017).md): "Shel is naked before Him, and
Abaddon has no covering;" since אבדון is the general name of the
underworld, including the grave, i.e., the inner place of the earth
which receives the body of the dead, as the kingdom of the dead, lying
deeper, does the soul. But where, as here and at [Pro
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#010.md), שׁאול and אבדון stand together,
they are related to each other, as ᾅδης and ταρταρος or ἅβυσσος, [Rev
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011.md) : אבדון is the lowest hell, the
place of deepest descent, of uttermost destruction. The conclusion which
is drawn in the proverb proceeds from the supposition that in the region
of creation there is nothing more separated, and by a wide distance,
from God, than the depth, and especially the undermost depth, of the
realm of the dead. If now God has this region in its whole compass wide
open before Him, if it is visible and thoroughly cognisable by Him (נגד,
acc. adv.: in conspectu, from נגד, eminere, conspicuum esse) - for He is
also present in the underworld, [Psa
139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008.md) - then much more will the hearts
of the children of men be open, the inward thoughts of men living and
acting on the earth being known already from their expressions. Man sees
through man, and also himself, never perfectly; but the Lord can try the
heart and prove the reins, [Jer 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md).
What that means this proverb gives us to understand, for it places over
against the hearts of men nothing less than the depths of the underworld
in eternity.

[Pro 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#012.md)

12 The scorner liketh not that one reprove him,

To wise men he will not go.

The inf. absol., abruptly denoting the action, may take the place of the
object, as here (cf. [Job 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#018.md); [Isa
42:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#024).md), as well as of the subject
([Pro 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#027.md), [Job
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025).md). Thus הוכיח is ([Pro
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007).md) construed with the dat. obj.
Regarding the probable conclusion which presents itself from passages
such as [Pro 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#012.md) and [Pro
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020.md), as to the study of wisdom in
Israel, vid., p. 39. Instead of אל, we read, [Pro
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020.md) (cf. [Pro
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024).md), את־; for לכת את־ means to have
intercourse with one, to go a journey with one ([Mal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006.md), cf. [Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md), but not [Sa2
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#022.md), where we are to translate with
Keil), according to which the lxx has here μετὰ δὲ σοφῶν οὐχ ὁμιλήσει.
The mocker of religion and of virtue shuns the circle of the wise, for
he loves not to have his treatment of that which is holy reproved, nor
to be convicted of his sin against truth; he prefers the society where
his frivolity finds approbation and a response.

[Pro 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013.md)

13 A joyful heart maketh the countenance cheerful;

But in sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.

The expression of the countenance, as well as the spiritual habitus of a
man, is conditioned by the state of the heart. A joyful heart maketh the
countenance טוב, which means friendly, but here happy-looking = cheerful
(for טוב ro is the most general designation of that which makes an
impression which is pleasant to the senses or to the mind); on the
contrary, with sorrow of heart (עצּבת, constr. of עצּבת, [Pro
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010), as חטאת = חטּאת, from חטּאה.md)
there is connected a stricken, broken, downcast heart; the spiritual
functions of the man are paralyzed; self-confidence, without which
energetic action is impossible, is shattered; he appears discouraged,
whereby רוּח is thought of as the power of self-consciousness and of
self-determination, but לב, as our "Gemt" \[animus\], as the oneness of
thinking and willing, and thus as the seat of determination, which
decides the intellectual-corporeal life-expression of the man, or
without being able to be wholly restrained, communicates itself to them.
The ב of וּבעצּבת is, as [Pro 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016.md).,
[Pro 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#008.md); [Pro
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md), meant in the force of being
together or along with, so that רוּח נכאה do not need to be taken
separate from each other as subject and predicate: the sense of the
noun-clause is in the ב, as e.g., also [Pro
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#023.md) (it is about his life, i.e., it
concerns his life). Elsewhere the crushed spirit, like the broken heart,
is equivalent to the heart despairing in itself and prepared for grace.
The heart with a more clouded mien may be well, for sorrow has in it a
healing power ([Ecc 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#003).md). But here the
matter is the general psychological truth, that the corporeal and
spiritual life of man has its regulator in the heart, and that the
condition of the heart leaves its stamp on the appearance and on the
activity of the man. The translation of the רוח נכאה by "oppressed
breath" (Umbreit, Hitzig) is impossible; the breath cannot be spoken of
as broken.

[Pro 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#014.md)

14 The heart of the understanding seeketh after knowledge,

And the mouth of fools practiseth folly.

Luther interprets רעה as metaphor. for to govern, but with such ethical
conceptions it is metaphor. for to be urgently circumspect about
anything (vid., [Pro 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020).md), like
Arab. ra'y and r'âyt, intentional, careful, concern about anything. No
right translation can be made of the Chethib פני, which Schultens,
Hitzig, Ewald, and Zckler prefer; the predicate can go before the פּני,
after the Semitic rule in the fem. of the sing., [Sa2
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#009.md), cf. [Job
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md), Chethib, but cannot follow in
the masc. of the sing.; besides, the operations of his look and aspect
are ascribed to his face, but not spiritual functions as here, much more
to the mouth, i.e., to the spirit speaking through it. The heart is
within a man, and the mouth without; and while the former gives and
takes, the latter is always only giving out. In [Pro
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#015.md), where a synonymous distich is
formed from the antithetic distich, the ear, as hearing, is mentioned
along with the heart as appropriating. נבון is not an adj., but is gen.,
like צדיק, 28a (opp. ופי). חכם, [Pro
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#023.md). The φιλοσοφία of the
understanding is placed over against the μωρολογία of the fools. The lxx
translates καρδία ὀρθὴ ζητεῖ αἲσθησιν (cf. [Pro
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010), καρδία ἀδρὸς αἰσθητική.md); it
uses this word after the Hellenistic usus loq. for דעת, of experimental
knowledge.

[Pro 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#015.md)

15 All the days of the afflicted are evil;

But he who is of a joyful heart hath a perpetual feast.

Regarding עני (the afflicted), vid., 21b. They are so called on whom a
misfortune, or several of them, press externally or internally. If such
an one is surrounded by ever so many blessings, yet is his life day by
day a sad one, because with each new day the feeling of his woe which
oppresses him renews itself; whoever, on the contrary, is of joyful
heart (gen. connection as [Pro 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#013.md);
[Pro 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#008)), such an one (his life.md) is
always a feast, a banquet (not משׁתּה, as it may be also pointed, but
משׁתּה and תּמיד thus adv., for it is never adj.; the post-bib. usage is
תּמידין for עולות תּמיד). Hitzig (and also Zckler) renders 15b: And (the
days) of one who is of a joyful heart are.... Others supply לו (cf. [Pro
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#007).md), but our rendering does not need
that. We have here again an example of that attribution (Arab. isnâd) in
which that which is attributed (musnad) is a condition (hal) of a
logical subject (the musnad ilêhi), and thus he who speaks has this, not
in itself, but in the sense of the condition; the inwardly cheerful is
feasts evermore, i.e., the condition of such an one is like a continual
festival. The true and real happiness of a man is thus defined, not by
external things, but by the state of the heart, in which, in spite of
the apparently prosperous condition, a secret sorrow may gnaw, and
which, in spite of an externally sorrowful state, may be at peace, and
be joyfully confident in God.

[Pro 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016.md)

16 Better is little with the fear of Jahve,

Than great store and trouble therewith.

The ב in both cases the lxx rightly renders by μετά. How מהוּמה
(elsewhere of wild, confused disorder, extreme discord) is meant of
store and treasure, [Psa 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md) shows:
it is restless, covetous care and trouble, as the contrast of the
quietness and contentment proceeding from the fear of God, the noisy,
wild, stormy running and hunting about of the slave of mammon.
Theodotion translates the word here, as Aquila and Symmachus elsewhere,
by words which correspond (φαγέδαινα = φάγαινα or ἀχορτασία) with the
Syr. יענותא, greed or insatiability.

[Pro 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#017.md)

17 Better a dish of cabbage, and love with it,

Than a fatted ox together with hatred.

With בו is here interchanged שׁם, which, used both of things and of
persons, means to be there along with something. Both have the Dag.
forte conj., cf. to the contrary, [Deu
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#020.md); [Mic
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011.md); [Deu
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#022.md); the punctuation varies, if the
first of the two words is a n. actionis ending in ה. The dish (portion)
is called ארחה, which the lxx and other Greek versions render by
ξενισμός, entertainment, and thus understand it of that which is set
before a guest, perhaps rightly so, for the Arab. ârrakh (to date, to
determine), to which it is compared by Gesenius and Dietrich, is
equivalent to warrh, a denom. of the name of the moon. Love and hatred
are, according to circumstances, the disposition of the host, or of the
participant, the spirit of the family:

Cum dat oluscula mensa minuscula pace quiet,

Ne pete grandia lautaque prandia lite repleta.

[Proverbs 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 15:18</span></span>

Two proverbs of two different classes of men, each second line of which
terminates with a catchword having a similar sound (וארך, וארח).

18 A passionate man stirreth up strife,

And one who is slow to anger allayeth contention.

[Pro 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025.md) and [Pro
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022.md) are variations of the first line
of this proverb. The Pih. גּרה occurs only these three times in the
phrase גּרה מדון, R. גר, to grind, thus to strike, to irritate, cogn. to
(but of a different root from) the verb עורר, to excite, [Pro
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md), and חרחר, to set on fire, [Pro
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#021.md), cf. שׁלּח, [Pro
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014.md). Regarding חמה, vid., [Pro
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001.md); we call such a man a "hot-head;"
but the biblical conception nowhere (except in the Book of Daniel)
places the head in connection with spiritual-psychical events
(Psychologie, p. 254). Regarding ארך אפּים, vid., [Pro
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029.md); the lxx (which contains a
translation of this proverb, and after it of a variation) translates
μακρόθυμος δὲ καὶ τὴν μέλλουσαν καταπρᾳύνει, i.e., (as the Syr. render
it) he suppresses the strife in its origin, so that it does not break
out. But both are true: that he who is slow to anger, who does not thus
easily permit himself to become angry, allayeth the strife which one
enters into with him, or into which he is drawn, and that he prevents
the strife, for he places over against provoking, injurious conduct,
patient gentleness (מרפּא, [Ecc 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004).md).

[Proverbs 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 15:19</span></span>

19 The way of the slothful is as hedged with thorns;

But the path of the righteous is paved.

Hitzig misses the contrast between אצל (slothful) and ישׁרים (upright),
and instead of the slothful reads עריץ, the tyrannical. But is then the
slothful ישׁר? The contrast is indeed not that of contradiction, but the
slothful is one who does not act uprightly, a man who fails to fulfil
the duty of labour common to man, and of his own special calling. The
way of such an one is כּמשׂכת חדק, like a fencing with thorns (from חדק,
R. חד, to be pointed, sharp, distinguished from Arab. hadḳ, to surround,
and in the meaning to fix with the look, denom. of khadaḳt, the apple of
the eye), so that he goes not forwards, and sees hindrances and
difficulties everywhere, which frighten him back, excusing his shunning
his work, his remissness of will, and his doing nothing; on the
contrary, the path of those who wait truly and honestly on their
calling, and prosecute their aim, is raised up like a skilfully made
street, so that unhindered and quickly they go forward (סלוּלה, R. סל,
aggerare, cf. [Jer 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015.md) with [Isa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#011.md) and [Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md) :8, סלסל, which was still in use
in the common language of Palestine in the second cent., Rosch haschana,
26b).

[Proverbs 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 15:20</span></span>

This collection of Solomonic proverbs began, [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md), with a proverb having reference
to the observance of the fourth commandment,

(Note: The fifth commandment of the Westminster Shorter Catechism is
named as the fourth in Luther's catechism.)

and a second chief section, [Pro 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001.md),
began in the same way. Here a proverb of the same kind designates the
beginning of a third chief section. That the editor was aware of this is
shown by the homogeneity of the proverbs, [Pro
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#019.md); [Pro
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028.md), which form the conclusion of
the first and second sections. We place together first in this new
section, [Pro 15:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#020.md), in which (with
the exception of [Pro 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#025).md) the ישׂמח
\[maketh glad\] of the first ([Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001).md) is continued.

[Pro 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#020.md)

20 A wise son maketh a glad father,

And a fool of a man despiseth his mother.

Line first = [Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md). The gen.
connection of כּסיל אדם (here and at [Pro
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#020).md) is not superlative the most
foolish of men, but like פּרא אדם, [Gen
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012.md); the latter: a man of the wild
ass kind; the former: a man of the fool kind, who is the exemplar of
such a sort among men. Piety acting in willing subordination is wisdom,
and the contrary exceeding folly.

[Pro 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#021.md)

21 Folly is joy to him that is devoid of understanding;

But a man of understanding goeth straight forward.

Regarding חסר־לב, vid., at [Pro 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#032.md)
(cf. libı̂b, which in the Samaritan means "dearly beloved," in Syr.
"courageous," in Arab. and Aethiop. cordatus); אישׁ תּבוּנה, [Pro
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#023.md), and ישּׁר, with the accus. of
the way, here of the going, [Pro 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#006.md)
(but not [Pro 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005.md), where the going
itself is not the subject). In consequence of the contrast, the meaning
of 21a is different from that of [Pro
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#023.md), according to which sin is to
the fool as the sport of a child. Here אוּלת is folly and buffoonery,
drawing aside in every kind of way from the direct path of that which is
good, and especially from the path of one's duty. This gives joy to the
fool; he is thereby drawn away from the earnest and faithful performance
of the duties of his calling, and thus wastes time and strength; while,
on the contrary, a man of understanding, who perceives and rejects the
vanity and unworthiness of such trifling and such nonsense, keeps the
straight direction of his going, i.e., without being drawn aside or kept
back, goes straight forward, i.e., true to duty, prosecutes the end of
his calling. לכת is accus., like [Pro
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#029.md), [Mic
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md).

[Pro 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#022.md)

22 A breaking of plans where no counsel is;

But where many counsellors are they come to pass.

On the other side it is also true according to the proverbs, "so viel
Kpfe so viel Sinne" \[quot homines, tot sententiae\], and "viel Rath ist
Unrath" \[ne quid nimis\], and the like. But it cannot become a rule of
morals not to accept of counsel that we may not go astray; on the
contrary, it is and remains a rule of morals: not stubbornly to follow
one's own heart (head), and not obstinately to carry out one's own will,
and not in the darkness of wisdom to regard one's own plans as
unimproveable, and not needing to be examined; but to listen to the
counsel of intelligent and honest friends, and, especially where weighty
matters are in hand, not affecting one's own person, but the common
good, not to listen merely to one counsellor, but to many. Not merely
the organism of the modern state, but also of old the Mosaic arrangement
of the Israelitish community, with its representative organization, its
courts and councils, rested on the acknowledged justice and importance
of the saying uttered in [Pro 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014.md),
and here generalized. הפר, infin. abs. Hiph. of פּרר, to break, with the
accus. following, stands here, like הפוך, [Pro
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#007.md), instead of the finite: the
thoughts come to a fracture (failure), irrita fiunt consilia. סוד (=
יסוד, cf. נוסד [Psa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002).md) means
properly the being brought close together for the purpose of secret
communication and counsel (cf. Arab. sâwada, to press close together =
to walk with one privately). The lxx: their plans are unexecuted, οἱ μὴ
τιμῶντες συνέδρια, literally Symmachus, διασκεδάζονται λογισμοὶ μὴ ὄντος
συμβουλίου. תּקוּם has, after [Jer
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md); [Jer
51:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#029.md), מחשׁבות as subject. The lxx
(besides perverting ברב \[by a multitude\] into בלב ἐν καρδίαις\]), the
Syr. and Targ. introduce עצה ([Pro
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021).md) as subject.

[Pro 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#023.md)

23 A man has joy by the right answer of his mouth;

And a word in its season, how fair is it!

If we translate מענה only by "answer," then 23a sounds as a praise of
self-complaisance; but it is used of true correspondence ([Pro
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#019).md), of fit reply ([Job
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#003.md), [Job
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#005).md), of appropriate answer (cf. 28a,
[Pro 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001).md). It has happened to one in
his reply to hit the nail on its head, and he has joy from that (שׂמחה ב
after שׂמח בּ, e.g., [Pro 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#024).md), and
with right; for the reply does not always succeed. A reply like this,
which, according to circumstances, stops the mouth or bringeth a kiss
([Pro 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#026).md), is a fortunate throw, is
a gift from above. The synonymous parallel line measures that which is
appropriate, not to that which is to be answered, but from a general
point of view as to its seasonableness; עת (= עדת from יעד) is here "the
ethically right, becoming time, determined by the laws of wisdom
(moral)" (vid., Orelli, Synonyma der Zeit u. Ewigkeit, p. 48), cf.
על־אפניו (translated by Luther 'in its time"), [Pro
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011.md). With מה־טּוב, cf. [Pro
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#016.md); both ideas lie in it: that such
a word is in itself well-conditioned and successful, and also that it is
welcome, agreeable, and of beneficial influence.

[Proverbs 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 15:24</span></span>

Four proverbs of fundamentally different doctrines:

24 The man of understanding goeth upwards on a way of life,

To depart from hell beneath.

The way of life is one, [Pro 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006.md); [Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md) (where, notwithstanding the want
of the article, the idea is logically determined), although in itself
forming a plurality of ארחות, [Pro
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#019.md). "A way of life," in the
translation, is equivalent to a way which is a way of life. למעלה,
upwards (as [Ecc 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021.md), where, in the
doubtful question whether the spirit of a man at his death goes upwards,
there yet lies the knowledge of the alternative), belongs, as the
parallel משּׁאול מטּה shows, to ארח חיּים as virtual adj.: a way of life
which leads upwards. And the ל of למשׂכּיל is that of possession, but
not as of quiet possession (such belongs to him), but as personal
activity, as in דּרך לו, he has a journey = he makes a journey, finds
himself on a journey, [Kg1 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#027.md); for
למען סוּר is not merely, as לסוּר, [Pro
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014.md); [Pro
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027.md), the expression of the end and
consequence, but of the subjective object, i.e., the intention, and thus
supposes an activity corresponding to this intention. The O.T. reveals
heaven, i.e., the state of the revelation of God in glory, yet not as
the abode of saved men; the way of the dying leads, according to the
O.T. representation, downwards into Shel; but the translations of Enoch
and Elijah are facts which, establishing the possibility of an
exception, break through the dark monotony of that representation, and,
as among the Greeks the mysteries encouraged ἡδυστέρας ἐλπίδας, so in
Israel the Chokma appears pointing the possessor of wisdom upwards, and
begins to shed light on the darkness of Shel by the new great thoughts
of a life of immortality, thus of a ζωὴ αἰώνιος ([Pro
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028)) (Psychologie, p. 407ff..md), now
for the first time becoming prominent, but only as a foreboding and an
enigma. The idea of the Shel opens the way for a change: the gathering
place of all the living on this side begins to be the place of
punishment for the godless ([Pro 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027.md);
[Pro 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018).md); the way leading upwards,
εἰς τὴν ζωὴν, and that leading downwards, εἰς τὴν ἀπωλειαν ([Mat
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013)..md), come into direct contrast.

[Proverbs 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 15:25</span></span>

25 The house of the proud Jahve rooteth out,

And He establisheth the landmark of the widow.

The power unnamed in יסּחוּ, [Pro 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#022.md)
(cf. [Pro 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#011).md), is here named יסּח
יהוה (thus to be pointed with Mercha and Pasek following). יצּב is the
abbreviated fut. form which the elevated style, e.g., [Deu
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md), uses also as indic. - a
syntactical circumstance which renders Hitzig's correction ויּצּב
superfluous. It is the border of the land-possession of the widows,
removed by the גּאים (lxx ὑβριστῶν), that is here meant. The possession
of land in Israel was secured by severe punishment inflicted in him who
removed the "landmark" ([Deu 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014.md);
[Deu 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#017).md), and the Chokma ([Pro
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028.md); [Pro
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#002).md) as well as the prophets (e.g.,
[Hos 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010).md) inculcate the inviolability
of the borders of the possession, as the guardian of which Jahve here
Himself appears.

[Proverbs 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 15:26</span></span>

26 An abomination to Jahve are evil thoughts;

But gracious words are to Him pure.

Not personally (Luther: the plans of the wicked) but neutrally is רע
here meant as at [Pro 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#014.md), and in
אושׁת רע, [Pro 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024.md) (cf. Pers. merdi
nı̂ku, man of good = good man), vid., Friedr. Philippi's Status Constr.
p. 121. Thoughts which are of a bad kind and of a bad tendency,
particularly (what the parallel member brings near) of a bad disposition
and design against others, are an abomination to God; but, on the
contrary, pure, viz., in His eyes, which cannot look upon iniquity ([Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013).md), are the אמרי־נעם, words of
compassion and of friendship toward men, which are (after 26a) the
expression of such thoughts, thus sincere, benevolent words, the
influence of which on the soul and body of him to whom they refer is
described, [Pro 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024.md). The Syr.,
Targ., Symmachus, Theodotion, and the Venet. recognise in וּטהורים the
pred., while, on the contrary, the lxx, Jerome, and Luther (who finally
decided for the translation, "but the pure speak comfortably") regard it
as subject. But that would be an attribution which exceeds the measure
of possibility, and for which אמרים or דברי must be used; also the
parallelism requires that טהורים correspond with 'תועבת ה. Hence also
the reference of וטהורים to the judgment of God, which is determined
after the motive of pure untainted law; that which proceeds from such,
that and that only, is pure, pure in His sight, and thus also pure in
itself.

[Proverbs 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 15:27</span></span>

27 Whoever does service to \[servit\] avarice troubleth his own house;

But he that hateth gifts shall live.

Regarding בּצע בּצע, vid., at [Pro

object.; [Pro 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016.md) is a variation of
27b. מתּנות are here gifts in the sense of [Ecc
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md), which pervert judgment, and cause
respect of persons. The lxx from this point mingles together a series of
proverbs with those of the following chapter.

[Proverbs 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 15:28</span></span>

Two proverbs regarding the righteous and the wicked:

28 The heart of the righteous considereth how to answer right,

And the mouth of the godless poureth forth evil.

Instead of לענות, the lxx (Syr. and Targ.) imagines אמוּנות πίστεις;
Jerome translates, but falsely, obedientiam (from ענה, to bend oneself);
Meri thinks on לענה, wormwood, for the heart of the righteous revolves
in itself the misery and the vanity of this present life; Hitzig
corrects this verse as he does the three preceding: the heart of the
righteous thinks on ענוות, a plur. of verb ענוה, which, except in this
correction, does not exist. The proverb, as it stands, is, in fineness
of expression and sharpness of the contrast, raised above such
manglings. Instead of the righteous, the wise might be named, and
instead of the godless, fools (cf. 2b); but the poet places the proverb
here under the point of view of duty to neighbours. It is the
characteristic of the righteous that he does not give the reins to his
tongue; but as Luther has translated: the heart of the righteous
considers \[tichtet from dictare, frequently to speak, here carefully to
think over\] what is to be answered, or rather, since מה־לּענות is not
used, he thinks thereupon to answer rightly, for that the word ענות is
used in this pregnant sense is seen from 23a. The godless, on the
contrary, are just as rash with their mouth as the righteous are of a
thoughtful heart: their mouth sputters forth (effutit) evil, for they do
not first lay to heart the question what may be right and just in the
case that has arisen.

[Proverbs 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 15:29</span></span>

29 Jahve is far from the godless;

But the prayer of the righteous He heareth.

Line second is a variation of 8b. God is far from the godless, viz., as
Polychronius remarks, non spatii intercapedine, sed sententiae
diversitate; more correctly: as to His gracious presence - חלץ מהם, He
has withdrawn Himself from them, [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006.md), so that if they pray, their
prayer reaches not to Him. The prayer of the righteous, on the contrary,
He hears, He is graciously near to them, they have access to Him, He
listens to their petitions; and if they are not always fulfilled
according to their word, yet they are not without an answer ([Psa
145:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018).md).

[Proverbs 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 15:30</span></span>

Two proverbs regarding the eye and the ear:

30 The light of the eye rejoiceth the heart,

And a good message maketh the bones fat.

Hitzig corrects also here: מראה עינים, that which is seen with the eyes,
viz., after long desire; and certainly מראה עינים can mean not only that
which the eyes see ([Isa 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003).md), but
also this, that the eyes do see. But is it true what Hitzig says in
justification of his correction, that מאור never means light, or ray, or
brightness, but lamp (φωστήρ)? It is true, indeed, that מאור עינים
cannot mean a cheerful sight (Luther) in an objective sense (lxx
θεωρῶνὀφθαλμὸς καλά), as a verdant garden or a stream flowing through a
landscape (Rashi), for that would be מראה מאיר עינים, and "brightness
which the eyes see" (Bertheau); the genitive connection certainly does
not mean: the מאור is not the light from without presenting itself to
the eyes, but, like אור עינים ([Psa
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011).md) and similar expressions, the
light of the eye itself \[bright or joyous eyes\]. But מאור does not
mean alone the body of light, but also the illumination, [Exo
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#014.md) and elsewhere, not only that
which (ὄ, τι) gives light, but also this, that (ὄτι) light arises and is
present, so that we might translate it here as at [Psa
90:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#008.md), either the brightness, or that
which gives light. But the clear brightness of one's own eye cannot be
meant, for then that were as much as to say that it is the effect, not
that it is the cause, of a happy heart, but the brightness of the eyes
of others that meet us. That this gladdens the heart of him who has a
sight of it is evident, without any interchanging relation of the
joy-beaming countenance, for it is indeed heart-gladdening to a man, to
whom selfishness has not made the χαίρειν μετὰ χαιρόντων impossible, to
see a countenance right joyful in truth. But in connection with [Pro
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015.md), it lies nearer to think on a
love-beaming countenance, a countenance on which joyful love to us
mirrors itself, and which reflects itself in our heart, communicating
this sense of gladness. The ancient Jewish interpreters understand מאור
עינים of the enlightening of the eye of the mind, according to which
Euchel translates: "clear intelligence;" but Rashi has remarked that
that is not the explanation of the words, but the Midrash. That, in line
second of this synonymous distich, שׁמוּעה טובה does not mean alloquium
humanum (Fl.), nor a good report which one hears of himself, but a good
message, is confirmed by [Pro 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025.md);
שׁמוּעה as neut. part. pass. may mean that which is heard, but the
comparison of ישׁוּעה, שׁבוּעה, stamps it as an abstract formation like
גּאלּה, גּדלּה (גּדוּלה), according to which the lxx translates it by
ἀκοή (in this passage by φήμη). Regarding דּשּׁן, richly to satisfy, or
to refresh, a favourite expression in the Mishle, vid., at [Pro
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025.md); [Pro
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md).

[Proverbs 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#031.md)

31 An ear which heareth the doctrine of life

Keeps itself in the circle of the wise.

As, [Pro 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#033.md), תוכחות מוסר means
instructions aiming at discipline, so here תּוכחת חיּים means
instructions which have life as their end, i.e., as showing how one may
attain unto true life; Hitzig's חכם, for חיים, is a fancy. Is now the
meaning this, that the ear which willingly hears and receives such
doctrine of life will come to dwell among the wise, i.e., that such an
one (for אזן is synecdoche partis pro persona, as [Job
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#011).md) will have his residence among
wise men, as being one of them, inter eos sedem firmam habebit iisque
annumerabitur (Fl.)? By such a rendering, one is surprised at the
harshness of the synecdoche, as well as at the circumstantiality of the
expression (cf. [Pro 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020), יחכּם.md). On
the contrary, this corresponds with the thought that one who willingly
permits to be said to him what he must do and suffer in order that he
may be a partaker of life, on this account remains most gladly in the
circle of the wise, and there has his appropriate place. The "passing
the night" (לין, cogn. ליל, Syr. Targ. בּוּת, Arab. bât) is also
frequently elsewhere the designation of prolonged stay, e.g., [Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md). בּקרב is here different in
signification from that it had in [Pro
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#023.md), where it meant "in the heart."
In the lxx this proverb is wanting. The other Greek translations have
οὖς ἀκοῦον ἐλέγχους χωῆς ἐν μέσῳ σοφῶν αὐλισθήσεται. Similarly the Syr.,
Targ., Jerome, Venet., and Luther, admitting both renderings, but, since
they render in the fut., bringing nearer the idea of prediction
(Midrash: זוכה לישׁב בישׁיבת חכמים) than of description of character.

[Proverbs 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 15:32</span></span>

Two proverbs with the catchword מוּסר:

32 He that refuseth correction lightly values his soul;

But he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.

Regarding פּורע מוּסר, vid., [Pro
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#018.md), cf. [Pro
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#025.md), and מואס נפשׁו, [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036.md). נפשׁו contains more than the
later expression עצמו, self; it is equivalent to חיּיו ([Job
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#021).md), for the נפשׁ is the bond of
union between the intellectual and the corporeal life. The despising of
the soul is then the neglecting, endangering, exposing of the life; in a
word, it is suicide (10b). [Pro 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008.md)
is a variation derived from this distich: "He who gains understanding
loves his soul," according to which the lxx translate here ἀγαπᾷ ψυχὴν
αὐτοῦ. לב the Midrash explains by חכמה שׁנתונה בלב; but the correct view
is, that לב is not thought of as a formal power, but as operative and
carried into effect in conformity with its destination.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 15:33</span></span>

33 The fear of Jahve is a discipline to wisdom,

And before honour is humility.

We may regard 'יראת ה (the fear of Jahve) also as pred. here. The fear
of Jahve is an educational maxim, and the end of education of the
Chokma; but the phrase may also be the subject, and by such a rendering
Luther's parallelism lies nearer: "The fear of the Lord is discipline to
wisdom;" the fear of God, viz., continually exercised and tried, is the
right school of wisdom, and humility is the right way to honour. Similar
is the connection מוּסר השׂכּל, discipline binds understanding to itself
as its consequence, [Pro 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003.md). Line
second repeats itself, [Pro 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012.md),
"Pride comes before the fall." Luther's "And ere one comes to honour, he
must previously suffer," renders עני rather than ענוה. But the Syr.
reverses the idea: the honour of the humble goeth before him, as also
one of the anonymous Greek versions: προπορεύεται δὲ ταπεινοῖς δόξα. But
the δόξα comes, as the above proverb expresses it, afterwards. The way
to the height lies through the depth, the depth of humility under the
hand of God, and, as ענוה expresses, of self-humiliation.
