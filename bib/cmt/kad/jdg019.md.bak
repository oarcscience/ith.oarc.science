### [Judges Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 19:0</span></span>

War of the Congregation with the Tribe of Benjamin on Account of the
Crime at Gibeah - Judges 19-20

This account belongs to the times immediately following the death of
Joshua, as we may see form the fact that Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
the contemporary of Joshua, was high priest at that time ([Jdg
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028).md). In Judg 19 we have an account
of the infamous crime committed by the inhabitants of Gibeah, which
occasioned the war; in Judg 20 the war itself; and in Judg 21 an account
of what was afterwards done by the congregation to preserve the tribe of
Benjamin, which was almost annihilated by the war.

[Judges 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 19:1</span></span>

Infamous Crime of the Inhabitants of Gibeah. - [Jdg
19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md). At the time when there was no
king in Israel, a Levite, who sojourned (i.e., lived outside a Levitical
town) in the more remote parts of the mountains of Ephraim, took to
himself a concubine out of Bethlehem in Judah, who proved unfaithful to
him, and then returned to her father's house. הר־אפרים ירכּתי, the
hinder or outermost parts of the mountains of Ephraim, are the northern
extremity of these mountains; according to [Jdg
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#018.md), probably the neighbourhood of
Shiloh. עליו תּזנה, "she played the harlot out beyond him," i.e., was
unfaithful to her husband, and then went away from him," back to her
father's house.

[Judges 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 19:3</span></span>

Some time afterwards, namely at the end of four months (הדשׁים ארבּעה is
in apposition to ימים, and defines more precisely the ימים, or days),
her husband went after her, "to speak to her to the heart," i.e., to
talk to her in a friendly manner (see [Gen
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#003).md), and to reconcile her to himself
again, so that she might return; taking with him his attendant and a
couple of asses, for himself and his wife to ride upon. The suffix
attached to להשׁיבו refers to לבּה, "to bring back her heart," to turn
her to himself again. The Keri השׁיבהּ is a needless conjecture. "And
she brought him into her father's house, and her father received his
son-in-law with joy, and constrained him (יהזק־בּו, lit. held him fast)
to remain there three days." It is evident from this that the Levite had
succeeded in reconciling his wife.

[Judges 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 19:5</span></span>

Also on the fourth day, when he was about to depart in the morning, the
Levite yielded to the persuasion of his father-in-law, that he would
first of all strengthen his heart again with a bit of bread (לב סעד as
in [Gen 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005.md); the imperative form with
ŏ is unusual); and then afterwards, whilst they were eating and
drinking, he consented to stay another night.

[Judges 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 19:7</span></span>

When he rose up to go, his father-in-law pressed him; then he turned
back (ויּשׁב is quite in place, and is not to be altered into ויּשׁב,
according to the lxx and one Heb. Cod.), and remained there for the
night.

[Judges 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 19:8</span></span>

And even in the morning of the fifth day he suffered himself to be
induced to remain till the afternoon. התמהמהוּ is an imperative, "Tarry
till the day turns," i.e., till mid-day is past.

[Judges 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 19:9</span></span>

When at length he rose up, with his concubine and his attendant, to go
away, the father entreated his daughter once more: "Behold the day has
slackened to become evening, spend the night here! Behold the declining
of the day, spend the night here," etc. חנות inf. of חנה, to bend,
incline. The interchange of the plural and singular may be explained
from the simple fact that the Levite was about to depart with his wife
and attendant, but that their remaining or departing depended upon the
decision of the man alone. But the Levite did not consent to remain any
longer, but set out upon the road, and came with his companions to
before Jebus, i.e., Jerusalem, which is only two hours from Bethlehem
(compare Rob. Pal. ii. 375 and 379). עד־נכח, to before Jebus, for the
road from Bethlehem to Shiloh went past Jerusalem.

[Judges 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 19:11</span></span>

But as the day had gone far down when they were by Jebus (רד, third
pers. perf., either of ירד with י dropped like תּתּה in [Sa2
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#041.md) for נתתּה, or from רדד in the
sense of ירד), the attendant said to his master, "Come, let us turn
aside into this Jebusite city, and pass the night in it." But his master
was unwilling to enter a city of the foreigners (נכרי( sre is a
genitive), where there were none of the sons of Israel, and would pass
over to Gibeah. "Come (לך = לכה, [Num
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013).md), we will draw near to one of
the places (which he immediately names), and pass the night in Gibeah or
Ramah." These two towns, the present Jeba and er Rm, were not a full
hour's journey apart, and stood opposite to one another, only about two
and a half or three hours from Jerusalem (see at [Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025.md), [Jos
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028).md).

[Judges 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 19:14</span></span>

Then they went forward, and the sun went down upon them as they were
near (at) Gibeah of Benjamin.

[Judges 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 19:15</span></span>

And they turned aside thither to pass the night in Gibeah; and he (the
Levite) remained in the market-place of the town, as no one received
them into his house to pass the night.

[Jdg 19:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#016.md)

Behold, there came an old man from the field, who was of the mountains
of Ephraim, and dwelt as a stranger in Gibeah, the inhabitants of which
were Benjaminites (as is observed here, as a preliminary introduction to
the account which follows). When he saw the traveller in the
market-place of the town, he asked him whither he was going and whence
he came; and when he had heard the particulars concerning his descent
and his journey, he received him into his house. ואת־בּית י הלך אני
([Jdg 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#018).md), "and I walk at the house
of Jehovah, and no one receives me into his house" (Seb. Schm., etc.);
not "I am going to the house of Jehovah" (Ros., Berth., etc.), for את
הלך does not signify to go to a place, for which the simple accusative
is used either with or without ה local. It either means "to go through a
place" ([Deu 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019), etc..md), or "to go
with a person," or, when applied to things, "to go about with anything"
(see [Job 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#005.md), and Ges. Thes. p.
378). Moreover, in this instance the Levite was not going to the house
of Jehovah (i.e., the tabernacle), but, as he expressly told the old
man, from Bethlehem to the outermost sides of the mountains of Ephraim.
The words in question explain the reason why he was staying in the
market-place. Because he served at the house of Jehovah, no one in
Gibeah would receive him into his house,

(Note: As Seb. Schmidt correctly observes, "the argument is taken from
the indignity shown him: the Lord thinks me worthy to minister to Him,
as a Levite, in His house, and there is not one of the people of the
Lord who thinks me worthy to receive his hospitality.")

although, as he adds in [Jdg 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#019.md), he
had everything with him that was requisite for his wants. "We have both
straw and fodder for our asses, and bread and wine for me and thy maid,
and for the young man with thy servants. No want of anything at all," so
as to cause him to be burdensome to his host. By the words "thy maid"
and "thy servants" he means himself and his concubine, describing
himself and his wife, according to the obsequious style of the East in
olden times, as servants of the man from whom he was expecting a
welcome.

[Jdg 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#020.md)

The old man replied, "Peace to thee," assuring him of a welcome by this
style of greeting; "only all thy wants upon me," i.e., let me provide
for them. Thus the friendly host declined the offer made by his guest to
provide for himself. "Only do not pass the night in the market-place."

[Jdg 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#021.md)

He then took him into his house, mixed fodder for his asses (יבול from
בּלל, a denom. verb from בּליל, to make a mixture, to give fodder to the
beasts), and waited upon his guest with washing of feet, food, and drink
(see [Gen 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#004.md)., [Jdg
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#002).md).

[Jdg 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022.md)

Whilst they were enjoying themselves, some worthless men of the city
surrounded the house, knocking continuously at the door (התדּפּק, a form
indicative of gradual increase), and demanding of the master of the
house that he would bring out the man who had entered his house, that
they might know him,-the very same demand that the Sodomites had made of
Lot ([Gen 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#006)..md). The construct state
בני־בליּעל אנשׁי is used instead of בּני־בל אנשׁים ([Deu
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#014), etc..md), because בליעל בני is
regarded as one idea: people of worthless fellows. Other cases of the
same kind are given by Ewald, Lehrb. 289, c.

[Jdg 19:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#023.md)

The old man sought, as Lot had done, to defend his guests from such a
shameful crime by appealing to the sacred rights of hospitality, and by
giving up his own virgin daughter and the concubine of his guest (see
the remarks on [Gen 19:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#007).md). נבלה,
folly, used to denote shameful licentiousness and whoredom, as in [Gen
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#007.md) and [Deu
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#021.md). אותם ענּוּ, "humble them." The
masculine is used in אותם and להם as the more general gender, instead of
the more definite feminine, as in [Gen
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009.md); [Exo
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#021.md), etc.

[Jdg 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#025.md)

But as the people would not listen to this proposal, the man (no doubt
the master of the house, according to [Jdg
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#024)) took his (the guest's.md)
concubine (of course with the consent of his guest) and led her out to
them, and they abused her the whole night. It is not stated how it was
that they were satisfied with this; probably because they felt too weak
to enforce their demand. בּ התעלּל, to exercise his power or wantonness
upon a person (see [Exo 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#002).md).

[Jdg 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#026.md)

When the morning drew on (i.e., at the first dawn of day), the woman
fell down before the door of the house in which אדוניה, "her lord,"
i.e., her husband, was, and lay there till it was light, i.e., till
sunrise.

[Jdg 19:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#027.md)

There her husband found her, when he opened the house-door to go his way
(having given up all thought of receiving her back again from the
barbarous crowd), "lying before the house-door, and her hands upon the
threshold" (i.e., with outstretched arms), and giving no answer to his
word, having died, that is to say, in consequence of the ill-treatment
of the night. He then took the corpse upon his ass to carry it to his
place, i.e., to his home.

[Jdg 19:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#029.md)

As soon as he arrived there, he cut up the body, according to its bones
(as they cut slaughtered animals in pieces: see at [Lev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#006).md), into twelve pieces, and sent
them (the corpse in its pieces) into the whole of the territory of
Israel, i.e., to all the twelve tribes, in the hope that every one who
saw it would say: No such thing has happened or been seen since the
coming up of Israel out of Egypt until this day. Give ye heed to it
(שׁימוּ for לב שׂימוּ); make up your minds and say on, i.e., decide how
this unparalleled wickedness is to be punished. Sending the dissected
pieces of the corpse to the tribes was a symbolical act, by which the
crime committed upon the murdered woman was placed before the eyes of
the whole nation, to summon it to punish the crime, and was naturally
associated with a verbal explanation of the matter by the bearer of the
pieces. See the analogous proceeding on the part of Saul ([Sa1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#007).md), and the Scythian custom related
by Lucian in Toxaris, c. 48, that whoever was unable to procure
satisfaction for an injury that he had received, cut an ox in pieces and
sent it round, whereupon all who were willing to help him to obtain
redress took a piece, and swore that they would stand by him to the
utmost of their strength. The perfects ואמר - והיה ([Jdg
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#030).md) are not used for the imperfects
c. vav consec. ויּאמר - ויהי, as Hitzig supposes, but as simple perfects
(perfecta conseq.), expressing the result which the Levite expected from
his conduct; and we have simply to supply לאמר before והיה, which is
often omitted in lively narrative or animated conversation (compare, for
example, [Exo 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#005.md) with [Jdg
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#002).md). The perfects are used by the
historian instead of imperfects with a simple vav, which are commonly
employed in clauses indicating intention, "because what he foresaw would
certainly take place, floated before his mind as a thing already done"
(Rosenmller). The moral indignation, which the Levite expected on the
part of all the tribes at such a crime as this, and their resolution to
avenge it, are thereby exhibited not merely as an uncertain conjecture,
but a fact that was sure to occur, and concerning which, as Judg 20
clearly shows, he had not deceived himself.
