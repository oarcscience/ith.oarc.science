### [Judges Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md)

[Judges 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 7:1</span></span>

Mustering of the Army that Gideon had Collected. - [Jdg
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md). When Gideon had been assured of
the help of God by this double sign, he went to the battle early the
next morning with the people that he had gathered around him. The
Israelites encamped above the fountain of Harod, i.e., upon a height at
the foot of which this fountain sprang; but the camp of Midian was to
him (Gideon) to the north of the hill Moreh in the valley (of Jezreel:
see [Jdg 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033).md). The geographical
situation of these two places cannot be determined with certainty. The
fountain of Harod is never mentioned again, though there is a place of
that name referred to in [Sa2 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#025.md) as
the home of two of David's heroes; and it was from this, no doubt, that
the fountain was named. The hill Moreh is also unknown. As it was by the
valley (of Jezreel), we cannot possibly think of the grove of Moreh at
Shechem ([Gen 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md); [Deu
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#030).md).

(Note: Bertheau endeavours to settle the position of the place from our
knowledge of the country, which is for the most part definite enough.
Starting with the assumption that the fountain of Harod cannot be any
other than the "fountain in Jezreel" mentioned in [Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md), where Saul and the Israelites
encamped at Gilboa ([Sa1 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#004).md) to
fight against the Philistines who were posted at Shunem, a place on the
western slope of the so-called Little Hermon, he concludes that the
fountain of Harod must be the present Ain Jalud, and the hill of Moreh
the Little Hermon itself. These combinations are certainly possible, for
we have nothing definite to oppose to them; still they are very
uncertain, as they simply rest upon the very doubtful assumption that
the only fountain in the plain of Jezreel was the celebrated fountain
called Ain Jalud, and are hardly reconcilable with the account given of
the route which was taken by the defeated Midianites ([Jdg
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025.md). and [Jdg
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#004))..md)

[Jdg 7:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#002.md)

The army of the Israelites amounted to 32,000 men ([Jdg
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#004).md), but that of the Midianites and
their allies was about 135,000 ([Jdg
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#010).md), so that they were greatly
superior to the Israelites in numbers. Nevertheless the Lord said to
Gideon, "The people that are with thee are too many for me to give
Midian into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me,
saying, My hand hath helped me." רב followed by מן is to be understood
as a comparative. Gideon was therefore to have a proclamation made
before all the people: "Whosoever is fearful and despondent, let him
turn and go back from Mount Gilead." The ἁπ. λεγ. צפר, judging from the
Arabic, which signifies to plait, viz., hair, ropes, etc., and the noun
צפירה, a circle or circuitous orbit, probably signifies to twist one's
self round; hence in this instance to return in windings, to slink away
in bypaths. The expression "from Mount Gilead," however, is very
obscure. The mountain (or the mountains) of Gilead was on the eastern
side of the Jordan; but the Israelitish army was encamped in or near the
plain of Jezreel, in the country to the west of the Jordan, and had been
gathered from the western tribes alone; so that even the inadmissible
rendering, Let him turn and go home to the mountains of Gilead, would
not give any appropriate sense. The only course left therefore is either
to pronounce it an error of the text, as Clericus and Bertheau have
done, and to regard "Gilead" as a mistake for "Gilboa," or to conclude
that there was also a mountain or mountain range named Gilead by the
plain of Jezreel in western Palestine, just as, according to [Jos
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010.md), there was a mountain, or range
of mountains, called Seir, in the territory of Judah, of which nothing
further is known. The appeal which Gideon is here directed to make to
the army was prescribed in the law ([Deu
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#008).md) for every war in which the
Israelites should be engaged, and its general object was to fortify the
spirit of the army be removing the cowardly and desponding. But in the
case before us the intention of the Lord was to deprive His people of
all ground for self-glorification. Hence the result of the appeal was
one which Gideon himself certainly did not expect, - namely, that more
than two-thirds of the soldiers gathered round him - 22,000 men of the
people - turned back, and only 10,000 remained.

[Jdg 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#004.md)

But even this number was regarded by the Lord as still too great, so
that He gave to Gideon the still further command, "Bring them (the
10,000 men) down to the water," i.e., the waters formed from the
fountain of Harod, "and I will purify them for thee there (צרף, separate
those appointed for the battle from the rest of the army; the singular
suffix refers to העם), and say to thee, This shall go with thee, and
that," i.e., show thee each individual who is to go with thee to the
battle, and who not.

[Jdg 7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#005.md)

Gideon was to divide the people by putting all those who should lick the
water with their tongue as a dog licketh into one class, and all those
who knelt down to drink into another, and so separating the latter from
the former. The number of those who licked the water into their mouth
with their hand amounted to 300, and all the rest knelt down to drink.
"To lick with their hand to their mouth," i.e., to take the water from
the brook with the hollow of their hand, and lap it into the mouth with
their tongue as a dog does, is only a more distinct expression for
"licking with the tongue." The 300 men who quenched their thirst in this
manner were certainly not the cowardly or indolent who did not kneel
down to drink in the ordinary way, either from indolence or fear, as
Josephus, Theodoret, and others supposed, but rather the bravest-namely
those who, when they reached a brook before the battle, did not allow
themselves time to kneel down and satisfy their thirst in the most
convenient manner, but simply took up some water with their hands as
they stood in their military accoutrements, to strengthen themselves for
the battle, and then proceeded without delay against the foe. By such a
sign as this, Bertheau supposes that even an ordinary general might have
been able to recognise the bravest of his army. No doubt: but if this
account had not been handed down, it is certain that it would never have
occurred to an ordinary or even a distinguished general to adopt such a
method of putting the bravery of his troops to the test; and even
Gideon, the hero of God, would never have thought of diminishing still
further through such a trial an army which had already become so small,
or of attempting to defeat an army of more than 100,000 men by a few
hundred of the bravest men, if the Lord himself had not commanded it.

Whilst the Lord was willing to strengthen the feeble faith of Gideon by
the sign with the fleece of wool, and thus to raise him up to full
confidence in the divine omnipotence, He also required of him, when thus
strengthened, an attestation of his faith, by the purification of his
army that he might give the whole glory to Him, and accept the victory
over that great multitude from His hand alone.

[Jdg 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#007.md)

After his fighting men had been divided into a small handful of 300 men
on the one hand, and the large host of 9700 on the other, by the
fulfilment of the command of God, the Lord required of him that he
should send away the latter, "every man to his place," i.e., to his own
home, promising that He would save Israel by the 300 men, and deliver
the Midianites into their hand. The promise preceded the command, to
render it easier to Gideon to obey it. "All the people," after taking
out the 300 men, that is to say, the 9700 that remained.

[Jdg 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#008.md)

"So they (the 300 picked men) took the provision of the people in their
hand, and their (the people's) trumpets (the suffix points back to העם,
the people); and all the men of Israel (the 9700) he had sent away every
one to his tents, i.e., to his home (see at [Deu
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#007).md), and the three hundred men he
had kept by himself; but the camp of the Midianites was below to him in
the valley." These words bring the preparations for the battle to a
close, and the last clause introduces the ensuing conflict and victory.
In the first clause העם (the people) cannot be the subject, partly
because of the actual sense, since the 300 warriors, who are no doubt
the persons intended (cf. [Jdg 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016).md),
cannot be called "the people," in distinction from "all the men of
Israel," and partly also because of the expression את־צדה, which would
be construed in that case without any article in violation of the
ordinary rule. We must rather read העם את־צדת, as the lxx and the
Chaldee have done. The 300 men took the provision of the people, i.e.,
provision for the war, from the people who had been sent away, and the
war-trumpets; so that every one of the 300 had a trumpet now, and as the
provision of the people was also probably kept in vessels or pitchers
(caddim: [Jdg 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016).md), a jug as well.
The subject to יקחוּ is to be taken from the first clause of the seventh
verse. The sentences which follow from כּל־אישׁ ואת are circumstantial
clauses, introduced to bring out distinctly the situation in which
Gideon was now placed. בּ החזיק, the opposite of שׁלּח, to send away,
signifies to hold fast, to keep back or by himself, as in [Exo
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#002.md). לו, to him, Gideon, who was
standing by the fountain of Harod with his 300 men, the situation of
Midian was underneath in the valley (see [Jdg
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md), and [Jdg
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033).md).

[Judges 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 7:9</span></span>

Gideon's Battle and Victory. - [Jdg
7:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#009.md). The following night the Lord
commanded Gideon to go down to the camp of the enemy, as He had given it
into his hand (the perfect is used to denote the purpose of God which
had already been formed, as in [Jdg
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#014).md). But in order to fill him with
confidence for such an enterprise, which to all human appearance was a
very rash one, God added, "If thou art afraid to go down, go thou with
thine attendant Purah down to the camp, and thou wilt hear what they
say, and thy hands will thereby become strong." The meaning of the
protasis is not, If thou art afraid to go down into the camp of the
enemy alone, or to visit the enemy unarmed, take Purah thine
armour-bearer with thee, to make sure that thou hast weapons to use
(Bertheau); for, apart from the fact that the addition "unarmed" is
perfectly arbitrary, the apodosis "thou wilt see," etc., by no means
agrees with this explanation. The meaning is rather this: Go with thy
300 men into (בּ) the hostile camp to smite it, for I have given it into
thy hand; but if thou art afraid to do this, go down with thine
attendant to (אל) the camp, to ascertain the state and feeling of the
foe, and thou wilt hear what they say, i.e., as we gather from what
follows, how they are discouraged, have lost all hope of defeating you,
and from that thou wilt gather courage and strength for the battle. On
the expression "thine hands shall be strengthened," see [Sa2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#007.md). The expression which follows,
בּמּחנה וירדתּ, is not a mere repetition of the command to go down with
his attendant to the hostile camp, but describes the result of the
stimulus given to his courage: And then thou wilt go fearlessly into the
hostile camp to attack the foe. בּמּחנה ירד ([Jdg
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#009.md), [Jdg
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#011).md) is to be distinguished from
המּחנה ירד in [Jdg 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#010.md). The former
signifies to go down into the camp to smite the foe; the latter, to go
down to the camp to reconnoitre it, and is equivalent to the following
clause: "he went to the outside of the camp."

[Judges 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 7:11</span></span>

But when Gideon came with his attendant to the end of the armed men
(chamushim, as in [Jos 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014.md); [Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018).md) in the hostile camp, and the
enemy were lying spread out with their camels in the valley, an
innumerable multitude, he heard one (of the fighting men) relate to his
fellow (i.e., to another) a dream which he had had: "Behold a cake of
barley bread was rolling into the camp of Midian, and it came to the
tent and smote it, so that it fell and turned upwards, and let the tent
lay along." Then the other replied, "This is nothing else than the sword
of Gideon the son of Joash the Israelite: God hath given Midian and all
the camp into his hand." "The end of fighting men" signifies the
outermost or foremost of the outposts in the enemy's camp, which
contained not only fighting men, but the whole of the baggage of the
enemy, who had invaded the land as nomads, with their wives, their
children, and their flocks. In [Jdg
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#012.md), the innumerable multitude of the
enemy is described once more in the form of a circumstantial clause, as
in [Jdg 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005.md), not so much to
distinguish the fighting men from the camp generally, as to bring out
more vividly the contents and meaning of the following dream. The
comparison of the enemy to the sand by the sea-side recalls [Jos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#004.md), and is frequently met with (see
[Gen 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md); [Gen
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013.md); [Sa1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005).md). With the word ויּבא in [Jdg
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#013.md), the thread of the narrative,
which was broken off by the circumstantial clause in [Jdg
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#012.md), is resumed and carried further.
The ἁπ. λεγ. צלוּל (Keri, צליל) is rendered cake, placenta, by the early
translators: see Ges. Thes. p. 1170. The derivation of the word has been
disputed, and is by no means certain, as צלל does not give any suitable
meaning, either in the sense of to ring or to be overshadowed, and the
meaning to roll (Ges. l.c.) cannot be philologically sustained; whilst
צלה, to roast, can hardly be thought of, since this is merely used to
denote the roasting of flesh, and קלה was the word commonly applied to
the roasting of grains, and even "the roasted of barley bread" would
hardly be equivalent to subcinericeus panis ex hordeo (Vulgate). "The
tent," with the definite article, is probably the principal tent in the
camp, i.e., the tent of the general. למעלה, upwards, so that the bottom
came to the top. "The tent lay along," or the tent fell, lay in ruins,
is added to give emphasis to the words. "This is nothing if not," i.e.,
nothing but. The cake of bread which had rolled into the Midianitish
camp and overturned the tent, signifies nothing else than the sword of
Gideon, i.e., Gideon, who is bursting into the camp with his sword, and
utterly destroying it.

This interpretation of the dream was certainly a natural one under the
circumstances. Gideon is especially mentioned simply as the leader of
the Israelites; whilst the loaf of barley bread, which was the food of
the poorer classes, is to be regarded as strictly speaking the symbol of
Israel, which was so despised among the nations. The rising of the
Israelites under Gideon had not remained a secret to the Midianites, and
no doubt filled them with fear; so that in a dream this fear might
easily assume the form of the defeat or desolation and destruction of
their camp by Gideon. And the peculiar form of the dream is also
psychologically conceivable. As the tent is everything to a nomad, he
might very naturally picture the cultivator of the soil as a man whose
life is all spent in cultivating and baking bread. In this way bread
would become almost involuntarily a symbol of the cultivator of the
soil, whilst in his own tent he would see a symbol not only of his mode
of life, but of his freedom, greatness, and power. If we add to this,
that the free pastoral tribes, particularly the Bedouins of Arabia, look
down with pride not only upon the poor tillers of the soil, but even
upon the inhabitants of towns, and that in Palestine, the land of wheat,
none but the poorer classes feed upon barley bread, we have here all the
elements out of which the dream of the Midianitish warrior was formed.
The Israelites had really been crushed by the Midianites into a poor
nation of slaves. But whilst the dream itself admits of being explained
in this manner in a perfectly natural way, it acquires the higher
supernatural character of a divine inspiration, from the fact that God
not only foreknew it, but really caused the Midianite to dream, and to
relate the dream to his comrade, just at the time when Gideon had
secretly entered the camp, so that he should hear it, and discover
therefrom, as God had foretold him, the despondency of the foe. Under
these circumstances, Gideon could not fail to regard the dream as a
divine inspiration, and to draw the assurance from it, that God had
certainly given the Midianites into his hands.

[Judges 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 7:15</span></span>

When therefore he had heard the dream related and interpreted, he
worshipped, praising the Lord with joy, and returned to the camp to
attack the enemy without delay. He then divided the 300 men into three
companies, i.e., three attacking columns, and gave them all trumpets and
empty pitchers, with torches in the pitchers in their hands. The
pitchers were taken that they might hide the burning torches in them
during their advance to surround the enemy's camp, and then increase the
noise at the time of the attack, by dashing the pitchers to pieces ([Jdg
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#020).md), and thus through the noise, as
well as the sudden lighting up of the burning torches, deceive the enemy
as to the strength of the army. At the same time he commanded them, "See
from me, and do likewise," - a short expression for, As ye see me do, so
do ye also (כּן, without the previous כּ, or כּאשׁר as in [Jdg
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#015); see Ewald, 260, a..md), - "I blow
the trumpet, I and all who are with me; ye also blow the trumpets round
about the entire camp," which the 300 men divided into three companies
were to surround, "and say, To the Lord and Gideon." According to [Jdg
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#020.md), this war-cry ran fully thus:
"Sword to (for) the Lord and Gideon." This addition in [Jdg
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#020.md), however, does not warrant us in
inserting "chereb" (sword) in the text here, as some of the early
translators and MSS have done.

(Note: Similar stratagems to the one adopted by Gideon here are recorded
by Polyaenus (Strateg. ii. c. 37) of Dicetas, at the taking of Heraea,
and by Plutarch (Fabius Max. c. 6) of Hannibal, when he was surrounded
and completely shut in by Fabius Maximus. An example from modern history
is given by Niebuhr (Beschr. von Arabien, p. 304). About the middle of
the eighteenth century two Arabian chiefs were fighting for the Imamate
of Oman. One of them, Bel-Arab, besieged the other, Achmed ben Said,
with four or five thousand men, in a small castle on the mountain. But
the latter slipped out of the castle, collected together several hundred
men, gave every soldier a sign upon his head, that they might be able to
distinguish friends from foes, and sent small companies to all the
passes. Every one had a trumpet to blow at a given signal, and thus
create a noise at the same time on every side. The whole of the opposing
army was thrown in this way into disorder, since they found all the
passes occupied, and imagined the hostile army to be as great as the
noise.)

[Judges 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 7:19</span></span>

Gideon then proceeded with the 100 who were with him, i.e., the company
which was led by himself personally, to the end of the hostile camp, at
the beginning of the middle watch, i.e., at midnight ראשׁ is an
accusative defining the time: see Ges. 118, 2, and Ewald, 204, a. The
only other watch that is mentioned in the Old Testament beside the
middle night-watch, is the morning night-watch ([Exo
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024.md); [Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011).md), from which it has been
correctly inferred, that the Israelites divided the night into three
night-watches. The division into four watches ([Mat
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025.md); [Mar
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048).md) was first adopted by the Jews
from the Romans. "They (the Midianites) had only (just) posted the
watchmen (of the middle watch)," - a circumstantial clause, introduced
to give greater distinctness to the situation. When the first sentries
were relieved, and the second posted, so that they thought they might
make quite sure of their night's rest once more, Gideon and his host
arrived at the end of the camp, and, as we must supply from the context,
the other two hosts at two other ends of the camp, who all blew their
trumpets, breaking the pitchers in their hands at the same time. The
inf. abs. נפוץ, as a continuation of the finite verb יתקעוּ, indicates
that the fact was contemporaneous with the previous one (see Ewald, 351,
c.).

[Judges 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 7:20</span></span>

According to the command which they had received ([Jdg
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#017).md), the other two tribes followed
his example. "Then the three companies blew the trumpets, broke the
pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in
their right to blow, and cried, Sword to the Lord and Gideon! And they
stood every one his place round about the camp," sc., without moving, so
that the Midianites necessarily thought that there must be a numerous
army advancing behind the torch-bearers. וגו ויּרץ, "and the whole army
ran," i.e., there began a running hither and thither in the camp of the
enemy, who had been frightened out of their night's rest by the
unexpected blast of the trumpets, the noise, and the war-cry of the
Israelitish warriors; "and they (the enemy) lifted up a cry (of anguish
and alarm), and caused to fly" (carried off), sc., their tents (i.e.,
their families) and their herds, or all their possessions (cf. [Jdg
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md); [Exo
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#020).md). The Chethibh יניסוּ is the
original reading, and the Keri ינוּסוּ a bad emendation.

[Judges 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 7:22</span></span>

Whilst the 300 men blew their trumpets, "Jehovah set the sword of one
against the other, and against the whole camp," i.e., caused one to turn
his sword against the other and against all the camp, that is to say,
not merely man against man, but against every one in the camp, so that
there arose a terrible slaughter throughout the whole camp. The first
clause, "and the three hundred blew the trumpets," simply resumes the
statement in [Jdg 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#020.md), "the three
companies blew the trumpets," for the purpose of appending to it the
further progress of the attack, and the result of the battle. Bertheau
inserts in a very arbitrary manner the words, "the second time." His
explanation of the next clause ("then the 300 fighting men of Gideon
drew the sword at Jehovah's command, every man against his man") is
still more erroneous, since it does violence to the constant usage of
the expression בּרעהוּ אישׁ (see [Sa1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#020.md); [Ch2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023.md); [Isa
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005.md); [Zac
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010).md). "And all the camp of the
Midianites fled to Beth-shittah to Zeredah, to the shore of
Abel-meholah, over Tabbath." The situation of these places, which are
only mentioned here, with the exception of Abel-meholah, the home of
Elisha ([Kg1 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016.md); [Kg1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012).md), has not yet been determined.
According to the Syriac, the Arabic, and some of the MSS, we should read
Zeredathah instead of Zererathah, and Zeredathah is only another form
for Zarthan (comp. [Kg1 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#046.md) with [Ch2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#017).md). This is favoured by the
situation of Zarthan in the valley of the Jordan, probably near the
modern Kurn Sartabeh (see p. 35), inasmuch as in all probability
Beth-shittah and Abel-meholah are to be sought for in the valley of the
Jordan; and according to [Jdg 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#024.md),
the enemy fled to the Jordan. Beth-shittah, i.e., acacia-house, is not
the same place as the village of Shutta mentioned by Robinson (iii. p.
219), since this village, according to Van de Velde's map, was to the
north of Gilboa. For although Shutta is favoured by the circumstance,
that from a very ancient time there was a road running from Jezreel
along the valley, between the so-called Little Hermon (Duhy) and the
mountains of Gilboa, and past Beisan to the Jordan; and the valley of
Jalud, on the northern side of which Shutta was situated, may be
regarded as the opening of the plain of Jezreel into the valley of the
Jordan (see v. Raumer, Pal. p. 41, and Rob. iii. p. 176); and v. Raumer
conjectures from this, that "the flight of the Midianites was apparently
directed to Bethsean, on account of the nature of the ground," - this
assumption is rendered very questionable by the fact that the flying foe
did not cross the Jordan in the neighbourhood of Beisan, but much
farther to the south, viz., according to [Jdg
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#004.md), in the neighbourhood of Succoth,
which was on the south side of the Nahr Zerka (Jabbok). From this we are
led to conjecture, that they were not encamped in the north-eastern part
of the plain of Jezreel, in the neighbourhood of Jezreel (Zerin) and
Shunem (Solam), but in the south-eastern part of this plain, and that
after they had been beaten there they fled southwards from Gilboa, say
from the district of Ginaea (Jenin) to the Jordan. In this case we have
to seek for Abel-shittah on the south-east of the mountains of Gilboa,
to the north of Zeredathah (Zarthan). From this point they fled on still
farther to the "shore of Abel-meholah." שׂפה does not mean boundary, but
brink; here the bank of the Jordan, like היּרדּן שׂפת in [Kg2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#013.md). The bank or strand of
Abel-meholah is that portion of the western bank of the Jordan or of the
Ghor, above which Abel-meholah was situated. According to the Onom. (s.
v. Ἀβελμαελαί, Abelmaula), this place was in the Aulon (or Ghor), ten
Roman miles to the south of Scythopolis (Beisan), and was called at that
time Βηθμαιελά or Bethaula. According to this statement, Abel-meholah
would have to be sought for near Churbet es Shuk, in the neighbourhood
of the Wady Maleh (see V. de Velde, Mem. p. 280). And lastly, Tabbath
must have been situated somewhere to the south of Abel-meholah.

Pursuit of the Enemy as far as the Jordan. - [Jdg
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#023.md). As soon as the Midianites had
been put to flight, the Israelitish men of Naphtali, Asher, and
Manasseh, let themselves be convened for the purpose of pursuing them:
i.e., the men of these tribes, whom Gideon had sent away before the
battle, and who were on their way home, could be summoned back again in
a very short time to join in the pursuit of the flying foe. The omission
of Zebulun ([Jdg 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#035).md) is, in all
probability, simply to be attributed to the brevity of the account.

[Judges 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 7:24</span></span>

In order to cut off the retreat of the enemy who was flying to the
Jordan, Gideon sent messengers into the whole of the mountains of
Ephraim with this appeal to the Ephraimites, "Come down (from your
mountains into the lowlands of the Jordan) to meet Midian, and take the
waters from them to Bethbarah and the Jordan," sc., by taking possession
of this district (see [Jdg 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#028).md). "The
waters," mentioned before the Jordan and distinguished from it, must
have been streams across which the flying foe would have to cross to
reach the Jordan, namely, the different brooks and rivers, such as Wady
Maleh, Fyadh, Jamel, Tubs, etc., which flowed down from the eastern side
of the mountains of Ephraim into the Jordan, and ran through the Ghor to
Bethbarah. The situation of Bethbarah is unknown. Even Eusebius could
say nothing definite concerning the place; and the conjecture that it is
the same as Bethabara, which has been regarded ever since the time of
Origen as the place mentioned in [Joh
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#028.md) where John baptized, throws no
light upon the subject, as the situation of Bethabara is also unknown,
to say nothing of the fact that the identity of the two names is very
questionable. The Ephraimites responded to this appeal and took
possession of the waters mentioned, before the Midianites, who could
only move slowly with their flocks and herds, were able to reach the
Jordan. They then captured two of the princes of the Midianites and put
them to death: one of them, Oreb, i.e., the raven, at the rock Oreb; the
other, Zeeb, i.e., the wolf, at the wine-press of Zeeb. Nothing further
is known about these two places. The rock of Oreb is only mentioned
again in [Isa 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026.md), when the prophet
alludes to this celebrated victory. So much, however, is evident from
the verse before us, viz., that the Midianites were beaten by the
Ephraimites at both places, and that the two princes fell there, and the
places received their names from that circumstance. They were not
situated in the land to the east of the Jordan, as Gesenius (on [Isa
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026).md), Rosenmller, and others infer
from the fact that the Ephraimites brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to
Gideon ליּרדּן מעבר ([Jdg 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025).md), but
on the western side of the Jordan, where the Ephraimites had taken
possession of the waters and the Jordan in front of the Midianites.
ליּרדּן מעבר does not mean "from the other side of the Jordan," but
simply "on the other side of (beyond) the Jordan," as in [Jos
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#032.md); [Jos
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#007.md); [Kg1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015.md); and the statement here is not
that the Ephraimites brought the heads from the other side to Gideon on
the west of the river, but that they brought them to Gideon when he was
in the land to the east of the Jordan. This explanation of the words is
required by the context, as well as by the foregoing remark, "they
pursued Midian," according to which the Ephraimites continued the
pursuit of the Midianites after slaying these princes, and also by the
complaint brought against Gideon by the Ephraimites, which is not
mentioned till afterwards ([Jdg 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001)..md),
that he had not summoned them to the war. It is true, this is given
before the account of Gideon's crossing over the Jordan ([Jdg
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#004).md), but in order of time it did not
take place till afterwards, and, as Bertheau has correctly shown, the
historical sequence is somewhat anticipated.
