### [1 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 5:1</span></span>

The families of the tribe of Reuben. - [Ch1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001.md), [Ch1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002.md). Reuben is called the first-born
of Israel, because he was the first-born of Jacob, although, owing to
his having defiled his father's bed ([Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004).md), his birthright, i.e., its
privileges, were transferred to the sons of Joseph, who were not,
however, entered in the family register of the house of Israel according
to the birthright, i.e., as first-born sons. The inf. התיחשׂ with ל
expresses "shall" or "must," cf. Ew. 237, e., "he was not to register,"
i.e., "he was not to be registered." The subject is Joseph, as the
Rabbins, e.g., Kimchi, have perceived. The clauses after הוּא כּי form a
parenthesis, containing the reason of Reuben's being called ישׂראל
בּכור, which is still further established by its being shown (in [Ch1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002).md) how it happened that Joseph,
although the birthright was given to him, according to the disposition
made by the patriarch ([Gen 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005)..md),
yet was not entered in the family registers as first-born. The reason of
this was, "for Judah was strong among his brethren, and (one) from him
became the Prince;" scil. on the strength of the patriarchal blessing
([Gen 49:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008).md), and by means of the
historic fulfilment of this blessing. The "prevailing" of Judah among
his brethren showed itself even under Moses at the numbering of the
people, when the tribe of Judah considerably outnumbered all the other
tribes (cf. t. i. 2, S. 192). Then, again, it appeared after the
division of the land of Canaan among the tribes of Israel, Judah being
called by a declaration of the divine will to be the vanguard of the
army in the war against the Canaanites ([Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)..md); and it was finally made
manifest by the נגיד over Israel being chosen by God from the tribe of
Judah, in the person of David (cf. [Ch1
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004.md) with [Sa1
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014.md); [Sa1
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#030).md). From this we gather that the
short, and from its brevity obscure, sentence ממּנוּ וּלנגיד bears the
signification we have given it. "But the birthright was Joseph's;" i.e.,
the rights of the progenitor were transferred to or remained with him,
for two tribal domains were assigned to his two sons Ephraim and
Manasseh, according to the law of the first-born ([Deu
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015).md).

After this parenthetic explanation, the words "the sons of Reuben, the
first-born of Israel," [Ch1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001.md), are
again taken up in [Ch1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#003.md), and the
sons are enumerated. The names of the four sons correspond to those
given in [Gen 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#009.md); [Exo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014.md), and [Num
26:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005.md).

[1 Chronicles 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 5:4</span></span>

From one of these sons descended Joel, whose family is traced down
through seven generations, to the time of the Assyrian deportation of
the Israelites. But we are neither informed here, nor can we ascertain
from any information elsewhere given in the Old Testament, from which of
the four sons Joel was descended. For although many of the names in [Ch1
5:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#004.md) frequently occur, yet they are
nowhere met with in connection with the family whose members are here
registered. The last-named, Beerah, was לראוּבני נשׂיא, a prince of the
Reubenites, not a prince of the tribe of Reuben, but a prince of a
family of the Reubenites. This is expressed by ל being used instead of
the stat. constr.; cf. Ew. 292, a. In reference to the leading away of
the trans-Jordanic tribes into captivity by Tiglath-pilneser, cf. on
[Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md). The name of this king as
it appears in the Chronicles is always Tiglath-pilneser, but its meaning
has not yet been certainly ascertained. According to Oppert's
interpretation, it = תּגלת־פּלּא־סחר, i.e., "worship of the son of the
Zodiac" (i.e., the Assyrian Hercules); vid., Delitzsch on Isaiah,
Introd.

[1 Chronicles 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 5:7</span></span>

"And his brothers," (each) according to his families in the
registration, according to their descent (properly their generations;
vide for תּולדות on [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004).md), are
(were) the head (the first) Jeiel and Zechariah, and Bela, ... the son
of Joel," probably the Joel already mentioned in [Ch1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#004). "His (i.e., Beerah's.md) brothers"
are the families related to the family of Beerah, which were descended
from the brothers of Joel. That they were not, however, properly
"brothers," is clear from the fact that Bela's descent is traced back to
Joel as the third of the preceding members of his family; and the
conclusion would be the same, even if this Joel be another than the one
mentioned in [Ch1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#004.md). The singular
suffix with למשׁפּחתיו is to be taken distributively or אישׁ may be
supplied before it in thought; cf. [Num
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#034.md); [Num
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#010.md). The word ראשׁ, "head," for the
first-born, stands here before the name, as in [Ch1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#003.md); [Ch1
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#008.md); elsewhere it stands after the
name, e.g., [Ch1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012.md) and [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md). The dwelling-places of Bela and
his family are then given in [Ch1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008.md),
[Ch1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009.md). "He dwelt in Aroer," on the
banks of the brook Arnon ([Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md);
[Jos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002).md), now the ruin Araayr on the
northern bank of the Mojeb (vide on [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034).md). "Until Nebo and Baal-meon"
westward. Nebo, a village on the hill of the same name in the mountains
of Abarim, opposite Jericho (cf. on [Num
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038).md). Baal-meon is probably
identical with the ruin Myun, three-quarters of an hour south-east from
Heshbon.

[1 Chronicles 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 5:9</span></span>

"Eastward to the coming to the desert (i.e., till towards the desert)
from the river Euphrates," i.e., to the great Arabico-Syrian desert,
which stretches from the Euphrates to the eastern frontier of Perea, or
from Gilead to the Euphrates. Bela's family had spread themselves so far
abroad, "for their herds were numerous in the land of Gilead," i.e.,
Perea, the whole trans-Jordanic domain of the Israelites.

[1 Chronicles 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 5:10</span></span>

"In the days of Saul they made war upon the Hagarites, and they fill
into their hands, and they dwelt in their tents over the whole east side
of Gilead." The subject is not determined, so that the words may be
referred either to the whole tribe of Reuben or to the family of Bela
([Ch1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008).md). The circumstance that in
[Ch1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008.md) and [Ch1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009.md) Bela is spoken of in the singular
(יושׁב הוּא and ישׁב), while here the plural is used in reference to the
war, is not sufficient to show that the words do not refer to Bela's
family, for the narrative has already fallen into the plural in the last
clause of [Ch1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009.md). We therefore think
it better to refer [Ch1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010.md) to the
family of Bela, seeing that the wide spread of this family, which is
mentioned in [Ch1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009.md), as far as the
desert to the east of the inhabited land, presupposes the driving out of
the Hagarites dwelling on the eastern plain of Gilead. The notice of
this war, moreover, is clearly inserted here for the purpose of
explaining the wide spread of the Belaites even to the Euphrates desert,
and there is nothing which can be adduced against that reference. The
אחיו in [Ch1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#007.md) does not, as Bertheau
thinks probable, denote that Bela was a contemporary of Beerah, even if
the circumstance that from Bela to Joel only three generations are
enumerated, could be reconciled with this supposition. The spread of
Bela's family over the whole of the Reubenite Gilead, which has just
been narrated, proves decisively that they were not contemporaries. If
Bela lived at the time of the invasion of Gilead by Tiglath-pileser,
when the prince Beerah was carried away into exile, it is certainly
possible that he might have escaped the Assyrians; but he could neither
have had at that time a family "which inhabited all the east land," nor
could he himself have extended his domain from "Aroer and Nebo towards
the wilderness," as the words יושׁב הוּא, [Ch1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008.md), distinctly state. We therefore
hold that Bela was much older than Beerah, for he is introduced as a
great-grandson of Joel, so that his family might have been as widely
distributed as [Ch1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008.md), [Ch1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009.md) state, and have undertaken and
carried out the war of conquest against the Hagarites, referred to in
[Ch1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010.md), as early as the time of
Saul. Thus, too, we can most easily explain the fact that Bela and his
brothers Jeiel and Zechariah are not mentioned. As to הגרעים, cf. on
[Ch1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#019.md).

[1 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 5:11</span></span>

The families of the tribe of Gad, and their dwelling-places. - [Ch1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011.md). In connection with the preceding
statement as to the dwelling-places of the Reubenites, the enumeration
of the families of Gad begins with a statement as to their
dwelling-places: "Over against them (the Reubenites) dwelt the Gadites
in Bashan unto Salcah." Bashan is used here in its wider signification
of the dominion of King Og, which embraced the northern half of Gilead,
i.e., the part of that district which lay on the north side of the
Jabbok, and the whole district of Bashan; cf. on [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md). Salcah formed the boundary
towards the east, and is now Szalchad, about six hours eastward from
Bosra (see on [Deu 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010).md).

[Ch1 5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012.md)

The sons of Gad ([Gen 46:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#016).md) are not
named here, because the enumeration of the families of Gad had been
already introduced by [Ch1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011.md), and
the genealogical connection of the families enumerated in [Ch1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012.md)., with the sons of the tribal
ancestor, had not been handed down. In [Ch1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012.md) four names are mentioned, which
are clearly those of heads of families or fathers'-houses, with the
addition "in Bashan," i.e., dwelling, for ישׁבוּ is to be repeated or
supplied from the preceding verse. - In [Ch1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#013.md) seven other names occur, the
bearers of which are introduced as brothers of those mentioned ([Ch1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012).md), according to their
fathers'-houses. They are therefore heads of fathers'-houses, but the
district in which they dwelt is not given; whence Bertheau concludes,
but wrongly, that the place where they dwelt is not given in the text.
The statement which is here omitted follows in [Ch1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016.md) at a fitting place; for in [Ch1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#014.md) and [Ch1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#015.md) their genealogy, which rightly
goes before the mention of their dwelling-place, is given. אלּה, [Ch1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#014.md), is not to be referred, as
Bertheau thinks, to the four Gadites mentioned in [Ch1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012.md) and [Ch1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#013.md), but only to those mentioned in
[Ch1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#013.md). Nothing more was known of
those four ([Ch1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012).md) but that they
dwelt in Bashan, while the genealogy of the seven is traced up through
eight generations to a certain Buz, of whom nothing further is known, as
the name בּוּז occurs nowhere else, except in [Gen
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md) as that of a son of Nahor. The
names of his ancestors also are not found elsewhere among the Gadites.

[Ch1 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#015.md)

The head of their fathers'-houses (i.e., of those mentioned in [Ch1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#013).md) as Ahi the son of Abdiel, the
son of Guni, who is conjectured to have lived in the time of King Jotham
of Judah, or of Jeroboam II of Israel, when, according to [Ch1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#017.md), genealogical registers of the
Gadites were made up.

[Ch1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016.md)

The families descended from Buz "dwelt in Gilead," in the part of that
district lying to the south of the Jabbok, which Moses had given to the
Gadites and Reubenites ([Deu 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012).md);
"In Bashan and her daughters," that is, in the villages belonging to the
cities of Bashan and Gilead inhabited by them (for the suffix in
בּבנותיה is to be referred distributively to both districts, or the
cities in them). "And in all the pasture grounds (מגרשׁ, cf. on [Num
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#002).md) of Sharon unto their outgoings."
שׁרון, Sharon, lay not in Perea, but is a great plain on the shore of
the Mediterranean Sea, extending from Carmel to near Joppa, famed for
its great fertility and its rich growth of flowers ([Sol
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md); [Isa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009.md); [Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002.md); [Isa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010).md). "A Caesarea Palaestinae usque
ad oppidum Joppe omnis terra, quae cernitur, dicitur Saronas." Jerome in
Onom.; cf. v. Raumer, Pal. S. 50, and Robins. Phys. Geog. S. 123. It is
this plain which is here meant, and the supposition of the older
commentators that there was a second Sharon in the east-Jordan land is
without foundation, as Reland, Palestina illustr. p. 370f., has
correctly remarked. For it is not said that the Gadites possessed cities
in Sharon, but only pastures of Sharon are spoken of, which the Gadites
may have sought out for their herds even on the coast of the
Mediterranean; more especially as the domain of the cis-Jordanic
half-tribe of Manasseh stretched into the plain of Sharon, and it is
probable that at all times there was intercourse between the cis-and
trans-Jordanic Manassites, in which the Gadites may also have taken
part. תּוצאותם are the outgoings of the pastures to the sea, cf. [Jos
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#009.md).

[Ch1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#017.md)

"And these (כּלּם, all the families of Gad, not merely those mentioned
in [Ch1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#013)..md) were registered in the
days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of
Israel." These two kings did not reign contemporaneously, for Jotham
ascended the throne in Judah twenty-five years after the death of
Jeroboam of Israel. Here, therefore, two different registrations must be
referred to, and that carried on under Jotham is mentioned first,
because Judah had the legitimate kingship. That set on foot by Jeroboam
was probably undertaken after that king had restored all the ancient
boundaries of the kingdom of Israel, [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md). King Jotham of Judah could
prepare a register of the Gadites only if a part of the trans-Jordanic
tribes had come temporarily under his dominion. As to any such event,
indeed, we have no accurate information, but the thing in itself is not
unlikely. For as the death of Jeroboam II was followed by complete
anarchy in the kingdom of the ten tribes, and one ruler overthrew the
other, until at last Pekah succeeded in holding the crown for ten years,
while in Judah until Pekah ascended the throne of Israel Uzziah reigned,
and raised his kingdom to greater power and prosperity, the southern
part of the trans-Jordanic land might very well have come for a time
under the sway of Judah. At such a time Jotham may have carried out an
assessment and registration of the Gadites, until his contemporary Pekah
succeeded, with the help of the Syrian king Rezin, in taking from the
king of Judah the dominion over Gilead, and in humbling the kingdom of
Judah in the reign of Ahaz.

[1 Chronicles 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 5:18</span></span>

War of the trans-Jordanic tribes of Israel with Arabic tribes. - As the
half-tribe of Manasseh also took part in this war, we should have
expected the account of it after [Ch1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#024.md). Bertheau regards its position
here as a result of striving after a symmetrical distribution of the
historical information. "In the case of Reuben," he says, "the
historical information is in [Ch1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010.md); in the case of the half-tribe of
Manasseh, in [Ch1 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025.md), [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md); as to Gad, we have our record in
[Ch1 5:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018.md), which, together with the
account in [Ch1 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025.md), [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md), refers to all the trans-Jordanic
Israelites." But it is much more likely that the reason of it will be
found in the character of the authorities which the author of the
Chronicle made use of, in which, probably, the notes regarding this war
were contained in the genealogical register of the Gadites.

[Ch1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018.md)

חיל מן־בּני belongs to the predicate of the sentence, "They were the
sons of Valour," i.e., they belonged to the valiant warriors, "men
bearing shield and sword (weapons of offence and defence), and those
treading (or bending) the bow," i.e., skilful bowmen. מלחמה למוּדי,
people practised in war; cf. the portrayal of the warlike valour of Gad
and Manasseh, [Ch1 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md), [Ch1
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#021.md). "The number 44,760 must be
founded upon an accurate reckoning" (Berth.); but in comparison with the
number of men capable of bearing arms in those tribes in the time of
Moses, it is somewhat inconsiderable: for at the first numbering under
him Reuben alone had 46,500 and Gad 45,650, and at the second numbering
Reuben had 43,730 and Gad 40,500 men; see on Num 1-4 (1:2, S. 192).

[Ch1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#019.md)

"They made was with the Hagarites and Jethur, Nephish and Nodab." So
early as the time of Saul the Reubenites had victoriously made war upon
the Hagarites (see [Ch1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010).md); but the
war here mentioned was certainly at a later time, and has no further
connection with that in [Ch1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010.md)
except that both arose from similar causes. The time of the second is
not given, and all we know from [Ch1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022.md) is that it had broken out before
the trans-Jordanic Israelites were led captive by the Assyrians.
הגריאים, in [Psa 83:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#007.md) contracted into
הגרים, are the Ἀγραῖοι, whom Strabo, xvi. p. 767, introduces, on the
authority of Eratosthenes, as leading a nomadic life in the great
Arabico-Syrian desert, along with the Nabataeans and Chaulotaeans.
Jetur, from whom the Itureans are descended, and Nephish, are
Ishmaelites; cf. on [Gen 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#015.md). Nodab,
mentioned only here, is a Bedouin tribe of whom nothing more is known.

[Ch1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020.md)

The Israelites, with God's help, gained the victory. יעזרוּ, "it was
helped to them," i.e., by God "against them" - the Hagarites and their
allies. שׁעמּהם contracted from עמּהם אשׁר. נעתּור is not an uncommon
form of the perf. Niph., which would not be suitable in a continuous
sentence, but the inf. absol. Niph. used instead of the third pers.
perf. (cf. Gesen. Heb. Gramm. 131, 4): "and (God) was entreated of them,
because they trusted in Him." From these words we may conclude that the
war was a very serious one, in which the possession of the land was at
stake. As the trans-Jordanic tribes lived mainly by cattle-breeding, and
the Arabian tribes on the eastern frontier of their land were also a
shepherd people, quarrels could easily arise as to the possession of the
pasture grounds, which might lead to a war of extermination.

[Ch1 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#021.md)

The conquerors captured a great booty in herds, 50,000 camels, 250,000
head of small cattle (sheep and goats), 2000 asses, and 100,000 persons
- all round numbers; cf. the rich booty obtained in the war against the
Midianites, [Num 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#011.md), [Num
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#032.md).

[Ch1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022.md)

This rich booty should not surprise us, "for there fell many slain,"
i.e., the enemy had suffered a very bloody defeat. "For the war was from
God," i.e., conducted to this result: cf. [Ch2
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#020.md); [Sa1
17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047.md). "And they dwelt in their
stead," i.e., they took possession of the pasture grounds, which up to
that time had belonged to the Arabs, and held them until they were
carried away captive by the Assyrians; see [Ch1

The families of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, and the leading
away of the East-Jordan Israelites into the Assyrian exile. - [Ch1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023.md). The half-tribe of Manasseh in
Bashan was very numerous (רבוּ המּה), "and they dwelt in the land of
Bashan (i.e., the Bashan inhabited by Gad, [Ch1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012)) (northwards.md) to Baal Hermon," -
i.e., according to the more accurate designation of the place in [Jos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md) and [Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005.md), in the valley of Lebanon under
Mount Hermon, probably the present Bnjas, at the foot of Hermon (see on
[Num 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008).md), - "and Senir and Mount
Hermon." שׂניר, which according to [Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009.md) was the name of Hermon or
Antilibanus in use among the Amorites, is here and in [Eze
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#005.md) the name of a part of those
mountains (vide on [Deu 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009).md), just as
"mount Hermon" is the name of another part of this range.

[Ch1 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#024.md)

Seven heads of fathers'-houses of the half-tribe of Manasseh are
enumerated, and characterized as valiant heroes and famous men. The
enumeration of the names begins strangely with ו (ואפר); perhaps a name
has fallen out before it. Nothing has been handed down as to any of
these names.

[Ch1 5:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025.md)

[Ch1 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025.md) and [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md) form the conclusion of the
register of the two and a half trans-Jordanic tribes. The sons of
Manasseh are not the subject to ויּמעלוּ, but the Reubenites and
Manassites, as is clear from [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md). These fell away faithlessly from
the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the
people of the land, whom God had destroyed before them, i.e., the
Amorites or Canaanites. "And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of
the Assyrian kings Pul and Tiglath-pilneser, and he (this latter) led
them away captives to Halah and Habor," etc. את־רוּח ויּער, Lavater has
rightly rendered, "in mentem illis dedit, movit eos, ut expeditionem
facerent contra illos;" cf. [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md). Pul is mentioned as being the
first Assyrian king who attacked the land of Israel, cf. [Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md). The deportation began, however,
only with Tiglath-pileser, who led the East-Jordan tribes into exile,
[Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md). To him ויּגלם sing.
refers. The suffix is defined by the following acc., וגו לרעוּבני; ל is,
according to the later usage, nota acc.; cf. Ew. 277, e. So also before
the name חלח, "to Halah," i.e., probably the district Καλαχήνη (in
Strabo) on the east side of the Tigris near Adiabene, to the north of
Nineveh, on the frontier of Armenia (cf. on [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006).md). In the second book of Kings
([Ch1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029).md) the district to which the
two and a half tribes were sent as exiles is not accurately determined,
being only called in general Asshur (Assyria). The names in our verse
are there ([Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006).md) the names of the
districts to which Shalmaneser sent the remainder of the ten tribes
after the destruction of the kingdom of Israel. It is therefore
questionable whether the author of the Chronicle took his account from
an authority used by him, or if he names these districts only according
to general recollection, in which the times of Shalmaneser and of
Tiglath-pileser are not very accurately distinguished (Berth.). We
consider the first supposition the more probable, not merely because he
inverts the order of the names, but mainly because he gives the name הרא
instead of "the cities of Media," as it is in Kings, and that name he
could only have obtained from his authorities. חבור is not the river
Chaboras in Mesopotamia, which falls into the Euphrates near Circesium,
for that river is called in Ezekiel כּבר, but is a district in northern
Assyria, where Jakut mentions that there is both a mountain Χαβώρας on
the frontier of Assyria and Media (Ptolem. vi. 1), and a river Khabur
Chasaniae, which still bears the old name Khbur, rising in the
neighbourhood of the upper Zab, near Amadijeh, and falling into the
Tigris below Jezirah. This Khbur is the river of Gozan (vide on [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006).md). The word הרא appears to be the
Aramaic form of the Hebrew הר, mountains, and the vernacular designation
usual in the mouths of the people of the mountain land of Media, which
is called also in Arabic el Jebl (the mountains). This name can
therefore only have been handed down from the exiles who dwelt there.
