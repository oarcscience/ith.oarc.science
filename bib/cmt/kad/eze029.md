### [Ezekiel Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 29:0</span></span>

Against Egypt - Ezekiel 29-32

The announcement of the judgment upon Egypt is proclaimed in seven
"words of God." The first five are threats. The first (Ezekiel 29:1-16)
contains a threat of the judgment upon Pharaoh and his people and land,
expressed in grand and general traits. The second ([Eze
29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017).md) gives a special prediction
of the conquest and plundering of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar. The third
(Ezekiel 30:1-19) depicts the day of judgment which will break upon
Egypt and its allies. The fourth ([Eze
30:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020).md) foretells the annihilation
of the might of Pharaoh by the king of Babylon; and the fifth (Ezekiel
31) holds up as a warning to the king and people of Egypt the glory and
the overthrow of Assyria. The last two words of God in Ezekiel 32
contain lamentations over the destruction of Pharaoh and his might,
viz., Ezekiel 32:1-16, a lamentation over the king of Egypt; and Ezekiel
32:17-32, a second lamentation over the destruction of his imperial
power. - Ezekiel's prophecy concerning Egypt assumes this elaborate
form, because he regards the power of Pharaoh and Egypt as the
embodiment of that phase of the imperial power which imagines in its
ungodly self-deification that it is able to uphold the kingdom of God,
and thus seduces the people of God to rely with false confidence upon
the imperial power of this world.

[Ezekiel 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 29:1</span></span>

The Judgment upon Pharaoh and His People and Land

Because Pharaoh looks upon himself as the creator of his kingdom and of
his might, he is to be destroyed with his men of war ([Eze
29:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#002).md). In order that Israel may no
longer put its trust in the fragile power of Egypt, the sword shall cut
off from Egypt both man and beast, the land shall be turned into a
barren wilderness, and the people shall be scattered over the lands
([Eze 29:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005).md). But after the
expiration of the time appointed for its punishment, both people and
land shall be restored, though only to remain an insignificant kingdom
([Eze 29:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013).md). - According to [Eze
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md), this prophecy belongs to the
tenth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin; and as we may see by
comparing it with the other oracles against Egypt of which the dates are
given, it was the first word of God uttered by Ezekiel concerning this
imperial kingdom. The contents also harmonize with this, inasmuch as the
threat which it contains merely announces in general terms the overthrow
of the might of Egypt and its king, without naming the instrument
employed to execute the judgment, and at the same time the future
condition of Egypt is also disclosed.

[Eze 29:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md)

Destruction of the might of Pharaoh, and devastation of Egypt

[Eze 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md). In the tenth year, in the
tenth (month), on the twelfth of the month, the word of Jehovah came to
me, saying, [Eze 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#002.md). Son of man,
direct thy face against Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and prophesy against
him and against all Egypt. [Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md).
Speak and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with
thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, thou great dragon which lieth in its
rivers, which saith, "Mine is the river, and I have made it for myself."
[Eze 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004.md). I will put a ring into thy
jaws, and cause the fishes of thy rivers to hang upon thy scales, and
draw thee out of thy rivers, and all the fishes of thy rivers which hang
upon thy scales; [Eze 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005.md). And will
cast thee into the desert, thee and all the fishes of thy rivers; upon
the surface of the field wilt thou fall, thou wilt not be lifted up nor
gathered together; I give thee for food to the beasts of the earth and
the birds of the heaven. [Eze 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md).
And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall learn that I am Jehovah. Because
it is a reed-staff to the house of Israel, - [Eze
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007.md). When they grasp thee by thy
branches, thou crackest and tearest open all their shoulder; and when
they lean upon thee, thou breakest and causest all their loins to shake,
- [Eze 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#008.md). Therefore thus saith the
Lord Jehovah, Behold, I bring upon thee the sword, and will cut off from
thee man and beast; [Eze 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#009.md). And the
land of Egypt will become a waste and desolation, and they shall learn
that I am Jehovah. Because he saith: "The river is mine, and I have made
it," [Eze 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010.md). Therefore, behold, I
will deal with thee and thy rivers, and will make the land of Egypt into
barren waste desolations from Migdol to Syene, even to the border of
Cush. [Eze 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#011.md). The foot of man will
not pass through it, and the foot of beast will not pass through it, and
it will not be inhabited for forty years. [Eze
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#012.md). I make the land of Egypt a
waste in the midst of devastated lands, and its cities shall be waste
among desolate cities forty years; and I scatter the Egyptians among the
nations, and disperse them in the lands. - The date given, viz., "in the
tenth year," is defended even by Hitzig as more correct than the reading
of the lxx, ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ δωδεκάτω; and he supposes the Alexandrian
reading to have originated in the fact that the last date mentioned in
[Eze 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001.md) had already brought down the
account to the eleventh year. - Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, against whom
the threat is first directed, is called "the great dragon" in [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md). תּנּים (here and [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002).md) is equivalent to תּנּין,
literally, the lengthened animal, the snake; here, the water-snake, the
crocodile, the standing symbol of Egypt in the prophets (cf. [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md); [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md); [Psa
74:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013).md), which is here transferred to
Pharaoh, as the ruler of Egypt and representative of its power. By יארים
we are to understand the arms and canals of the Nile (vid., [Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018).md). The predicate, "lying in the
midst of his rivers," points at once to the proud security in his own
power to which Pharaoh gave himself up. As the crocodile lies quietly in
the waters of the Nile, as though he were lord of the river; so did
Pharaoh regard himself as the omnipotent lord of Egypt. His words affirm
this: "the river is mine, I have made it for myself." The suffix
attached to עשׂיתני stands in the place of לי, as [Eze
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#009.md), where the suffix is wanting,
clearly shows. There is an incorrectness in this use of the suffix,
which evidently passed into the language of literature from the popular
phraseology (cf. Ewald, 315b). The rendering of the Vulgate, ego feci
memetipsum, is false. יארי is the expression used by him as a king who
regards the land and its rivers as his own property; in connection with
which we must bear in mind that Egypt is indebted to the Nile not only
for its greatness, but for its actual existence. In this respect Pharaoh
says emphatically לי, it is mine, it belongs to me, because he regards
himself as the creator. The words, "I have made it for myself," simply
explain the reason for the expression לי, and affirm more than "I have
put myself in possession of this through my own power, or have acquired
its blessings for myself" (Hvernick); or, "I have put it into its
present condition by constructing canals, dams, sluices, and buildings
by the river-side" (Hitzig). Pharaoh calls himself the creator of the
Nile, because he regards himself as the creator of the greatness of
Egypt. This pride, in which he forgets God and attributes divine power
to himself, is the cause of his sin, for which he will be overthrown by
God. God will draw the crocodile Pharaoh out of his Nile with hooks, and
cast him upon the dry land, where he and the fishes that have been drawn
out along with him upon his scales will not be gathered up, but devoured
by the wild beasts and birds of prey. The figure is derived from the
manner in which even in ancient times the crocodile was caught with
large hooks of a peculiar construction (compare Herod. ii. 70, and the
testimonies of travellers in Oedmann's Vermischten Sammlungen, III pp.
6ff., and Jomard in the Dscription de l'Egypte, I p. 27). The form חחיים
with a double Yod is a copyist's error, probably occasioned by the
double Yod occurring after ח in בּלחייך, which follows. A dual form for
חחים is unsuitable, and is not used anywhere else even by Ezekiel (cf.
[Eze 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#004.md), [Eze
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#009.md), and more especially [Eze
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#004).md).

The fishes which hang upon the scales of the monster, and are drawn
along with it out of the Nile, are the inhabitants of Egypt, for the
Nile represents the land. The casting of the beast into the wilderness,
where it putrefies and is devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, must
not be interpreted in the insipid manner proposed by Hitzig, namely,
that Pharaoh would advance with his army into the desert of Arabia and
be defeated there. The wilderness is the dry and barren land, in which
animals that inhabit the water must perish; and the thought is simply
that the monster will be cast upon the desert land, where it will
finally become the food of the beasts of prey.

In [Eze 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md) the construction is a
subject of dispute, inasmuch as many of the commentators follow the
Hebrew division of the verse, taking the second hemistich 'יען היותם וגו
as dependent upon the first half of the verse, for which it assigns the
reason, and then interpreting [Eze
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007.md) as a further development of [Eze
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md), and commencing a new period with
[Eze 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#008.md) (Hitzig, Kliefoth, and
others). But it is decidedly wrong to connect together the two halves of
the sixth verse, if only for the simple reason that the formula וידעוּ
כּי אני יהוה, which occurs so frequently elsewhere in Ezekiel,
invariably closes a train of thought, and is never followed by the
addition of a further reason. Moreover, a sentence commencing with יען
is just as invariably followed by an apodosis introduced by לכן, of
which we have an example just below in [Eze
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#009.md) and [Eze
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010.md). For both these reasons it is
absolutely necessary that we should regard 'יען ה as the beginning of a
protasis, the apodosis to which commences with לכן in [Eze
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#008.md). The correctness of this
construction is established beyond all doubt by the fact that from [Eze
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md) onwards it is no longer Pharaoh
who is spoken of, as in [Eze 29:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md),
but Egypt; so that יען introduces a new train of thought. But [Eze
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007.md) is clearly shown, both by the
contents and the form, to be an explanatory intermediate clause inserted
as a parenthesis. And inasmuch as the protasis is removed in consequence
to some distance from its apodosis, Ezekiel has introduced the formula
"thus saith the Lord Jehovah" at the commencement of the apodosis, for
the purpose of giving additional emphasis to the announcement of the
punishment. [Eze 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007.md) cannot in any
case be regarded as the protasis, the apodosis to which commences with
the לכן in [Eze 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#008.md), and Hvernick
maintains. The suffix attached to היותם, to which Hitzig takes
exception, because he has misunderstood the construction, and which he
would conjecture away, refers to מצרים as a land or kingdom. Because the
kingdom of Egypt was a reed-staff to the house of Israel (a figure drawn
from the physical character of the banks of the Nile, with its thick
growth of tall, thick rushes, and recalling to mind [Isa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006).md), the Lord would bring the sword
upon it and cut off from it both man and beast. But before this apodosis
the figure of the reed-staff is more clearly defined: "when they (the
Israelites) take thee by thy branches, thou breakest," etc. This
explanation is not to be taken as referring to any particular facts
either of the past or future, but indicates the deceptive nature of
Egypt as the standing characteristic of that kingdom. At the same time,
to give greater vivacity to the description, the words concerning Egypt
are changed into a direct address to the Egyptians, i.e., not to
Pharaoh, but to the Egyptian people regarded as a single individual. The
expression בכפך causes some difficulty, since the ordinary meaning of
כּף (hand) is apparently unsuitable, inasmuch as the verb תּרוץ, from
רצץ, to break or crack (not to break in pieces, i.e., to break quite
through), clearly shows that the figure if the reed is still continued.
The Keri בּכּף is a bad emendation, based upon the rendering "to grasp
with the hand," which is grammatically inadmissible. תּפשׂ with ב does
not mean to grasp with something, but to seize upon something, to take
hold of a person ([Isa 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006.md); [Deu
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#017).md), so that בכפך can only be an
explanatory apposition to בּך. The meaning grip, or grasp of the hand,
is also unsuitable and cannot be sustained, as the plural כּפּות alone
is used in this sense in [Sol 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005.md). The
only meaning appropriate to the figure is that of branches, which is
sustained, so far as the language is concerned, by the use of the plural
כּפּות for palm-branches in [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md), and of the singular כּפּה for
the collection of branches in [Job
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032.md), and [Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013.md); [Isa
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#015.md); and this is apparently in
perfect harmony with natural facts, since the tall reed of the Nile,
more especially the papyrus, is furnished with hollow, sword-shaped
leaves at the lower part of the talk. When it cracks, the reed-staff
pierces the shoulder of the man who has grasped it, and tears it; and if
a man lean upon it, it breaks in pieces and causes all the loins to
tremble. העמיד cannot mean to cause to stand, or to set upright, still
less render stiff and rigid. The latter meaning cannot be established
from the usage of the language, and would be unsuitable here. For if a
stick on which a man leans should break and penetrate his loins, it
would inflict such injury upon them as to cause him to fall, and not to
remain stiff and rigid. העמד cannot have any other meaning than that of
המעד, to cause to tremble or relax, as in [Psa
69:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#024.md), to shake the firmness of the
loins, so that the power to stand is impaired.

In the apodosis the thought of the land gives place to that of the
people; hence the use of the feminine suffixes עליך and ממּך in the
place of the masculine suffixes בּך and עליך in [Eze
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007.md). Man and beast shall be cut off,
and the land made into a desert waste by the sword, i.e., by war. This
is carried out still further in [Eze
29:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#009.md); and once again in the
protasis 9b (cf. [Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003).md) the
inordinate pride of the king is placed in the foreground as the reason
for the devastation of his land and kingdom. The Lord will make of Egypt
the most desolate wilderness. חרבות is intensified into a superlative by
the double genitive חרב שׁממה, desolation of the wilderness. Throughout
its whole extent from Migdol, i.e., Magdolo, according to the Itiner.
Anton. p. 171 (ed. Wessel), twelve Roman miles from Pelusium; in the
Coptic Meshtol, Egyptian Màktr (Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr. I pp. 261f.),
the most northerly place in Egypt. סונה, to Syene (for the construction
see [Eze 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006.md) and [Eze
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003).md), Συήνη, Sun in the inscriptions,
according to Brugsch (Geogr. Inschr. I. p. 155), probably the profane
designation of the place (Coptic Souan), the most southerly border town
of Egypt in the direction of Cush, i.e., Ethiopia, on the eastern bank
of the Nile, some ruins of which are still to be seen in the modern
Assvan (Assuan, Arab. aswa=n), which is situated to the north-east of
them (vid., Brugsch, Reiseber. aus. Aegypten, p. 247, and Leyrer in
Herzog's Encyclopaedia). The additional clause, "and to the border of
Cush," does not give a fresh terminal point, still further advanced, but
simply defines with still greater clearness the boundary toward the
south, viz., to Syene, where Egypt terminates and Ethiopia beings. In
[Eze 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#011.md) the desolation is more
fully depicted. לא תשׁב, it will not dwell, poetical for "be inhabited,"
as in Joel 4 (3):20, [Isa 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md), etc.
This devastation shall last for forty years, and so long shall the
people of Egypt be scattered among the nations. But after the expiration
of that time they shall be gathered together again ([Eze
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013).md). The number forty is neither a
round number (Hitzig) nor a very long time (Ewald), but is a symbolical
term denoting a period appointed by God for punishment and penitence
(see the comm. on [Eze 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006).md), which is
not to be understood in a chronological sense, or capable of being
calculated.

[Eze 29:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013.md)

Restoration of Egypt

[Eze 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013.md). For thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians out of
the nations, whither they were scattered. [Eze
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014.md). And I will turn the captivity
of Egypt, and will bring them back into the land of Pathros, into the
land of their origin, and they shall be a lowly kingdom there. [Eze
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#015.md). Lowlier than the kingdoms shall
it be, and exalt itself no more over the nations; and I will make them
small, so that they shall rule no more over the nations. [Eze
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#016.md). And it shall be no more the
confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance when
they incline towards it; and they shall learn that I am the Lord
Jehovah. - The turning of the period of Egypt's punishment is connected
by כּי, which refers to the time indicated, viz., "forty years." For
forty years shall Egypt be utterly laid waste; for after the expiration
of that period the Lord will gather the Egyptians again from their
dispersion among the nations, turn their captivity, i.e., put an end to
their suffering (see the comm. on [Eze
16:53](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053).md), and lead them back into the
land of their birth, i.e., of their origin (for מכוּרה, see [Eze
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003).md), namely, to Pathros. פתרוס, the
Egyptian Petorēs (Παθούρης, lxx [Jer
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001).md), or south land, i.e., Upper
Egypt, the Thebais of the Greeks and Romans. The designation of Upper
Egypt as the mother country of the Egyptians, or the land of their
nativity, is confirmed not only by the accounts given by Herodotus (ii.
4 and 15) and Diodorus Sic. (i. 50), but also by the Egyptian mythology,
according to which the first king who reigned after the gods, viz.,
Menes or Mena, sprang from the city of Thinis (Thynis), Egypt. Tenj, in
the neighbourhood of Abydos in Upper Egypt, and founded the city of
Memphis in Lower Egypt, which became so celebrated in later times (vid.,
Brugsch, Histoire d'Egypte, I p. 16). But Egypt shall not attain to its
former power any more. It will be and continue a lowly kingdom, that it
may not again become a ground of confidence to Israel, a power upon
which Israel can rely, so as to fall into guilt and punishment. The
subject to ולא יהיה is Egypt as a nation, notwithstanding the fact that
it has previously been construed in the feminine as a land or kingdom,
and in אחריהם the Egyptians are spoken of in the plural number. For it
is out of the question to take מזכּיר עון as the subject to לא יהיה in
the sense of "no more shall one who calls guilt to remembrance inspire
the house of Israel with confidence," as Kliefoth proposes, not only
because of the arrangement of the words, but because the more precise
definition of מזכּיר עון as 'בּפנותם אח clearly shows that Egypt is the
subject of the sentence; whereas, in order to connect this definition in
any way, Kliefoth is compelled to resort to the interpolation of the
words, "which it committed." מזכּיר עון is in apposition to מבטח; making
Egypt the ground of confidence, brings into remembrance before God the
guilt of Israel, which consists in the fact that the Israelites turn to
the Egyptians and seek salvation from them, so that He is obliged to
punish them (vid., [Eze 21:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028).md). -
The truth of the prediction in [Eze
29:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013.md) has been confirmed by
history, inasmuch as Egypt never recovered its former power after the
Chaldean period. - Moreover, if we compare the Messianic promise for
Egypt in [Isa 19:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md) with the
prediction in [Eze 29:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013.md), we are
struck at once with the peculiarity of Ezekiel, already referred to in
the introductory remarks on Ezekiel 25-32, namely, that he leaves
entirely out of sight the Messianic future of the heathen nations.

[Ezekiel 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 29:17</span></span>

Conquest and Plundering of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar

[Eze 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017.md). In the seven and twentieth
year, in the first (moon), on the first of the moon, the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018.md). Son of
man, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, has made his army perform hard
work at Tyre: every head is bald, and every shoulder grazed, and no
wages have been given to him and to his army from Tyre for the work
which he performed against it. [Eze
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#019.md). Therefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Behold, I give Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the land of
Egypt, that he may carry away its possessions, and plunder its plunder,
and make booty of its booty, and this may be the wages of his army. [Eze
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#020.md). As the pay for which he worked,
I give him the land of Egypt, because they did it for me, is the saying
of the Lord Jehovah. [Eze 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#021.md). In
that day will I cause a horn to sprout to the house of Israel, and I
will open the mouth for thee in the midst of them; and they shall know
that I am Jehovah. - This brief prophecy concerning Egypt was uttered
about seventeen years after the preceding word of God, and was the
latest of all the predictions of Ezekiel that are supplied with dates.
But notwithstanding its brevity, it is not to be taken in connection
with the utterance which follows in Ezekiel 30:1-19 so as to form one
prophecy, as Hitzig supposes. This is at variance not only with the
formula in [Eze 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001.md), which is the
usual introduction to a new word of God, but also with [Eze
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#021.md) of the present chapter, which is
obviously intended to bring the previous word of God to a close. This
termination, which is analogous to the closing words of the prophecies
against Tyre and Sidon in [Eze
28:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025.md), also shows that the present
word of God contains the last of Ezekiel's prophecies against the
Egyptian world-power, and that the only reason why the prophet did not
place it at the end when collecting his prophecies - that is to say,
after Ezekiel 32 - was, that the promise in v. 30, that the Lord would
cause a horn to bud to the house of Israel, contained the correlate to
the declaration that Egypt was henceforth to be but a lowly kingdom.
Moreover, this threat of judgment, which is as brief as it is definite,
was well fitted to prepare the way and to serve as an introduction for
the more elaborate threats which follow. The contents of the prophecy,
namely, the assurance that God would give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar as
spoil in return for the hard labour which he and his army had performed
at Tyre, point to the time immediately following the termination of the
thirteen years' siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar. If we compare with this
the date given in [Eze 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017.md), the
siege was brought to a close in the twenty-seventh year of the captivity
of Jehoiachin, i.e., b.c. 572, and must therefore have commenced in the
year b.c. 586, or about two years after the destruction of Jerusalem,
and with this the extract given by Josephus (c. Ap. i. 21) from the
Tyrian annals agrees.

(Note: For the purpose of furnishing the proof that the temple at
Jerusalem lay in ruins for fifty years, from the time of its destruction
till the commencement of its rebuilding, Josephus gives in the passage
referred to above the years of the several reigns of the kings and
judges of Tyre from Ithobal to Hirom, in whose reign Cyrus took the
kingdom; from which it is apparent that fifty years elapsed from the
commencement of the siege of Tyre to the fourteenth year of Hirom, in
which Cyrus began to reign. At the same time, the seventh year of
Nebuchadnezzar is given by mistake instead of the seventeenth or
nineteenth as the date of the beginning of the siege. (Compare on this
point Movers, Phnizier, II 1, pp. 437ff.; M. v. Niebuhr, Gesch. Assurs
u. Bab. pp. 106ff.; and M. Duncker, Gesch. des Altert. I p. 841.))

העביד עבדה, to cause a work to be executed, or service to be rendered.
This labour was so severe, that every head was bald and every shoulder
grazed. These words have been correctly interpreted by the commentators,
even by Ewald, as referring to the heavy burdens that had to be carried
in order to fill up the strait which separated Insular Tyre from the
mainland. They confirm what we have said above, in the remarks on [Eze
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#010.md) and elsewhere, concerning the
capture of Tyre.

But neither he nor his army had received any recompense for their severe
toil. This does not imply that Nebuchadnezzar had been unable to
accomplish the work which he had undertaken, i.e., to execute his design
and conquer the city, but simply that he had not received the recompense
which he expected after this severe labour; in other words, had not
found the booty he hoped for when the city was taken (see the
introductory remarks on Ezekiel 26-28). To compensate him for this, the
Lord will give him the land of Egypt with its possessions as booty,
ונשׂא המנהּ, that he may carry off the abundance of its possessions, its
wealth; not that he may lead away the multitude of its people (De Wette,
Kliefoth, etc.), for "נשׂא is not the appropriate expression for this"
(Hitzig). המון, abundance of possessions, as in [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md); [Psa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016.md), etc. פּעלּה, the doing of a
thing; then that which is gained by working, the recompense for labour,
as in [Lev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#013.md) and other passages.
אשׁר עשׂוּ is taken by Hitzig as referring to the Egyptians, and
rendered, "in consequence of that which they have done to me." But
although אשׁר may be taken in this sense (vid., [Isa
65:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#018).md), the arguments employed by
Hitzig in opposition to the ordinary rendering - "for they
(Nebuchadnezzar and his army) have done it for me," i.e., have performed
their hard work at Tyre for me and by my commission - have no force
whatever. This use of עשׂה is thoroughly established by [Gen
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#030.md); and the objection which he
raises, namely, that "the assertion that Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre in
the service of Jehovah could only have been properly made by Ezekiel in
the event of the city having been really conquered," is out of place,
for this simple reason, that the assumption that the city was not taken
is a mere conjecture; and even if the conjecture could be sustained, the
siege itself might still be a work undertaken in the service of Jehovah.
And the principal argument, namely, "that we should necessarily expect
עשׂה (instead of עשׂוּ), inasmuch as with עשׂוּ every Hebrew reader
would inevitably take אשׁר as referring to מצרים," is altogether wide of
the mark; for מצרים does not signify the Egyptians in this passage, but
the land of Egypt alone is spoken of both in the verse before us and
throughout the oracle, and for this עשׂוּ is quite unsuitable, whereas
the context suggests in the most natural way the allusion to
Nebuchadnezzar and his army. But what is absolutely decisive is the
circumstance that the thought itself, "in consequence of what the
Egyptians have done to me," i.e., what evil they have done, is foreign
to, if not at variance with, all the prophecies of Ezekiel concerning
Egypt. For the guilt of Egypt and its Pharaoh mentioned by Ezekiel is
not any crime against Jehovah, but simply Pharaoh's deification of
himself, and the treacherous nature of the help which Egypt afforded to
Israel. ליהוה = עשׂה לי is not the appropriate expression for this, in
support of which assertion we might point to עשׂוּ לי in [Eze
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#038.md). - [Eze
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#021.md). On that day, namely, when the
judgment upon Egypt is executed by Nebuchadnezzar, the Lord will cause a
horn to sprout or grow to the house (people) of Israel. The horn is a
symbol of might and strength, by which the attacks of foreigners are
warded off. By the overthrow of Judah the horn of Israel was cut off
([Lam 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003.md); compare also [Jer
48:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#025).md). In עצמיח קרן the promise
coincides, so far as the words are concerned, with [Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md); but it also points back to the
prophetic words of the godly Hannah in [Sa1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md), "My horn is exalted in Jehovah,
my mouth hath opened itself wide over my enemies," and is Messianic in
the broader sense of the word. The horn which the Lord will cause to
sprout to the people of Israel is neither Zerubbabel nor the Messiah,
but the Messianic salvation. The reason for connecting this promise of
salvation for Israel with the overthrow of the power of Egypt, as
Hvernick has observed, is that "Egypt presented itself to the prophet as
the power in which the idea of heathenism was embodied and
circumscribed." In the might of Egypt the world-power is shattered, and
the overthrow of the world-power is the dawn of the unfolding of the
might of the kingdom of God. Then also will the Lord give to His prophet
an opening of the mouth in the midst of Israel. These words are
unquestionably connected with the promise of God in [Eze
24:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#026.md), that after the fall of
Jerusalem the mouth of Ezekiel should be opened, and also with the
fulfilment of that promise in [Eze
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022.md); but they have a much more
comprehensive meaning, namely, that with the dawn of salvation in
Israel, i.e., in the church of the Lord, the word of prophecy would
sound forth in the richest measure, inasmuch as, according to Joel ([Eze
2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001).md), a universal outpouring of the
Spirit of God would then take place. In this light Theodoret is correct
in his remark, that "through Ezekiel He signified the whole band of
prophets." But Kliefoth has quite mistaken the meaning of the words when
he discovers in them the thought that "God would then give the prophet a
new word of God concerning both Egypt and Israel, and that this is
contained in the oracle in Ezekiel 30:1-19." Such a view as this is
proved at once to be false, apart from other grounds, by the expression
בּתוכם (in the midst of them), which cannot be taken as applying to
Egypt and Israel, but can only refer to בּית ישׂראל, the house of
Israel.
