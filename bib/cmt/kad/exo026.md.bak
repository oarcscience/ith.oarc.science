### [Exodus Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 26:1</span></span>

(cf. Ex 36:8-38). The Dwelling-Place. - This was to be formed of a
framework of wood, and of tapestry and curtains. The description
commences with the tapestry or tent-cloth ([Exo
26:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001).md), which made the framework
(vv. 15-30) into a dwelling. The inner lining is mentioned first ([Exo
26:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001).md), because this made the
dwelling into a tent (tabernacle). This inner tent-cloth was to consist
of ten curtains (יריעת, αὐλαίαι), or, as Luther has more aptly rendered
it, Teppiche, pieces of tapestry, i.e., of cloth composed of byssus
yarn, hyacinth, purple, and scarlet. משׁזר twisted, signifies yarn
composed of various colours twisted together, from which the finer kinds
of byssus, for which the Egyptians were so celebrated, were made (vid.,
Hengstenberg, Egypt, pp. 139ff.). The byssus yarn was of a clear white,
and this was woven into mixed cloth by combination with dark blue, and
dark and fiery red. It was not to be in simple stripes or checks,
however; but the variegated yarn was to be woven (embroidered) into the
white byssus, so as to form artistic figures of cherubim ("cherubim,
work of the artistic weaver, shalt thou make it"). חשׁב מעשׂה (lit.,
work or labour of the thinker) is applied to artistic weaving, in which
either figures or gold threads ([Exo
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006.md), [Exo
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#008.md), [Exo
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#015).md) are worked into the cloth, and
which is to be distinguished from רקם מעשׂה variegated weaving ([Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036).md).

[Exodus 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 26:2</span></span>

The length of each piece was to be 28 cubits, and the breadth 4 cubits,
one measure for all; and five of these pieces were to be "joined
together one to another," i.e., joined or sewed together into a piece of
28 cubits in length and 20 in breadth, and the same with the other five.

[Exodus 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 26:4</span></span>

They were also to make 50 hyacinth loops "on the border of the one piece
of tapestry, from the end in the join," i.e., on the extreme edge of the
five pieces that were sewed together; and the same "on the border of the
last piece in the second joined tapestry." Thus there were to be fifty
loops in each of the two large pieces, and these loops were to be
מקבּילת "taking up the loops one the other;" that is to say, they were
to be so made that the loops in the two pieces should exactly meet.

[Exodus 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 26:6</span></span>

Fifty golden clasps were also to be made, to fasten the pieces of
drapery (the two halves of the tent-cloth) together, "that it might be a
dwelling-place." This necessarily leads to Bhr's conclusion, that the
tent-cloth, which consisted of two halves fastened together with the
loops and clasps, answering to the two compartments of the
dwelling-place ([Exo 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033).md), enclosed
the whole of the interior, not only covering the open framework above,
but the side walls also, and therefore that it hung down inside the
walls, and that it was not spread out upon the wooden framework so as to
form the ceiling, but hung down on the walls on the outside of the
wooden beams, so that the gilded beams were left uncovered in the
inside. For if this splendid tent-cloth had been intended for the
ceiling only, and therefore only 30 cubits had been visible out of the
40 cubits of its breadth, and only 10 out of the 28 of its length-that
is to say, if not much more than a third of the whole had been seen and
used for the inner lining of the dwelling, - that is to say, if not much
more than a third of the whole had been seen and used for the inner
lining of the dwelling, - it would not have been called "the dwelling"
so constantly as it is (cf. [Exo 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#008.md);
[Exo 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#018).md), nor would the goats'-hair
covering which was placed above it have been just as constantly called
the "tent above the dwelling" ([Exo
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md); [Exo
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#014.md); [Exo
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#019).md). This inner tent-cloth was so
spread out, that whilst it was fastened to the upper ends of the beams
in a way that is not explained in the text, it formed the ceiling of the
whole, and the joining came just above the curtain which divided the
dwelling into two compartments. One half therefore, viz., the front
half, formed the ceiling of the holy place with its entire breadth of 20
cubits and 10 cubits of its length, and the remaining 18 cubits of its
length hung down over the two side walls, 9 cubits down each wall, - the
planks that formed the walls being left uncovered, therefore, to the
height of 1 cubit from the ground. In a similar manner the other half
covered the holy of holies, 10 cubits of both length and breadth forming
the ceiling, and the 10 cubits that remained of the entire length
covering the end wall; whilst the folds in the corners that arose from
the 9 cubits that hung down on either side, were no doubt so adjusted
that the walls appeared to be perfectly smooth. (For further remarks,
see [Exo 39:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#033)..md)

[Exodus 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 26:7</span></span>

The outer tent-cloth, "for the tent over the dwelling," was to consist
of eleven lengths of goats' hair, i.e., of cloth made of goats' hair;

(Note: The coverings of the tents of the Bedouin Arabs are still made of
cloth woven from black goats' hair, which the women spin and weave (see
Lynch's Expedition of the United States to the Jordan and Dead Sea).)

each piece being thirty cubits long and four broad.

[Exodus 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 26:9</span></span>

Five of these were to be connected (sewed together) by themselves (לבד),
and the other six in the same manner; and the sixth piece was to be made
double, i.e., folded together, towards the front of the tent, so as to
form a kind of gable, as Josephus has also explained the passage (Ant.
iii. 6, 4).

[Exodus 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 26:10</span></span>

Fifty loops and clasps were to be made to join the two halves together,
as in the case of the inner tapestry, only the clasps were to be of
brass or copper.

[Exodus 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 26:12</span></span>

This tent-cloth was two cubits longer than the inner one, as each piece
was 30 cubits long instead of 28; it was also two cubits broader, as it
was composed of 11 pieces, the eleventh only reckoning as two cubits, as
it was to be laid double. Consequently there was an excess (העדף that
which is over) of two cubits each way; and according to [Exo
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#012.md) and [Exo
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#013.md) this was to be disposed of in
the following manner: "As for the spreading out of the excess in the
tent-cloths, the half of the cloth in excess shall spread out over the
back of the dwelling; and the cubit from here and from there in the
excess in the length of the tent-cloths (i.e., the cubit over in the
length in each of the cloths) shall be spread out on the sides of the
dwelling from here and from there to cover it." Now since, according to
this, one half of the two cubits of the sixth piece which was laid
double was to hang down the back of the tabernacle, there only remained
one cubit for the gable of the front. It follows, therefore, that the
joining of the two halves with loops and clasps would come a cubit
farther back, than the place where the curtain of the holy of holies
divided the dwelling. But in consequence of the cloth being a cubit
longer in every direction, it nearly reached the ground on all three
sides, the thickness of the wooden framework alone preventing it from
reaching it altogether.

[Exodus 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 26:14</span></span>

"The other coverings were placed on the top of this tent: one made of
rams' skins dyed red, "as a covering for the tent," and another upon the
top of this, made of the skins of the sea-cow (תּחשׁים, see at [Exo
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005).md).

[Exodus 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 26:15</span></span>

The wooden framework. - [Exo 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015.md),
[Exo 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#016.md). The boards for the
dwelling were to be made "of acacia-wood standing," i.e., so that they
could stand upright; each ten cubits long and one and a half broad. The
thickness is not given; and if, on the one hand, we are not to imagine
them too thin, as Josephus does, for example, who says they were only
four fingers thick (Ant. iii. 6, 3), we have still less reason for
following Rashi, Lund, Bhr and others, who suppose them to have been a
cubit in thickness, thus making simple boards into colossal blocks, such
as could neither have been cut from acacia-trees, nor carried upon
desert roads.

(Note: Kamphausen (Stud. und Krit. 1859, p. 117) appeals to Bhr's
Symbolik 1, p. 261-2, and Knobel, Exod. p. 261, in support of the
opinion, that at any rate formerly there were genuine acacias of such
size and strength, that beams could have been cut from them a cubit and
a half broad and a cubit thick; but we look in vain to either of these
writings for such authority as will establish this fact. Expressions
like those of Jerome and Hasselquist, viz., grandes arbores and arbos
ingens ramosissima, are far too indefinite. It is true that, according
to Abdullatif, the Sont is "a very large tree," but he gives a quotation
from Dinuri, in which it is merely spoken of as "a tree of the size of a
nut-tree." See the passages cited in Rosenmller's bibl. Althk. iv. 1, p.
278, Not. 7, where we find the following remark of Wesling on Prosper.
Alpin. de plantis Aeg.: Caudicem non raro ampliorem deprehendi, quam ut
brachio meo circumdari possit. Even the statement of Theophrast (hist.
plant. 4, 3), to the effect that rafters are cut from these trees 12
cubits long (δωδεκάπηχυς ἐρέψιμος ὕλη), is no proof that they were beams
a cubit and a half broad and a cubit thick. And even if there had been
trees of this size in the peninsula of Sinai in Moses' time, a beam of
such dimensions, according to Kamphausen's calculation, which is by no
means too high, would have weighed more than twelve cwt. And certainly
the Israelites could never have carried beams of this weight with them
through the desert; for the waggons needed would have been such as could
never be used where there are no beaten roads.)

To obtain boards of the required breadth, to or three planks were no
doubt joined together according to the size of the trees.

[Exodus 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 26:17</span></span>

Every board was to have two ידות (lit., hands or holders) to hold them
upright, pegs therefore; and they were to be "bound to one another"
(משׁלּב, from שׁלב in Chald. to connect, hence שׁלבּים in [Kg1
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#028.md), the corner plates that hold
together the four sides of a chest), not "pegged into one another," but
joined together by a fastening dovetailed into the pegs, by which the
latter were fastened still more firmly to the boards, and therefore had
greater holding power than if each one had been simply sunk into the
edge of the board.

[Exodus 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 26:18</span></span>

Twenty of these boards were to be prepared for the side of the dwelling
that was turned towards the south, and forty sockets (אדנים foundations,
[Job 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#006).md) or bases for the pegs,
i.e., to put the pegs of the boards into, that the boards might stand
upright; and the same number of boards and sockets for the north side.
תּימנה, "southward," is added to נגבּה לפאת in [Exo
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#018.md), to give a clearer definition of
negeb, which primarily means the dry, and then the country to the south;
an evident proof that at that time negeb was not established as a
geographical term for the south, and therefore that it was not written
here by a Palestinian, as Knobel supposes, but by Moses in the desert.

The form of the "sockets" is not explained, and even in [Exo
38:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#027.md), in the summing up of the gifts
presented for the work, it is merely stated that a talent of silver
(about 93 lb.) was applied to every socket.

[Exodus 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 26:22</span></span>

Six boards were to be made for the back of the dwelling westwards
(ימּה), and two boards "for the corners or angels of the dwelling at the
two outermost (hinder) sides." למקצּעת (for cornered), from מקצּע,
equivalent to מקצוע an angle ([Exo
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#024.md); [Eze
46:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#021).md), from קצע to cut off, lit.,
a section, something cut off, hence an angle, or corner-piece. These
corner boards ([Exo 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#024).md) were to be
"doubled (תּאמם) from below, and whole (תּמּים, integri, forming a
whole) at its head (or towards its head, cf. אל [Exo
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#029).md) with regard to the one ring, so
shall it be to both of them (so shall they both be made); to the two
corners shall they be" (i.e., designed for the two hinder corners). The
meaning of these words, which are very obscure in some points, can only
be the following: the two corner beams at the tack were to consist of
two pieces joined together at a right angle, so as to form as double
boards one single whole from the bottom to the top. The expressions
"from below" and "up to its head" are divided between the two predicates
"doubled" (תּאמים) and "whole" (תּמּים), but they belong to both of
them. Each of the corner beams was to be double from the bottom to the
top, and still to form one whole. There is more difficulty in the words
האחת אל־הטּבּעת in [Exo 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#024.md). It is
impossible to attach any intelligible meaning to the rendering "to the
first ring," so that even Knobel, who proposed it, has left it
unexplained. There is hardly any other way of explaining it, than to
take the word אל in the sense of "having regard to a thing," and to
understand the words as meaning, that the corner beams were to form one
whole, from the face that each received only one ring, probably at the
corner, and not two, viz., one on each side. This one ring was placed
half-way up the upright beam in the corner or angle, in such a manner
that the central bolt, which stretched along the entire length of the
walls ([Exo 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#028).md), might fasten into
it from both the side and back.

[Exodus 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 26:25</span></span>

Sixteen sockets were to be made for these eight boards, two for each. -
[Exo 26:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#026.md). To fasten the boards,
that they might not separate from one another, bars of acacia-wood were
to be made and covered with gold, five for each of the three sides of
the dwelling; and though it is not expressly stated, yet the reference
to rings in [Exo 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#029.md) as holders of
the bars (לבּריחים בּתּים) is a sufficient indication that they were
passed through golden rings fastened into the boards.

[Exodus 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 26:28</span></span>

"And the middle bar in the midst of the boards (i.e., at an equal
distance from both top and bottom) shall be fastening (מבריח) from one
end to the other." As it thus expressly stated with reference to the
middle bar, that it was to fasten, i.e., to reach along the walls from
one end to the other, we necessarily conclude, with Rashi and others,
that the other four bars on every side were not to reach the whole
length of the walls, and may therefore suppose that they were only half
as long as the middle one, so that there were only three rows of bars on
each wall, the upper and lower being composed of two bars each.

[Exodus 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 26:30</span></span>

"And set up the dwelling according to its right, as was shown thee upon
the mountain" (cf. [Exo 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#009).md). Even
the setting up and position of the dwelling were not left to human
judgment, but were to be carried out כּמשׁפּטו, i.e., according to the
direction corresponding to its meaning and purpose. From the description
which is given of the separate portions, it is evident that the dwelling
was to be set up in the direction of the four quarters of the heavens,
the back being towards the west, and the entrance to the east; whilst
the whole of the dwelling formed an oblong of thirty cubits long, ten
broad, and ten high. The length we obtain from the twenty boards of a
cubit and a half in breadth; and the breadth, by adding to the nine
cubits covered by the six boards at the back, half a cubit as the inner
thickness of each of the corner beams. The thickness of the corner beams
is not given, but we may conjecture that on the outside which formed
part of the back they were three-quarters of a cubit thick, and that
half a cubit is to be taken as the thickness towards the side. In this
case, on the supposition that the side beams were a quarter of a cubit
thick, the inner space would be exactly ten cubits broad and thirty and
a quarter long; but the surplus quarter would be taken up by the
thickness of the pillars upon which the inner curtain was hung, so that
the room at the back would form a perfect cube, and the one at the front
an oblong of exactly twenty cubits in length, ten in breadth, and ten in
height.

[Exodus 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 26:31</span></span>

To divide the dwelling into two rooms, a curtain was to be made, of the
same material, and woven in the same artistic manner as the inner
covering of the walls ([Exo 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001).md).
This was called פּרכת, lit., division, separation, from פּרך to divide,
or מסך פּרכת ([Exo 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#012.md); [Exo
39:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#034.md); [Exo
40:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#021).md) division of the covering, i.e.,
to hang this "upon four pillars of gilded acacia-wood and their golden
hooks, (standing) upon four silver sockets," under the loops (קרסים)
which held the two halves of the inner covering together ([Exo
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006).md). Thus the curtain divided the
dwelling into two compartments, the one occupying ten cubits and the
other twenty of its entire length.

[Exodus 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 26:33</span></span>

"Thither (where the curtain hands under the loops) within the curtain
shalt thou bring the ark of testimony ([Exo
25:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016).md), and the curtain shall
divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy" (הקּדשׁים קדשׁ
the holy of holies). The inner compartment was made into the most holy
place through the ark of the covenant with the throne of grace upon it.

[Exodus 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 26:35</span></span>

The two other things (already described) were to be placed outside the
curtain, viz., in the holy place; the candlestick opposite to the table,
the former on the south side of the dwelling, the latter towards the
north.

[Exodus 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">exo 26:36</span></span>

For the entrance to the tent they were also to make a curtain (מסך,
lit., a covering, from סכך to cover) of the same material as the inner
curtain, but of work in mixed colours, i.e., not woven with figures upon
it, but simply in stripes or checks. רקם מעשׂה does not mean coloured
needlework, with figures or flowers embroidered with the needle upon the
woven fabric (as I asserted in my Archologie, in common with the
Rabbins, Gesenius, Bhr, and others); for in the only other passage in
which רקם occurs, viz., [Psa 139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015.md),
it does not mean to embroider, but to weave, and in the Arabic it
signifies to make points, stripes, or lines, to work in mixed colours
(see Hartmann die Hebrerinn am Putztisch iii. 138ff.). This curtain was
to hang on five gilded pillars of acacia-wood with golden hooks, and for
these they were to cast sockets of brass. In the account of the
execution of this work in [Exo 36:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#038.md),
it is still further stated, that the architect covered the heads
(capitals) of the pillars and their girders (חשׁקים, see [Exo
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#010).md) with gold. From this it
follows, that the pillars were not entirely gilded, but only the
capitals, and that they were fastened together with gilded girders.
These girders were either placed upon the hooks that were fastened to
the tops of the pillars, or, what I think more probable, formed a kind
of architrave above the pillars, in which case the covering as well as
the inner curtain merely hung upon the hooks of the columns. But if the
pillars were not gilded all over, we must necessarily imagine that
curtain as hung upon that side of the pillars which was turned towards
the holy place, so that none of the white wood was to be seen inside the
holy place; and the gilding of the capitals and architrave merely served
to impress upon the forefront of the tabernacle the glory of a house of
God.

If we endeavour to understand the reason for building the dwelling in
this manner, there can be no doubt that the design of the wooden walls
was simply to give stability to the tabernacle. Acacia-wood was chosen,
because the acacia was the only tree to be found in the desert of Arabia
from which planks and beams could be cut, whilst the lightness an
durability of this wood rendered it peculiarly suitable for a portable
temple. The wooden framework was covered both within and without with
hangings of drapery and other coverings, to give it the character of a
tent, which is the term really applied to it in [Exo
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021.md), and in most instances
afterwards. The sanctuary of Jehovah in the midst of His people was to
be a tent, because, so long as the people were wandering about and dwelt
in tents, the dwelling of their God in the midst of them must be a tent
also. The division of the dwelling into two parts corresponded to the
design of the tabernacle, where Jehovah desired not to dwell alone by
Himself, but to come and meet with His people ([Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022).md). The most holy place was the
true dwelling of Jehovah, where He was enthroned in a cloud, the visible
symbol of His presence, above the cherubim, upon the capporeth of the
ark of the covenant. The holy place, on the other hand, was the place
where His people were to appear before Him, and draw near to Him with
their gifts, the fruits of their earthly vocation, and their prayers,
and to rejoice before His face in the blessings of His covenant grace.
By the establishment of the covenant of Jehovah with the people of
Israel, the separation of man from God, of which the fall of the
progenitors of our race had been the cause, was to be brought to an end;
an institution was to be set up, pointing to the reunion of man and God,
to true and full vital communion with Him; and by this the kingdom of
God was to be founded on earth in a local and temporal form. This
kingdom of God, which was founded in Israel, was to be embodied in the
tabernacle, and shadowed forth in its earthly and visible form as
confined within the limits of time and space. This meaning was indicated
not only in the instructions to set up the dwelling according to the
four quarters of the globe and heavens, with the entrance towards
sunrise and the holy of holies towards the west, but also in the
quadrangular form of the building, the dwelling as a whole assuming the
form of an oblong of thirty cubits in length, and ten in breadth and
height, whilst the most holy place was a cube of ten cubits in every
direction. In the symbolism of antiquity, the square was a symbol of the
universe or cosmos; and thus, too, in the symbolism of the Scriptures it
is a type of the world as the scene of divine revelation, the sphere of
the kingdom of God, for which the world from the very first had been
intended by God, and to which, notwithstanding the fall of man, who was
created lord of the earth, it was to be once more renewed and glorified.
Hence the seal of the kingdom of God was impressed upon the sanctuary of
God in Israel through the quadrangular form that was given to its
separate rooms. And whilst the direction in which it was set up, towards
the four quarters of the heavens, showed that the kingdom of God that
was planted in Israel was intended to embrace the entire world, the
oblong shape given to the whole building set forth the idea of the
present incompleteness of the kingdom, and the cubic form of the most
holy place its ideal and ultimate perfection.

(Note: The significant character of these different quadrangular forms
is placed beyond all doubt, when we compare the tabernacle and Solomon's
temple, which was built according to the same proportions, with the
prophetic description of the temple and holy city in Ezek. 40-48, and
that of the heavenly Jerusalem in Rev 21 and 22. Just as in both the
tabernacle and Solomon's temple the most holy place was in the form of a
perfect cube (of 10 and 20 cubits respectively), so John saw the city of
God, which came down from God out of heaven, in the form of a perfect
cube. "The length, and the breadth, and the height of it were equal,"
viz., 12,000 furlongs on every side ([Rev
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016).md), a symbolical representation of
the idea, that the holy of holies in the temple will be seen in its
perfected form in the heavenly Jerusalem, and God will dwell in it for
ever, along with the just made perfect. This city of God is "the
tabernacle of God with men;" it has no longer a temple, but the Lord God
of Hosts and the Lamb are the temple of it ([Rev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022).md), and those who dwell therein
see the face of God and the Lamb ([Exo
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#004).md). The square comes next to the
cube, and the regular oblong next to this. The tabernacle was in the
form of an oblong: the dwelling was 30 cubits long and 10 broad, and the
court 100 cubits long and 50 bread. Solomon's temple, when regarded as a
whole, was in the same form; it was 60 cubits long and 20 cubits broad,
apart from the porch and side buildings. In Ezekiel's vision not only is
the sanctuary a square of 500 reeds ([Eze
42:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015.md); [Eze
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002).md), but the inner court ([Eze
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#023.md), [Eze
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#027.md), [Eze
40:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#047).md), the paved space in the outer
court ([Eze 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#019).md), and other parts
also, are all in the form of squares. The city opposite to the temple
was a square of 4500 reeds ([Eze
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016).md), and the suburbs a square of
250 reeds on every side ([Eze 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#017).md).
The idea thus symbolically expressed is, that the temple and city, and
in fact the whole of the holy ground, already approximate to the form of
the most holy place. Both the city and temple are still distinct from
one another, although they both stand upon holy ground in the midst of
the land (ch. 47 and 48); and in the temple itself the distinction
between the holy place and the most holy is still maintained, although
the most holy place is no longer separated by a curtain from the holy
place; and in the same manner the distinction is still maintained
between the temple-building and the courts, though the latter have
acquired much greater importance than in Solomon's temple, and are very
minutely described, whereas they are only very briefly referred to in
the case of Solomon's temple. The sanctuary which Ezekiel saw, however,
was only a symbol of the renewed and glorified kingdom of God, not of
the perfected kingdom. This was first shown to the holy seer in Patmos,
in the vision of the heavenly Jerusalem, as it appeared in a perfect
cubical form.)

Yet even in its temporal form, it was perfect of its kind, and therefore
the component parts of the quadrangular building were regulated by the
number ten, the stamp of completeness.

The splendour of the building, as the earthly reflection of the glory of
the kingdom of God, was also in harmony with this explanation of its
meaning. In the dwelling itself everything was either overlaid with gold
or made of pure gold, with the exception of the foundations or sockets
of the boards and inner pillars, for which silver was used. In the gold,
with its glorious, yea, godlike splendour ([Job
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022).md), the glory of the
dwelling-place of God was reflected; whilst the silver, as the symbol of
moral purity, shadowed forth the holiness of the foundation of the house
or kingdom of God. The four colours, and the figures upon the drapery
and curtains of the temple, were equally significant. Whilst the four
colours, like the same number of coverings, showed their general purpose
as connected with the building of the kingdom of God, the brilliant
white of the byssus stands prominently out among the rest of the colours
as the ground of the woven fabrics, and the colour which is invariably
mentioned first. The splendid white byssus represented the holiness of
the building; the hyacinth, a dark blue approaching black rather than
bright blue, but the true colour of the sky in southern countries, its
heavenly origin and character; the purple, a dark rich red, its royal
glory; whilst the crimson, a light brilliant red, the colour of blood
and vigorous life, set forth the strength of imperishable life in the
abode and kingdom of the holy and glorious God-King. Lastly, through the
figures of cherubim woven into these fabrics the dwelling became a
symbolical representation of the kingdom of glory, in which the heavenly
spirits surround the throne of God, the heavenly Jerusalem with its
myriads of angels, the city of the living God, to which the people of
God will come when their heavenly calling is fulfilled ([Heb
12:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md).
