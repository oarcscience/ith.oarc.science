### [Isaiah Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 38:1</span></span>

There is nothing to surprise us in the fact that we are carried back to
the time when Jerusalem was still threatened by the Assyrian, since the
closing vv. of chapter 37 merely contain an anticipatory announcement,
introduced for the purpose of completing the picture of the last
Assyrian troubles, by adding the fulfilment of Isaiah's prediction of
their termination. It is within this period, and indeed in the year of
the Assyrian invasion ([Isa 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001).md),
since Hezekiah reigned twenty-nine years, and fifteen of these are
promised here, that the event described by Isaiah falls - an event not
merely of private interest, but one of importance in connection with the
history of the nation also. "In those days Hizkiyahu became dangerously
ill. And Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, came to him, and said to him,
Thus saith Jehovah, Set thine house in order: for thou wilt die, and not
recover. Then Hizkiyahu turned (K. om.) his face to the wall, and prayed
to Jehovah, and said (K. saying), O Jehovah, remember this, I pray, that
I have walked before thee in truth, and with the whole heart, and have
done what was good in Thine eyes! And Hizkiyahu wept with loud weeping."
"Give command to thy house" (ל, cf., אל, [Sa2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#023).md) is equivalent to, "Make known
thy last will to thy family" (compare the rabbinical tsavvâ'âh, the last
will and testament); for though tsivvâh is generally construed with the
accusative of the person, it is also construed with Lamed (e.g., [Exo
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#022.md); cf., אל, [Exo
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#034).md). חיה in such a connection as
this signifies to revive or recover. The announcement of his death is
unconditional and absolute. As Vitringa observes, "the condition was not
expressed, because God would draw it from him as a voluntary act." The
sick man turned his face towards the wall (פּניו הסב, hence the usual
fut. cons. ויּסּב as in [Kg1 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#004.md),
[Kg1 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008.md), [Kg1
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#014).md), to retire into himself and to
God. The supplicatory אנּה (here, as in [Psa
116:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#004.md), [Psa
116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016), and in all six times, with ה.md)
always has the principal tone upon the last syllable before יהוה = אדני
([Neh 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011).md). The metheg has sometimes
passed into a conjunctive accent (e.g., [Gen
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#017.md); [Exo
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#031).md). אשׁר את does not signify that
which, but this, that, as in [Deu 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007.md);
[Kg2 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md), etc. "In truth," i.e.,
without wavering or hypocrisy. שׁלם בלב, with a complete or whole heart,
as in [Kg1 8:61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#061.md), etc. He wept aloud,
because it was a dreadful thing to him to have to die without an heir to
the throne, in the full strength of his manhood (in the thirty-ninth
year of his age), and with the nation in so unsettled a state.

[Isaiah 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 38:4</span></span>

The prospect is now mercifully changed. "And it came to pass (K. Isaiah
was not yet out of the inner city; keri סהצר, the forecourt, and) the
word of Jehovah came to Isaiah (K. to him) as follows: Go (K. turn
again) and say to Hizkiyahu (K. adds, to the prince of my people), Thus
saith Jehovah, the God of David thine ancestor, I have heard thy prayer,
seen thy tears; behold, I (K. will cure thee, on the third day thou
shalt go up to the house of Jehovah) add (K. and I add) to thy days
fifteen years. And I will deliver thee ad this city out of the hand of
the king of Asshur, and will defend this city (K. for mine own sake and
for David my servant's sake)." In the place of העיר (the city) the keri
and the earlier translators have הצר. The city of David is not called
the "inner city" anywhere else; in fact, Zion, with the temple hill,
formed the upper city, so that apparently it is the inner space of the
city of David that is here referred to, and Isaiah had not yet passed
through the middle gate to return to the lower city, where he dwelt. The
text of Kings is the more authentic throughout; except that עמּי נגיד,
"the prince of my people," is an annalistic adorning which is hardly
original. סהלוך in Isaiah is an inf. abs. used in an imperative sense;
שׁוּב, on the other hand, which we find in the other text, is
imperative. On yōsiph, see at [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014.md).

[Isaiah 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 38:21</span></span>

The text of Isaiah is not only curtailed here in a very forced manner,
but it has got into confusion; for [Isa
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#021.md) and [Isa
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#022.md) are removed entirely from their
proper place, although even the Septuagint has them at the close of
Hezekiah's psalm. They have been omitted from their place at the close
of [Isa 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#006.md) through an oversight, and
then added in the margin, where they now stand (probably with a sign, to
indicate that they were supplied). We therefore insert them here, where
they properly belong. "Then Isaiah said they were to bring (K. take) a
fig-cake; and they plaistered (K. brought and covered) the boil, and he
recovered. And Hizkiyahu said (K. to Isaiah), What sign is there that
(K. Jehovah will heal me, so that I go up) I shall go up into the house
of Jehovah?" As shechı̄n never signifies a plague-spot, but an abscess
(indicated by heightened temperature), more especially that of leprosy
(cf., [Exo 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#009.md); [Lev
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#018).md), there is no satisfactory
ground, as some suppose, for connecting Hezekiah's illness (taken along
with [Isa 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024).md) with the pestilence
which broke out in the Assyrian army. The use of the figs does not help
us to decide whether we are to assume that it was a boil (bubon) or a
carbuncle (charbon). Figs were a well-known emmoliens or maturans, and
were used to accelerate the rising of the swelling and the subsequent
discharge. Isaiah did not show any special medical skill by ordering a
softened cake of pressed figs to be laid upon the boil, nor did he
expect it to act as a specific, and effect a cure: it was merely
intended to promote what had already been declared to be the will of
God. על ויּמרהוּ is probably more original than the simpler but less
definite על ויּשׂימוּ. Hitzig is wrong in rendering ויּהי, "that it (the
boil) may get well;" and Knobel in rendering it, "that he may recover."
It is merely the anticipation of the result so common in the historical
writings of Scripture (see at [Isa 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md)
and [Isa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001).md), after which the
historian goes back a step or two.

[Isaiah 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 38:7</span></span>

The pledge desired. "(K. Then Isaiah said) and (K. om.) let this be the
sign to thee on the part of Jehovah, that (אשׁר, K. כּי) Jehovah will
perform this (K. the) word which He has spoken; Behold, I make the
shadow retrace the steps, which it has gone down upon the sun-dial of
Ahaz through the sun, ten steps backward. And the sun went back ten
steps upon the dial, which it had gone down" (K. "Shall the shadow go
forward \[הלך, read הלך according to [Job
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002.md), or הילך\] ten steps, or shall it
go back ten steps? Then Yechizkiyahu said, It is easy for the shadow to
go down ten steps; no, but the shadow shall go back ten steps. Then
Isaiah the prophet cried to Jehovah, and turned back the shadow by the
steps that it had gone down upon the sun-dial of Ahaz, ten steps
backward"). "Steps of Ahaz" was the name given to a sun-dial erected by
him. As ma‛ălâh may signify either one of a flight of steps or a degree
(syn. madrigâh), we might suppose the reference to be to a dial-plate
with a gnomon; but, in the first place, the expression points to an
actual succession of steps, that is to say, to an obelisk upon a square
or circular elevation ascended by steps, which threw the shadow of its
highest point at noon upon the highest steps, and in the morning and
evening upon the lowest either on the one side or the other, so that the
obelisk itself served as a gnomon. It is in this sense that the Targum
on [Kg2 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#013.md) renders gerem hamma‛ălōth
by derag shâ‛ayyâ', step (flight of steps) of the sun-dial; and the
obelisk of Augustus, on the Field of Mars at Rome, was one of this kind,
which served as a sun-dial. The going forward, going down, or declining
of the shadow, and its going back, were regulated by the meridian line,
and under certain circumstances the same might be said of a vertical
dial, i.e., of a sun-dial with a vertical dial-plate; but it applies
more strictly to a step-dial, i.e., to a sun-dial in which the degrees
that measure definite periods of time are really gradus. The step-dial
of Ahaz may have consisted of twenty steps or more, which measured the
time of day by half-hours, or even quarters. If the sign was given an
hour before sunset, the shadow, by going back ten steps of half-an-hour
each, would return to the point at which it stood at twelve o'clock. But
how was this effected? Certainly not by giving an opposite direction to
the revolution of the earth upon its axis, which would have been
followed by the most terrible convulsions over the entire globe; and in
all probability not even by an apparently retrograde motion of the sun
(in which case the miracle would be optical rather than cosmical); but
as the intention was to give a sign that should serve as a pledge, and
therefore had not need whatever to be supernatural, it may have been
simply through a phenomenon of refraction, since all that was required
was that the shadow which was down at the bottom in the afternoon should
be carried upwards by a sudden and unexpected refraction. Hamma‛ălōth
(the steps) in [Isa 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#008.md) does not
stand in a genitive relation to tsēl (the shadow), as the accents would
make it appear, but is an accusative of measure, equivalent to בּמּעלות
in the sum of the steps ([Kg2 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#011).md).
To this accusative of measure there is appended the relative clause:
quos (gradus) descendit (ירדה; צל being used as a feminine) in scala
Ahasi per solem, i.e., through the onward motion of the sun. When it is
stated that "the sun returned," this does not mean the sun in the
heaven, but the sun upon the sun-dial, upon which the illuminated
surface moved upwards as the shadow retreated; for when the shadow moved
back, the sun moved back as well. The event is intended to be
represented as a miracle; and a miracle it really was. The force of will
proved itself to be a power superior to all natural law; the phenomenon
followed upon the prophet's prayer as an extraordinary result of divine
power, not effected through his astronomical learning, but simply
through that faith which can move mountains, because it can set in
motion the omnipotence of God.

[Isaiah 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 38:9</span></span>

As a documentary proof of this third account, a psalm of Hezekiah is
added in the text of Isaiah, in which he celebrates his miraculous
rescue from the brink of death. The author of the book of Kings has
omitted it; but the genuineness is undoubted. The heading runs thus in
[Isa 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009.md) : "Writing of Hizkiyahu king
of Judah, when he was sick, and recovered from his sickness." The song
which follows might be headed Mikhtam, since it has the characteristics
of this description of psalm (see at [Psa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001).md). We cannot infer from bachălōthō
(when he was sick) that it was composed by Hezekiah during his illness
(see at [Psa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001).md); vayyechi (and he
recovered) stamps it as a song of thanksgiving, composed by him after
his recovery. In common with the two Ezrahitish psalms, Ps 88 and 89, it
has not only a considerable number of echoes of the book of Job, but
also a lofty sweep, which is rather forced than lyrically direct, and
appears to aim at copying the best models.

[Isaiah 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 38:10</span></span>

Strophe 1 consists indisputably of seven lines:

"I said, In quiet of my days shall I depart into the gates of Hades:

I am mulcted of the rest of my years.

I said, I shall not see Jah, Jah, in the land of the living:

I shall behold man no more, with the inhabitants of the regions of the
dead.

My home is broken up, and is carried off from me like a shepherd's tent:

I rolled up my life like a weaver; He would have cut me loose from the
roll:

From day to night Thou makest an end of me."

"In quiet of my days" is equivalent to, in the midst of the quiet course
of a healthy life, and is spoken without reference to the Assyrian
troubles, which still continued. דּמי, from דּמה, to be quiet, lit., to
be even, for the radical form דם has the primary idea of a flat
covering, of something stroked smooth, of that which is level and equal,
so that it could easily branch out into the different ideas of
aequabilitas, equality of measure, aequitas, equanimity, aequitas,
equality, and also of destruction = complanatio, levelling. On the
cohortative, in the sense of that which is to be, see Ewald, 228, a;
אלכה, according to its verbal idea, has the same meaning as in Ps. 39:14
and [Ch2 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md); and the construction
with בּ (= ואבואה אלכה) is constructio praegnans (Luzzatto). The pual
פּקּדתּי does not mean, "I am made to want" (Rashi, Knobel, and others),
which, as the passive of the causative, would rather be הפקשׂדתּי, like
הנסהלתּי, I am made to inherit ([Job
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003).md); but, I am visited with
punishment as to the remnant, mulcted of the remainder, deprived, as a
punishment, of the rest of my years. The clause, "Jah in the land of the
living," i.e., the God of salvation, who reveals Himself in the land of
the living, is followed by the corresponding clause, הדל עם־יושׁבי, "I
dwelling with the inhabitants of the region of the dead;" for whilst הלד
signifies temporal life (from châlad, to glide imperceptibly away, [Job
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017).md), הלד signifies the end of this
life, the negation of all conscious activity of being, the region of the
dead. The body is called a dwelling (dōr, Arab. dâr), as the home of a
man who possesses the capacity to distinguish himself from everything
belonging to him (Psychol. p. 227). It is compared to a nomadic tent.
רעי (a different word from that in [Zac
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017.md), where it is the chirek
compaginis) is not a genitive (= רעה, Ewald, 151, b), but an adjective
in i, like אוילי רעה in [Zac 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#015.md).
With niglâh (in connection with נסּע, as in [Job
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021).md), which does not mean to be laid
bare (Luzz.), nor to be wrapt up (Ewald), but to be obliged to depart,
compare the New Testament ἐκδημεῖν ἐκ τοῦ σώματος ([Co2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008).md). The ἁπ γεγρ קפד might mean to
cut off, or shorten (related to qâphach); it is safer, however, and more
appropriate, to take it in the sense of rolling up, as in the name of
the badger ([Isa 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#023.md); [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011).md), since otherwise what Hezekiah
says of himself and of God would be tautological. I rolled or wound up
my life, as the weaver rolls up the finished piece of cloth: i.e., I was
sure of my death, namely, because God was about to give me up to death;
He was about to cut me off from the thrum (the future is here
significantly interchanged with the perfect). Dallâh is the thrum,
licium, the threads of the warp upon a loom, which becomes shorter and
shorter the further the weft proceeds, until at length the piece is
finished, and the weaver cuts through the short threads, and so sets it
free (בצּע, cf., [Job 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#009.md); [Job
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008).md). The strophe closes with the
deep lamentation which the sufferer poured out at that time: he could
not help feeling that God would put an end to him (shâlam, syn. kâlâh,
tâmam, gâmar) from day to night, i.e., in the shortest time possible
(compare [Job 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 38:13</span></span>

In strophe 2 the retrospective glance is continued. His sufferings
increased to such an extent, that there was nothing left in his power
but a whining moan - a languid look for help.

I waited patiently till the morning; like the lion,

So He broke in pieces all my bones:

From day to night Thou makest it all over with me.

Like a swallow, a crane, so I chirped;

I cooed like the dove;

Mine eyes pined for the height.

O Lord, men assault me! Be bail for me."

The meaning of shivvithi may be seen from [Psa
131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md), in accordance with which an
Arabic translator has rendered the passage, "I smoothed, i.e., quieted
(sâweitu) my soul, notwithstanding the sickness, all night, until the
morning." But the morning brought no improvement; the violence of the
pain, crushing him like a lion, forced from him again and again the
mournful cry, that he must die before the day had passed, and should not
live to see another. The Masora here has a remark, which is of
importance, as bearing upon [Psa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017.md), viz., that כּארי occurs twice,
and לישׁני בתרי with two different meanings. The meaning of עגוּר סוּס
is determined by [Jer 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007.md), from which
it is evident that עגּור is not an attribute of סּוס here, in the sense
of "chirping mournfully," or "making a circle in its flight," but is the
name of a particular bird, namely the crane. For although the Targum and
Syriac both seem to render סוס in that passage (keri סיס, which is the
chethib here, according to the reading of Orientals) by כּוּרכּיא) (a
crane, Arab. Kurki), and עגוּר, by סנוּניתא) (the ordinary name of the
swallow, which Haji Gaon explains by the Arabic chuttaf), yet the
relation is really the reverse: sūs (sı̄s) is the swallow, and ‛âgūr the
crane. Hence Rashi, on b. Kiddusin 44a ("then cried Res Lakis like a
crane"), gives âg, Fr. grue, as the rendering of כרוכי; whereas Parchon
(s.verse ‛âgūr), confounds the crane with the hoarsely croaking stork
(ciconia alba). The verb 'ătsaphtsēph answers very well not only to the
flebile murmur of the swallow (into which the penitential Progne was
changed, according to the Grecian myth), but also to the shrill shriek
of the crane, which is caused by the extraordinary elongation of the
windpipe, and is onomatopoetically expressed in its name ‛âgūr.

(Note: The call of the parent cranes, according to Naumann (Vgel
Deutschlands, ix. 364), is a rattling kruh (gruh), which is uncommonly
violent when close, and has a trumpet-like sound, which makes it audible
at a very great distance. With the younger cranes it has a somewhat
higher tone, which often passes, so to speak, into a falsetto.)

Tsiphtsēph, like τρίζειν, is applied to every kind of shrill,
penetrating, inarticulate sound. The ordinary meaning of dallū, to hang
long and loose, has here passed over into that of pining (syn. kâlâh).
The name of God in [Isa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014.md) is
Adonai, not Jehovah, being one of the 134 ודּין, i.e., words which are
really written Adonai, and not merely to be read so.

(Note: Vid., Br, Psalterium, p. 133.)

It is impossible to take עשׁקה־לּי as an imperative. The pointing,
according to which we are to read ‛ashqa, admits this (compare shâmrâh
in [Psa 86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002.md); [Psa
119:167](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#167.md); and on the other hand,
zochrālli, in [Neh 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019), etc..md);

(Note: Vid., Br, Thorath Emeth, pp. 22, 23.)

but the usage of the language does not yield any appropriate meaning for
such an imperative. It is either the third person, used in a neuter
sense, "it is sorrowful with me;" or, what Luzzatto very properly
considers still more probable, on account of the antithesis of ‛ashqâh
and ‛ârbēni, a substantive (‛ashqah for ‛osheq), "there is pressure upon
me" (compare רזי־לי, [Isa 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016).md),
i.e., it presses me like an unmerciful creditor; and to this there is
appended the petition, Guarantee me, i.e., be bail for me, answer for me
(see at [Job 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 38:15</span></span>

In strophe 3 he now describes how Jehovah promised him help, how this
promise put new life into him, and how it was fulfilled, and turned his
sufferings into salvation.

"What shall I say, that He promised me, and He hath carried it out:

I should walk quietly all my years, on the trouble of my soul?!

'O Lord, by such things men revive, and the life of my spirit is always
therein:

And so wilt Thou restore me, and make me to live!'

Behold, bitterness became salvation to me, bitterness;

And Thou, Thou hast delivered my soul in love out of the pit of
destruction

For Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back."

The question, "What shall I say?" is to be understood as in [Sa2
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#020.md), viz., What shall I say, to thank
Him for having promised me, and carried out His promise? The Vav in ואמר
introduces the statement of his reason (Ges. 155, 1, c). On הדּדּה (=
התדּדּה), from דּדה (= דּאדא), see at [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md). The future here, in [Isa
38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015.md), gives the purpose of God
concerning him. He was to walk (referring to the walk of life, not the
walk to the temple) gently (without any disturbance) all his years upon
the trouble of his soul, i.e., all the years that followed upon it, the
years that were added to his life. This is the true explanation of על,
as in [Isa 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005.md); [Isa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010.md); [Lev
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#025); not "in spite of" (Ewald.md), or
"with," as in [Psa 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#024.md); [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md), where it forms an adverb. A
better rendering than this would be "for," or "on account of," i.e., in
humble salutary remembrance of the way in which God by His free grace
averted the danger of death. What follows in [Isa
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016.md) can only be regarded in
connection with the petition in [Isa
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016.md), as Hezekiah's reply to the
promise of God, which had been communicated to him by the prophet.
Consequently the neuters עליהם and בּהן( dna (cf., [Isa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md); [Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021.md); [Eze
33:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#018).md) refer to the gracious words
and gracious acts of God. These are the true support of life (על as in
[Deu 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003).md) for every man, and in these
does the life of his spirit consist, i.e., his inmost and highest source
of life, and that "on all sides" (לכל, which it would be more correct to
point לכּל, as in [Ch1 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#005.md); cf.,
bakkōl, in every respect, [Sa2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005).md).
With this explanation, the conjecture of Ewald and Knobel, that the
reading should be רוּחו, falls to the ground. From the general truth of
which he had made a personal application, that the word of God is the
source of all life, he drew this conclusion, which he here repeats with
a retrospective glance, "So wilt Thou then make me whole (see the kal in
[Job 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#004).md), and keep me alive" (for
ותחיני; with the hope passing over into a prayer). The praise for the
fulfilment of the promise commences with the word hinnēh (behold). His
severe illness had been sent in anticipation of a happy deliverance (on
the radical signification of mar, which is here doubled, to give it a
superlative force, see Comm. on Job, at [Job
16:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002).md). The Lord meant it for good;
the suffering was indeed a chastisement, but it was a chastisement of
love. Casting all his sins behind Him, as men do with things which they
do not wish to know, or have no desire to be reminded of (compare e.g.,
[Neh 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026).md), He "loved him out," i.e.,
drew him lovingly out, of the pit of destruction (châshaq, love as a
firm inward bond; belı̄, which is generally used as a particle, stands
here in its primary substantive signification, from bâlâh, to consume).

[Isaiah 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 38:18</span></span>

In strophe 4 he rejoices in the preservation of his life as the highest
good, and promises to praise God for it as long as he lives.

"For Hades does not praise Thee; death does not sing praises to Thee:

They that sink into the grave do not hope for Thy truth.

The living, the living, he praises Thee, as I do today;

The father to the children makes known Thy truth.

Jehovah is ready to give me salvation;

Therefore will we play my stringed instruments all the days of my life

In the house of Jehovah."

We have here that comfortless idea of the future state, which is so
common in the Psalms (vid., [Psa 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md);
[Psa 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010.md); [Psa
88:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#012.md), cf., [Psa
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017).md), and also in the book of
Ecclesiastes ([Ecc 9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004.md), [Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010).md). The foundation of this idea,
notwithstanding the mythological dress, is an actual truth (vid.,
Psychol. p. 409), which the personal faith of the hero of Job endeavours
to surmount (Comment. pp. 150-153, and elsewhere), but the decisive
removal of which was only to be effected by the progressive history of
salvation. The v. is introduced with "for" (kı̄), inasmuch as the
gracious act of God is accounted for on the ground that He wished to be
still further glorified by His servant whom He delivered. לא, in [Isa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018.md), is written only once instead of
twice, as in [Isa 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md). They "sink
into the grave," i.e., are not thought of as dying, but as already dead.
"Truth" ('ĕmeth) is the sincerity of God, with which He keeps His
promises. [Isa 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#019.md) reminds us that
Manasseh, who was twelve years old when he succeeded his father, was not
yet born (cf., [Isa 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007).md). The
להושׁיעני יהוה, μέλλει σώζειν με, is the same as in [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026.md). The change in the number in
[Isa 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020.md) may be explained from the
fact that the writer thought of himself as the choral leader of his
family; ay is a suffix, not a substantive termination (Ewald, 164, p.
427). The impression follows us to the end, that we have cultivated
rather than original poetry here. Hezekiah's love to the older sacred
literature is well known. He restored the liturgical psalmody ([Ch2
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030).md). He caused a further collection
of proverbs to be made, as a supplement to the older book of Proverbs
([Pro 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001).md). The "men of Hezekiah"
resembled the Pisistratian Society, of which Onomacritos was the head.

On [Isa 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#021.md), [Isa
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#022.md), see the notes at the close of
[Isa 38:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#004.md), where these two vv.
belong.
