### [Psalms Chapter 67](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

Harvest Thanksgiving Song

Like [Psa 65:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001), this Psalm,
inscribed To the Precentor, with accompaniment of stringed instruments,
a song-Psalm (מזמור שׁיר), also celebrates the blessing upon the
cultivation of the ground. As [Psa
65:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001) contemplated the corn and
fruits as still standing in the fields, so this Psalm contemplates, as
it seems, the harvest as already gathered in, in the light of the
redemptive history. Each plentiful harvest is to Israel a fulfilment of
the promise given in [Lev 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004), and a
pledge that God is with His people, and that its mission to the whole
world (of peoples) shall not remain unaccomplished. This mission-tone
referring to the end of God's work here below is unfortunately lost in
the church's closing strain, "God be gracious and merciful unto us," but
it sounds all the more distinctly and sweetly in Luther's hymn, "Es woll
uns Gott genהdig sein," throughout.

There are seven stanzas: twice three two-line stanzas, having one of
three lines in the middle, which forms the clasp or spangle of the
septiad, a circumstance which is strikingly appropriate to the fact that
this Psalm is called "the Old Testament Paternoster" in some of the old
expositors.

(Note: Vid., Sonntag's Tituli Psalmorum (1687), where it is on this
account laid out as the Rogate Psalm.)

The second half after the three-line stanza beings in [Psa
67:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#006) exactly as the first closed in
[Psa 67:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#004). יברכנוּ is repeated three
times, in order that the whole may bear the impress of the blessing of
the priest, which is threefold.

[Psalms 67:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 67:1</span></span>

The Psalm begins ([Psa 67:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001)) with
words of the priest's benediction in [Num
6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024). By אתּנוּ the church desires
for itself the unveiled presence of the light-diffusing loving
countenance of its God. Here, after the echo of the holiest and most
glorious benediction, the music strikes in. With [Psa
67:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#002) the Beracha passes over into a
Tephilla. לדעת is conceived with the most general subject: that one may
know, that may be known Thy way, etc. The more graciously God attests
Himself to the church, the more widely and successfully does the
knowledge of this God spread itself forth from the church over the whole
earth. They then know His דּרך, i.e., the progressive realization of His
counsel, and His ישׁוּעה, the salvation at which this counsel aims, the
salvation not of Israel merely, but of all mankind.

[Psalms 67:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 67:3</span></span>

Now follows the prospect of the entrance of all peoples into the kingdom
of God, who will then praise Him in common with Israel as their God
also. His judging (שׁפט) in this instance is not meant as a judicial
punishment, but as a righteous and mild government, just as in the
christological parallels [Psa 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012).,
[Isa 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003). מישׁר in an ethical sense
for מישׁרים, as in [Psa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007); [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004); [Mal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006). הנחה as in [Psa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#004) of gracious guidance (otherwise
than in [Job 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#023)).

[Psalms 67:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 67:5</span></span>

The joyous prospect of the conversion of heathen, expressed in the same
words as in [Psa 67:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#005), here receives
as its foundation a joyous event of the present time: the earth has just
yielded its fruit (cf. [Psa 85:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#013)),
the fruit that had been sown and hoped for. This increase of corn and
fruits is a blessing and an earnest of further blessing, by virtue of
which ([Jer 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009); [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003); cf. on the contrary [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017)) it shall come to pass that all
peoples unto the uttermost bounds of the earth shall reverence the God
of Israel. For it is the way of God, that all the good that He manifests
towards Israel shall be for the well-being of mankind.
