### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 5:1</span></span>

"Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and to go to hear is
better than that fools give a sacrifice; for the want of knowledge leads
them to do evil." The "house of God" is like the "house of Jahve," [Sa2
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#020.md); [Isa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001.md), the temple; אל, altogether like
אל־מ־אל, [Psa 73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md). The Chethı̂b רגליך
is admissible, for elsewhere also this plur. ("thy feet") occurs in a
moral connection and with a spiritual reference, e.g., [Psa
119:59](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059.md); but more frequently, however,
the comprehensive sing. occurs. [Psa
119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105.md); [Pro
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015.md); [Pro
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026.md)., and the Kerı̂ thus follows the
right note. The correct understanding of what follows depends on רע ...
כּי־. Interpreters have here adopted all manner of impossible views.
Hitzig's translation: "for they know not how to be sorrowful," has even
found in Stuart at least one imitator; but עשׂות רע would, as the
contrast of 'asoth tov, [Ecc 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md),
mean nothing else than, "to do that which is unpleasant, disagreeable,
bad," like 'asah ra'ah, [Sa2 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#018.md).
Gesen., Ewald (336b), Elster, Heiligst., Burger, Zckl., Dale, and
Bullock translate: "they know not that they do evil;" but for such a
rendering the words ought to have been עשׂותם רע (cf. [Jer
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015).md); the only example for the
translation of לעשׂות after the manner of the acc. c. inf. = se facere
malum - viz. at [Kg1 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md) - is
incongruous, for למות does not here mean se mori, but ut moreretur. Yet
more incorrect is the translation of Jerome, which is followed by
Luther: nesciunt quid faciant mali. It lies near, as at [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md) so also here, to suppose an
injury done to the text. Aben Ezra introduced רק before לעשׂ, but
Koheleth never uses this limiting particle; we would have to write כי
אם־לעשׂות, after [Ezr 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012.md); [Ezr
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#015.md). Anything thus attained, however,
is not worth the violent means thus used; for the ratifying clause is
not ratifying, and also in itself, affirmed of the כסילים, who, however,
are not the same as the resha'im and the hattaim, is inappropriate.
Rather it might be said: they know not to do good (thus the Syr.); or:
they know not whether it be good or bad to do, i.e., they have no moral
feeling, and act not from moral motives (so the Targ.). Not less violent
than this remodelling of the text is the expedient of Herzberg,
Philippson, and Ginsburg, who from לשׁמע derive the subject-conception
of the obedient (השּׂמעים): "For those understand not at all to do
evil;" the subj. ought to have been expressed if it must be something
different from the immediately preceding כסילים. We may thus render enam
yod'im, after [Psa 82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005.md); [Isa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010.md), as complete in itself: they
(the fools) are devoid of knowledge to do evil = so that they do evil;
i.e., want of knowledge brings them to this, that they do evil.
Similarly also Knobel: they concern themselves not, - are unconcerned
(viz., about the right mode of worshipping God), - so that they do evil,
with the correct remark that the consequence of their perverse conduct
is here represented as their intention. But ידע לא, absol., does not
mean to be unconcerned (wanton), but to be without knowledge. Rashbam,
in substance correctly: they are predisposed by their ignorance to do
evil; and thus also Hahn; Mendelssohn translates directly: "they sin
because they are ignorant." If this interpretation is correct, then for
לשׁמע it follows that it does not mean "to obey" (thus e.g., Zckler),
which in general it never means without some words being added to it
(cf. on the contrary, [Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022).md), but
"to hear," - viz. the word of God, which is to be heard in the house of
God, - whereby, it is true, a hearing is meant which leads to obedience.

In the word הורות, priests are not perhaps thought of, although the
comparison of [Ecc 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#005) (המלאך.md) with
[Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md) makes it certainly natural;
priestly instruction limited itself to information regarding the
performance of the law already given in Scripture, [Lev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011.md); [Deu
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md)., and to deciding on questions
arising in the region of legal praxis, [Deu
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#008.md); [Hag
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#011.md). The priesthood did not belong to
the teaching class in the sense of preaching. Preaching was never a part
of the temple cultus, but, for the first time, after the exile became a
part of the synagogue worship. The preachers under the O.T. were the
prophets, - preachers by a supernatural divine call, and by the
immediate impulse of the Spirit; we know from the Book of Jeremiah that
they sometimes went into the temple, or there caused their books of
prophecy to be read; yet the author, by the word לשׁמע of the foregoing
proverb, scarcely thinks of them. But apart from the teaching of the
priests, which referred to the realization of the letter of the law, and
the teaching of the prophets to the realization of the spirit of the
law, the word formed an essential part of the sacred worship of the
temple: the Tefilla, the Beracha, the singing of psalms, and certainly,
at the time of Koheleth, the reading of certain sections of the Bible.
When thou goest to the house of God, says Koheleth, take heed to thy
step, well reflecting whither thou goest and how thou hast there to
appear; and (with this ו he connects with this first nota bene a second)
drawing near to hear exceeds the sacrifice-offering of fools, for they
are ignorant (just because they hear not), which leads to this result,
that they do evil. מן, prae, expresses also, without an adj., precedence
in number, [Isa 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010.md), or activity,
[Isa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md), or worth, [Eze
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md). קרוב is inf. absol. Bttcher
seeks to subordinate it as such to שׁמר: take heed to thy foot ... and
to the coming near to hear more than to ... . But these obj. to שמר
would be incongruous, and מתת וגו clumsy and even distorted in
expression; it ought rather to be מתּתּך כּכסי־לים זבח. As the inf.
absol. can take the place of the obj., [Isa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md); [Isa
42:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#024.md); [Lam
3:45](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#045.md), so also the place of the subj.
(Ewald, 240a), although [Pro 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#027.md) is
a doubtful example of this. That the use of the inf. absol. has a wide
application with the author of this book, we have already seen under
[Ecc 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md). Regarding the sequence of
ideas in זבח ... מתּת (first the subj., then the obj.), vid., Gesen.
133. 3, and cf. above at [Ecc 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md).
זבח (זבחים), along with its general signification comprehending all
animal sacrifices, according to which the altar bears the name מזבּח,
early acquired also a more special signification: it denotes, in
contradistinction to עולה, such sacrifices as are only partly laid on
the altar, and for the most part are devoted to a sacrificial festival,
[Exo 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#012.md) (cf. [Exo
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#027).md), the so-called shelamim, or
also zivhhe shelamim, [Pro 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md). The
expression זבח נתן makes it probable that here, particularly, is
intended the festival ([Kg1 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#041).md)
connected with this kind of sacrifice, and easily degenerating to
worldly merriment (vid., under [Pro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014).md); for the more common word for
תּת would have been הקריב or שׁחוט; in תּת it seems to be indicated that
it means not only to present something to God, but also to give at the
same time something to man. The most recent canonical Chokma-book agrees
with [Pro 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003.md) in this depreciation of
sacrifice. But the Chokma does not in this stand alone. The great word
of Samuel, [Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md)., that
self-denying obedience to God is better than all sacrifices, echoes
through the whole of the Psalms. And the prophets go to the utmost in
depreciating the sacrificial cultus.

The second rule relates to prayer.

[Ecclesiastes 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 5:2</span></span>

"Be not hasty with thy mouth, and let not thy heart hasten to speak a
word before God: for God is in heaven, and thou art upon earth;
therefore let thy words be few. For by much business cometh dreaming,
and by much talk the noise of fools." As we say in German: auf Flgeln
fliegen \[to flee on wings\], auf Einem Auge nicht sehen \[not to see
with one eye\], auf der Flte blasen \[to blow on the flute\], so in Heb.
we say that one slandereth with (auf) his tongue ([Psa
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#003).md), or, as here, that he hasteth
with his mouth, i.e., is forward with his mouth, inasmuch as the word
goes before the thought. It is the same usage as when the post-bibl.
Heb., in contradistinction to התורה שׁבּכתב, the law given in the
Scripture, calls the oral law הת שׁבּעל־פּה, i.e., the law mediated
על־פה, oraliter = oralis traditio (Shabbath 31a; cf. Gittin 60b). The
instrument and means is here regarded as the substratum of the action -
as that which this lays as a foundation. The phrase: "to take on the
lips," [Psa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md), which needs no
explanation, is different. Regarding בּהל, festinare, which is, like
מהר, the intens. of Kal, vid., once it occurs quite like our "sich
beeilen" to hasten, with reflex. accus. suff., [Ch2
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#021.md). Man, when he prays, should not
give the reins to his tongue, and multiply words as one begins and
repeats over a form which he has learnt, knowing certainly that it is
God of whom and to whom he speaks, but without being conscious that God
is an infinitely exalted Being, to whom one may not carelessly approach
without collecting his thoughts, and irreverently, without lifting up
his soul. As the heavens, God's throne, are exalted above the earth, the
dwelling-place of man, so exalted is the heavenly God above earthly man,
standing far beneath him; therefore ought the words of a man before God
to be few, - few, well-chosen reverential words, in which one expresses
his whole soul. The older language forms no plur. from the subst. מעט
(fewness) used as an adv.; but the more recent treats it as an adj., and
forms from it the plur. מעטּים (here and in [Psa
109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008.md), which bears the superscription
le-david, but has the marks of Jeremiah's style); the post-bibl. places
in the room of the apparent adj. the particip. adj. מועט with the plur.
מוּעטים (מוּעטין), e.g., Berachoth 61a: "always let the words of a man
before the Holy One (blessed be His name!) be few" (מוע). Few ought the
words to be; for where they are many, it is not without folly. This is
what is to be understood, [Ecc 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md), by
the comparison; the two parts of the verse stand here in closer mutual
relation than [Ecc 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md), - the proverb
is not merely synthetical, but, like [Job
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007.md), parabolical. The ב is both times
that of the cause. The dream happens, or, as we say, dreams happen ענין
בּרב; not: by much labour; for labour in itself, as the expenditure of
strength making one weary, has as its consequence, [Ecc
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011.md), sweet sleep undisturbed by
dreams; but: by much self-vexation in a man's striving after high and
remote ends beyond what is possible (Targ., in manifold project-making);
the care of such a man transplants itself from the waking to the
sleeping life, it if does not wholly deprive him of sleep, [Ecc
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011.md), [Ecc
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016.md), - all kinds of images of the
labours of the day, and fleeting phantoms and terrifying pictures hover
before his mind. And as dreams of such a nature appear when a man
wearies himself inwardly as well as outwardly by the labours of the day,
so, with the same inward necessity, where many words are spoken folly
makes its appearance. Hitzig renders כסיל, in the connection קול כּ, as
adj.; but, like אויל (which forms an adj. ěvīlī), כסיל is always a
subst., or, more correctly, it is a name occurring always only of a
living being, never of a thing. There is sound without any solid
content, mere blustering bawling without sense and intelligence. The
talking of a fool is in itself of this kind ([Ecc
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#014).md); but if one who is not just a
fool falls into much talk, it is scarcely possible but that in this flow
of words empty bombast should appear.

Another rule regarding the worship of God refers to vowing.

[Ecclesiastes 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 5:4</span></span>

"When thou hast made a vow to God, delay not to fulfil it; for there is
no pleasure in fools: that which thou hast vowed fulfil. Better that
thou vowest not, than that thou vowest and fulfillest not. Let not thy
mouth bring thy body into punishment; and say not before the messenger
of God that it was precipitation: why shall God be angry at thy talk,
and destroy the work of thy hands? For in many dreams and words there
are also many vanities: much rather fear God!" If they abstained, after
Shabbath 30b, from treating the Book of Koheleth as apocryphal, because
it begins with תורה דברי (cf. at [Ecc
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003).md) and closes in the same way, and
hence warrants the conclusion that that which lies between will also be
תורה דברי, this is in a special manner true of the passage before us
regarding the vow which, in thought and expression, is the echo of [Deu
23:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#022.md). Instead of kaashěr tiddor,
we find there the words ki tiddor; instead of lelohim (= lěělohim,
always only of the one true God), there we have lahovah ělohěcha; and
instead of al-teahher, there lo teahher. There the reason is: "for the
Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in
thee;" here: for there is no pleasure in fools, i.e., it is not possible
that any one, not to speak of God, could have a particular inclination
toward fools, who speak in vain, and make promises in which their heart
is not, and which they do not keep. Whatever thou vowest, continues
Koheleth, fulfil it; it is better (Ewald, 336a) that thou vowest not,
than to vow and not to pay; for which the Tra says: "If thou shalt
forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee" ([Deu
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#022).md). נדר, which, according to the
stem-word, denotes first the vow of consecration of setting apart (cogn.
Arab. nadar, to separate, נזר, whence נזיר), the so-called אסר \[vid.
[Num 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003.md)\], is here a vow in its
widest sense; the author, however, may have had, as there, the law (cf.
[Ecc 5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002).md), especially shalme něděr,
in view, i.e., such peace-offerings as the law does not enjoin, but
which the offerer promises (cogn. with the shalme nedavah, i.e., such as
rest on free-will, but not on any obligation arising from a previous
promise) from his own inclination, for the event that God may do this or
that for him. The verb שׁלּם is not, however, related to this name for
sacrifices, as חטּא is to חטּאת, but denotes the fulfilling or discharge
as a performance fully accordant with duty. To the expression חטא ...
היה (twice occurring in the passage of Deut. referred to above) there is
added the warning: let not thy mouth bring thy body into sin. The verb
nathan, with Lamed and the inf. following, signifies to allow, to
permit, [Gen 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#006.md); [Jdg
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034.md); [Job
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#030.md). The inf. is with equal right
translated: not to bring into punishment; for חטא - the syncop. Hiph. of
which, according to an old, and, in the Pentateuch, favourite form, is
לחטיא - signifies to sin, and also (e.g., [Gen
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009.md); cf. the play on the word, [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011).md) to expiate sin; sin-burdened and
guilty, or liable to punishment, mean the same thing. Incorrectly,
Ginsburg, Zck., and others: "Do not suffer thy mouth to cause thy flesh
to sin;" for (1) the formula: "the flesh sins," is not in accordance
with the formation of O.T. ideas; the N.T., it is true, uses the
expression σὰρξ ἁμαρτίας, [Rom 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md),
but not ἁμαρτάνουσα, that which sins is not the flesh, but the will
determined by the flesh, or by fleshly lust; (2) the mouth here is not
merely that which leads to sin, but the person who sins through
thoughtless haste, - who, by his haste, brings sin upon his flesh, for
this suffers, for the breach of vow, by penalties inflicted by God; the
mouth is, like the eye and the hand, a member of the ὃλον τὸ σῶμα ([Mat
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#024)..md), which is here called בשׂר; the
whole man in its sensitive nature (opp. לב, [Ecc
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md); [Ecc
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#010.md); [Pro
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030).md) has to suffer chastisement on
account of that which the mouth hath spoken. Gesen. compares this
passage, correctly, with [Deu 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004.md),
for the meaning peccati reum facere; [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md) is also similar.

The further warning refers to the lessening of the sin of a rash vow
unfulfilled as an unintentional, easily expiable offence: "and say not
before the messenger of God that it was a שׁגגה, a sin of weakness."
Without doubt hammǎlāch is an official byname of a priest, and that such
as was in common use at the time of the author. But as for the rest, it
is not easy to make the matter of the warning clear. That it is not
easy, may be concluded from this, that with Jewish interpreters it lies
remote to think of a priest in the word hammǎlāch. By this word the
Targ. understands the angel to whom the execution of the sentence of
punishment shall be committed on the day of judgment; Aben Ezra: the
angel who writes down all the words of a man; similarly Jerome, after
his Jewish teacher. Under this passage Ginsburg has an entire excursus
regarding the angels. The lxx and Syr. translate "before God," as if the
words of the text were אל נגד, [Psa
138:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md), or as if hammalach could of
itself mean God, as presenting Himself in history. Supposing that
hammalach is the official name of a man, and that of a priest, we appear
to be under the necessity of imagining that he who is charged with the
obligation of a vow turns to the priest with the desire that he would
release him from it, and thus dissolve (bibl. הפיר, Mishnic התּיר) the
vow. But there is no evidence that the priests had the power of
releasing from vows. Individual cases in which a husband can dissolve
the vow of his wife, and a father the vow of his daughter, are
enumerated in Num 30; besides, in the traditional law, we find the
sentence: "A vow, which one who makes it repents of, can be dissolved by
a learned man (חכם), or, where none is present, by three laymen,"
Bechoroth 36b; the matter cannot be settled by any middle person
(שׁליח), but he who has taken the vow (הנודר) must appear personally,
Jore deah c. 228, 16. Of the priest as such nothing is said here.
Therefore the passage cannot at all be traditionally understood of an
official dissolution of an oath. Where the Talm. applies it
juristically, Shabbath 32b, etc., Rashi explains hammalach by gizbar
shěl-haqdesh, i.e., treasurer of the revenues of the sanctuary; and in
the Comm. to Koheleth he supposes that some one has publicly resolved on
an act of charity (צדקה), i.e., has determined it with himself, and that
now the representative of the congregation (שׁליח) comes to demand it.
But that is altogether fanciful. If we proceed on the idea that liphne
hammalach is of the same meaning as liphne hakkohen, [Lev
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#008.md), [Lev
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011.md); [Num
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006.md); [Num
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#002.md), etc., we have then to derive the
figure from such passages relating to the law of sacrifice as [Num
15:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022.md), from which the words ki
shegagah hi ([Num 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#025).md) originate. We
have to suppose that he who has made a vow, and has not kept it, comes
to terms with God with an easier and less costly offering, since in the
confession (ודּוּי) which he makes before the priest he explains that
the vow was a shegagah, a declaration that inconsiderately escaped him.
The author, in giving it to be understood that under these circumstances
the offering of the sacrifice is just the direct contrary of a good
work, calls to the conscience of the inconsiderate נודר: why should God
be angry on account of thy voice with which thou dost excuse thy sins of
omission, and destroy (vid., regarding חבּל under [Isa
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027).md) the work of thy hands (vid.,
under [Psa 90:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#017).md), for He destroys
what thou hast done, and causes to fail what thou purposest? The
question with lammah resembles those in [Ezr
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#022.md); [Ezr
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#023.md), and is of the same kind as at
[Ecc 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md).; it leads us to consider
what a mad self-destruction that would be ([Jer
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#007.md), cf. under [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005).md).

The reason for the foregoing admonition now following places the
inconsiderate vow under the general rubric of inconsiderate words. We
cannot succeed in interpreting [Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006.md) \[7\] (in so far as we do not
supply, after the lxx and Syr. with the Targ.: ne credas; or better,
with Ginsburg, היא = it is) without taking one of the vavs in the sense
of "also." That the Heb. vav, like the Greek καί, the Lat. et, may have
this comparative or intensifying sense rising above that which is purely
copulative, is seen from e.g., [Num
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#014.md), cf. also [Jos
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#011.md). In many cases, it is true, we
are not under the necessity of translating vav by "also;" but since the
"and" here does not merely externally connect, but expresses correlation
of things homogeneous, an "also" or a similar particle involuntarily
substitutes itself for the "and," e.g., [Gen
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020) (Jerome.md): super Ismael quoque;
[Exo 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#008.md) : filios quoque; [Deu
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#032.md) : et nec sic quidem credidistis;
[Deu 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#008.md) : nam et in Horeb; cf. [Jos
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#019.md); [Sa1
25:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#043.md); [Sa2
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#025.md); [Kg1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#022.md); [Kg1
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026.md); [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006.md), "I have also given to thee." But
there are also passages in which it cannot be otherwise translated than
by "also." We do not reckon among these [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md), where we do not translate "also
my neighbours," and [Amo 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#010.md), where
the words are to be translated, "and that in your nostrils." On the
contrary, [Isa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#007.md) is scarcely
otherwise to be translated than "also when the poor maketh good his
right," like [Sa2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#023.md), "also in their
death they are not divided." In [Ch2
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005.md), in like manner, the two vavs are
scarcely correlative, but we have, with Keil, to translate, "also in the
second and third year." And in [Hos
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md), והוּא, at least according to the
punctuation, signifies "also it," as Jerome translates: ex Israele et
ipse est. According to the interpunction of the passage before us, וּד
הר is the pred., and thus, with the Venet., is to be translated: "For in
many dreams and vanities there are also many words." We could at all
events render the vav, as also at [Ecc
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md); [Exo
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#006.md), as vav apod.; but וגו בּרב has
not the character of a virtual antecedent, - the meaning of the
expression remains as for the rest the same; but Hitzig's objection is
of force against it (as also against Ewald's disposition of the words,
like the of Symmachus, Jerome, and Luther: "for where there are many
dreams, there are also vanities, and many words"), that it does not
accord with the connection, which certainly in the first place requires
a reason referable to inconsiderate talk, and that the second half is,
in fact, erroneous, for between dreams and many words there exists no
necessary inward mutual relation. Hitzig, as Knobel before him, seeks to
help this, for he explains: "for in many dreams are also vanities, i.e.,
things from which nothing comes, and (the like) in many words." But not
only is this assumed carrying forward of the ב doubtful, but the
principal thing would be made a secondary matter, and would drag
heavily. The relation in \_[Ecc 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md) is
different where vav is that of comparison, and that which is compared
follows the comparison. Apparently the text (although the lxx had it
before them, as it is before us) has undergone dislocation, and is thus
to be arranged: כי ברב חלמת ודברים הרבה והבלים: for in many dreams and
many words there are also vanities, i.e., illusions by which one
deceives himself and others. Thus also Bullock renders, but without
assigning a reason for it. That dreams are named first, arises from a
reference back to [Ecc 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md), according
to which they are the images of what a man is externally and mentally
busied and engaged with. But the principal stress lies on ודברים הרבה,
to which also the too rash, inconsiderate vows belong. The pred. והבלים,
however, connects itself with "vanity of vanities," which is Koheleth's
final judgment regarding all that is earthly. The כי following connects
itself with the thought lying in 6a, that much talk, like being much
given to dreams, ought to be avoided: it ought not to be; much rather
(imo, Symm. ἀλλά) fear God, Him before whom one should say nothing, but
that which contains in it the whole heart.

[Ecclesiastes 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 5:8</span></span>

"If thou seest the oppression of the poor and the robbery of right and
of justice in the state, marvel not at the matter: for one higher
watches over him who is high; and others are high above both." Like
rash, mishpat vatsěděq are also the gen. of the obj.; "robbery of the
right and of justice" is an expression not found elsewhere, but not on
that account, as Grtz supposes, impossible: mishpat is right, rectitude,
and conformity to law; and \]\], judicial administration, or also social
deportment according to these norms; גּזל, a wicked, shameless depriving
of a just claim, and withholding of the showing of right which is due.
If one gets a sight of such things as these in a medinah, i.e., in a
territorial district under a common government, he ought not to wonder
at the matter.

תּמהּ means to be startled, astonished, and, in the sense of "to
wonder," is the word commonly used in modern Heb. But חפץ has here the
colourless general signification of res, according to which the Syr.
translates it (vid., under [Ecc 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001).md);
every attempt in passages such as this to retain the unweakened primary
meaning of the word runs out into groundless and fruitless subtlety. Cf.
Berachoth 5a, חפץ לח ... אדם, "a man who buys a thing from another." On
the other hand, there is doubt about the meaning of the clause assigning
the reason. It seems to be intended, that over him who is high, who
oppresses those under him, there stands one who is higher, who in turn
oppresses him, and thereby becomes the executor of punishment upon him;
and that these, the high and the higher, have over them a Most High,
viz., God, who will bring them to an account (Knobel, Ew., Elst., Vaih.,
Hengst., Zckl.). None of the old translators and expositors rises, it is
true, to the knowledge that גּבהים may be pl. majestatis,

(Note: That is surprising, since the Talm. interpretation, Menachoth
110a, even brings it about that לב, [Ecc
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010), is to be understood of God..md)

but the first גּבהּ the Targ. renders by אל אדּיר. This was natural to
the Jewish usus loq., for gbwh in the post-bibl. Heb. is a favourite
name for God, e.g., Beza 20b, Jebamoth 87a, Kamma 13a: "from the table
of God" (משלחן גבוה), i.e., the altar (cf. [Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md); [Co1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021).md).

(Note: חלק גבוה is also a common Rabbin. name for the tithes and
offerings (cf. e.g., Nachmani under [Gen
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020).md). Along with חלק הגבוה, the
sacrifices are also called (in Hurwitz' work on the Heb. rites, known by
the abbreviated title ש''לה) לגבוה; vid., 85b of the ed. 1764, and 23b
of the Amsterdam ed. 1707 of the abridgment.)

The interpretation of גב, however, as the pl. majest., has in the Book
of Koheleth itself a support in בּוראיך, [Ecc
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md); and the thought in which [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md) climactically terminates accords
essentially with [Ecc 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017.md). This
explanation, however, of [Ecc 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md) does
not stand the test. For if an unrighteous administration of justice, if
violence is in vogue instead of right, that is an actual proof that over
him who is high no human higher one watches who may put a check upon
him, and to whom he feels that he is responsible. And that above them
both one who is Most High stands, who will punish injustice and avenge
it, is a consolatory argument against vexation, but is no explanatory
reason of the phenomenon, such as we expect after the noli mirari; for
אל־תתמה does not signify "be not offended" ([Joh
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001).md), or, "think it not strange"
([Pe1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012).md), which would be otherwise
expressed (cf. under [Psa 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001).md), but
μή θαυμάσης (lxx). Also the contrast, [Ecc
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md), warrants the conclusion that in
[Ecc 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md) the author seeks to explain
the want of legal order from the constitution of a despotic state as
distinguished from patriarchal government. For this reason שׁמר will not
be meant of over-watching, which has its aim in the execution of legal
justice and official duty, but of egoistic watching, - not, however, as
Hitzig understands it: "they mutually protect each other's advantage;
one crow does not peck out the eyes of another," - but, on the contrary,
in the sense of hostile watching, as at [Sa1
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#011.md); [Sa2
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#016.md), as B. Bardach understands it:
"he watches for the time when he may gain the advantage over him who is
high, who is yet lower than himself, and may strengthen and enrich
himself with his flesh or his goods." Over the one who is high, who
oppresses the poor and is a robber in respect of right and justice,
there stands a higher, who on his part watches how he can plunder him to
his own aggrandisement; and over both there are again other high ones,
who in their own interest oppress these, as these do such as are under
them. This was the state of matters in the Persian Empire in the time of
the author. The satrap stood at the head of state officers. In many
cases he fleeced the province to fatten himself. But over the satrap
stood inspectors, who often enough built up their own fortunes by fatal
denunciations; and over all stood the king, or rather the court, with
its rivalry of intrigues among courtiers and royal women. The cruel
death-punishments to which disagreeable officials were subjected were
fearful. There was a gradation of bad government and arbitrary
domination from high to low and from low to high, and no word is more
fitting for this state of things in Persia than שׁמר; for watching,
artfully lurking as spies for an opportunity to accomplish the downfall
of each other, was prevalent in the Persian Empire, especially when
falling into decay.

[Ecclesiastes 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 5:9</span></span>

The author, on the other hand, now praises the patriarchal form of
government based on agriculture, whose king takes pride, not in bloody
conquests and tyrannical caprice, but in the peaceful promotion of the
welfare of his people: "But the advantage of a country consists always
in a king given to the arable land." What impossibilities have been
found here, even by the most recent expositors! Ewald, Heiligst.,
Elster, Zckl. translate: rex agro factus = terrae praefectus; but, in
the language of this book, not עבד but מלך עשׁה is the expression used
for "to make a king." Gesen., Win., de Wette, Knobel, Vaih. translate:
rex qui colitur a terra (civibus). But could a country, in the sense of
its population in subjection to the king, be more inappropriately
designated than by שׂדה? Besides, עבד certainly gains the meaning of
colere where God is the object; but with a human ruler as the object it
means servire and nothing more, and נעבּד

(Note: Thus pointed rightly in J., with Sheva quiesc. and Dagesh in
Beth; vid., Kimchi in Michlol 63a, and under עבד.)

can mean nothing else than "dienstbar gemacht" made subject to, not
"honoured." Along with this signification, related denom. to עבד, נעבד,
referred from its primary signification to שׂדה, the open fields (from
שׂדה, to go out in length and breadth), may also, after the phrase עבד
האדמה, signify cultivated, wrought, tilled; and while the phrase "made
subject to" must be certainly held as possible (Rashi, Aben Ezra, and
others assume it without hesitation), but is without example, the Niph.
occurs, e.g., at [Eze 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#009.md), in the
latter signification, of the mountains of Israel: "ye shall be tilled."
Under [Ecc 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md), Hitzig, and with him
Stuart and Zckler, makes the misleading remark that the Chethı̂b is
בּכל־היא, and that it is = בּכל־זאת, according to which the explanation
is then given: the protection and security which an earthly ruler
secures is, notwithstanding this, not to be disparaged. But היא is
Chethı̂b, for which the Kerı̂ substitutes הוּא; בּכּל is Chethı̂b without
Kerı̂; and that בּכל is thus a modification of the text, and that, too,
an objectionable one, since בכל־היא, in the sense of "in all this," is
unheard of. The Kerı̂ seeks, without any necessity, to make the pred. and
subj. like one another in gender; without necessity, for היא may also be
neut.: the advantage of a land is this, viz., what follows. And how
בּכּל is to be understood is seen from [Ezr
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#017.md), where it is to be explained:
And they prepared

(Note: That כלה ב may mean "to be ready with anything," Keil erroneously
points to [Gen 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#012.md); and Philippi,
St. Const. p. 49, thinks that vǎkol ǎnāshim can be taken together in the
sense of vakol haanashim.)

the sum of the men, i.e., the list of the men, of such as had married
strange wives; cf. [Ch1 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#005.md).
Accordingly בכל here means, as the author generally uses הכל mostly in
the impersonal sense of omnia: in omnibus, in all things = by all means;
or: in universum, in general. Were the words accentuated מלך לשדה נעבד,
the adject. connection of לשׂ נע would thereby be shown; according to
which the lxx and Theod. translate τοῦ αγροῦ εἰργασμένου; Symm., with
the Syr., τῇ χώρα εἰργασμένη: "a king for the cultivated land," i.e.,
one who regards this as a chief object. Luzz. thus indeed accentuates;
but the best established accentuation is מלך לשדה נעבד. This separation
of נעבד from לש can only be intended to denote that נעבד is to be
referred not to it, but to מלך, according to which the Targ.
paraphrases. The meaning remains the same: a king subject (who has
become a servus) to the cultivated land, rex agro addictus, as Dathe,
Rosenm., and others translate, is a still more distinct expression of
that which "a king for the well-cultivated field" would denote: an
agriculture-king, - one who is addicted, not to wars, lawsuits, and
sovereign stubbornness in his opinions, but who delights in the peaceful
advancement of the prosperity of his country, and especially takes a
lively interest in husbandry and the cultivation of the land. The order
of the words in [Ecc 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md) is like that
at [Ecc 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md); cf. [Isa
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md); [Isa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002.md). The author thus praises, in
contrast to a despotic state, a patriarchal kingdom based on
agriculture.

[Ecclesiastes 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 5:10</span></span>

"He who loveth silver is not satisfied with silver; and he whose love
cleaveth to abundance, hath nothing of it: also this is vain." The
transition in this series of proverbs is not unmediated; for the
injustice which, according to [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md), prevails in the state as it now
is becomes subservient to covetousness, in the very nature of which
there lies insatiableness: semper avarus eget, hunc nulla pecunia
replet. That the author speaks of the "sacra fames argenti" (not auri)
arises from this, that not זהב, but כסף, is the specific word for coin.

(Note: A Jewish fancy supposes that כסף is chosen because it consists of
letters rising in value (20, 60, 80); while, on the contrary, זהב
consists of letters decreasing in value (7, 5, 2).)

Mendelssohn-Friedlnder also explains: "He who loveth silver is not
satisfied with silver," i.e., it does not make him full; that might
perhaps be linguistically possible (cf. e.g., [Pro
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#011).md), although the author would in
that case probably have written the words מן־הכּסף, after [Ecc
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003.md); but "to be not full of money" is,
after [Ecc 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#008.md), and especially [Ecc
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008.md), [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), cf. [Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md) = never to have enough of money,
but always to desire more.

That which follows, [Ecc 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md), is,
according to Hitz., a question: And who hath joy in abundance, which
bringeth nothing in? But such questions, with the answer to be supplied,
are not in Koheleth's style; and what would then be understood by
capital without interest? Others, as Zφckler, supply ישׂבּע: and he that
loveth abundance of possessions (is) not (full) of income; but that
which is gained by these hard ellipses is only a tautology. With right,
the Targ., Syr., Jerome, the Venet., and Luther take lo tevuah as the
answer or conclusion; and who clings to abundance of possessions with
his love? - he has no fruit thereof; or, with a weakening of the
interrog. pronoun into the relative (as at [Ecc
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009.md); cf. under [Psa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013).md): he who ... clings has nothing
of it. Hamon signifies a tumult, a noisy multitude, particularly of
earthly goods, as at [Psa 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016.md); [Ch1
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#016.md); [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md). The connection of אהב with ב,
occurring only here, follows the analogy of חפץ בּ and the like. The
conclusion is synon. with levilti ho'il; e.g., [Isa
44:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#010.md); [Jer
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008.md). All the Codd. read לא; לו in this
sense would be meaningless.

(Note: In Maccoth 10a, לו is read three times in succession; the Midrash
Wajikra, c. 22, reads לא, and thus it is always found without Kerı̂ and
without variation.)

The designation of advantage by tevuah, the farmer enjoys the fruit of
his labour; but he who hangs his heart on the continual tumult, noise,
pomp of more numerous and greater possessions is possible, to him all
real profit - i.e., all pleasant, peaceful enjoyment - is lost. With the
increase of the possessions there is an increase also of unrest, and the
possessor has in reality nothing but the sight of them.

[Ecclesiastes 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 5:11</span></span>

"When property and goods increase, they become many who consume them;
and what advantage hath the owner thereof but the sight of them with his
eyes?" The verb רבה signifies to increase, the רבב, to be many; but also
(which Bttch. denies) inchoatively: to become many, [Gen
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md); rightly, the lxx, ἐπληθύνθησαν.
The author has not a miser in view, who shuts up his money in chests,
and only feeds himself in looking at it with closed doors; but a
covetous man, of the sort spoken of in [Psa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012.md); [Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md). If the hattovah, the possession
of such an one, increases, in like manner the number of people whom he
must maintain increases also, and thus the number of those who eat of it
along with him, and at the same time also his disquiet and care,
increase; and what advantage, what useful result (vid., regarding
Kishron, above, p. 638, and under [Ecc
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021).md) has the owner of these good
things from them but the beholding of them (reith; Kerı̂, reuth; cf. the
reverse case, [Psa 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004).md)? - the
possession does not in itself bring happiness, for it is never great
enough to satisfy him, but is yet great enough to fill him with great
care as to whether he may be able to support the demands of so great a
household: the fortune which it brings to him consists finally only in
this, that he can look on all he has accumulated with proud
self-complacency.

[Ecclesiastes 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 5:12</span></span>

He can also eat that which is good, and can eat much; but he does not on
that account sleep more quietly than the labourer who lives from hand to
mouth: "Sweet is the sleep of the labourer, whether he eats little or
much; but, on the contrary, the abundance of the rich does not permit
him to sleep." The lxx, instead of "labourer," uses the word "slave"
(δούλου), as if the original were העבד. But, as a rule, sound sleep is
the reward of earnest labour; and since there are idle servants as well
as active masters, there is no privilege to servants. The Venet. renders
rightly by "of the husbandman" (ἐργάτου), the האדמה עבד; the "labourer"
in general is called עמל, [Ecc 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008.md) and
[Jdg 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#026.md), post-bibl. פּעל. The
labourer enjoys sweet, i.e., refreshing, sound sleep, whether his fare
be abundant of scanty - the labour rewards him by sweet sleep,
notwithstanding his poverty; while, on the contrary, the sleep of the
rich is hindered and disturbed by his abundance, not: by his satiety,
viz., repletion, as Jerome remarks: incocto cibo in stomachi angustiis
aestuante; for the labourer also, if he eats much, eats his fill; and
why should sufficiency have a different result in the one from what is
has in the other? As שׂבע means satiety, not over-satiety; so, on the
other hand, it means, objectively, sufficient and plentifully existing
fulness to meet the wants of man, [Pro
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010.md), and the word is meant thus
objectively here: the fulness of possession which the rich has at his
disposal does not permit him to sleep, for all kinds of projects, cares,
anxieties regarding it rise within him, which follow him into the night,
and do not suffer his mind to be at rest, which is a condition of sleep.
The expression השּׂ לע is the circumlocutio of the genit. relation, like
לב ... חל, [Rut 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#003.md); נע ... אם (lxx
Αμνὼν τῆσ ̓Αχινόαμ), [Sa2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#002.md).
Heiligstedt remarks that it stands for שׂבע העשׁיר; but the nouns צמא,
רעב ,צמא snuon, שׂבע form no const., for which reason the circumloc. was
necessary; שׂבע is the constr. of שׂבע. Falsely, Ginsburg: "aber der
Ueberfluss den Reichen - er lsst ihn nicht schlafen" but superabundance
the rich - it doth not suffer him to sleep; but this construction is
neither in accordance with the genius of the German nor of the Heb.
language. Only the subject is resumed in איננּוּ (as in [Ecc
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#007).md); the construction of הניח is as
at [Ch1 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#021.md); cf. [Psa
105:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014.md). Of the two Hiphil forms, the
properly Heb. הניח and the Aramaizing הנּיח, the latter is used in the
weakened meaning of ἐᾶν, sinere.

After showing that riches bring to their possessor no real gain, but,
instead of that, dispeace, care, and unrest, the author records as a
great evil the loss, sometimes suddenly, of wealth carefully amassed.

[Ecclesiastes 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 5:13</span></span>

"There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, riches kept by
their possessor to his hurt: the same riches perish by an evil event;
and he hath begotten a son, thus this one hath nothing in his hand."
There is a gradation of evils. חולה רעה (cf. רע חלי ר, [Ecc
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002).md) is not an ordinary, but a morbid
evil, i.e., a deep hurtful evil; as a wound, not a common one, but one
particularly severe and scarcely curable, is called נחלה, e.g., [Nah
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019.md). השׁ ... רא is, as at [Ecc
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md), an ellipt. relat. clause; cf. on
the other hand, [Ecc 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001.md); the author
elsewhere uses the scheme of the relat. clause without relat. pron.
(vid., under [Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013.md); [Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016).md); the old language would use
ראיתיה, instead of ראיתי, with the reflex. pron. The great evil consists
in this, that riches are not seldom kept by their owner to his own hurt.
Certainly שׁמוּר ל can also mean that which is kept for another, [Sa1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024.md); but how involved and constrained
is Ginsburg's explanation: "hoarded up (by the rich man) for their
(future) owner," viz., the heir to whom he intends to leave them! That ל
can be used with the passive as a designation of the subj., vid., Ewald,
295c; certainly it corresponds as little as מן, with the Greek ὑπό, but
in Greek we say also πλοῦτος φυλαχθεὶς τῷ κεκτημένῳ, vid., Rost's
Syntax, 112. 4. The suff. of lera'atho refers to be'alav, the plur. form
of which can so far remain out of view, that we even say adonim qosheh,
[Isa 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md), etc. "To his hurt," i.e.,
at the last suddenly to lose that which has been carefully guarded. The
narrative explanation of this, "to his hurt," begins with vav explic.
Regarding 'inyan ra'. It is a casus adversus that is meant, such a
stroke upon stroke as destroyed Job's possessions. The perf. והו
supposes the case that the man thus suddenly made poor is the father of
a son; the clause is logically related to that which follows as
hypothet. antecedent, after the scheme. [Gen
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#013.md). The loss of riches would of
itself make one who is alone unhappy, for the misfortune to be poor is
less than the misfortunes to be rich and then to become poor; but still
more unfortunate is the father who thought that by well-guarded wealth
he had secured the future of his son, and who now leaves him with an
empty hand.

What now follows is true of this rich man, but is generalized into a
reference to every rich man, and then is recorded as a second great
evil. As a man comes naked into the world, so also he departs from it
again without being able to take with him any of the earthly wealth he
has acquired.

[Ecclesiastes 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 5:15</span></span>

"As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he again depart as
he came, and not the least will he carry away for his labour, which he
could take with him in his hand." In 13a the author has the case of Job
in his mind; this verse before us is a reminiscence from [Job
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md), with the setting aside of the
difficult word שׁמּה found there, which Sirach 40:1 exhibits. With
"naked" begins emphatically the main subject; כּשׁבּא = בא כּאשׁר is the
intensifying resumption of the comparison; the contrast of לכת f, going
away, excedere vit, is בּיא of the entrance on life, coming into the
world. מאוּמה (according to the root meaning and use, corresponding to
the French point, Olsh. 205a) emphatically precedes the negation, as at
[Jdg 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006.md) (cf. the emphasis reached in
a different way, [Psa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018).md). נשׂא
signifies here, as at [Ecc 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md), [Psa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005.md), to take hence, to take forth, to
carry away. The ב of בּע is not partitive (Aben Ezra compares [Lev
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#032).md), according to which Jerome and
Luther translate de labore suo, but is the Beth pretii, as e.g., at [Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md), as the Chald. understands it;
Nolde cites for this Beth pretii passages such as [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md), but incorrectly. Regarding the
subjunctive שׁיּלך, quod auferat. We might also with the lxx and Symm.
punctuate שׁיּלך: which might accompany him in his hand, but which could
by no means denote, as Hitzig thinks: (for his trouble), which goes
through his hand. Such an expression is not used; and Hitzig's
supposition, that here the rich man who has lost his wealth is the
subject, does not approve itself.

[Ecclesiastes 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 5:16</span></span>

A transition is now made to rich men as such, and the registering
formula which should go before [Ecc
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014.md) here follows: "And this also is a
sore evil: altogether exactly as he came, thus shall he depart: and what
gain hath he that laboureth in the wind?" Regarding זה; and regarding
כּל־ע שׁ,

(Note: I n H. written as one word: כּלעמת. Parchon (Lex. under עמת) had
this form before him. In his Lex. Kimchi bears evidence in favour of the
correct writing as two words.)

The writing of these first two as one word \[vid. note below\] accords
with Ibn-Giat's view, accidentally quoted by Kimchi, that the word is
compounded of כ of comparison, and the frequently occurring לעמּת always
retaining its ל, and ought properly to be pointed כּלע (cf. מלּ, [Kg1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020).md). עמּה signifies combination,
society, one thing along with or parallel to another; and thus לעמת
bears no כ, since it is itself a word of comparison, כּל־עמּת
"altogether parallel," "altogether the same." The question: what kind of
advantage (vid., [Ecc 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003).md) is to him
(has he) of this that ... , carries its answer in itself. Labouring for
the wind or in the wind, his labour is רוּח (רעיון) רעוּת, and thus
fruitless. And, moreover, how miserable an existence is this life of
labour leading to nothing!

[Ecclesiastes 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 5:17</span></span>

"Also all his life long he eateth in darkness and grieveth himself much,
and oh for his sorrow and hatred!" We might place [Ecc
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016.md) under the regimen of the שׁ of
שׁיע of [Ecc 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015.md); but the Heb. style
prefers the self-dependent form of sentences to that which is governed.
The expression [Ecc 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016.md) has something
strange. This strangeness disappears if, with Ewald and Heiligst., after
the lxx and Jerome, for יאכל we read ואכל: καὶ ἐν πένθει; Bttch. prefers
ואפל, "and in darkness." Or also, if we read ילך for יאכל; thus the
Midrash here, and several codd. by Kennicott; but the Targ., Syr., and
Masora read יאכל. Hitzig gets rid of that which is strange in this
passage by taking כּל־ימיו as accus. of the obj., not of the time: all
his days, his whole life he consumes in darkness; but in Heb. as in Lat.
we say: consumere dies vitae, [Job
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013.md); [Job
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#011.md), but not comedere; and why
should the expression, "to eat in darkness," not be a figurative
expression for a faithless, gloomy life, as elsewhere "to sit in
darkness" ([Mic 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008).md), and "to walk in
darkness"? It is meant that all his life long he ate אונים לחם, the
bread of sorrow, or לחץ לחם, prison fare; he did not allow himself
pleasant table comforts in a room comfortably or splendidly lighted, for
it is unnecessary to understand חשׁך subjectively and figuratively
(Hitz., Zck.).

In 16b the traditional punctuation is וכעס.

(Note: Thus in correct texts, in H. with the note: כ מלרע, viz., here
and at [Psa 112:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#010.md), only there ע has,
according to tradition, the Kametz. Cf. Mas. fin. 52b, and Baer's Ed. of
Psalter, under [Psa 112:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#010)..md)

The perf. ruled by the preceding fut. is syntactically correct, and the
verb כּעס is common with the author, [Ecc
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#009.md). Hitzig regards the text as
corrupt, and reads כּחליו and כּעס, and explains: and (he consumes or
swallows) much grief in his, etc.; the phrase, "to eat sorrow," may be
allowed (cf. [Pro 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#006.md), cf. [Job
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016).md); but יאכל, as the
representative of two so bold and essentially different metaphors, would
be in point of style in bad taste. If the text is corrupt, it may be
more easily rectified by reading וק לו וחלי הרבה וכּעס: and grief in
abundance, and sorrow has he, and wrath. We merely suggest this. Ewald,
Burger, and Bttch. read only וכעס הרבה וחלי; but לו is not to be
dispensed with, and can easily be reduced to a mere vav. Elster retains
וכעס, and reads, like Hitzig, בחליו: he grieves himself much in his
sorrow and wrath; but in that case the word וקצפו was to be expected;
also in this way the ideas do not psychologically accord with each
other. However the text is taken, we must interpret וחליו וקצף as an
exclamation, like הף, [Isa 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md); תּף,
[Jer 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016.md); Ewald, 328a, as we have
done above. That וח of itself is a subst. clause = וחלי לו is untenable;
the rendering of the noun as forming a clause, spoken of under [Ecc
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021.md), is of a different character.

(Note: Rashi regards וחליו as a form like חיתו. This o everywhere
appears only in a gen. connection.)

He who by his labour and care aims at becoming rich, will not only lay
upon himself unnecessary privations, but also have many sorrows; for
many of his plans fail, and the greater success of others awakens his
envy, and neither he himself nor others satisfy him; he is morbidly
disposed, and as he is diseased in mind, so also in body, and his
constantly increasing dissatisfaction becomes at last קצף, he grumbles
at himself, at God, and all the world. From observing such persons, Paul
says of them ([Ti1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006)..md): "They have
pierced themselves through (transfoderunt) with many sorrows."

In view of these great evils, with which the possession of riches also
is connected: of their deceitful instability, and their merely belonging
to this present life, Koheleth returns to his ceterum censeo.

[Ecclesiastes 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 5:18</span></span>

"Behold then what I have seen as good, what as beautiful (is this): that
one eat and drink and see good in all his labour with which he wearieth
himself, under the sun, throughout the number of the days of his life
which God hath given him; for that is his portion." Toward this seeing,
i.e., knowing from his own experience, his effort went forth, according
to [Ecc 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md); and what he here, [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md), [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md), expresses as his resultat, he
has already acknowledged at [Ecc 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md)
and [Ecc 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md). With "behold" he here
returns to it; for he says, that from the observations just spoken of,
as from others, no other resultat befell him. Instead of ר טובה (here
and at [Ecc 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#006).md), he as often uses the
words טוב ראה, [Ecc 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md); [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md), or בּטוב, [Ecc
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md). In רא, the seeing is meant of
that of mental apperception; in לרא, of immediate perception,
experience. Our translation above does not correspond with the
accentuation of the verse, which belongs to the class of
disproportionably long verses without Athnach; cf. [Gen
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md); [Num
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md); [Isa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001.md); [Jer
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#013.md); [Jer
51:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#037.md); [Eze
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#010.md); [Amo
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md); [Ch1
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#026.md); [Ch1
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001.md); [Ch2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001.md). The sentence אני ... הנה (with
pausal āni with Reba) constitutes the beginning of the verse, in the
form, as it were, of a superscription; and then its second part, the
main proposition, is divided by the disjunctives following each other:
Telisha Gedhola, Geresh, Legarmeh, Reba, Tebir, Tifcha, Silluk (cf. [Jer
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001.md), where Pazer instead of Telisha
Bedhola; but as for the rest, the sequence of the accents is the same).
Among the moderns, Hengst. holds to the accents, for he translates in
strict accordance therewith, as Tremmelius does: "Behold what I have
seen: that it is fine and good (Trem. bonum pulchrum) to eat ... ." The
asher in the phrase, tov asher-yapheh, then connects it together: good
which is at the same time beautiful; Grtz sees here the Greek καλὸν
κάγαθόν. But the only passage to which, since Kimchi, reference is made
for this use of asher, viz., [Hos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md), does not prove it; for we are
not, with Drusius, to translate there by: iniquitas quae sit peccatum,
but by quae poenam mereat. The accentuation here is not correct. The
second asher is without doubt the resumption of the first; and the
translation - as already Dachselt in his Biblia Accentuata indicated:
ecce itaque quod vidi bonum, quod pulchrum (hoc est ut quis edat) -
presents the true relation of the component parts of the sentence. The
suffix of עמלו refers to the general subj. contained in the inf.; cf.
[Ecc 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md). The period of time denoted
by מספּר is as at [Ecc 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md); [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md). Also we read חל ... כּי־, [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md), in the same connection.

[Ecclesiastes 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 5:19</span></span>

This verse, expressing the same, is constructed anakolouthistically,
altogether like [Ecc 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md) : "Also for
every man to whom God hath given riches and treasures, and hath given
him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his
labour; just this is a gift of God." The anakolouthon can be rendered
into English here as little as it can at [Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md); for if we allow the phrase,
"also every man," the "also" remains fixed to the nearest conception,
while in the Heb it governs the whole long sentence, and, at the
nearest, belongs to זה. Cheerful enjoyment is in this life that which is
most advisable; but also it is not made possible in itself by the
possession of earthly treasures, - it is yet a special gift of God added
thereto. Nechasim, besides here, occurs also in [Jos
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#008.md); [Ch2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011.md).; and in the Chald. of the Book
of Ezra; [Ezr 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#008.md); [Ezr
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#026.md). Also hishlit, to empower, to
make possible, is Aram., [Dan 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038.md),
[Dan 2:48](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#048.md), as well as Heb., [Psa
119:133](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#133.md); the prevalence of the verbal
stem שלט is characteristic of the Book of Koheleth. Helqo, "his
portion," is just the cheerful enjoyment as that which man has here
below of life, if he has any of it at all.

[Ecclesiastes 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 5:20</span></span>

Over this enjoyment he forgets the frailty and the darkened side of this
life. It proves itself to be a gift of God, a gift from above: "For he
doth not (then) think much of the days of his life; because God
answereth the joy of his heart." Such an one, permitted by God to enjoy
this happiness of life, is thereby prevented from tormenting himself by
reflections regarding its transitoriness. Incorrectly, Hengst.:
Remembrance and enjoyment of this life do not indeed last long,
according to Ewald, who now, however, rightly explains: He will not, by
constant reflection on the brevity of his life, too much embitter this
enjoyment; because God, indeed, grants to him true heart-joy as the
fairest gift. The meaning of [Ecc 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#019.md)
is also, in general, hit upon. The lxx translates: "because God occupies
him with the joy of his heart;" but for that we ought to have had the
word מענהוּ; Jerome helps it, for he reads בשמהה instead of בשמחת: eo
quod Deus occupet deliciis cor ejus. But also, in this form, this
explanation of מענה is untenable; for ב ענה, the causat. of which would
be מענה, signifies, in the style of Koheleth, not in general to busy
oneself with something, but to weary oneself with something; hence ענה
בשׂ cannot mean: to be occupied with joy, and thereby to be drawn away
from some other thing. And since the explanation: "he makes him sing,"
needs to argument to dispose of it, מענה thus remains only as the Hiph.
of אנה, to meet, to respond to, grant a request. Accordingly, Hitz.,
like Aben Ezra and Kimchi, comparing [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md).: God makes to answer, i.e., so
works that all things which have in or of themselves that which can make
him glad, must respond to his wish. But the omission of the obj. - of
which Hitz. remarks, that because indefinite it is left indefinite - is
insufferably hard, and the explanation thus ambiguous. Most interpreters
translate: for God answers (Gesen. He. Wrt. B., incorrectly: answered)
him with joy of his heart, i.e., grants this to him in the way of
answer. Ewald compares [Psa 65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006.md); but
that affords no voucher for the expression: to answer one with something
= to grant it to him; for ענה is there connected with a double accus.,
and בּצדק is the adv. statement of the way and manner. But above all,
against this interpretation is the fact of the want of the personal obj.
The author behoved to have written מענהוּ or אתו מענה. We take the Hiph.
as in the sense of the Kal, but give it its nearest signification: to
answer, and explain, as in a similar manner Seb. Schmid, Rambam, and
others have already done: God answers to the joy of his heart, i.e., He
assents to it, or (using an expression which is an exact equivalent), He
corresponds to it. This makes the joy a heart-joy, i.e., a joy which a
man feels not merely externally, but in the deepest recess of his heart,
for the joy penetrates his heart and satisfies it ([Sol
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011.md); [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md); [Jer
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016).md). A similar expression,
elsewhere not found, we had at [Ecc
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md) in אהב בּ. Why should not ענה ב
(הענה) be possible with ענהוּ, just as ἀμείβεσθαι πρός τι is with
ἀμείβεσθαί τινα? For the rest, בש לב is not needed as obj.; we can take
it also as an expression of the state or condition: God gives answer in
the heart-joy of such an one. In ענה, to answer, to hear the answer, is
thought of as granting a request; here, as giving assent to. [Job
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009.md) affords a twofold suitable
example, that the Hiph. can have an enlarged Kal signification.

After the author has taken the opportunity of once more expressing his
ultimatum, he continues to register the sad evils that cling to wealth.
