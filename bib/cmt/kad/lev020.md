### [Leviticus Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001)

[Leviticus 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 20:1</span></span>

Punishments for the Vices and crimes Prohibited in Ch. 18 and 19. - The
list commences with idolatry and soothsaying, which were to be followed
by extermination, as a practical apostasy from Jehovah, and a manifest
breach of the covenant.

[Leviticus 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 20:2</span></span>

Whoever, whether an Israelite or a foreigner in Israel, dedicated of his
seed (children) to Moloch (see [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021)), was to be put to death. The
people of the land were to stone him. בּאבן רגם, lapide obruere, is
synonymous with סקל, lit., lapidem jacere: this was the usual punishment
appointed in the law for cases in which death was inflicted, either as
the result of a judicial sentence, or by the national community.

[Leviticus 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 20:3</span></span>

By this punishment the nation only carried out the will of Jehovah; for
He would cut off such a man (see at [Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010) and [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021)) for having defiled the
sanctuary of Jehovah and desecrated the name of Jehovah, not because he
had brought the sacrifice to Moloch into the sanctuary of Jehovah, as
Movers supposes, but in the same sense in which all the sins of Israel
defiled the sanctuary in their midst ([Lev
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#031); [Lev
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016)).

[Leviticus 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 20:4</span></span>

If the people, however (the people of the land), should hide their eyes
from him (on the dagesh in חעלּם and יעלּימוּ see the note on [Lev
4:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013)), from an unscrupulous
indifference or a secret approval of his sin, the Lord would direct His
face against him and his family, and cut him off with all that went a
whoring after him.

[Leviticus 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 20:6</span></span>

He would also do the same to every soul that turned to familiar spirits
and necromantists ([Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031), cf.
[Exo 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#017)), "to go a whoring after
them," i.e., to make himself guilty of idolatry by so doing, such
practices being always closely connected with idolatry.

[Leviticus 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 20:7</span></span>

For the Israelites were to sanctify themselves, i.e., to keep themselves
pure from all idolatrous abominations, to be holy because Jehovah was
holy ([Lev 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044); [Lev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002)), and to keep the statutes of
their God who sanctified them ([Exo
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013)).

[Leviticus 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 20:9</span></span>

Whoever cursed father or mother was to be punished with death ([Lev
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#003)); "His blood would be upon him."
The cursing of parents was a capital crime (see at [Lev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#004), and for the plural דּמיו [Exo
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001) and [Gen
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010)), which was to return upon the
doer of it, according to [Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006). The
same punishment was to be inflicted upon adultery ([Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010), cf. [Lev
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#020)), carnal intercourse with a
father's wife ([Lev 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011), cf. [Lev
18:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007)) or with a daughter-in-law
([Lev 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#012), cf. [Lev
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017)), sodomy ([Lev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#013), cf. [Lev
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#022)), sexual intercourse with a
mother and her daughter, in which case the punishment was to be
heightened by the burning of the criminals when put to death ([Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014), cf. [Lev
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017)), lying with a beast ([Lev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#015), [Lev
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#016), cf. [Lev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#023)), sexual intercourse with a
half-sister ([Lev 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017), cf. [Lev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009) and [Lev
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#011)), and lying with a menstruous
woman ([Lev 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018), cf. [Lev
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019)). The punishment of death, which
was to be inflicted in all these cases upon both the criminals, and also
upon the beast that had been abused ([Lev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#015), [Lev
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#016)), was to be by stoning,
according to [Lev 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002), [Lev
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027), and [Deu
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#021).; and by the burning ([Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014)) we are not to understand death
by fire, or burning alive, but, as we may clearly see from [Jos
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#015) and [Jos
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025), burning the corpse after death.
This was also the case in [Lev 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009)
and [Gen 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024).

[Leviticus 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 20:19</span></span>

No civil punishment, on the other hand, to be inflicted by the
magistrate or by the community generally, was ordered to follow marriage
with an aunt, the sister of father or mother ([Lev
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#019), cf. [Lev
18:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#012)), with an uncle's wife ([Lev
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#020), cf. [Lev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#004)), or with a sister-in-law, a
brother's wife ([Lev 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#021), cf. [Lev
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#016)). In all these cases the threat
is simply held out, "they shall bear their iniquity," and (according to
[Lev 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#020), [Lev
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#021)) "die childless;" that is to
say, God would reserve the punishment to Himself (see at [Lev
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#014)). In the list of punishments no
reference is made to intercourse with a mother ([Lev
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007)) or a granddaughter ([Lev
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#010)), as it was taken for granted
that the punishment of death would be inflicted in such cases as these;
just as marriage with a daughter or a full sister is passed over in the
prohibitions in ch. 18.

[Leviticus 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 20:22</span></span>

The list of punishments concludes, like the prohibitions in [Lev
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024)., with exhortations to observe
the commandments and judgments of the Lord, and to avoid such
abominations (on [Lev 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#022) cf. [Lev
18:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003), [Lev
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#026), [Lev
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028), [Lev
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#030); and on [Lev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#023) cf. [Lev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003) and [Lev
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024)). The reason assigned for the
exhortations is, that Jehovah was about to give them for a possession
the fruitful land, whose inhabitants He had driven out because of their
abominations, and that Jehovah was their God, who had separated Israel
from the nations. For this reason ([Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025)) they were also to sever (make
distinctions) between clean and unclean cattle and birds, and not make
their souls (i.e., their persons) abominable through unclean animals,
with which the earth swarmed, and which God had "separated to make
unclean," i.e., had prohibited them from eating or touching when dead,
because they defiled (see ch. 11). For ([Lev
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#026)) they were to be holy, because
Jehovah their God was holy, who had severed them from the nations, to
belong to Him, i.e., to be the nation of His possession (see [Exo
19:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004)).

[Leviticus 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 20:27</span></span>

But because Israel was called to be the holy nation of Jehovah, every
one, ether man or woman, in whom there was a heathenish spirit of
soothsaying, was to be put to death, viz., stoned (cf. [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031)), to prevent defilement by
idolatrous abominations.
