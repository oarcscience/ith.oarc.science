### [Job Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#001)

[Job 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 4:1</span></span>

In reply to Sommer, who in his excellent biblische Abhandlungen, 1846,
considers the octastich as the extreme limit of the compass of the
strophe, it is sufficient to refer to the Syriac strophe-system. It is,
however, certainly an impossibility that, as Ewald (Jahrb. ix. 37)
remarks with reference to the first speech of Jehovah, Job 38-39, the
strophes can sometimes extend to a length of 12 lines = Masoretic
verses, consequently consist of 24 στίχοι and more. Then Eliphaz the
Temanite began, and said:

[Job 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 4:2</span></span>

2 If one attempts a word with thee, will it grieve thee?

And still to restrain himself from words, who is able?

3 Behold, thou hast instructed many,

And the weak hands thou hast strengthened.

4 The stumbling turned to thy words,

And the sinking knees thou hast strengthened.

5 But now it cometh to thee, thou art grieved;

Now it toucheth thee, thou despondest.

The question with which Eliphaz beings, is certainly one of those in
which the tone of interrogation falls on the second of the
paratactically connected sentences: Wilt thou, if we speak to thee, feel
it unbearable? Similar examples are [Job
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021); [Num
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022); [Jer
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004); and with interrogative Wherefore?
[Isa 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004); [Isa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002) : comp. the similar paratactic
union of sentences, [Job 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010); [Job
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#011). The question arises here,
whether נסּה is an Aramaic form of writing for נשּׂא (as the Masora in
distinction from [Deu 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034) takes it),
and also either future, Wilt thou, if we raise, i.e., utter, etc.; or
passive, as Ewald formerly,

(Note: In the second edition, comp. Jahrb. ix. 37, he explains it
otherwise: "If we attempt a word with thee, will it be grievous to thee
quod aegre feras?" But that, however, must be נסּה; the form נסּה can
only be third pers. Piel: If any one attempts, etc., which, according to
Ewald's construction, gives no suitable rendering.)

If a word is raised, i.e., uttered, דּבר נשׂא, like משׁל נשׂא, [Job
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001); or whether it is third pers.
Piel, with the signification, attempt, tentare, [Ecc
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023). The last is to be preferred,
because more admissible and also more expressive. נסּה followed by the
fut. is a hypothetic praet., Supposing that, etc., wilt thou, etc., as
e.g., [Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010). מלּין is the Aramaic
plur. of מלּה, which is more frequent in the book of Job than the Hebrew
plur. מלּים. The futt., [Job 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#003).,
because following the perf., are like imperfects in the western
languages: the expression is like [Isa
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003). In עתּה כּי, [Job
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#005), כּי has a temporal signification,
Now when, Ges. 155, 1, e, (b).

[Job 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 4:6</span></span>

6 Is not thy piety thy confidence,

Thy Hope? And the uprightness of thy ways?

7 Think now: who ever perished, being innocent?!

And where have the righteous been cut off?!

8 As often as I saw, those who ploughed evil

And sowed sorrow, - they reaped the same.

9 By the breath of Eloah they perished,

By the breath of His anger they vanished away.

10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the shachal,

And the teeth of the young lions, are rooted out.

11 The lion wanders about for want of prey,

And the lioness' whelps are scattered.

In [Job 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#006) all recent expositors take
the last waw as waw apodosis: And thy hope, is not even this the
integrity of thy way? According to our punctuation, there is no occasion
for supposing such an application of the waw apodosis, which is an error
in a clause consisting only of substantives, and is not supported by the
examples, [Job 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#017); [Job
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012); [Sa2
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#041).

(Note: We will not, however, dispute the possibility, for at least in
Arabic one can say, zı̂d f-hkı̂m Zeid, he is wise. Grammarians remark that
Arab. zı̂d in this instance is like a hypothetical sentence: If any one
asks, etc. [Sa2 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#034) is similar.)

תקותך is the permutative of the ambiguous כסלתך, which, from כּסל, to be
fat, signifies both the awkwardness of stupidity and the boldness of
confidence. The addition of הוּא to מי, [Job
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#007), like [Job
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#019); [Job
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003), makes the question more earnest:
quis tandem, like זה מי, quisnam (Ges. 122, 2). In [Job
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008), כּאשׁר is not comparative, but
temporal, and yet so that it unites, as usual, what stands in close
connection with, and follows directly upon, the preceding: When, so as,
as often as I had seen those who planned and worked out evil (comp. [Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008)), I also saw that they reaped it.
That the ungodly, and they alone, perish, is shown in [Job
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#010). under the simile of the lions.
The Hebrew, like the oriental languages in general, is rich in names for
lions; the reason of which is, that the lion-tribe, although now become
rarer in Asia, and of which only a solitary one is found here and there
in the valley of the Nile, was more numerous in the early times, and
spread over a wider area.

(Note: Vid., Schmarda, Geographische Verbreitung der Thiere, i. 210,
where, among other things, we read: The lion in Asia is driven back at
almost all points, and also in Africa has been greatly diminished; for
hundreds of lions and panthers were used in the Roman amphitheatres,
whilst at the present time it would be impossible to procure so large a
number.)

שׁחל, which the old expositors often understood as the panther, is
perhaps the maneless lion, which is still found on the lower Euphrates
and Tigris. נתע = נתץ, [Psa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007),
evellere, elidere, by zeugma, applies to the voice also. All recent
expositors translate [Job 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#011) init.
wrongly: the lion perishes. The participle אבד is a stereotype
expression for wandering about viewless and helpless ([Deu
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005); [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013); [Psa
119:176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#176), and freq.). The part.,
otherwise remarkable here, has its origin in this usage of the language.
The parallelism is like [Psa 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010).

[Job 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 4:12</span></span>

12 And a word reached me stealthily,

And my ear heard a whisper thereof.

13 In the play of thought, in visions of the night,

When deep sleep falleth on men,

14 Fear came upon me, and trembling;

And it caused the multitude of my bones to quake with fear.

15 And a breathing passed over my face;

16 It stood there, and I discerned not its appearance:

An image was before my eyes;

A gentle murmur, and I heard a voice.

The fut. יגגּב, like [Jdg 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001); [Psa
80:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009), is ruled by the following fut.
consec.: ad me furtim delatum est (not deferebatur). Eliphaz does not
say אלי ויגנּב (although he means a single occurrence), because he
desires, with pathos, to put himself prominent. That the word came to
him so secretly, and that he heard only as it were a whisper (שׁמץ,
according to Arnheim, in distinction from שׁמע, denotes a faint,
indistinct impression on the ear), is designed to show the value of such
a solemn communication, and to arouse curiosity. Instead of the prosaic
ממּנוּ, we find here the poetic pausal-form מנהוּ expanded from מנּוּ,
after the form מנּי, [Job 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016); [Psa
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023). מן is partitive: I heard only a
whisper, murmur; the word was too sacred and holy to come loudly and
directly to his ear. It happened, as he lay in the deep sleep of night,
in the midst of the confusion of thought resulting from nightly dreams.
שׂעפּים (from שׂעיף, branched) are thoughts proceeding like branches
from the heart as their root, and intertwining themselves; the מן which
follows refers to the cause: there were all manner of dreams which
occasioned the thoughts, and to which they referred (comp. [Job
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015)); תּרדּמה, in distinction from
שׁנה, sleep, and תּנוּמה, slumber, is the deep sleep related to death
and ecstasy, in which man sinks back from outward life into the remotest
ground of his inner life. In [Job
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#014), קראני, from קרא = קרה, to meet
(Ges. 75, 22), is equivalent to קרני (not קרני, as Hirz., first edition,
wrongly points it; comp. [Gen 44:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#029)).
The subject of הפחיד is the undiscerned ghostlike something. Eliphaz was
stretched upon his bed when רוּח, a breath of wind, passed (חלף( dessap,
similar to [Isa 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001)) over his face.
The wind is the element by means of which the spirit-existence is made
manifest; comp. [Kg1 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#012), where
Jehovah appears in a gentle whispering of the wind, and [Act
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002), where the descent of the Holy
Spirit is made known by a mighty rushing. רוּח, πνεῦμα, Sanscrit âtma,
signifies both the immaterial spirit and the air, which is
proportionately the most immaterial of material things.

(Note: On wind and spirit, vid., Windischmann, Die Philosophie im
Fortgang der Weltgesch. S. 1331ff.)

His hair bristled up, even every hair of his body; סמּר, not causative,
but intensive of Kal. יעמד has also the ghostlike appearance as subject.
Eliphaz could not discern its outline, only a תמוּנה, imago quaedam (the
most ethereal word for form, [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008); [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015), of μορφή or δόξα of God), was
before his eyes, and he heard, as it were proceeding from it, רקל דּממה,
i.e., per hendiadyn: a voice, which spoke to him in a gentle, whispering
tone, as follows:

[Job 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 4:17</span></span>

17 Is a mortal just before Eloah,

Or a man pure before his Maker?

18 Behold, He trusteth not His servants!

And His angels He chargeth with imperfection.

19 How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,

They are crushed as though they were moths.

20 From morning until evening, - so are they broken in pieces:

Unobserved they perish for ever.

21 Is it not so: the cord of their tent in them is torn away,

So they die, and not in wisdom?

The question arises whether מן is comparative: prae Deo, on which
Mercier with penetration remarks: justior sit oportet qui immerito
affligitur quam qui immerito affligit; or causal: a Deo, h.e., ita ut a
Deo justificetur. All modern expositors rightly decide on the latter.
Hahn justly maintains that עם and בּעיני are found in a similar
connection in other places; and [Job
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002) is perhaps not to be explained in
any other way, at least that does not restrict the present passage. By
the servants of God, none but the angels, mentioned in the following
line of the verse, are intended. שׂים with בּ signifies imputare ([Sa1
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#015)); in [Job
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012) (comp. [Job
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#022)) we read תּפלה, absurditatem
(which Hupf. wishes to restore even here), joined with the verb in this
signification. The form תּהלה is certainly not to be taken as stultitia
from the verb הלל; the half vowel, and still less the absence of the
Dagesh, will not allow this. תּרן (Olsh. 213, c), itself uncertain in
its etymology, presents no available analogy. The form points to a
Lamedh-He verb, as תּרמה from רמה, so perhaps from הלה, Niph. נהלא,
remotus, [Mic 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007) : being distant,
being behind the perfect, difference; or even from הלה (Targ. הלא, Pa.
הלּי) = לאה, weakness, want of strength.

(Note: Schnurrer compares the Arabic wahila, which signifies to be
relaxed, forgetful, to err, to neglect. Ewald, considering the ת as
radical, compares the Arabic dll, to err, and tâl, med. wau, to be
dizzy, unconscious; but neither from והל nor from תּהל can the
substantival form be sustained.)

Both significations will do, for it is not meant that the good spirits
positively sin, as if sin were a natural necessary consequence of their
creatureship and finite existence, but that even the holiness of the
good spirits is never equal to the absolute holiness of God, and that
this deficiency is still greater in spirit-corporeal man, who has
earthiness as the basis of his original nature. At the same time, it is
presupposed that the distance between God and created earth is
disproportionately greater than between God and created spirit, since
matter is destined to be exalted to the nature of the spirit, but also
brings the spirit into the danger of being degraded to its own level.

[Job 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019)

אף signifies, like כּי אף, quanto minus, or quanto magis, according as a
negative or positive sentence precedes: since [Job
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018) is positive, we translate it here
quanto magis, as [Sa2 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#011). Men are
called dwellers in clay houses: the house of clay is their φθαρτὸν σῶμα,
as being taken de limo terrae ([Job
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006); comp. Wis. 9:15); it is a
fragile habitation, formed of inferior materials, and destined to
destruction. The explanation which follows - those whose יסוד, i.e.,
foundation of existence, is in dust - shows still more clearly that the
poet has [Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007); [Gen
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019), in his mind. It crushes them
(subject, everything that operates destructively on the life of man)
לפני־עשׁ, i.e., not: sooner than the moth is crushed (Hahn), or more
rapidly than a moth destroys (Oehler, Fries), or even appointed to the
moth for destruction (Schlottm.); but לפני signifies, as [Job
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#024) (cf. [Sa1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#016)), ad instar: as easily as a moth
is crushed. They last only from morning until evening: they are broken
in pieces (הכּת, from כּתת, for הוּכת); they are therefore as ephemerae.
They perish for ever, without any one taking it to heart (suppl. על־לב,
[Isa 42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025); [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001)), or directing the heart towards
it, animum advertit (suppl. לב, [Job
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008)).

In [Job 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021) the soul is compared to
the cord of a tent, which stretches out and holds up the body as a tent,
like [Ecc 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#006), with a silver cord,
which holds the lamp hanging from the covering of the tent. Olshausen is
inclined to read יתדם, their tent-pole, instead of יתרם, and at any rate
thinks the accompanying בּם superfluous and awkward. But (1) the
comparison used here of the soul, and of the life sustained by it,
corresponds to its comparison elsewhere with a thread or weft, of which
death is the cutting through or loosing ([Job
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#009); [Job
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008); [Isa
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012)); (12) בּם is neither
superfluous nor awkward, since it is intended to say, that their
duration of life falls in all at once like a tent when that which in
them (בם) corresponds to the cord of a tent (i.e., the נפשׁ) is drawn
away from it. The relation of the members of the sentence in [Job
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021) is just the same as in [Job
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#002) : Will they not die when it is
torn away, etc. They then die off in lack of wisdom, i.e., without
having acted in accordance with the perishableness of their nature and
their distance from God; therefore, rightly considered: unprepared and
suddenly, comp. [Job 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#012); [Pro
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023). Oehler, correctly: without
having been made wiser by the afflictions of God. The utterance of the
Spirit, the compass of which is unmistakeably manifest by the strophic
division, ends here. Eliphaz now, with reference to it, turns to Job.
