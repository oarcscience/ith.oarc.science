[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

Thanksgiving, an Offering Up of One's Self, and Prayer

[Psa 39:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001) is followed by Psalms 40,
because the language of thanksgiving with which it opens is, as it were,
the echo of the language of payer contained in the former. If Psalms 40
was composed by David, and not rather by Jeremiah-a question which can
only be decided by including Ps 69 (which see) in the same
investigation-it belongs to the number of those Psalms which were
composed between Gibea of Saul and Ziklag. The mention of the roll of
the book in v. 8 harmonizes with the retrospective references to the
Tra, which abound in the Psalms belonging to the time of Saul. And to
this we may add the vow to praise Jahve בּקהל, [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010), cf. [Psa
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026); [Psa
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#018); the expression, "more in number
than the hairs of my head," [Psa
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013), cf. [Psa
69:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005); the wish יצּרוּני, [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012), cf. [Psa
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021); the mocking האח האה, [Psa
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016), cf. [Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021), [Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025); and much besides, on which
vid., my Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, S. 457 transl. vol.
ii. p. 149. The second half has an independent form in [Psa
70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001). It is far better adapted to
form an independent Psalm than the first half, which merely looks back
into the past, and for this very reason contains no prayer.

The long lines, more in keeping with the style of prayer than of song,
which alternate with disproportionately shorter ones, are characteristic
of this Psalm. If with these long lines we associate a few others, which
are likewise more or less distinctly indicated, then the Psalm can be
easily divided into seven six-line strophes.

In the Epistle to the Hebrews, [Heb
10:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005), [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007) of this Psalm are, by following
the lxx, taken as the language of the Christ at His coming into the
world. There can be no doubt in this particular instance that, as we
look to the second part of the Psalm, this rendering is brought about
typically. The words of David, the anointed one, but only now on the way
to the throne, are so moulded by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of
prophecy, that they sound at the same time like the words of the second
David, passing through suffering to glory, whose offering up of Himself
is the close of the animal sacrifices, and whose person and work are the
very kernel and star of the roll of the Law. We are not thereby
compelled to understand the whole Psalm as typically predictive. It
again descends from the typically prophetic height to which it has risen
even from [Psa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010) onwards; and from
[Psa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013) onwards, the typically
prophetic strain which still lingers in [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010) and [Psa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011) has entirely ceased.

[Psalms 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 40:1</span></span>

David, who, though not without some hesitation, we regard as the author,
now finds himself in a situation in which, on the one hand, he has just
been rescued from danger, and, on the other, is still exposed to peril.
Under such circumstances praise rightly occupies the first place, as in
general, according to [Psa 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023),
gratitude is the way to salvation. His hope, although תּוחלת ממשּׁכה
([Pro 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012)), has not deceived him; he
is rescued, and can now again sing a new song of thanksgiving, an
example for others, strengthening their trust. קוּה קוּיתי, I waited
with constancy and perseverance. יהוה is the accusative as in [Psa
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005); [Psa
130:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#005), and not the vocative as in [Psa
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#008). אזנו is to be supplied in
thought to ויּט, although after the analogy of [Psa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006); [Psa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#003), one might have looked for the
Hiph. wayaT instead of the Kal. בור שׁאון does not mean a pit of roaring
(of water), since שׁאון standing alone (see, on the other hand, [Psa
65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008), [Isa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012).) has not this meaning; and,
moreover, "rushing, roaring" (Hengstenberg), tumultuous waters of a pit
or a cistern does not furnish any idea that is true to nature; neither
does it mean a pit of falling in, since שׁאה does not exhibit the
signification deorsum labi; but the meaning is: a pit of devastation, of
destruction, of ruin ([Jer 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031); [Jer
46:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#017)), vid., supra on [Psa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008). Another figure is "mire of the
marsh" (יון found only here and in [Psa
69:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003)), i.e., water, in the miry bottom
of which one can find no firm footing - a combination like מטר־גּשׁם,
[Zac 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001), אדמת־עפר, [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002), explained in the Mishna,
Mikvaoth ix. 2, by טיט הבורות (mire of the cisterns). Taking them out of
this, Jahve placed his feet upon a rock, established his footsteps,
i.e., removed him from the danger which surrounded him, and gave him
firm ground under his feet. The high rock and the firm footsteps are the
opposites of the deep pit and the yielding miry bottom. This deliverance
afforded him new matter for thanksgiving (cf. [Psa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003)), and became in his mouth "praise
to our God;" for the deliverance of the chosen king is an act of the God
of Israel on behalf of His chosen people. The futures in [Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004) (with an alliteration similar to
[Psa 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008)) indicate, by their being
thus cumulative, that they are intended of the present and of that which
still continues in the future.

[Psalms 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 40:5</span></span>

He esteems him happy who puts his trust (מבטחו, with a latent Dagesh,
as, according to Kimchi, also in [Psa
71:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#005); [Job
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024); [Jer
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007)) in Jahve, the God who has
already made Himself glorious in Israel by innumerable wonderful works.
[Jer 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007) is an echo of this אשׁרי.
[Psa 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009) (cf. [Psa
91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009)) shows how Davidic is the
language. The expression is designedly not האישׁ, but הגּבר, which is
better adapted to designate the man as being tempted to put trust in
himself. רהבים from רהב (not from רהב) are the impetuous or violent, who
in their arrogance cast down everything. שׂטי כזב, "turners aside of
falsehood" (שׁוּט = שׂטה, cf. [Psa
101:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#003)), is the expression for
apostates who yield to falsehood instead of to the truth: to take כּזב
as accusative of the aim is forbidden by the status construct.; to take
it as the genitive in the sense of the accusative of the object (like תם
הלכי, [Pro 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007)) is impracticable,
because שׂוט (שׂטה) does not admit of a transitive sense; כזב is,
therefore, genit. qualit. like און in [Psa
59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006). This second strophe contains two
practical applications of that which the writer himself has experienced.
From this point of view, he who trusts in God appears to the poet to be
supremely happy, and a distant view of God's gracious rule over His own
people opens up before him. נפלאות are the thoughts of God realized, and
מחשׁבות those that are being realized, as in [Jer
51:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#029); [Isa
55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008). רבּות is an accusative of the
predicate: in great number, in rich abundance; אלינוּ, "for us," as
e.g., in [Jer 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001) (Ew. 217, c). His
doings towards Israel were from of old a fulness of wondrous deeds and
plans of deliverance, which was ever realizing and revealing itself.
There is not ערך אליך, a possibility of comparison with Thee, οὐκ ἔστι
(Ew. 321, c) ἰσουν τί σοι - ערך as in [Psa
89:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#007); [Isa
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018) - they are too powerful (עצם of
a powerful sum, as in [Psa 69:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005); [Psa
139:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017), cf. [Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006)) for one to enumerate. According
to Rosenmller, Stier, and Hupfeld, אין ערך אליך even affirms the same
thing in other words: it is not possible to lay them forth to Thee
(before Thee); but that man should "lay forth" (Symmachus ἐκθέστηαι)
before God His marvellous works and His thoughts of salvation, is an
unbecoming conception. The cohortative forms, which follow, אגּידה
ואדבּרה ,wollof h, admit of being taken as a protasis to what follows,
after the analogy of [Job 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#018); [Job
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#006); [Job
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#026); [Psa
139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008) : if I wish to declare them and
speak them forth, they are too powerful (numerous) to be enumerated
(Ges. 128, 1, d). The accentuation, however, renders it as a
parenthetical clause: I would (as in [Psa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018); [Psa
55:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#013); [Psa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#010)) declare them and speak them
forth. He would do this, but because God, in the fulness of His wondrous
works and thoughts of salvation, is absolutely without an equal, he is
obliged to leave it undone - they are so powerful (numerous) that the
enumeration of them falls far short of their powerful fulness. The words
alioqui pronunciarem et eloquerer have the character of a parenthesis,
and, as [Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007) shows, this accords
with the style of this Psalm.

[Psalms 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 40:7</span></span>

The connection of the thoughts is clear: great and manifold are the
proofs of Thy loving-kindness, how am I to render thanks to Thee for
them? To this question he first of all gives a negative answer: God
delights not in outward sacrifices. The sacrifices are named in a
twofold way: (a) according to the material of which they consist, viz.,
זבח, the animal sacrifice, and מנחה, the meal or meat offering
(including the נסך, the wine or drink offering, which is the inalienable
accessory of the accompanying mincha); (b) according to their purpose,
in accordance with which they bring about either the turning towards one
of the good pleasure of God, as more especially in the case of the עולה,
or, as more especially in the case of the הטּאת (in this passage חטאה),
the turning away of the divine displeasure. The fact of the זבח and עולה
standing first, has, moreover, its special reason in the fact that זבח
specially designates the shelamı̂m offerings, and to the province of
these latter belongs the thank-offering proper, viz., the tôda-shelamı̂m
offering; and that עולה as the sacrifice of adoration (προσευχή), which
is also always a general thanksgiving (εὐχαριστία), is most natural,
side by side with the shalemim, to him who gives thanks. When it is said
of God, that He does not delight in and desire such non-personal
sacrifices, there is as little intention as in [Jer
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022) (cf. [Amo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021).) of saying that the sacrificial
Tra is not of divine origin, but that the true, essential will of God is
not directed to such sacrifices.

Between these synonymous utterances in [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007) and [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007) stands the clause אזנים כּרית
לּי. In connection with this position it is natural, with Rosenmller,
Gesenius, De Wette, and Stier, to explain it "ears hast Thou pierced for
me" = this hast Thou engraven upon my mind as a revelation, this
disclosure hast Thou imparted to me. But, although כּרה, to dig, is even
admissible in the sense of digging through, piercing (vid., on [Psa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017)), there are two considerations
against this interpretation, viz.: (1) that then one would rather look
for אזן instead of אזנים after the analogy of the phrases גּלה אזן, חעיר
אזן, and פּתח אזן, since the inner sense, in which the external organs
of sense, with their functions, have their basis of unity, is commonly
denoted by the use of the singular; (2) that according to the syntax,
חפצתּ, כּרית, and שׁאלתּ are all placed on the same level. Thus,
therefore, it is with this very אזנים כרית לי that the answer is
intended, in its positive form, to begin; and the primary passage, [Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022), favours this view: "Hath Jahve
delight in whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in one's obeying the
voice of Jahve? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, to attend
better than the fat of rams!" The assertion of David is the echo of this
assertion of Samuel, by which the sentence of death was pronounced upon
the kingship of Saul, and consequently the way of that which is
well-pleasing to God was traced out for the future kingship of David.
God - says David - desires not outward sacrifices, but obedience; ears
hath He digged for me, i.e., formed the sense of hearing, bestowed the
faculty of hearing, and given therewith the instruction to obey.

(Note: There is a similar expression in the Tamul Kural, Graul's
translation, S. 63, No. 418: "An ear, that was not hollowed out by
hearing, has, even if hearing, the manner of not hearing." The
"hollowing out" meaning in this passage an opening of the inward sense
of hearing by instruction.)

The idea is not that God has given him ears in order to hear that
disclosure concerning the true will of God (Hupfeld), but, in general,
to hear the word of God, and to obey that which is heard. God desires
not sacrifices but hearing ears, and consequently the submission of the
person himself in willing obedience. To interpret it "Thou hast
appropriated me to Thyself לעבד עולם," after [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006); [Deu
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017), would not be out of harmony
with the context; but it is at once shut out by the fact that the word
is not אזן, but אזנים. Concerning the generalizing rendering of the lxx,
σῶμα δὲ κατηρτίσω μου, following which Apollinaris renders it αὐτὰρ ἐμοί
Βροτέης τεκτήναο σάρκα γενέθλης, and the Italic (which is also retained
in the Psalterium Romanum), corpus autem perfecisti mihi; vide on [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005), Commentary, S. 460f. transl.
vol. ii. p. 153.

The אז אמרתּי, which follows, now introduces the expression of the
obedience, with which he placed himself at the service of God, when he
became conscious of what God's special will concerning him was. With
reference to the fact that obedience and not sacrifice has become known
to him as the will and requirement of God, he has said: "Lo, I come,"
etc. By the words "Lo, I come," the servant places himself at the call
of his master, [Num 22:38](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#038); [Sa2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#021). It is not likely that the words
בּמגלּת ספר כּתוּב עלי then form a parenthesis, since [Psa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009) is not a continuation of that
"Lo, I come," but a new sentence. We take the Beth, as in [Psa
66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013), as the Beth of the
accompaniment; the roll of the book is the Tra, and more especially
Deuteronomy, written upon skins and rolled up together, which according
to the law touching the king ([Deu
17:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014)) was to be the vade-mecum of
the king of Israel. And עלי cannot, as synonymous with the following
בּמעי, signify as much as "written upon my heart," as De Wette and
Thenius render it-a meaning which, as Maurer has already correctly
replied, עלי obtains elsewhere by means of a conception that is
altogether inadmissible in this instance. On the contrary, this
preposition here, as in [Kg2 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013),
denotes the object of the contents; for כּתב על signifies to write
anything concerning any one, so that he is the subject one has specially
in view (e.g., of the judicial decision recorded in writing, [Job
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026)). Because Jahve before all else
requires obedience to His will, David comes with the document of this
will, the Tra, which prescribes to him, as a man, and more especially as
the king, the right course of conduct. Thus presenting himself to the
God of revelation, he can say in [Psa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009), that willing obedience to God's
Law is his delight, as he then knows that the written Law is written
even in his heart, or, as the still stronger expression used here is, in
his bowels. The principal form of מעי, does not occur in the Old
Testament; it was מעים (from מע, מעה, or even מעי), according to current
Jewish pronunciation מעים (which Kimchi explains dual); and the word
properly means (vid., on [Isa 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#019))
the soft parts of the body, which even elsewhere, like רחמים, which is
synonymous according to its original meaning, appear pre-eminently as
the seat of sympathy, but also of fear and of pain. This is the only
passage in which it occurs as the locality of a mental acquisition, but
also with the associated notion of loving acceptance and cherishing
protection (cf. the Syriac phrase סם בגו מעיא, som begau meajo, to shut
up in the heart = to love). That the Tra is to be written upon the
tables of the heart is even indicated by the Deuteronomion, [Deu
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006), cf. [Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003); [Pro
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#003). This reception of the Tra into
the inward parts among the people hitherto estranged from God is,
according to [Jer 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033), the
characteristic of the new covenant. But even in the Old Testament there
is among the masses of Israel "a people with My law in their heart"
([Isa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007)), and even in the Old
Testament, "he who hath the law of his God in his heart" is called
righteous ([Psa 37:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#031)). As such an one
who has the Tra within him, not merely beside him, David presents
himself on the way to the throne of God.

[Psalms 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 40:10</span></span>

The self-presentation before Jahve, introduced by אז אמרתּי, extends
from הנה to מעי; consequently בּשּׂרתּי yltn joins on to אמרתי, and the
אכלא which stands in the midst of perfects describes the synchronous
past. The whole is a retrospect. בּשּׂר, Arab. bššr (root בש), starting
from its sensible primary signification to scrape off, scratch off, rub
smooth, means: to smooth any one (gltten), Engl. to gladden one, i.e.,
vultum ejus diducere, to make him joyful and glad, more especially to
cheer one by good news (e.g., basharahu or bashsharuhu bi̇maulûdin,
bashsharuhu bi-maulûdin, he has cheered him by the intelligence of the
birth of a son), in Hebrew directly equivalent to εὐαγγελίζειν
(εὐαγγελίζεσθαι). He has proclaimed to all Israel the evangel of Jahve's
justifying and gracious rule, which only changes into retribution
towards those who despise His love; and he can appeal to the Omniscient
One ([Jer 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015)), that neither through
fear of men, nor through shame and indolence, has he restrained his lips
from confessing Him. God's conduct, in accordance with the prescribed
order of redemption, is as a matter of fact called צדק, and as an
attribute of His holy love, צדקה; just as אמוּנה is His faithfulness
which fulfils the promises made and which does not suffer hope to be put
to shame, and תּשׁוּעה is His salvation as it is manifested in facts.
This rich matter for the preaching of the evangel, which may be
comprehended in the two words חסד ועמת, the Alpha and Omega of God's
self-attestation in the course of the redemptive history, he has not
allowed to slumber as a dead, unfruitful knowledge hidden deep down in
his heart. The new song which Jahve put into his mouth, he has also
really sung. Thus far we have the first part of the song, which renders
thanks for past mercies.

[Psalms 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 40:12</span></span>

Now, in accordance with the true art of prayer, petition developes
itself out of thanksgiving. The two כּלא, [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010) and here, stand in a reciprocal
relation to one another: he refrained not his lips; therefore, on His
part, let not Jahve withhold His tender mercies so that they should not
be exercised towards him (ממּנּי). There is just the same correlation of
mercy and truth in [Psa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011) and
here: he wishes continually to stand under the protection of these two
saving powers, which he has gratefully proclaimed before all Israel.
With כּי, [Psa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013), he bases these
desires upon his own urgent need. רעות are the evils, which come even
upon the righteous ([Psa 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020)) as
trials or as chastenings. אפפוּ עלי is a more circumstantial form of
expression instead of אפפוּני, [Psa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005). His misdeeds have taken hold
upon him, i.e., overtaken him in their consequences (השּׂיג, as in [Deu
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015), [Deu
28:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#045); cf. לכד, [Pro
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#022)), inasmuch as they have changed
into decrees of suffering. He cannot see, because he is closely
encompassed on all sides, and a free and open view is thereby altogether
taken from him (the expression is used elsewhere of loss of sight, [Sa1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002); [Sa1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#015); [Kg1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#004)). The interpretation adopted by
Hupfeld and Hitzig: I am not able to survey, viz., their number, puts
into the expression more than it really expresses in the common usage of
the language. His heart, i.e., the power of vital consistence, has
forsaken him he is disconcerted, dejected, as it were driven to despair
([Psa 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011)). This feeling of the
misery of sin is not opposed to the date of the Psalm being assigned to
the time of Saul, vid., on [Psa 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011).

[Psalms 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 40:14</span></span>

In the midst of such sufferings, which, the longer they last, discover
him all the more to himself as a sinner, he prays for speedy help. The
cry for help in [Psa 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014) turns with
רצה towards the will of God; for this is the root of all things. As to
the rest, it resembles [Psa 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020)
(38:23). The persecuted one wishes that the purpose of his deadly foes
may as it were rebound against the protection of God and miserably
miscarry. לספּותהּ, ad abripiendam eam (with Dagesh in the פ according
to Ges. 45, 2, Ew. 245, a, and not as Gesenius, Thesaurus, p. 1235,
states, aspirated),

(Note: After ל the aspirate usually disappears, as here and in [Psa
118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013); but there are exceptions, as
לנתושׁ ולנתוץ, [Jer 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010), and
frequently, לשׁדוד, ib. [Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004).
After ב and כ it usually remains, as in [Psa
87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006), [Job
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013); [Job
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015); [Sa2
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#034); [Kg1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#021); [Ecc
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010); but again there are exceptions,
as בּשׁכּן, [Gen 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022), בּזכּר, [Jer
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002). In [Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002) it is pointed לבכּתהּ according
to the rule, and in my Comment. S. 423 it is to be read "with a
Dagesh.")

is added to מבקשׁי נפשׁי by way of explanation and definiteness.
ישׁמּוּ, from שׁמם, to become torpid, here used of outward and inward
paralysis, which is the result of overpowering and as it were bewitching
surprise or fright, and is called by the Arabs ro‛b or ra‛b (paralysis
through terror) cf. Job, note at [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012). An על following upon ישׁמּוּ
looks at first sight as though it introduced the object and reason of
this fright; it is therefore not: as a reward, in consequence of their
infamy, which would not be על־עקב, but merely the accusative עקב ([Isa
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023), Arabic ‛qîba), it is rather: on
account of the reward ([Psa 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012)) of
their disgrace (cf. as belonging to the same period, [Psa
109:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#029); [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026)), i.e., of the reward which
consists in their being put to shame (Hitzig). לי as in [Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003); [Psa
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#006) : with reference to me. האח האח
(Aquila, ἀὰ ἀὰ, αὐτῇ συγχρησάμενος, as Eusebius says, οὕτως ἐχούσῃ τῇ
Ἑβραΐκῆ φωνῇ) is an exclamation of sarcastic delight, which finds its
satisfaction in another's misfortune ([Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025)).

[Psalms 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 40:17</span></span>

On [Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017) compare [Psa
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027). David wishes, as he does in
that passage, that the pious may most heartily rejoice in God, the goal
of their longing; and that on account of the salvation that has become
manifest, which they love ([Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008)),
they may continually say: Let Jahve become great, i.e., be magnified or
celebrated with praises! In [Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017)
with ואני he comes back to his own present helpless state, but only in
order to contrast with it the confession of confident hope. True he is
עני ואביון (as in [Psa 109:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#022); [Psa
136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001), cf. [Psa
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016)), but He who ruleth over all
will care for him: Dominus solicitus erit pro me (Jerome). חשׁב in the
same sense in which in [Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006) the
מחשׁבות, i.e., God's thoughts of salvation, is conceived of (cf. the
corresponding North-Palestinian expression in [Jon
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006)). A sigh for speedy help
(אל־תּאחר, as in [Dan 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019) with a
transition of the merely tone-long Tsere into a pausal Pathach, and here
in connection with a preceding closed syllable, Olshausen, 91, d, under
the accompanying influence of two final letters which incline towards
the a sound) closes this second part of the Psalm. The first part is
nothing but thanksgiving, the second is exclusively prayer.
