<p>Exhortation to Repentance in View of the Judgment - Zephaniah 2:1-3:8
<p>Zephaniah, having in the previous chapter predicted the judgment upon the whole world, and Judah especially, as being close at hand, now summons his people to repent, and more especially exhorts the righteous to seek the Lord and strive after righteousness and humility, that they may be hidden in the day of the Lord (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001">Zep 2:1-3</A>). The reason which he gives for this admonition to repentance is twofold: viz., (1) that the Philistians, Moabites, and Ammonites will be cut off, and Israel will take possession of their inheritances (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004">Zep 2:4-10</A>), that all the gods of the earth will be overthrown, and all the islands brought to worship the Lord, since He will smite the Cushites, and destroy proud Asshur and Nineveh (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011">Zep 2:11-15</A>); and (2) that even blood-stained Jerusalem, with its corrupt princes, judges, and prophets, will endure severe punishment. Accordingly, the call to repentance is not simply strengthened by the renewed threat of judgment upon the heathen and the ungodly in Judah, but is rather accounted for by the introduction of the thought, that by means of the judgment the heathen nations are to be brought to acknowledge the name of the Lord, and the rescued remnant of Israel to be prepared for the reception of the promised salvation.

<p>Call to conversion. - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001">Zep 2:1</A>. "Gather yourselves together, and gather together, O nation that dost not grow pale. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#002">Zep 2:2</A>. Before the decree bring forth (the day passes away like chaff), before the burning wrath of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah's wrath come upon you. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003">Zep 2:3</A>. Seek Jehovah, all ye humble of the land, who have wrought His right; seek righteousness, seek humility, perhaps ye will be hidden in the day of Jehovah's wrath." The summons in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001">Zep 2:1</A> is addressed to the whole of Judah or Israel. The verb qo&#772;she&#772;sh, possibly a denom. from qash, signifies to gather stubble (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#007">Exo 5:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#012">Exo 5:12</A>), then generally to gather together or collect, e.g., branches of wood (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032">Num 15:32-33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#010">Kg1 17:10</A>); in the hithpoel, to gather one's self together, applied to that spiritual gathering which leads to self-examination, and is the first condition of conversion. The attempts of Ewald and Hitzig to prove, by means of doubtful etymological combinations from the Arabic, that the word possesses the meanings, to grow pale, or to purify one's self, cannot be sustained. The kal is combined with the hiphil for the purpose of strengthening it, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005">Hab 1:5</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009">Isa 29:9</A>. Nikhsa&#770;ph is the perf. nipahl in pause, and not a participle, partly because of the &#1500;&#1488; which stands before it (see however Ewald, 286, g), and partly on account of the omission of the article; and nikhsa&#770;ph is to be taken as a relative, "which does not turn pale." Ka&#770;saph has the meaning "to long," both in the niphal (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030">Gen 31:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003">Psa 84:3</A>) and kal (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012">Psa 17:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#015">Job 14:15</A>). This meaning is retained by many here. Thus Jerome renders it, "gens non amabilis, i.e., non desiderata a Deo;" but this is decidedly unsuitable. Others render it "not possessing strong desire," and appeal to the paraphrase of the Chaldee, "a people not wishing to be converted to the law." This is apparently the view upon which the Alex. version rests: &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. But although nikhsa&#770;ph is used to denote the longing of the soul for fellowship with God in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003">Psa 84:3</A>, this idea is not to be found in the word itself, but simply in the object connected with it. We therefore prefer to follow Grotius, Gesenius, Ewald, and others, and take the word in its primary sense of turning pale at anything, becoming white with shame (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022">Isa 29:22</A>), which is favoured by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#015">Zep 3:15</A>. The reason for the appeal is given in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#002">Zep 2:2</A>, viz., the near approach of the judgment. The resolution brings forth, when that which is resolved upon is realized (for ya&#770;lad in this figurative sense, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001">Pro 27:1</A>). The figure is explained in the second hemistich. The next clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1509; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; does not depend upon &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;&#1501;, for in that case the verb would stand at the head with Vav cop., but it is a parenthesis inserted to strengthen the admonition: the day comes like chaff, i.e., approaches with the greatest rapidity, like chaff driven by the wind: not "the time passes by like chaff" (Hitzig); for it cannot be shown that yo&#772;m was ever used for time in this sense. Yo&#772;m is the day of judgment mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007">Zep 1:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#014">Zep 1:14-15</A>; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; here is not to pass by, but to approach, to come near, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019">Nah 3:19</A>. For the figure of the chaff, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005">Isa 29:5</A>. In the second &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;&#1501; is strengthened by &#1500;&#1488;; and &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1488;&#1507;, the burning of wrath in the last clause, is explained by &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1507; &#1497;&#1497;, the day of the revelation of the wrath of God.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003">Zep 2:3</A>
<p>But because the judgment will so speedily burst upon them, all the pious especially - &#8219;anve&#772; ha&#770;'a&#770;rets, the quiet in the land, &#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007">Amo 2:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004">Isa 11:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011">Psa 37:11</A>) - are to seek the Lord. The humble (&#8219;a&#774;na&#770;v&#305;&#772;m) are described as those who do Jehovah's right, i.e., who seek diligently to fulfil what Jehovah has prescribed in the law as right. Accordingly, seeking Jehovah is explained as seeking righteousness and humility. The thought is this: they are to strive still more zealously after Jehovah's right, viz., righteousness and humility (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#020">Deu 16:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001">Isa 51:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007">Isa 51:7</A>); then will they probably be hidden in the day of wrath, i.e., be pardoned and saved (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#015">Amo 5:15</A>). This admonition is now still further enforced from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004">Zep 2:4</A> onwards by the announcement of the coming of judgment upon all the heathen, that the kingdom of God may attain completion.

<p>Destruction of the Philistines. - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004">Zep 2:4</A>. "For Gaza will be forgotten, and Ashkelon become a desert; Ashdod, they drive it out in broad day, and Ekron will be ploughed out. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005">Zep 2:5</A>. Woe upon the inhabitants of the tract by the sea, the nation of the Cretans! The word of Jehovah upon you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines! I destroy thee, so that not an inhabitant remains. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006">Zep 2:6</A>. And the tract by the sea becomes pastures for shepherds' caves, and for folds of sheep. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007">Zep 2:7</A>. And a tract will be for the remnant of the house of Judah; upon them will they feed: in the houses of Ashkelon they encamp in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and turn their captivity." The fourth verse, which is closely connected by k&#305;&#772; (for) with the exhortation to repentance, serves as an introduction to the threat of judgment commencing with ho&#772;i in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005">Zep 2:5</A>. As the mentioning of the names of the four Philistian capitals (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003">Jos 13:3</A>) is simply an individualizing periphrasis for the Philistian territory and people, so the land and people of Philistia are mentioned primarily for the purpose of individualizing, as being the representatives of the heathen world by which Judah was surrounded; and it is not till afterwards, in the further development of the threat, that the enumeration of certain near and remote heathen nations is appended, to express more clearly the idea of the heathen world as a whole. Of the names of the Philistian cities Zephaniah makes use of two, &#8219;Azza&#770;h and &#8219;Eqro&#772;n, as a play upon words, to express by means of paronomasia the fate awaiting them. &#8219;azza&#770;h, Gaza, will be &#8219;azu&#770;bha&#770;h, forsaken, desolate. &#8219;Eqro&#772;n, Ekron, will be te&#772;&#8219;a&#770;qe&#772;r, rooted up, torn out of its soil, destroyed. To the other two he announces their fate in literal terms, the shema&#770;ma&#770;h threatened against Ashkelon corresponding to the &#8219;a&#774;zu&#772;bha&#770;h, and the ga&#770;re&#772;sh predicated of Ashdod preparing the way for Ekron's te&#772;&#8219;a&#770;qe&#772;r. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; at noon, i.e., in broad day, might signify, when used as an antithesis to night, "with open violence" (Jerome, Kimchi); but inasmuch as the expulsion of inhabitants is not effected by thieves in the night, the time of noon is more probably to be understood, as v. Clln and Rosenmller suppose, as denoting the time of day at which men generally rest in hot countries (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#005">Sa2 4:5</A>), in the sense of unexpected, unsuspected expulsion; and this is favoured by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008">Jer 15:8</A>, where the devastation at noon is described as a sudden invasion. The omission of Gath may be explained in the same manner as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006">Amo 1:6-8</A>, from the fact that the parallelism of the clauses only allowed the names of four cities to be given; and this number was amply sufficient to individualize the whole, just as Zephaniah, when enumerating the heathen nations, restricts the number to four, according to the four quarters of the globe: viz., the Philistines in the west (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005">Zep 2:5-7</A>); the Moabites and Ammonites comprised in one in the east (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008">Zep 2:8-10</A>); the Cushites in the south (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011">Zep 2:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#012">Zep 2:12</A>); and Asshur, with Nineveh, in the north (north-east), (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013">Zep 2:13-15</A>). The woe with which the threat is commenced in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005">Zep 2:5</A> applies to the whole land and people of the Philistines. Chebhel, the measure, then the tract of land measured out or apportioned (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004">Deu 3:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009">Deu 32:9</A>, etc.). The tract of the sea is the tract of land by the Mediterranean Sea which was occupied by the Philistines (chebhel hayya&#770;m = 'erets Pelisht&#305;&#772;m). Zephaniah calls the inhabitants go&#772;i Kere&#772;th&#305;&#772;m, nation of the Cretans, from the name of one branch of the Philistian people which was settled in the south-west of Philistia, for the purpose of representing them as a people devoted to ka&#770;rath, or extermination. The origin of this name, which is selected both here and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016">Eze 25:16</A> with a play upon the appellative signification, is involved in obscurity; for, as we have already observed at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014">Sa1 30:14</A>, there is no valid authority for the derivation which is now current, viz., from the island of Crete (see Stark, Gaza, pp. 66 and 99ff.). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; forms an independent sentence: The word of the Lord cometh over you. The nature of that word is described in the next sentence: I will destroy thee. The name Kena&#8219;an is used in the more limited sense of Philistia, and is chosen to indicate that Philistia is to share the lot of Canaan, and lose its inhabitants by extermination.

<p>The tract of land thus depopulated is to be turned into "pastures (nevo&#772;th, the construct state plural of na&#770;veh) of the excavation of shepherds," i.e., where shepherds will make excavations or dig themselves huts under the ground as a protection from the sun. This is the simplest explanation of the variously interpreted kero&#772;th (as an inf. of ka&#770;ra&#770;h, to dig), and can be grammatically sustained. The digging of the shepherds stands for the excavations which they make. Bochart (Hieroz. i. p. 519, ed. Ros.) has already given this explanation: "Caulae s. caulis repletus erit effossionis pastorum, i.e., caulae a pastoribus effossae in cryptis subterraneis ad vitandum solis aestum." On the other hand, the derivation from the noun ke&#772;ra&#770;h, in the sense of cistern, cannot be sustained; and there is no proof of it in the fact that ka&#770;ra&#770;h is applied to the digging of wells. Still less is it possible to maintain the derivation from &#1497;&#1499;&#1512; (Arab. wkr), by which Ewald would support the meaning nests for ke&#772;ro&#772;th, i.e., "the small houses or carts of the shepherds." And Hitzig's alteration of the text into &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; = &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, pastures, so as to obtain the tautology "meadows of the pastures," is perfectly unwarranted. The word chebhel is construed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006">Zep 2:6</A> as a feminine ad sensum, with a retrospective allusion to 'erets Pelisht&#305;&#772;m; whereas in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007">Zep 2:7</A> it is construed, as it is everywhere else, as a masculine. Moreover, the noun chebhel, which occurs in this verse without the article, is not the subject; for, if it were, it would at least have had the article. It is rather a predicate, and the subject must be supplied from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006">Zep 2:6</A> : "The Philistian tract of land by the sea will become a tract of land or possession for the remnant of the house of Judah, the portion of the people of God rescued from the judgment. Upon them, viz., these pastures, will they feed." The plural &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; does not stand for the neuter, but is occasioned by a retrospective glance at &#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;. The subject is, those that are left of the house of Judah. They will there feed their flocks, and lie down in the huts of Ashkelon. For the prophet adds by way of explanation, Jehovah their God will visit them. Pa&#770;qad, to visit in a good sense, i.e., to take them under His care, as is almost always the meaning when it is construed with an accusative of the person. It is only in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006">Psa 59:6</A> that it is used with an acc. pers. instead of with &#1506;&#1500;, in the sense of to chastise or punish. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011">Hos 6:11</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014">Amo 9:14</A>. The keri &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; has arisen from a misinterpretation. On the fulfilment, see what follows.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">zep 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The judgment upon Joab and Ammon. - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008">Zep 2:8</A>. "I have heard the abuse of Moab, and the revilings of the sons of Ammon, who have abused my nation, and boasted against its boundary. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009">Zep 2:9</A>. Therefore, as I live, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Yea, Moab shall become like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrha, an inheritance of nettles and salt-pits, and desert for ever. The remnant of my nation will plunder them, the residue of my nation will inherit them. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010">Zep 2:10</A>. Such to them for their pride, that they have despised and boasted against the nation of Jehovah of hosts." The threat now turns from the Philistines in the west to the two tribes to the east, viz., the Moabites and Ammonites, who were descended from Lot, and therefore blood-relations, and who manifested hostility to Israel on every possible occasion. Even in the time of Moses, the Moabitish king Balak sought to destroy Israel by means of Balaam's curses (Numbers 22), for which the Moabites were threatened with extermination (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017">Num 24:17</A>). In the time of the judges they both attempted to oppress Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012">Jdg 3:12</A>. and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007">Jdg 10:7</A>.; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001">Sa1 11:1-5</A> and 2 Samuel 10-12), for which they were severely punished by Saul and David (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047">Sa1 14:47</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002">Sa2 8:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030">Sa2 12:30-31</A>). The reproach of Moab and the revilings of the Ammonites, which Jehovah had heard, cannot be taken, as Jerome, Rashi, and others suppose, as referring to the hostilities of those tribes towards the Judaeans during the Chaldaean catastrophe; nor restricted, as v. Clln imagines, to the reproaches heaped upon the ten tribes when they were carried away by the Assyrians, since nothing is know of any such reproaches. The charge refers to the hostile attitude assumed by both tribes at all times towards the nation of God, which they manifested both in word and deed, as often as the latter was brought into trouble and distress. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026">Jer 48:26-27</A>; and for gidde&#772;ph, to revile or blaspheme by actions, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030">Num 15:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#027">Eze 20:27</A>; also for the fact itself, the remarks on Amos 1:13-2:3. &#1497;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500; &#1490;&#1489;, they did great things against their (the Israelites') border (the suffix in gebhu&#772;la&#770;m, their border, refers to &#8219;amm&#305;&#772;, my people). This great doing consisted in their proudly violating the boundary of Israel, and endeavouring to seize upon Israelitish territory (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013">Amo 1:13</A>). Pride and haughtiness, or high-minded self-exaltation above Israel as the nation of God, is charged against the Moabites and Ammonites by Isaiah and Jeremiah also, as a leading feature in their character (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006">Isa 16:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#011">Isa 25:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029">Jer 48:29-30</A>). Moab and Ammon are to be utterly exterminated in consequence. The threat of punishment is announced in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008">Zep 2:8</A> as irrevocable by a solemn oath. It shall happen to them as to Sodom and Gomorrha. This simile was rendered a very natural one by the situation of the two lands in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea. It affirms the utter destruction of the two tribes, as the appositional description shows. Their land is to become the possession of nettles, i.e., a place where nettles grow. Mimsha&#770;q, hap leg., from the root ma&#770;shaq, which was not used, but from which mesheq in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002">Gen 15:2</A> is derived. Cha&#770;ru&#772;l: the stinging nettle (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#007">Job 30:7</A>), which only flourishes in waste places. Mikhre&#772;h melach: a place of salt-pits, like the southern coast of the Dead Sea, which abounds in rock-salt, and to which there is an allusion in the threat of Moses in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022">Deu 29:22</A>. "A desert for ever:" the emphasis lies upon &#8219;ad &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;m (for ever) here. The people, however, i.e., the Moabites and Ammonites themselves, will be taken by the people of Jehovah, and be made their possession. The suffixes attached to &#1497;&#1489;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; can only refer to the people of Moab and Ammon, because a land turned into an eternal desert and salt-steppe would not be adapted for a nacha&#774;la&#770;h (possession) for the people of God. The meaning is not, they will be their heirs through the medium of plunder, but they will make them into their own property, or slaves (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002">Isa 14:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005">Isa 61:5</A>). &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497; is &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; with the suffix of the first person, only one of the two &#1497; being written. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010">Zep 2:10</A> the threat concludes with a repetition of the statement of the guilt which is followed by such a judgment.
<p>The fulfilment or realization of the threat pronounced upon Philistia, Moab, and Ammon, we have not to look for in the particular historical occurrences through which these tribes were conquered and subjugated by the Chaldaeans, and to some extent by the Jews after the captivity, until they eventually vanished from the stage of history, and their lands became desolate, as they still are. These events can only come into consideration as preliminary stages of the fulfilment, which Zephaniah completely passes by, since he only views the judgment in its ultimate fulfilment. We are precluded, moreover, from taking the words as relating to that event by the circumstance, that neither Philistia on the one hand, nor Moabites and Ammonites on the other, were ever taken permanent possession of by the Jews; and still less were they ever taken by Judah, as the nation of God, for His own property. Judah is not to enter into such possession as this till the Lord turns the captivity of Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007">Zep 2:7</A>); that is to say, not immediately after the return from the Babylonish captivity, but when the dispersion of Israel among the Gentiles, which lasts till this day, shall come to an end, and Israel, through its conversion to Christ, be reinstated in the privileges of the people of God. It follows from this, that the fulfilment is still in the future, and that it will be accomplished not literally, but spiritually, in the utter destruction of the nations referred to as heathen nations, and opponents of the kingdom of God, and in the incorporation of those who are converted to the living God at the time of the judgment, into the citizenship of the spiritual Israel. Until the eventual restoration of Israel, Philistia will remain an uninhabited shepherds' pasture, and the land of the Moabites and Ammonites the possession of nettles, a place of salt-pits and a desert; just as the land of Israel will for the very same time be trodden down by the Gentiles. The curse resting upon these lands will not be entirely removed till the completion of the kingdom of God on earth. This view is proved to be correct by the contents of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011">Zep 2:11</A>, with which the prophet passes to the announcement of the judgment upon the nations of the south and north.

<p>"Fearful is Jehovah over them, for He destroyeth all the gods of the earth; that all the islands of the nations, every one from its place, may worship Him." Whilst &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; refers to what precedes, the next clause in the reason assigned points to the announcement of judgment upon the remaining nations of the earth in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#012">Zep 2:12</A>.; so that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011">Zep 2:11</A> cannot be taken either as the conclusion of the previous threat, or as the commencement of the following one, but leads from the one to the other. Jehovah is terrible when He reveals Himself in the majesty of Judge of the world. The suffix appended to &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; does not refer to &#1506;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but to the &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010">Zep 2:10</A>, answering to the Moabites and Ammonites. Jehovah proves Himself terrible to these, because He has resolved to destroy all the gods of the earth. Ra&#770;za&#770;h, to make lean; hence to cause to vanish, to destroy. He causes the gods to vanish, by destroying the nations and kingdoms who relied upon these gods. He thereby reveals the nothingness of the gods, and brings the nations to acknowledge His sole deity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#012">Mic 5:12</A>). The fall of the false gods impels to the worship of the one true God. &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1493; is the consequence, the fruit, and the effect of Jehovah's proving Himself terrible to the nations and their gods. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, islands of the Gentiles, is an epithet taken from the islands and coastlands of Europe, to denote the whole of the heathen world (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001">Isa 41:1</A>). The distributive &#1506;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; refers to haggo&#772;y&#305;&#772;m as the principal idea, though not in the sense of "every nation," but in that of every individual belonging to the nations. Mimmeqo&#772;mo&#772;, coming from his place: the meaning is not that the nations will worship Jehovah at their own place, in their own lands, in contradistinction to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001">Mic 4:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016">Zac 14:16</A>, and other passages, where the nations go on pilgrimage to Mount Zion (Hitzig); but their going to Jerusalem is implied in the min (from), though it is not brought prominently out, as being unessential to the thought. With regard to the fulfilment, Bucer has correctly observed, that "the worship of Jehovah on the part of the heathen is not secured without sanguinary wars, that the type may not be taken for the fact itself, and the shadow for the body .... But the true completion of the whole in the kingdom of Christ takes place here in spirit and in faith, whilst in the future age it will be consummated in all its reality and in full fruition." Theodoret, on the other hand, is too one-sided in his view, and thinks only of the conversion of the heathen through the preaching of the gospel. "This prophecy," he says, "has received its true fulfilment through the holy apostles, and the saints who have followed them; ... and this takes place, not by the law, but by the teaching of the gospel."

<p>After this statement of the aim of the judgments of God, Zephaniah mentions two other powerful heathen nations as examples, to prove that the whole of the heathen world will succumb to the judgment. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#012">Zep 2:12</A>. "Ye Cushites also, slain of my sword are they. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013">Zep 2:13</A>. And let him stretch out his hand toward the south, and destroy Asshur; and make Nineveh a barren waste, a dry place, like the desert. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014">Zep 2:14</A>. And herds lie down in the midst of it, all kinds of beasts in crowds: pelicans also and hedgehogs will lodge on their knobs; the voice of the singer in the window; heaps upon the threshold: for their cedar-work hath He made bare. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015">Zep 2:15</A>. This the city, the exulting one, the safely dwelling one, which said in her heart, I, and no more: how has she become a desolation, a lair of beasts! Every one that passeth by it will hiss, swing his hand." As a representative of the heathen dwelling in the south, Zephaniah does not mention Edom, which bordered upon Judah, or the neighbouring land of Egypt, but the remote Ethiopia, the furthest kingdom or people in the south that was known to the Hebrews. The Ethiopians will be slain of the sword of Jehovah. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; does not take the place of the copula between the subject and predicate, any more than &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016">Isa 37:16</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011">Ezr 5:11</A> (to which Hitzig appeals in support of this usage: see Delitzsch, on the other hand, in his Comm. on Isaiah, l.c.), but is a predicate. The prophecy passes suddenly from the form of address (in the second person) adopted in the opening clause, to a statement concerning the Cushites (in the third person). For similar instances of sudden transition, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#018">Zep 3:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008">Zac 3:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#022">Eze 28:22</A>.
<p>(Note: Calvin correctly says: "The prophet commences by driving them, in the second person, to the tribunal of God, and then adds in the third person, 'They will be,' etc.")
<p>&#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497; &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; is a reminiscence from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016">Isa 66:16</A> : slain by Jehovah with the sword. Zephaniah says nothing further concerning this distant nation, which had not come into any hostile collision with Judah in his day; and only mentions it to exemplify the thought that all the heathen will come under the judgment. The fulfilment commenced with the judgment upon Egypt through the Chaldaeans, as is evident from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004">Eze 30:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009">Eze 30:9</A>, as compared with Josephus, Ant. x. 11, and continues till the conversion of that people to the Lord, the commencement of which is recorded in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027">Act 8:27-38</A>. The prophet dwells longer upon the heathen power of the north, the Assyrian kingdom with its capital Nineveh, because Assyria was then the imperial power, which was seeking to destroy the kingdom of God in Judah. This explains the fact that the prophet expresses the announcement of the destruction of this power in the form of a wish, as the use of the contracted forms ye&#772;t and ya&#770;se&#772;m clearly shows. For it is evident that Ewald is wrong in supposing that &#1493;&#1497;&#1496; stands for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1496;, or should be so pointed, inasmuch as the historical tense, "there He stretched out His hand," would be perfectly out of place. &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491; (to stretch out a hand), as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004">Zep 1:4</A>. &#8219;al tsa&#770;pho&#772;n, over (or against) the north. The reference is to Assyria with the capital Nineveh. It is true that this kingdom was not to the north, but to the north-east, of Judah; but inasmuch as the Assyrian armies invaded Palestine from the north, it is regarded by the prophets as situated in the north. On Nineveh itself, see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002">Jon 1:2</A> (p. 263); and on the destruction of this city and the fall of the Assyrian empire, at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019">Nah 3:19</A> (p. 379). Lishma&#770;ma&#770;h is strengthened by the apposition tsiyya&#770;h kammidba&#770;r.
<p>Nineveh is not only to become a steppe, in which herds feed (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#010">Isa 27:10</A>), but a dry, desolate waste, where only desert animals will make their home. Tsiyya&#770;h, the dry, arid land - the barren, sandy desert (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001">Isa 35:1</A>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1492;&#1468;, in the midst of the city which has become a desert, there lie flocks, not of sheep and goats (&#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006">Zep 2:6</A>; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020">Isa 13:20</A>), but  &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1470;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497; , literally of all the animals of the (or a) nation. The meaning can only be, "all kinds of animals in crowds or in a mass."  &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;  is used here for the mass of animals, just as it is in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006">Joe 1:6</A> for the multitude of locusts, and as &#1506;&#1501; is in Prov. 30:35-36 for the ant-people; and the genitive is to be taken as in apposition. Every other explanation is exposed to much greater objections and difficulties. For the form &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024">Gen 1:24</A>. Pelicans and hedgehogs will make their homes in the remains of the ruined buildings (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011">Isa 34:11</A>, on which passage Zephaniah rests his description). &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, upon the knobs of the pillars left standing when the palaces were destroyed (kaphto&#772;r; see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001">Amo 9:1</A>). The reference to the pelican, a marsh bird, is not opposed to the tsiyya&#770;h of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013">Zep 2:13</A>, since Nineveh stood by the side of streams, the waters of which formed marshes after the destruction of the city. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; cannot be rendered "a voice sings," for sho&#772;re&#772;r, to sing, is not used for tuning or resounding; but yesho&#772;re&#772;r is to be taken relatively, and as subordinate to &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, the voice of him that sings will be heard in the window. Jerome gives it correctly: vox canentis in fenestra. There is no necessity to think of the cry of the owl or hawk in particular, but simply of birds generally, which make their singing heard in the windows of the ruins. The sketching of the picture of the destruction passes from the general appearance of the city to the separate ruins, coming down from the lofty knobs of the pillars to the windows, and from these to the thresholds of the ruins of the houses. Upon the thresholds there is cho&#772;rebh, devastation (= rubbish), and no longer a living being. This is perfectly appropriate, so that there is no necessity to give the word an arbitrary interpretation, or to alter the text, so as to get the meaning a raven or a crow. The description closes with the explanatory sentence: "for He has laid bare the cedar-work," i.e., has so destroyed the palaces and state buildings, that the costly panelling of the walls is exposed. 'Arza&#770;h is a collective, from 'erez, the cedar-work, and there is no ground for any such alteration of the text as Ewald and Hitzig suggest, in order to obtain the trivial meaning "hews or hacks in pieces," or the cold expression, "He destroys, lays bare." In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015">Zep 2:15</A> the picture is rounded off. "This is the city," i.e., this is what happens to the exulting city. &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1492;, exulting, applied to the joyful tumult caused by the men - a favourite word with Isaiah (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002">Isa 22:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#007">Isa 23:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008">Isa 24:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013">Isa 32:13</A>). The following predicates from &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; to &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; are borrowed from the description of Babel in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008">Isa 47:8</A>, and express the security and self-deification of the mighty imperial city. The Yod in 'aphs&#305;&#772; is not paragogical, but a pronoun in the first person; at the same time, 'ephes is not a preposition, "beside me," since in that case the negation "not one" could not be omitted, but "the non-existence," so that &#1488;&#1508;&#1505;&#1497; = &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, I am absolutely no further (see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008">Isa 47:8</A>). But how has this self-deifying pride been put to shame! &#1488;&#1497;&#1498;, an expression of amazement at the tragical turn in her fate. The city filled with the joyful exulting of human beings has become the lair of wild beasts, and every one that passes by expresses his malicious delight in its ruin. Sha&#770;raq, to hiss, a common manifestation of scorn (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016">Mic 6:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008">Jer 19:8</A>). &#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506; &#1497;&#1491;, to swing the hand, embodying the thought, "Away with her, she has richly deserved her fate."
