### [Deuteronomy Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 30:1</span></span>

Nevertheless the rejection of Israel and its dispersion among the
heathen were not to be the close. If the people should return to the
Lord their God in their exile, He would turn His favour towards them
again, and gather them again out of their dispersion, as had already
been proclaimed in [Deu 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029.md). and [Lev
26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md)., where it was also observed
that the extremity of their distress would bring the people to
reflection and induce them to return.

[Deu 30:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)

"When all these words, the blessing and the curse which I have set
before thee, shall come." The allusion to the blessing in this
connection may be explained on the ground that Moses was surveying the
future generally, in which not only a curse but a blessing also would
come upon the nation, according to its attitude towards the Lord as a
whole and in its several members, since even in times of the greatest
apostasy on the part of the nation there would always be a holy seed
which could not die out; because otherwise the nation would necessarily
have been utterly and for ever rejected, whereby the promises of God
would have been brought to nought, - a result which was absolutely
impossible. "And thou takest to heart among all nations," etc., sc.,
what has befallen thee - not only the curse which presses upon thee, but
also the blessing which accompanies obedience to the commands of God, -
"and returnest to the Lord thy God, and hearkenest to His voice with all
the heart," etc. (cf. [Deu 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029).md); "the
Lord will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and gather
thee again." את־שׁבוּת שׁוּב does not mean to bring back the prisoners,
as the more modern lexicographers erroneously suppose (the Kal שׁוּב
never has the force of the Hiphil), but to turn the imprisonment, and
that in a figurative sense, viz., to put an end to the distress ([Job
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010.md); [Jer
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#008.md); [Eze
16:53](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053.md); [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md); also [Psa
85:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002.md); [Psa
126:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002.md), [Psa
126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004).md), except that in many passages
the misery of exile in which the people pined is represented as
imprisonment. The passage before us is fully decisive against the
meaning to bring back the prisoners, since the gathering out of the
heathen is spoken of as being itself the consequence of the "turning of
the captivity;" so also is [Jer 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014.md),
where the bringing back (השׁיב) is expressly distinguished from it. But
especially is this the case with [Jer
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018.md), where "turning the captivity of
Jacob's tents" is synonymous with having mercy on his dwelling-places,
and building up the city, again, so that the city lying in ruins is
represented as שׁבוּת, an imprisonment.

(Note: Hupfeld (on [Psa 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007).md) has
endeavoured to sustain the assertion that שׁבוּת is a later form for the
older and simpler forms, שׁבי, שׁביה, by citing one single passage of
the Old Testament. The abstract form of שׁבי is שׁבית, imprisonment
([Num 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029).md), then prisoners. This
form has been substituted by Jeremiah for שׁבוּת in one passage, viz.,
[Deu 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#044.md); and the Masoretic
punctuators were the first to overlook the difference in the two words,
and point them promiscuously.)

[Deu 30:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#004.md)

The gathering of Israel out of all the countries of the earth would then
follow. Even though the rejected people should be at the end of heaven,
the Lord would fetch them thence, and bring them back into the land of
their fathers, and do good to the nation, and multiply them above their
fathers. These last words show that the promised neither points directly
to the gathering of Israel from dispersion on its ultimate conversion to
Christ, nor furnishes any proof that the Jews will then be brought back
to Palestine. It is true that even these words have some reference to
the final redemption of Israel. This is evident from the curse of
dispersion, which cannot be restricted to the Assyrian and Babylonian
captivities, but includes the Roman dispersion also, in which the nation
continues still; and it is still more apparent from the renewal of this
promise in [Jer 32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037.md) and other
prophetic passages. But this application is to be found in the spirit,
and not in the latter. For if there is to be an increase in the number
of the Jews, when gathered out of their dispersion into all the world,
above the number of their fathers, and therefore above the number of the
Israelites in the time of Solomon and the first monarchs of the two
kingdoms, Palestine will never furnish room enough for a nation
multiplied like this. The multiplication promised here, so far as it
falls within the Messianic age, will consist in the realization of the
promise given to Abraham, that his seed should grow into nations ([Gen
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#006.md) and [Gen
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#016).md), i.e., in the innumerable
multiplication, not of the "Israel according to the flesh," but of the
"Israel according to the spirit," whose land is not restricted to the
boundaries of the earthly Canaan or Palestine (see p. 144). The
possession of the earthly Canaan for all time is nowhere promised to the
Israelitish nation in the law (see at [Deu
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#021).md).

[Deu 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006.md)

The Lord will then circumcise their heart, and the heart of their
children (see [Deu 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016).md), so that
they will love Him with all their heart. When Israel should turn with
true humility to the Lord, He would be found of them, - would lead them
to true repentance, and sanctify them through the power of His grace, -
would take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a
heart of flesh, a new heart and a new spirit, - so that they should
truly know Him and keep His commandments (vid., [Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md); [Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026.md); [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md). and [Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039)..md). "Because of thy life," i.e.,
that thou mayest live, sc., attain to true life. The fulfilment of this
promise does not take place all at once. It commenced with small
beginnings at the deliverance from the Babylonian exile, and in a still
higher degree at the appearance of Christ in the case of all the
Israelites who received Him as their Saviour. Since then it has been
carried on through all ages in the conversion of individual children of
Abraham to Christ; and it will be realized in the future in a still more
glorious manner in the nation at large ([Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)..md). The words of Moses do not
relate to any particular age, but comprehend all times. For Israel has
never been hardened and rejected in all its members, although the mass
of the nation lives under the curse even to the present day.

[Deu 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#007.md)

But after its conversion, the curses, which had hitherto rested upon it,
would fall upon its enemies and haters, according to the promise in [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md).

[Deuteronomy 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 30:8</span></span>

Israel would then hearken again to the voice of the Lord and keep His
commandments, and would rejoice in consequence in the richest blessing
of its God. In the expression, ושׁמעתּ תשׁוּב אתּה ("thou shalt return
and hearken"), תּשׁוּב ("thou shalt return") has an adverbial
signification. This is evident from the corresponding expression in [Deu
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#009.md), "for Jehovah will again rejoice
over thee" (lit., "will return and rejoice"), in which the adverbial
signification is placed beyond all doubt.

[Deu 30:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#008.md) contain the general
thought, that Israel would then come again into its normal relation to
its God, would enter into true and perfect covenant fellowship with the
Lord, and enjoy all the blessings of the covenant.

[Deu 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#009.md)

[Deu 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#009.md) is a repetition of [Deu
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#011.md). The Lord will rejoice again
over Israel, to do them good (vid., [Deu
28:63](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063).md), as He had rejoiced over their
fathers. The fathers are not the patriarchs alone, but all the pious
ancestors of the people.

[Deu 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#010.md)

A renewed enforcement of the indispensable condition of salvation.

[Deuteronomy 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 30:11</span></span>

The fulfilment of this condition is not impossible, nor really very
difficult. This natural though leads to the motive, which Moses
impresses upon the hearts of the people in [Deu
30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011.md), viz., that He might turn the
blessing to them. God had done everything to render the observance of
His commandments possible to Israel. "This commandment" (used as in [Deu
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001) to denote the whole law.md) is "not
too wonderful for thee," i.e., is not too hard to grasp, or
unintelligible (vid., [Deu 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008).md), nor
is it too far off: it is neither in heaven, i.e., at an inaccessible
height; nor beyond the sea, i.e., at an unattainable distance, at the
end of the world, so that any one could say, Who is able to fetch it
thence? but it is very near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart to do
it. It not only lay before the people in writing, but it was also
preached to them by word of mouth, and thus brought to their knowledge,
so that it had become a subject of conversation as well as of reflection
and careful examination. But however near the law had thus been brought
to man, sin had so estranged the human heart from the word of God, that
doing and keeping the law had become invariably difficult, and in fact
impossible; so that the declaration, "the word is in thy heart," only
attains its full realization through the preaching of the gospel of the
grace of God, and the righteousness that is by faith; and to this the
Apostle Paul applies the passage in [Rom
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008.md).

[Deuteronomy 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 30:15</span></span>

In conclusion, Moses sums up the contents of the whole of this preaching
of the law in the words, "life and good, and death and evil," as he had
already done at [Deu 11:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#026.md), in the
first part of this address, to lay the people by a solemn adjuration
under the obligation to be faithful to the Lord, and through this
obligation to conclude the covenant afresh. He had set before them this
day life and good ("good" = prosperity and salvation), as well as death
and evil (רע, adversity and destruction), by commanding them to love the
Lord and walk in His ways. Love is placed first, as in [Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md), as being the essential principle
of the fulfilment of the commandments. Expounding the law was setting
before them life and death, salvation and destruction, because the law,
as the word of God, was living and powerful, and proved itself in every
man a power of life or of death, according to the attitude which he
assumed towards it (vid., [Deu 32:47](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#047).md).
נדּח, to permit oneself to be torn away to idolatry (as in [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019).md).

[Deuteronomy 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 30:18</span></span>

As [Deu 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026.md); [Deu
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#019.md). He calls upon heaven and earth
as witnesses ([Deu 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019.md), as in [Deu
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026).md), namely, that he had set before
them life and death. וּבחרתּ, in [Deu
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019.md), is the apodosis: "therefore
choose life."

[Deuteronomy 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 30:20</span></span>

חיּיך הוּא כּי, for that (namely, to love the Lord) is thy life, that
is, the condition of life, and of long life, in the promised land (vid.,
[Deu 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040).md).
