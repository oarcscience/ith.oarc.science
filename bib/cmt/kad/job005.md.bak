### [Job Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001.md)

[Job 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 5:1</span></span>

1 Call now, - is there any one who will answer thee?

And to whom of the holy ones wilt thou turn?

2 For he is a fool who is destroyed by complaining,

And envy slays the simple one.

3 I, even I, have seen a fool taking root:

Then I had to curse his habitation suddenly.

4 His children were far from help,

And were crushed in the gate, without a rescuer;

5 While the hungry ate his harvest,

And even from among thorns they took it away,

And the intriguer snatched after his wealth.

The chief thought of the oracle was that God is the absolutely just One,
and infinitely exalted above men and angels. Resuming his speech from
this point, Eliphaz tells Job that no cry for help can avail him unless
he submits to the all-just One as being himself unrighteous; nor can any
cry addressed to the angels avail. This thought, although it is
rejected, certainly shows that the writer of the book, as of the
prologue, is impressed with the fundamental intuition, that good, like
evil, spirits are implicated in the affairs of men; for the "holy ones,"
as in Ps 89, are the angels. כּי supports the negation implied in [Job
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001.md) : If God does not help thee, no
creature can help thee; for he who complains and chafes at his lot
brings down upon himself the extremest destruction, since he excites the
anger of God still more. Such a surly murmurer against God is here
called אויל. ל is the Aramaic sign of the object, having the force of
quod attinet ad, quoad (Ew. 310, a).

Eliphaz justifies what he has said ([Job
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#002).md) by an example. He had seen such a
complainer in increasing prosperity; then he cursed his habitation
suddenly, i.e., not: he uttered forthwith a prophetic curse over it,
which, though פּתאם might have this meaning (not subito, but illico; cf.
[Num 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#004).md), the following futt.,
equivalent to imperff., do not allow, but: I had then, since his
discontent had brought on his destruction, suddenly to mark and abhor
his habitation as one overtaken by a curse: the cursing is a recognition
of the divine curse, as the echo of which it is intended. This curse of
God manifests itself also on his children and his property ([Job
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004)..md). שׁער is the gate of the city as
a court of justice: the phrase, to oppress in the gate, is like [Pro
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md); and the form Hithpa. is
according to the rule given in Ges. 54, 2, b. The relative אשׁר, [Job
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#005.md), is here conj. relativa, according
to Ges. 155, 1, c. In the connection אל־מצּנּים, אל is equivalent to עד,
adeo e spinis, the hungry fall so eagerly upon what the father of those
now orphans has reaped, that even the thorny fence does not hold them
back. צנּים, as [Pro 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005.md) : the double
praepos. אל־מן is also found elsewhere, but with another meaning. עמּים
has only the appearance of being plur.: it is sing. after the form
צדּיק, from the verb צמם, nectere, and signifies, [Job
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#009.md), a snare; here, however, not
judicii laqueus (Bttch.), but what, besides the form, comes still nearer
- the snaremaker, intriguer. The Targ. translates לסטיסין, i.e., λησταί.
Most modern critics (Rosenm. to Ebr.) translate: the thirsty (needy), as
do all the old translations, except the Targ.; this, however, is not
possible without changing the form. The meaning is, that intriguing
persons catch up (שׁאף, as [Amo 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007).md)
their wealth.

Eliphaz now tells why it thus befell this fool in his own person and his
children.

[Job 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 5:6</span></span>

6 For evil cometh not forth from the dust,

And sorrow sprouteth not from the earth;

7 For man is born to sorrow,

As the sparks fly upward.

8 On the contrary, I would earnestly approach unto God,

And commit my cause to the Godhead;

9 To Him who doeth great things and unsearchable;

Marvellous things till there is no number:

10 Who giveth rain over the earth,

And causeth water to flow over the fields:

11 To set the low in high places;

And those that mourn are exalted to prosperity.

As the oracle above, so Eliphaz says here, that a sorrowful life is
allotted to man,

(Note: Fries explains יוּלּד as part., and refers to Geiger's Lehrb. zur
Sprache der Mischna, S. 41f., according to which מקטּל signifies killed,
and קטּל (= Rabb. מתקטּל) being killed (which, however, rests purely on
imagination): not the matter from which mankind originates brings evil
with it, but it is man who inclines towards the evil. Bttch. would read
יולד: man is the parent of misery, though he may rise high in anger.)

so that his wisdom consequently consists in accommodating himself to his
lot: if he does not do that, he is an אויל, and thereby perishes.
Misfortune does not grow out of the ground like weeds; it is rather
established in the divine order of the world, as it is established in
the order of nature that sparks of fire should ascend. The old critics
understood by רשׁף בני birds of prey, as being swift as lightning (with
which the appellation of beasts of prey may be compared, [Job
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#008.md); [Job
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#026).md); but רשׁף signifies also a
flame or blaze ([Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006).md). Children of
the flame is an appropriate name for sparks, and flying upwards is
naturally peculiar to sparks as to birds of prey; wherefore among modern
expositors, Hirz., Ew., Hahn, von Gerl., Ebr., rightly decide in favour
of sparks. Schlottmann understands "angels" by children of flame; but
the wings, which are given to angels in Scripture, are only a symbol of
their freedom of motion. This remarkable interpretation is altogether
opposed to the sententious character of [Job
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007.md), which symbolizes a moral truth by
an ordinary thing. The waw in וּבני, which we have translated "as," is
the so-called waw adaequationis proper to the Proverbs, and also to
emblems, e.g., [Pro 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025.md).

Eliphaz now says what he would do in Job's place. Ew. and Ebr. translate
incorrectly, or at least unnecessarily: Nevertheless I will. We
translate, according to Ges. 127, 5: Nevertheless I would; and indeed
with an emphatic I: Nevertheless I for my part. דּרשׁ with אל is constr.
praegnans, like [Deu 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md), sedulo
adire. דּברה is not speech, like אמרה but cause, causa, in a judicial
sense. אל is God as the Mighty One; אלהים is God in the totality of His
variously manifested nature. The fecundity of the earth by rain, and of
the fields (חוּצות = rura) by water-springs (cf. [Psa
104:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010).md), as the works of God, are
intentionally made prominent. He who makes the barren places fruitful,
can also change suffering into joy. To His power in nature corresponds
His power among men ([Job 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#011).md).
לשׂוּם is here only as a variation for השּׂם, as Heiligst. rightly
observes: it is equivalent to collacaturus, or qui in eo est ut
collocet, according to the mode of expression discussed in Ges. 132,
rem. 1, and more fully on [Hab 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017.md).
The construction of [Hab 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011.md) is still
bolder. שׂגב signifies to be high and steep, inaccessible. It is here
construed with the acc. of motion: those who go in dirty, black clothes
because they mourn, shall be high in prosperity, i.e., come to stand on
an unapproachable height of prosperity.

[Job 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 5:12</span></span>

12 Who bringeth to nought the devices of the crafty,

So that their hands cannot accomplish anything;

13 Who catcheth the wise in their craftiness;

And the counsel of the cunning is thrown down.

14 By day they run into darkness,

And grope in the noon-day as in the night.

15 He rescueth from the sword, that from their mouth,

And from the hand of the strong, the needy.

16 Hope ariseth for the weak,

And folly shall close its mouth.

All these attributes are chosen designedly: God brings down all
haughtiness, and takes compassion on those who need it. The noun
תּוּשׁיּה, coined by the Chokma, and out of Job and Proverbs found only
in [Mic 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md); [Isa
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029.md), and even there in gnomical
connection, is formed from ישׁ, essentia, and signifies as it were
essentialitas, realitas: it denotes, in relation to all visible things,
the truly existing, the real, the objective; true wisdom (i.e.,
knowledge resting on an objective actual basis), true prosperity, real
profiting and accomplishing. It is meant that they accomplish nothing
that has actual duration and advantage. [Job
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013.md) cannot be better translated than
by Paul, [Co1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#019.md), who here deviates
from the lxx. With נמהרה, God's seizure, which prevents the contemplated
achievement, is to be thought of. He pours forth over the worldly wise
what the prophets call the spirit of deep sleep (תּרדּמה) and of
dizziness (עועים). On the other hand, He helps the poor. In מפיהם מחרב
the second מן is local: from the sword which proceeds from their mouth
(comp. [Psa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004.md); [Psa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005), and other passages.md). Bttch.
translates: without sword, i.e., instrument of power (comp. [Job
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#015.md); [Job
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009).md); but מן with חרב leads one to
expect that that from which one is rescued is to be described (comp.
[Job 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020).md). Ewald corrects מחרב, which
Olsh. thinks acute: it is, however, unhebraic, according to our present
knowledge of the usage of the language; for the passives of חרב are used
of cities, countries, and peoples, but not of individual men. Olsh., in
his hesitancy, arrives at no opinion. But the text is sound and
beautiful. עלתה with pathetic unaccented ah (Ges. 80, rem. 2, f), from
עולה = עולה, as Ps. 92:16 Chethib.

[Job 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 5:17</span></span>

17 Behold, happy is the man whom Eloah correcteth;

So despise not the chastening of the Almighty!

18 For He woundeth, and He also bindeth up;

He bruiseth, and His hands make whole.

19 In six troubles He will rescue thee,

And in seven no evil shall touch thee.

20 In famine He will redeem thee from death,

And in war from the stroke of the sword.

21 When the tongue scourgeth, thou shalt be hidden;

And thou shalt not fear destruction when it cometh.

The speech of Eliphaz now becomes persuasive as it turns towards the
conclusion. Since God humbles him who exalts himself, and since He
humbles in order to exalt, it is a happy thing when He corrects (הוכיח)
us by afflictive dispensations; and His chastisement (מוּסר) is to be
received not with a turbulent spirit, but resignedly, yea joyously: the
same thought as [Pro 3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md); [Psa
94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md), in both passages borrowed from
this; whereas [Job 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#018.md) here, like
[Hos 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md); [Lam
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#031.md)., refers to [Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039.md). רפא, to heal, is here
conjugated like a הל verb (Ges. 75, rem. 21). [Job
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md) is formed after the manner of the
so-called number-proverbs ([Pro 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md);
[Pro 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md), [Pro
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018).md), as also the roll of the
judgment of the nations in Amos 1-2: in six troubles, yea in still more
than six. רע is the extremity that is perhaps to be feared. In [Job
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020.md), the praet. is a kind of
prophetic praet. The scourge of the tongue recalls the similar promise,
[Psa 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021.md), where, instead of scourge,
it is: the disputes of the tongue. שׁוד, from שׁדד violence, disaster,
is allied in sound with שׁוט. Isaiah has this passage of the book of Job
in his memory when he writes [Job
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#015.md). The promises of Eliphaz now
continue to rise higher, and sound more delightful and more glorious.

[Job 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 5:22</span></span>

22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh,

And from the beasts of the earth thou hast nothing to fear.

23 For thou art in league with the stones of the field,

And the beasts of the field are at peace with thee.

24 And thou knowest that peace is thy pavilion;

And thou searchest thy household, and findest nothing wanting.

25 Thou knowest also that thy seed shall be numerous,

And thy offspring as the herb of the ground.

26 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a ripe age,

As shocks of corn are brought in in their season.

27 Lo! this we have searched out, so it is:

Hear it, and give thou heed to it.

The verb שׂחק is construed ([Job 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#022).md)
with ל of that which is despised, as [Job
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#007.md), [Job
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#018.md); [Job
41:21](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#021.md) \[Hebr.\]. על־תּירא is the form
of subjective negation \[vid. Ges. 152, 1: Tr.\]: only fear thou not =
thou hast no occasion. In [Job 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#023.md),
בּריתך is the shortest substantive form for לך בּרית. The whole of
nature will be at peace with thee: the stones of the field, that they do
not injure the fertility of thy fields; the wild beasts of the field,
that they do not hurt thee and thy herds. The same promise that Hosea
([Hos 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#020).md) utters in reference to the
last days is here used individually. From this we see how deeply the
Chokma had searched into the history of Paradise and the Fall. Since
man, the appointed lord of the earth, has been tempted by a reptile, and
has fallen by a tree, his relation to nature, and its relation to him,
has been reversed: it is an incongruity, which is again as a whole put
right (שׁלום), as the false relation of man to God is put right. In [Job
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#024), שׁלום (which might also be adj..md)
is predicate: thou wilt learn (וידעתּ, praet. consec. with accented
ultima, as e.g., [Deu 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#039.md), here with
Tiphcha initiale s. anterius, which does not indicate the grammatical
tone-syllable) that thy tent is peace, i.e., in a condition of
contentment and peace on all sides. [Job
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#024.md) is to be arranged: And when thou
examinest thy household, then thou lackest nothing, goest not astray,
i.e., thou findest everything, without missing anything, in the place
where thou seekest it.

[Job 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#025.md) reminds one of the Salomonic
[Psa 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016.md). צאצאים in the Old
Testament is found only in Isaiah and the book of Job. The meaning of
the noun כּלח, which occurs only here and [Job
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#002.md), is clear. Referring to the verb
כּלח, Arabic qahila (qalhama), to be shrivelled up, very aged, it
signifies the maturity of old age, - an idea which may be gained more
easily if we connect כּלח with כּלה (to be completed), like קשׁח with
קשׁה (to be hard).

(Note: We may also compare the Arabic khl (from which comes cuhulije,
mature manhood, opp. tufulije, tender childhood).)

In the parallel there is the time of the sheaves, when they are brought
up to the high threshing-floor, the latest period of harvest. עלה, of
the raising of the sheaves to the threshing-floor, as elsewhere of the
raising, i.e., the bringing up of the animals to the altar. גּדישׁ is
here a heap of sheaves, Arab. kuds, as [Job
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#032.md) a sepulchral heap, Arab. jadat,
distinct from אלמּה, a bundle, a single sheaf.

The speech of Eliphaz, which we have broken up into nine strophes, is
now ended. Eliphaz concludes it by an epimythionic distich, [Job
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#027.md), with an emphatic nota bene. He
speaks at the same time in the name of his companions. These are
principles well proved by experience with which he confronts Job. Job
needs to lay them to heart: tu scito tibi.

All that Eliphaz says, considered in itself, is blameless. He censures
Job's vehemence, which was certainly not to be approved. He says that
the destroying judgment of God never touches the innocent, but certainly
the wicked; and at the same time expresses the same truth as that placed
as a motto to the Psalter in [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), and which is even brilliantly
confirmed in the issue of the history of Job. When we find [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md), comp. [Psa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002.md), in apparent opposition to this,
אבד הצּדּיק, it is not meant that the judgment of destruction comes upon
the righteous, but that his generation experiences the judgment of his
loss (aetati suae perit). And these are eternal truths, that between the
Creator and creature, even an angel, there remains an infinite distance,
and that no creature possesses a righteousness which it can maintain
before God. Not less true is it, that with God murmuring is death, and
that it is appointed to sinful man to pass through sorrow. Moreover, the
counsel of Eliphaz is the right counsel: I would turn to God, etc. His
beautiful concluding exhortation, so rich in promises, crowns his
speech.

It has been observed (e.g., by Lwenthal), that if it is allowed that
Eliphaz ([Job 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017)..md) expresses a
salutary spiritual design of affliction, all coherence in the book is
from the first destroyed. But in reality it is an effect producing not
only outward happiness, but also an inward holiness, which Eliphaz
ascribes to sorrow. It is therefore to be asked, how it consists with
the plan of the book. There is no doctrinal error to be discovered in
the speech of Eliphaz, and yet he cannot be considered as a
representative of the complete truth of Scripture. Job ought to humble
himself under this; but since he does not, we must side with Eliphaz.

He does not represent the complete truth of Scripture: for there are,
according to Scripture, three kinds of sufferings, which must be
carefully distinguished.

(Note: Our old dogmatists (vid., e.g., Baier, Compendium Theologiae
positivae, ii. 1, 15) and pastoral theologians (e.g., Danhauer) consider
them as separate. Among the oldest expositors of the book of Job with
which I am acquainted, Olympiodorus is comparatively the best.)

The godless one, who has fallen away from God, is visited with suffering
from God; for sin and the punishment of sin (comprehended even in the
language in עון and חטּאת) are necessarily connected as cause and
effect. This suffering of the godless is the effect of the divine
justice in punishment; it is chastisement (מוּסר) under the disposition
of wrath ([Psa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md); [Psa
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md); [Jer
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024)..md), though not yet final wrath;
it is punitive suffering (נקם, נגע, τιμωρία, poena). On the other hand,
the sufferings of the righteous flow from the divine love, to which even
all that has the appearance of wrath in this suffering must be
subservient, as the means only by which it operates: for although the
righteous man is not excepted from the weakness and sinfulness of the
human race, he can never become an object of the divine wrath, so long
as his inner life is directed towards God, and his outward life is
governed by the most earnest striving after sanctification. According to
the Old and New Testaments, he stands towards God in the relation of a
child to his father (only the New Testament idea includes the mystery of
the new birth not revealed in the Old Testament); and consequently all
sufferings are fatherly chastisements, [Deu
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#005.md); [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012.md); [Heb
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006.md), [Rev
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019), comp. Tob. 12:13 (Vulg..md). But
this general distinction between the sufferings of the righteous and of
the ungodly is not sufficient for the book of Job. The sufferings of the
righteous even are themselves manifold. God sends affliction to them
more and more to purge away the sin which still has power over them, and
rouse them up from the danger of carnal security; to maintain in them
the consciousness of sin as well as of grace, and with it the lowliness
of penitence; to render the world and its pleasures bitter as gall to
them; to draw them from the creature, and bind them to himself by prayer
and devotion. This suffering, which has the sin of the godly as its
cause, has, however, not God's wrath, but God's love directed towards
the preservation and advancement of the godly, as its motive: it is the
proper disciplinary suffering (מוּסר or תּוכחת, [Pro
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011); παιδεία, Heb 12.md). It is this of
which Paul speaks, [Co1 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032.md). This
disciplinary suffering may attain such a high degree as entirely to
overwhelm the consciousness of the relation to God by grace; and the
sufferer, as frequently in the Psalms, considers himself as one rejected
of God, over whom the wrath of God is passing. The deeper the sufferer's
consciousness of sin, the more dejected is his mood of sorrow; and still
God's thoughts concerning him are thoughts of peace, and not of evil
([Jer 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011).md). He chastens, not however
in wrath, but בּמשׁפּט, with moderation ([Jer
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024).md).

Nearly allied to this suffering, but yet, as to its cause and purpose,
distinct, is another kind of the suffering of the godly. God ordains
suffering for them, in order to prove their fidelity to himself, and
their earnestness after sanctification, especially their trust in God,
and their patience. He also permits Satan, who impeaches them, to tempt
them, to sift them as wheat, in order that he may be confounded, and the
divine choice justified, - in order that it may be manifest that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, are able to
separate them from the love of God, and to tear away their faith (אמונה)
from God, which has remained stedfast on Him, notwithstanding every
apparent manifestation of wrath. The godly will recognise his affliction
as such suffering when it comes upon him in the very midst of his
fellowship with God, his prayer and watching, and his struggling after
sanctification. For this kind of suffering - trial - Scripture employs
the expressions נסּה ([Deu 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md), [Deu
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#016).md) and בּחן ([Pro
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003).md), πειρασμός ([Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md); [Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md)., [Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019); comp. Sir. 2:1ff..md). Such
suffering, according to a common figure, is for the godly what the
smelting-furnace or the fining-pot is to precious metals. A rich reward
awaits him who is found proof against the trial, temptation, and
conflict, and comes forth from it as pure, refined gold. Suffering for
trial is nearly allied to that for chastisement, in so far as the
chastisement is at the same time trial; but distinct from it, in so far
as every trial is not also chastisement (i.e., having as its purpose the
purging away of still existing sin).

A third kind of the suffering of the righteous is testimony borne by
suffering, - reproach, persecution, and perhaps even martyrdom, which
are endured for the sake of fidelity to God and His word. While he is
blessed who is found proof against trial, he is blessed in himself who
endures this suffering ([Mat 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011.md).,
and other passages); for every other suffering comes upon man for his
own sake, this for God's. In this case there is not even the remotest
connection between the suffering and the sinfulness of the sufferer. Ps
44 is a prayer of Israel in the midst of this form of suffering. Σταυρός
is the name expressly used for it in the New Testament - suffering for
the kingdom of heaven's sake.

Without a knowledge of these different kinds of human suffering, the
book of Job cannot be understood. "Whoever sees with spiritual eyes,"
says Brentius, "does not judge the moral character of a man by his
suffering, but his suffering by his moral character." Just the want of
this spiritual discernment and inability to distinguish the different
kinds of suffering is the mistake of the friends, and likewise, from the
very first, the mistake of Eliphaz. Convinced of the sincere piety of
his friend, he came to Job believing that his suffering was a salutary
chastisement of God, which would at last turn out for his good.
Proceeding upon this assumption, he blames Job for his murmuring, and
bids him receive his affliction with a recognition of human sinfulness
and the divine purpose for good. Thus the controversy begins. The causal
connection with sin, in which Eliphaz places Job's suffering, is after
all the mildest. He does not go further than to remind Job that he is a
sinner, because he is a man.

But even this causal connection, in which Eliphaz connects Job's
sufferings, though in the most moderate way, with previous sin deserving
of punishment, is his πρώτον ψεῦδος. In the next place, Job's suffering
is indeed not chastisement, but trial. Jehovah has decreed it for His
servant, not to chasten him, but to prove him. This it is that Eliphaz
mistakes; and we also should not know it but for the prologue and the
corresponding epilogue. Accordingly, the prologue and epilogue are
organic parts of the form of the book. If these are removed, its spirit
is destroyed.

But the speech of Eliphaz, moreover, beautiful and true as it is, when
considered in itself, is nevertheless heartless, haughty, stiff, and
cold. For (1.) it does not contain a word of sympathy, and yet the
suffering which he beholds is so terribly great: his first word to his
friend after the seven days of painful silence is not one of comfort,
but of moralizing. (2.) He must know that Job's disease is not the first
and only suffering which has come upon him, and that he has endured his
previous afflictions with heroic submission; but he ignores this, and
acts as though sorrow were now first come upon Job. (3.) Instead of
recognising therein the reason of Job's despondency, that he thinks that
he has fallen from the love of God, and become an object of wrath, he
treats him as self-righteous;

(Note: Oetinger: "Eliphaz mentioned the oracle to affect seriously the
hidden hypocrisy of Job's heart.")

and to excite his feelings, presents an oracle to him, which contains
nothing but what Job might sincerely admit as true. (4.) Instead of
considering that Job's despair and murmuring against God is really of a
different kind from that of the godless, he classes them together, and
instead of gently correcting him, present to Job the accursed end of the
fool, who also murmurs against God, as he has himself seen it. Thus, in
consequence of the false application which Eliphaz makes of it, the
truth contained in his speech is totally reversed. Thus delicately and
profoundly commences the dramatical entanglement. The skill of the poet
is proved by the difficulty which the expositor has in detecting that
which is false in the speech of Eliphaz. The idea of the book does not
float on the surface. It is clothed with flesh and blood. It is
submerged in the very action and history.
