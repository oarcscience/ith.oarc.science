Battle-Cry to God against Allied Peoples

The close of this Psalm is in accord with the close of the preceding
Psalm. It is the last of the twelve Psalms of Asaph of the Psalter. The
poet supplicates help against the many nations which have allied
themselves with the descendants of Lot, i.e., Moab and Ammon, to
entirely root out Israel as a nation. Those who are fond of Maccabaean
Psalms (Hitzig and Olshausen), after the precedent of van Til and von
Bengel, find the circumstances of the time of the Psalm in 1 Macc. 5,
and Grimm is also inclined to regard this as correct; and in point of
fact the deadly hostility of the ἔθνη κυκλόθεν which we there see
breaking forth on all sides,

(Note: Concerning the υίοὶ Βαΐάν (Benı̂ Baijân), 1 Macc. 5:4, the
difficulty respecting which is to the present time unsolved, vid.,
Wetzstein's Excursus II, pp. 559f..)

as it were at a given signal, against the Jewish people, who have become
again independent, and after the dedication of the Temple doubly
self-conscious, is far better suited to explain the Psalm than the
hostile efforts of Sanballat, Tobiah, and others to hinder the
rebuilding of Jerusalem, in the time of Nehemiah (Vaihinger, Ewald, and
Dillmann). There is, however, still another incident beside that
recorded in 1 Macc. 5 to which the Psalm may be referred, viz., the
confederation of the nations for the extinction of Judah in the time of
Jehoshaphat (2 Chr. 20), and, as it seems to us, with comparatively
speaking less constraint. For the Psalm speaks of a real league, whilst
in 1 Macc. 5 the several nations made the attack without being allied
and not jointly; then, as the Psalm assumes in [Psa
83:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009.md), the sons of Lot, i.e., the
Moabites and Ammonites, actually were at the head at that time, whilst
in 1 Macc. 5 the sons of Esau occupy the most prominent place; and
thirdly, at that time, in the time of Jehoshaphat, as is recorded, an
Asaphite, viz., Jahazil, did actually interpose in the course of events,
a circumstance which coincides remarkably with the לאסף. The league of
that period consisted, according to [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md), of Moabites, Ammonites, and a
part of the מעוּנים (as it is to be read after the lxx). But [Ch2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md) (where without any doubt מאדם is
to be read instead of מארם) adds the Edomites to their number, for it is
expressly stated further on ([Ch2
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md), [Ch2
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md), [Ch2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023).md) that the inhabitants of Mount
Ser were with them. Also, supposing of course that the "Ishmaelites" and
"Hagarenes" of the Psalm may be regarded as an unfolding of the מעונים,
which is confirmed by Josephus, Antiq. ix. 1. 2; and that Gebl is to be
understood by the Mount Ser of the chronicler, which is confirmed by the
Arab. jibâl still in use at the present day, there always remains a
difficulty in the fact that the Psalm also names Amalek, Philistia,
Tyre, and Asshur, of which we find no mention there in the reign of
Jehoshaphat. But these difficulties are counter-balanced by others that
beset the reference to 1 Macc. 5, viz., that in the time of the
Seleucidae the Amalekites no longer existed, and consequently, as might
be expected, are not mentioned at all in 1 Macc. 5; further, that there
the Moabites, too, are no longer spoken of, although some formerly
Moabitish cities of Gileaditis are mentioned; and thirdly, that אשׁור =
Syria (a certainly possible usage of the word) appears in a subordinate
position, whereas it was, however, the dominant power. On the other
hand, the mention of Amalek is intelligible in connection with the
reference to 2 Chr. 20, and the absence of its express mention in the
chronicler does not make itself particularly felt in consideration of
[Gen 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012.md). Philistia, Tyre, and
Asshur, however, stand at the end in the Psalm, and might also even be
mentioned with the others if they rendered aid to the confederates of
the south-east without taking part with them in the campaign, as being a
succour to the actual leaders of the enterprise, the sons of Lot. We
therefore agree with the reference of Psalms 83 (as also of [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001).md) to the alliance of the
neighbouring nations against Judah in the reign of Jehoshaphat, which
has been already recognised by Kimchi and allowed by Keil, Hengstenberg,
and Movers.

[Psalms 83:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 83:1</span></span>

The poet prays, may God not remain an inactive looker-on in connection
with the danger of destruction that threatens His people. דּמי (with
which יהי is to be supplied) is the opposite of alertness; חרשׁ the
opposite of speaking (in connection with which it is assumed that God's
word is at the same time deed); שׁקט the opposite of being agitated and
activity. The energetic future jehemajûn gives outward emphasis to the
confirmation of the petition, and the fact that Israel's foes are the
foes of God gives inward emphasis to it. On נשׂא ראשׁ, cf. [Psa
110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md). סוד is here a secret agreement;
and יערימוּ, elsewhere to deal craftily, here signifies to craftily
plot, devise, bring a thing about. צפוּניך is to be understood according
to [Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md); [Psa
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021.md). The Hithpa. התיעץ alternates
here with the more ancient Niph. ([Psa
83:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006).md). The design of the enemies in
this instance has reference to the total extirpation of Israel, of the
separatist-people who exclude themselves from the life of the world and
condemn it. מגּוי, from being a people = so that it may no longer be a
people or nation, as in [Isa 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md); [Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md); [Isa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002.md); [Jer
48:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#042.md). In the borrowed passage, [Jer
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002.md), by an interchange of a letter it
is נכריתנּה. This Asaph Psalm is to be discerned in not a few passages
of the prophets; cf. [Isa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md). with
[Psa 83:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#002.md), [Isa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012.md) with [Psa
83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 83:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 83:5</span></span>

Instead of לב אחד, [Ch1 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#038.md), it is
deliberant corde unâ, inasmuch as יחדּו on the one hand gives intensity
to the reciprocal signification of the verb, and on the other lends the
adjectival notion to לב. Of the confederate peoples the chronicler (2
Chr. 20) mentions the Moabites, the Ammonites, the inhabitants of Mount
Ser, and the Me(unim, instead of which Josephus, Antiq. ix. 1. 2, says:
a great body of Arabians. This crowd of peoples comes from the other
side of the Dead Sea, מאדם (as it is to be read in [Psa
83:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#002.md) in the chronicler instead of
מארם, cf. on [Psa 60:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002).md); the territory
of Edom, which is mentioned first by the poet, was therefore the
rendezvous. The tents of Edom and of the Ishmaelites are (cf. Arab. ahl,
people) the people themselves who live in tents. Moreover, too, the poet
ranges the hostile nations according to their geographical position. The
seven first named from Edom to Amalek, which still existed at the time
of the psalmist (for the final destruction of the Amalekites by the
Simeonites, [Ch1 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#042.md)., falls at an
indeterminate period prior to the Exile), are those out of the regions
east and south-east of the Dead Sea. According to [Gen
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#018.md), the Ishmaelites had spread from
Higz through the peninsula of Sinai beyond the eastern and southern
deserts as far up as the countries under the dominion of Assyria. The
Hagarenes dwelt in tents from the Persian Gulf as far as the east of
Gilead ([Ch1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010).md) towards the
Euphrates. גּבל, Arab. jbâl, is the name of the people inhabiting the
mountains situated in the south of the Dead Sea, that is to say, the
northern Seritish mountains. Both Gebl and also, as it appears, the
Amalek intended here according to [Gen
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012.md) (cf. Josephus, Antiq. ii. 1. 2:
Ἀμαληκῖτις, a part of Idumaea), belong to the wide circuit of Edom. Then
follow the Philistines and Phoenicians, the two nations of the coast of
the Mediterranean, which also appear in [Amo
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001) (cf. Joel 3.md) as making common
cause with the Edomites against Israel. Finally Asshur, the nation of
the distant north-east, here not as yet appearing as a principal power,
but strengthening (vid., concerning זרוע, an arm = assistance, succour,
Gesenius, Thesaurus, p. 433b) the sons of Lot, i.e., the Moabites and
Ammonites, with whom the enterprise started, and forming a powerful
reserve for them. The music bursts forth angrily at the close of this
enumeration, and imprecations discharge themselves in the following
strophe.

[Psalms 83:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 83:9</span></span>

With כּמדין reference is made to Gideon's victory over the Midianites,
which belongs to the most glorious recollections of Israel, and to which
in other instances, too, national hopes are attached, [Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003.md) \[4\], [Isa
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026.md), cf. [Hab
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#007.md); and with the asyndeton כּסיסרא
כיבין (כּסיסרא, as Norzi states, who does not rightly understand the
placing of the Metheg) to the victory of Barak and Deborah over Sisera
and the Canaanitish king Jabin, whose general he was. The Beth of בּנחל
is like the Beth of בּדּרך in [Psa
110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md) : according to [Jdg
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021.md) the Kishon carried away the
corpses of the slain army. ‛Endôr, near Tabor, and therefore situated
not far distant from Taanach and Megiddo ([Jdg
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019).md), belonged to the battle-field.
אדמה, starting from the radical notion of that which flatly covers
anything, which lies in דם, signifying the covering of earth lying flat
over the globe, therefore humus (like ארץ, terra, and תבל, tellus), is
here (cf. [Kg2 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#037).md) in accord with
דּמן (from דמן), which is in substance akin to it. In [Psa
83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012.md) we have a retrospective glance
at Gideon's victory. ‛Oreb and Zeēb were שׂרים of the Midianites, [Jdg
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025.md); Zebach and Tsalmunna‛, their
kings, [Jdg 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#005.md).

(Note: The Syriac Hexapla has ([Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014).md) צלמנע instead of שׁלמן, a
substitution which is accepted by Geiger, Deutsch. Morgenlnd. Zeitschr.
1862, S. 729f. Concerning the signification of the above names of
Midianitish princes, vid., Nldeke, Ueber die Amalekiter, S. 9.)

The pronoun precedes the word itself in שׁיתמו, as in [Exo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006); the heaped-up suffixes ēmo (êmo.md)
give to the imprecation a rhythm and sound as of rolling thunder.
Concerning נסיך, vid., on [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md). So
far as the matter is concerned, [Ch2
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#011.md) harmonizes with [Psa
83:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013.md). Canaan, the land which is God's
and which He has given to His people, is called נאות אלהים (cf. [Psa
74:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#020).md).

[Psalms 83:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 83:13</span></span>

With the אלהי, which constrains God in faith, the "thundering down"
begins afresh. גּלגּל signifies a wheel and a whirling motion, such as
usually arises when the wind changes suddenly, then also whatever is
driven about in the whirling, [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013.md).

(Note: Saadia, who renders the גּלגּל in [Psa
77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019.md) as an astronomical expression
with Arab. 'l-frk, the sphere of the heavens, here has professedly Arab.
kâlgrâblt, which would be a plural from expanded out of Arab. grâbı̂l,
"sieves" or "tambourines;" it is, however, to be read, as in [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013.md), Codex Oxon., Arab. kâlgirbâlt.
The verb Arab. garbala, "to sift," is transferred to the wind, e.g., in
Mutanabbi (edited with Wahidi's commentary by Dieterici), p. 29, l. 5
and 6: "it is as though the dust of this region, when the winds chase
one another therein, were sifted," Arab. mugarbalu (i.e., caught up and
whirled round); and with other notional and constructional applications
in Makkarı̂, i. p. 102, l. 18: "it is as though its soil had been
cleansed from dust by sifting," Arab. gurbilat (i.e., the dust thereof
swept away by a whirlwind). Accordingly Arab. girbâlat signifies first,
as a nom. vicis, a whirling about (of dust by the wind), then in a
concrete sense a whirlwind, as Saadia uses it, inasmuch as he makes use
of it twice for גּלגּל. So Fleischer in opposition to Ewald, who renders
"like the sweepings or rubbish.")

קשׁ (from קשׁשׁ, Arab. qšš, aridum esse) is the cry corn-talks, whether
as left standing or, as in this instance, as straw upon the
threshing-floor or upon the field. Like a fire that spreads rapidly,
laying hold of everything, which burns up the forest and singes off the
wooded mountain so that only a bare cone is left standing, so is God to
drive them before Him in the raging tempest of His wrath and take them
unawares. The figure in [Psa 83:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#015.md) is
fully worked up by Isaiah, [Isa
10:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md); לחט as in [Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022.md). In the apodosis, [Psa
83:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016.md), the figure is changed into a
kindred one: wrath is a glowing heat (חרון) and a breath (נשׁמה, [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033).md) at the same time. In [Psa
83:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#017.md) it becomes clear what is the
final purpose towards which this language of cursing tends: to the end
that all, whether willingly or reluctantly, may give the glory to the
God of revelation. Directed towards this end the earnest prayer is
repeated once more in the tetrastichic closing strain.

[Psalms 83:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 83:17</span></span>

The aim of the wish is that they in the midst of their downfall may lay
hold upon the mercy of Jahve as their only deliverance: first they must
come to nought, and only by giving Jahve the glory will they not be
utterly destroyed. Side by side with אתּה, v. 19a, is placed שׁמך as a
second subject (cf. [Psa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md); [Psa
69:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011).md). In view of [Psa
83:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#017.md) וידעוּ (as in [Psa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014).md) has not merely the sense of
perceiving so far as the justice of the punishment is concerned; the
knowledge which is unto salvation is not excluded. The end of the matter
which the poet wishes to see brought about is this, that Jahve, that the
God of revelation (שׁמך), may become the All-exalted One in the
consciousness of the nations.
