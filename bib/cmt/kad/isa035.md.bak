### [Isaiah Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 35:1</span></span>

Edom falls, never to rise again. Its land is turned into a horrible
wilderness. But, on the other hand, the wilderness through which the
redeemed Israel returns, is changed into a flowery field. "Gladness
fills the desert and the heath; and the steppe rejoices, and flowers
like the crocus. It flowers abundantly, and rejoices; yea, rejoicing and
singing: the glory of Lebanon is given to it, the splendour of Carmel
and the plain of Sharon; they will see the glory of Jehovah, the
splendour of our God." מדבּר ישׂשׂוּם (to be accentuated with tiphchah
munach, not with mercha tiphchah) has been correctly explained by
Aben-Ezra. The original Nun has been assimilated to the following Mem,
just as pidyōn in [Num 3:49](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#049.md) is
afterwards written pidyōm (Ewald, 91, b). The explanation given by
Rashi, Gesenius, and others (laetabuntur his), is untenable, if only
because sūs (sı̄s) cannot be construed with the accusative of the object
(see at [Isa 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006).md); and to get rid of
the form by correction, as Olshausen proposes, is all the more
objectionable, because "the old full plural in ūn is very frequently met
with before Mem" (Bttcher), in which case it may have been pronounced as
it is written here.

(Note: Bttcher calls ûm the oldest primitive form of the plural; but it
is only a strengthening of ûn; cf., tannı̄m = tannı̄n, Hanameel =
Hananeel, and such Sept. forms as Gesem, Madiam, etc. (see Hitzig on
[Jer 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007).md). Wetzstein told me of a
Bedouin tribe, in whose dialect the third pers. praet. regularly ended
in m, e.g., akalum (they have eaten).)

According to the Targum on [Sol 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)
(also Saad., Abulw.), the chăbhatstseleth is the narcissus; whilst the
Targum on the passage before us leaves it indefinite - sicut lilia. The
name (a derivative of bâtsal) points to a bulbous plant, probably the
crocus and primrose, which were classed together.

(Note: The crocus and the primrose (המצליתא in Syriac) may really be
easily confounded, but not the narcissus and primrose, which have
nothing in common except that they are bulbous plants, like most of the
flowers of the East, which shoot up rapidly in the spring, as soon as
the winter rains are over. But there are other colchicaceae beside our
colchicum autumnale, which flowers before the leaves appear and is
therefore called filius ante patrem (e.g., the eastern colchicum
variegatum).)

The sandy steppe would become like a lovely variegated plain covered
with meadow flowers.

(Note: Layard, in his Nineveh and Babylon, describes in several places
the enchantingly beautiful and spring-like variation of colours which
occurs in the Mesopotamian "desert;" though what the prophet had in his
mind was not the real midâr, or desert of pasture land, but, as the
words tsiyâh and ‛arâbhâh show, the utterly barren sandy desert.)

On gı̄lath, see at [Isa 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006.md) (cf., [Isa
65:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#018).md): the infin. noun takes the
place of an inf. abs., which expresses the abstract verbal idea, though
in a more rigid manner; 'aph (like gam in [Gen
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#015.md); [Gen
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#004).md) is an exponent of the increased
emphasis already implied in the gerunds that come after. So joyful and
so gloriously adorned will the barren desert, which has been hitherto so
mournful, become, on account of the great things that are in store for
it. Lebanon, Carmel, and Sharon have, as it were, shared their splendour
with the desert, that all might be clothed alike in festal dress, when
the glory of Jehovah, which surpasses everything self in its splendour,
should appear; that glory which they would not only be privileged to
behold, but of which they would be honoured to be the actual scene.

[Isaiah 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 35:3</span></span>

The prophet now exclaims to the afflicted church, in language of unmixed
consolation, that Jehovah is coming. "Strengthen ye the weak hands, and
make the trembling knees strong! Say to those of a terrified heart, Be
strong! Fear ye not! Behold, your God will come for vengeance, for a
divine retribution: He will come, and bring you salvation." Those who
have become weak in faith, hopeless and despairing, are to cheer up; and
the stronger are to tell such of their brethren as are perplexed and
timid, to be comforted now: for Jehovah is coming nâqâm (i.e., as
vengeance), and gemūl 'Elōhı̄m (i.e., as retribution, such as God the
highly exalted and Almighty Judge inflicts; the expression is similar to
that in [Isa 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md); [Isa
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md), cf., [Isa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010.md), but a bolder one; the words in
apposition stand as abbreviations of final clauses). The infliction of
punishment is the immediate object of His coming, but the ultimate
object is the salvation of His people (וישעכם a contracted future form,
which is generally confined to the aorist).

[Isaiah 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 35:5</span></span>

"Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf
unstopped. Then will the lame man leap as the stag, and the tongue of
the dumb man shout; for waters break out in the desert, and brooks in
the steppe. And the mirage becomes a fish-pond, and the thirsty ground
gushing water-springs; in the place of jackals, where it lies, there
springs up grass with reeds and rushes." The bodily defects mentioned
here there is no reason for regarding as figurative representations of
spiritual defects. The healing of bodily defects, however, is merely the
outer side of what is actually effected by the coming of Jehovah (for
the other side, comp. [Isa 32:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#003).md).
And so, also, the change of the desert into a field abounding with water
is not a mere poetical ornament; for in the last times, he era of
redemption, nature itself will really share in the doxa which proceeds
from the manifested God to His redeemed. Shârâb (Arab. sarâb) is
essentially the same thing as that which we call in the western
languages the mirage, or Fata morgana; not indeed every variety of this
phenomenon of the refraction of light, through strata of air of varying
density lying one above another, but more especially that appearance of
water, which is produced as if by magic in the dry, sandy desert

(Note: See. G. Rawlinson, Monarchies, i. p. 38.)

(literally perhaps the "desert shine," just as we speak of the "Alpine
glow;" see [Isa 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010).md). The antithesis
to this is 'ăgam (Chald. 'agmâ', Syr. egmo, Ar. agam), a fish-pond (as
in [Isa 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018.md), different from 'âgâm in
[Isa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#010).md). In the arid sandy desert,
where the jackal once had her lair and suckled her young (this is,
according to [Lam 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md), the true
explanation of the permutative ribhtsâh, for which ribhtsâm would be in
some respects more suitable), grass springs up even into reeds and
rushes; so that, as [Isa 43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md)
affirms, the wild beasts of the desert praise Jehovah.

[Isaiah 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 35:8</span></span>

In the midst of such miracles, by which all nature is glorified, the
people of Jehovah are redeemed, and led home to Zion. "And a highway
rises there, and a road, and it will be called the Holy Road; no unclean
man will pass along it, as it is appointed for them: whoever walks the
road, even simple ones do not go astray. There will be no lion there,
and the most ravenous beast of prey will not approach it, will not be
met with there; and redeemed ones walk. And the ransomed of Jehovah will
return, and come to Zion with shouting, and everlasting joy upon their
head: they lay hold of gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing flee
away." Not only unclean persons from among the heathen, but even unclean
persons belonging to Israel itself, will never pass along that holy
road; none but the church purified and sanctified through sufferings,
and those connected with it. למו הוּא, to them, and to them alone, does
this road belong, which Jehovah has made and secured, and which so
readily strikes the eye, that even an idiot could not miss it; whilst it
lies to high, that no beast of prey, however powerful (perı̄ts chayyōth,
a superlative verbal noun: Ewald, 313, c), could possibly leap up to it:
not one is ever encountered by the pilgrim there. The pilgrims are those
whom Jehovah has redeemed and delivered, or set free from captivity and
affliction (גּאל, לג, related to חל, solvere; פּדה, פד, scindere,
abscindere). Everlasting joy soars above their head; they lay fast hold
of delight and joy (compare on [Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008).md), so that it never departs from
them. On the other hand, sorrow and sighing flee away. The whole of [Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md) is like a mosaic from [Isa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011.md); [Isa
61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007.md); [Isa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003.md); and what is affirmed of the holy
road, is also affirmed in [Isa 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md) of
the holy city (compare [Isa 62:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012.md);
[Isa 63:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#004).md). A prelude of the
fulfilment is seen in what Ezra speaks of with gratitude to God in [Ezr
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031.md). We have intentionally avoided
crowding together the parallel passages from chapters 40-66. The whole
chapter is, in every part, both in thought and language, a prelude of
that book of consolation for the exiles in their captivity. Not only in
its spiritual New Testament thoughts, but also in its ethereal language,
soaring high as it does in majestic softness and light, the prophecy has
now reached the highest point of its development.
