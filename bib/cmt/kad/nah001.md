### [Nahum Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

Judgment upon Nineveh Decreed by God - [Nah
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

Jehovah, the jealous God and avenger of evil, before whose manifestation
of wrath the globe trembles ([Nah
1:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002).md), will prove Himself a strong
tower to His own people by destroying Nineveh ([Nah
1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007).md), since He has determined to
break the yoke which Asshur has laid upon Judah, and to destroy this
enemy of His people ([Nah 1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012).md).

[Nahum 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 1:1</span></span>

The heading runs thus: "Burden concerning Nineveh; book of the prophecy
of Nahum of Elkosh." The first sentence gives the substance and object,
the second the form and author, of the proclamation which follows. משּׂא
signifies a burden, from נשׂא, to lift up, to carry, to heave. This
meaning has very properly been retained by Jonathan, Aquila, Jerome,
Luther, and others, in the headings to the prophetic oracle. Jerome
observes on [Hab 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md) : "Massa never
occurs in the title, except when it is evidently grave and full of
weight and labour." On the other hand, the lxx have generally rendered
it λῆμμα in the headings to the oracles, or even ὅρασις, ὅραμα, ῥῆμα
(Isaiah 13ff., [Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006).md); and most of
the modern commentators since Cocceius and Vitringa, following this
example, have attributed to the word the meaning of "utterance," and
derived it from נשׂא, effari. But נשׂא has no more this meaning than
נשׂא קול can mean to utter the voice, either in [Exo
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md) and [Exo
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md), to which Hupfeld appeals in
support of it, or in [Kg2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025.md), to
which others appeal. The same may be said of משּׂא, which never means
effatum, utterance, and is never placed before simple announcements of
salvation, but only before oracles of a threatening nature. [Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md) and [Zac
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) form no exception to this rule.
Delitzsch (on [Isa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md) observes,
with regard to the latter passage, that the promise has at least a dark
foil, and in Nahum 9:1ff. the heathen nations of the Persian and
Macedonian world-monarchy are threatened with a divine judgment which
will break in pieces their imperial glory, and through which they are to
be brought to conversion to Jehovah; "and it is just in this that the
burden consists, which the word of God lays upon these nations, that
they may be brought to conversion through such a judgment from God"
(Kliefoth). Even in [Pro 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md) and [Pro
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md) Massâ' does not mean utterance.
The words of Agur in [Pro 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md) are a
heavy burden, which is rolled upon the natural and conceited reason;
they are punitive in their character, reproving human forwardness in the
strongest terms; and in [Pro 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md)
Massâ' is the discourse with which king Lemuel reproved his mother. For
the thorough vindication of this meaning of Massâ', by an exposition of
all the passages which have been adduced in support of the rendering
"utterance," see Hengstenberg, Christology, on [Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md), and O. Strauss on this passage.
For Nineveh, see the comm. on [Jon
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002.md). The burden, i.e., the threatening
words, concerning Nineveh are defined in the second clause as sēpher
châzōn, book of the seeing (or of the seen) of Nahum, i.e., of that
which Nahum saw in spirit and prophesied concerning Nineveh. The unusual
combination of sēpher and châzōn, which only occurs here, is probably
intended to show that Nahum simply committed his prophecy concerning
Nineveh to writing, and did not first of all announce it orally before
the people. On hâ'elqōshı̄ (the Elkoshite), see the Introduction.

[Nahum 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">nah 1:2</span></span>

The description of the divine justice, and its judicial manifestation on
the earth, with which Nahum introduces his prophecy concerning Nineveh,
has this double object: first of all, to indicate the connection between
the destruction of the capital of the Assyrian empire, which is about to
be predicted, and the divine purpose of salvation; and secondly, to cut
off at the very outset all doubt as to the realization of this judgment.
[Nah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002.md). "A God jealous and taking
vengeance is Jehovah; an avenger is Jehovah, and Lord of wrathful fury;
an avenger is Jehovah to His adversaries, and He is One keeping wrath to
His enemies. [Nah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md). Jehovah is
long-suffering and of great strength, and He does not acquit of guilt.
Jehovah, His way is in the storm and in the tempest, and clouds are the
dust of His feet." The prophecy commences with the words with which God
expresses the energetic character of His holiness in the decalogue ([Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md), cf. [Exo
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#014.md); [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Deu
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#009.md); and [Jos
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#019).md), where we find the form קנּוא
for קנּא. Jehovah is a jealous God, who turns the burning zeal of His
wrath against them that hate Him ([Deu
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#015).md). His side of the energy of the
divine zeal predominates here, as the following predicate, the
three-times repeated נקם, clearly shows. The strengthening of the idea
of nōqēm involved in the repetition of it three times (cf. [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md); [Jer
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#029).md), is increased still further by
the apposition ba'al chēmâh, possessor of the wrathful heat, equivalent
to the wrathful God (cf. [Pro 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022.md);
[Pro 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024).md). The vengeance applies to
His adversaries, towards whom He bears ill-will. Nâtar, when predicated
of God, as in [Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md) and [Psa
103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009.md), signifies to keep or bear
wrath. God does not indeed punish immediately; He is long-suffering (ארך
אפּים, [Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md); [Num
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#018), etc..md). His long-suffering is
not weak indulgence, however, but an emanation from His love and mercy;
for He is gedōl-kōăch, great in strength ([Num
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#017).md), and does not leave unpunished
(נקּה וגו after [Exo 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md) and [Num
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#018.md); see at [Exo
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007).md). His great might to punish
sinners, He has preserved from of old; His way is in the storm and
tempest. With these words Nahum passes over to a description of the
manifestations of divine wrath upon sinners in great national judgments
which shake the world (שׂערה as in [Job
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#017.md) = סערה, which is connected with
סוּפה in [Isa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md) and [Psa
83:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016).md). These and similar descriptions
are founded upon the revelations of God, when bringing Israel out of
Egypt, and at the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai, when the Lord
came down upon the mountain in clouds, fire, and vapour of smoke ([Exo
19:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016).md). Clouds are the dust of His
feet. The Lord comes down from heaven in the clouds. As man goes upon
the dust, so Jehovah goes upon the clouds.

[Nahum 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">nah 1:4</span></span>

"He threateneth the sea, and drieth it up, and maketh all the rivers dry
up. Bashan and Carmel fade, and the blossom of Lebanon fadeth. [Nah
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005.md). Mountains shake before Him, and
the hills melt away; the earth heaveth before Him, and the globe, and
all the inhabitants thereon. [Nah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006.md).
Before His fury who may stand? and who rise up at the burning of His
wrath? His burning heat poureth itself out like fire, and the rocks are
rent in pieces by Him." In the rebuking of the sea there is an allusion
to the drying up of the Red Sea for the Israelites to pass through (cf.
[Psa 106:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#009).md); but it is generalized
here, and extended to every sea and river, which the Almighty can smite
in His wrath, and cause to dry up. ויּבּשׁהוּ for וייבּשׁהוּ, the
vowelless י of the third pers. being fused into one with the first
radical sound, as in ויּדּוּ in [Lam
3:53](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#053.md) (cf. Ges. 69, Anm. 6, and Ewald
232-3). Bashan, Carmel, and Lebanon are mentioned as very fruitful
districts, abounding in a vigorous growth of vegetation and large
forests, the productions of which God could suddenly cause to fade and
wither in His wrath. Yea more: the mountains tremble and the hills melt
away (compare the similar description in [Mic
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#004), and the explanation given there.md).
The earth lifts itself, i.e., starts up from its place (cf. [Isa
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#013).md), with everything that dwells
upon the surface of the globe. תּשּׂא from נשׂא, used intransitively,
"to rise," as in [Psa 89:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010.md) and [Hos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md); not conclamat s. tollit vocem
(J. H. Michaelis, Burk, Strauss). תּבל, lit., the fertile globe, always
signifies the whole of the habitable earth, ἡ οἰκουμένη; and יושׁבי בהּ,
not merely the men (Ewald), but all living creatures (cf. [Joe
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#018.md), [Joe
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020).md). No one can stand before such
divine wrath, which pours out like consuming fire ([Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024).md), and rends rocks in pieces ([Kg1
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011.md); [Jer
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md); cf. [Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010.md); [Mal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002).md).

[Nahum 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">nah 1:7</span></span>

But the wrath of God does not fall upon those who trust in the Lord; it
only falls upon His enemies. With this turn Nahum prepares the way in
[Nah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007.md). for proclaiming the judgment
of wrath upon Nineveh. [Nah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007.md). "Good
is Jehovah, a refuge in the day of trouble; and He knoweth those who
trust in Him. [Nah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md). And with an
overwhelming flood will He make an end of her place, and pursue His
enemies into darkness." Even in the manifestation of His wrath God
proves His goodness; for the judgment, by exterminating the wicked,
brings deliverance to the righteous who trust in the Lord, out of the
affliction prepared for them by the wickedness of the world. The
predicate טוב is more precisely defined by the apposition למעוז וגו, for
a refuge = a refuge in time of trouble. The goodness of the Lord is seen
in the fact that He is a refuge in distress. The last clause says to
whom: viz., to those who trust in Him. They are known by Him. "To know
is just the same as not to neglect; or, expressed in a positive form,
the care or providence of God in the preservation of the faithful"
(Calvin). For the fact, compare [Psa
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#009.md); [Psa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002.md); [Jer
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019.md). And because the Lord is a
refuge to His people, He will put an end to the oppressor of His people,
viz., Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian empire, and that with an
overwhelming flood. Sheteph, overwhelming, is a figure denoting the
judgment sweeping over a land or kingdom, through the invasion of
hostile armies (cf. [Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md); [Dan
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#026.md), [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md). עבר, overflowed by a river
(cf. [Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md); [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md); [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md). עשׂה כלה, to put an end to
anything, as in [Isa 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md). מקומהּ is
the accusative of the object: make her place a vanishing one. כּלה, the
fem. of כּלה, an adjective in a neuter sense, that which is vanishing
away. The suffix in מקומהּ refers to Nineveh in the heading ([Nah
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001).md): either Nineveh personified as a
queen ([Nah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#007.md); [Nah
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#004).md), is distinguished from her seat
(Hitzig); or what is much more simple, the city itself is meant, and
"her place" is to be understood in this sense, that with the destruction
of the city even the place where it stood would cease to be the site of
a city, with which March aptly compares the phrase, "its place knoweth
man no more" ([Job 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#010.md); [Job
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#018.md); [Job
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#009).md). איביו are the inhabitants of
Nineveh, or the Assyrians generally, as the enemies of Israel.
ירדּף־חשׁך, not darkness will pursue its enemies; for this view is
irreconcilable with the makkeph: but to pursue with darkness, chōshekh
being an accusative either of place or of more precise definition, used
in an instrumental sense. The former is the simpler view, and answers
better to the parallelism of the clauses. As the city is to vanish and
leave no trace behind, so shall its inhabitants perish in darkness.

[Nahum 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">nah 1:9</span></span>

The reason for all this is assigned in [Nah
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md). [Nah
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md). "What think ye of Jehovah? He
makes an end; the affliction will not arise twice. [Nah
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010.md). For though they be twisted
together like thorns, and as if intoxicated with their wine, they shall
be devoured like dry stubble. [Nah
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011.md). From thee has one come out, who
meditated evil against Jehovah, who advised worthlessness." The question
in [Nah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md) is not addressed to the
enemy, viz., the Assyrians, as very many commentators suppose: "What do
ye meditate against Jehovah?" For although châshabh 'el is used in [Hos
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#015.md) for a hostile device with regard
to Jehovah, the supposition that 'el is used here for ‛al, according to
a later usage of the language, is precluded by the fact that חשׁב על is
actually used in this sense in [Nah
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011.md). Moreover, the last clause does
not suit this view of the question. The word, "the affliction will not
stand up, or not rise up a second time," cannot refer to the Assyrians,
or mean that the infliction of a second judgment upon Nineveh will be
unnecessary, because the city will utterly fall to the ground in the
first judgment, and completely vanish from the earth (Hitzig). For צרה
points back to בּיום צרה, and therefore must be the calamity which has
fallen upon Judah, or upon those who trust in the Lord, on the part of
Nineveh or Asshur (Marck, Maurer, and Strauss). This is confirmed by
[Nah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011.md) and [Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md), where this thought is definitely
expressed. Consequently the question, "What think ye with regard to
Jehovah?" can only be addressed to the Judaeans, and must mean, "Do ye
think that Jehovah cannot or will not fulfil His threat upon Nineveh?"
(Cyr., Marck, Strauss). The prophet addresses these words to the anxious
minds, which were afraid of fresh invasions on the part of the
Assyrians. To strengthen their confidence, he answers the question
proposed, by repeating the thought expressed in [Nah
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008). He (Jehovah.md) is making an end,
sc. of the enemy of His people; and he gives a further reason for this
in [Nah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010.md). The participial clauses
עד סירים to סבוּאים are to be taken conditionally: are (or were) they
even twisted like thorns. עד סירים, to thorns = as thorns (עד is given
correctly by J. H. Michaelis: eo usque ut spinas perplexitate aequent;
compare Ewald, 219). The comparison of the enemy to thorns expresses
"firmatum callidumque nocendi studium" (Marck), and has been well
explained by Ewald thus: "crisp, crafty, and cunning; so that one would
rather not go near them, or have anything to do with them" (cf. [Sa2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006.md) and [Mic
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004).md). כּסבאם סבוּאים, not "wetted like
their wet" (Hitzig), nor "as it were drowned in wine, so that fire can
do no more harm to them than to anything else that is wet" (Ewald); for
סבא neither means to wet nor to drown, but to drink, to carouse; and
סבוּא means drunken, intoxicated. סבא is strong unmixed wine (see
Delitzsch on [Isa 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022).md). "Their wine"
is the wine which they are accustomed to drink. The simile expresses the
audacity and hardiness with which the Assyrians regarded themselves as
invincible, and applies very well to the gluttony and revelry which
prevailed at the Assyrian court; even if the account given by Diod. Sic.
(ii. 26), that when Sardanapalus had three times defeated the enemy
besieging Nineveh, in his great confidence in his own good fortune, he
ordered a drinking carousal, in the midst of which the enemy, who had
been made acquainted with the fact, made a fresh attack, and conquered
Nineveh, rests upon a legendary dressing up of the facts. אכּלוּ,
devoured by fire, is a figure signifying utter destruction; and the
perfect is prophetic, denoting what will certainly take place. Like dry
stubble: cf. [Isa 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md); [Isa
47:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#014.md), and [Joe
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#005.md). מלא is not to be taken, as Ewald
supposes (279, a), as strengthening יבשׁ, "fully dry," but is to be
connected with the verb adverbially, and is simply placed at the end of
the sentence for the sake of emphasis (Ges., Maurer, and Strauss). This
will be the end of the Assyrians, because he who meditates evil against
Jehovah has come forth out of Nineveh. In ממּך Nineveh is addressed, the
representative of the imperial power of Assyria, which set itself to
destroy the Israelitish kingdom of God. It might indeed be objected to
this explanation of the verse, that the words in [Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012.md) and [Nah
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#013.md) are addressed to Zion or Judah,
whereas Nineveh or Asshur is spoken of both in what precedes ([Nah
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md) and [Nah
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010).md) and in what follows ([Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012).md) in the third person. On this
ground Hoelem. and Strauss refer ממּך also to Judah, and adopt this
explanation: "from thee (Judah) will the enemy who has hitherto
oppressed thee have gone away" (taking יצא as fut. exact., and יצא מן as
in [Isa 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#017).md). But this view does not
suit the context. After the utter destruction of the enemy has been
predicted in [Nah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010.md), we do not
expect to find the statement that it will have gone away from Judah,
especially as there is nothing said in what precedes about any invasion
of Judah. The meditation of evil against Jehovah refers to the design of
the Assyrian conquerors to destroy the kingdom of God in Israel, as the
Assyrian himself declares in the blasphemous words which Isaiah puts
into the mouth of Rabshakeh ([Isa
36:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#014).md), to show the wicked pride of
the enemy. This address merely expresses the feeling cherished at all
times by the power of the world towards the kingdom of God. It is in the
plans devised for carrying this feeling into action that the יעץ
בּליּעל, the advising of worthlessness, consists. This is the only
meaning that בּליּעל has, not that of destruction.

[Nahum 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">nah 1:12</span></span>

The power of Nineveh will be destroyed, to break the yoke laid upon
Judah. [Nah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012.md). "Thus saith Jehovah,
Though they be unconsumed, and therefore numerous, yet are they thus
mowed down, and have passed away. I have bowed thee down, I will bow
thee down no more. [Nah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#013.md). And now
shall I break his yoke from off thee, and break thy fetters in pieces.
[Nah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014.md). And Jehovah hath given
commandment concerning thee, no more of thy name will be sown: from the
house of thy God I cut off graven image and molten work: I prepare thy
grave; for thou art found light." To confirm the threat expressed in
[Nah 1:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md), Nahum explains the divine
purpose more fully. Jehovah hath spoken: the completeness and strength
of her army will be of no help to Nineveh. It is mowed down, because
Judah is to be delivered from its oppressor. The words שׁלמים to ועבר
refer to the enemy, the warlike hosts of Nineveh, which are to be
destroyed notwithstanding their great and full number. Shâlēm, integer,
with strength undiminished, both outwardly and inwardly, i.e., both
numerous and strong. וכן רבּים, and so, i.e., of such a nature, just
because they are of full number, or numerous. וכן נגוזּוּ, and so, i.e.,
although of such a nature, they will nevertheless be mowed down. גּזז,
taken from the mowing of the meadows, is a figure denoting complete
destruction. ועבר is not impersonal, actum est, sc. de iis, but
signifies it is away, or has vanished. The singular is used with special
emphasis, the numerous army being all embraced in the unity of one man:
"he paints the whole people as vanishing away, just as if one little man
were carried off" (Strauss). With וענּתך the address turns to Judah. The
words are not applicable to the Assyrians, to whom Abarbanel, Grotius,
Ewald, and Hitzig refer this clause; for Asshur is not only bowed down
or chastened, but utterly destroyed. ענּתך refers to the oppression
which Judah had suffered from the Assyrians in the time of Ahaz and
Hezekiah. This shall not be repeated, as has already been promised in
[Nah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md). For now will the Lord break
the yoke which this enemy has laid upon Judah. ועתּה, but now, is
attached adversatively to ענּתך. The suffix to מטהוּ refers to the
enemy, which has its seat in Nineveh. For the figure of the yoke, cf.
[Lev 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013.md); [Jer
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002.md); [Jer
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010.md); [Eze
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#027.md), etc.; and for the fact itself,
[Isa 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027.md). The words do not refer to
the people of the ten tribes, who were pining like slaves in exile
(Hitzig); for Nahum makes no allusion to them at all, but to Judah (cf.
[Nah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015).md), upon whom the Assyrians
had laid the yoke of tribute from the time of Ahaz. This was first of
all shaken off in the reign of Hezekiah, through the overthrow of
Sennacherib; but it was not yet completely broken, so long as there was
a possibility that Assyria might rise again with new power, as in fact
it did in the reign of Manasseh, when Assyrian generals invaded Judah
and carried off this king to Babylon ([Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011).md). It was only broken when the
Assyrian power was overthrown through the conquest and destruction of
Nineveh. This view, which is required by the futures 'eshbōr and
'ănattēq, is confirmed by [Nah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014.md),
for there the utter extermination of Assyria is clearly expressed.
Vetsivvâh is not a perfect with Vav rel.; but the Vav is a simple
copula: "and (= for) Jehovah has commanded." The perfect refers to the
divine purpose, which has already been formed, even though its execution
is still in the future. This purpose runs thus: "Of thy seed shall no
more be sown, i.e., thou wilt have no more descendants" ("the people and
name are to become extinct," Strauss; cf. [Isa
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#020).md). It is not the king of Assyria
who is here addressed, but the Assyrian power personified as a single
man, as we may see from what follows, according to which the idols are
to be rooted out along with the seed from the house of God, i.e., out of
the idol temples (cf. [Isa 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038.md); [Isa
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#013).md). Pesel and massēkhâh are
combined, as in [Deu 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015.md), to denote
every kind of idolatrous image. For the idolatry of Assyria, see
Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, ii. p. 439ff. אשׂים קברך cannot mean,
"I make the temple of thy god into a grave," although this meaning has
already been expressed in the Chaldee and Syriac; and the Masoretic
accentuation, which connects the words with what precedes, is also
founded upon this view. If an object had to be supplied to אשׂים from
the context, it must be pesel ūmassēkhâh; but there would be no sense in
"I make thine idol into a grave." There is no other course left,
therefore, than to take קברך as the nearest and only object to אשׂים, "I
lay, i.e., prepare thy grave," כּי קלּות, because, when weighed
according to thy moral worth ([Job
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#006).md), thou hast been found light (cf.
[Dan 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#027).md). Hence the widespread
opinion, that the murder of Sennacherib ([Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038.md); [Kg2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037).md) is predicted here, must be
rejected as erroneous and irreconcilable with the words, and not even so
far correct as that Nahum makes any allusion to that event. He simply
announces the utter destruction of the Assyrian power, together with its
idolatry, upon which that power rested. Jehovah has prepared a grave for
the people and their idols, because they have been found light when
weighed in the balances of righteousness.

[Nahum 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">nah 1:15</span></span>

Judah hears the glad tidings, that its oppressor is utterly destroyed. A
warlike army marches against Nineveh, which that city cannot resist,
because the Lord will put an end to the oppression of His people. [Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md). "Behold, upon the mountains the
feet of the messengers of joy, proclaiming salvation! Keep thy feasts, O
Judah; pay thy vows: for the worthless one will no more go through thee;
he is utterly cut off." The destruction of the Assyrian, announced in
[Nah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014.md), is so certain, that Nahum
commences the description of its realization with an appeal to Judah, to
keep joyful feasts, as the miscreant is utterly cut off. The form in
which he utters this appeal is to point to messengers upon the
mountains, who are bringing the tidings of peace to the kingdom of
Judah. The first clause is applied in [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md) to the description of the
Messianic salvation. The messengers of joy appear upon the mountains,
because their voice can be heard far and wide from thence. The mountains
are those of the kingdom of Judah, and the allusion to the feet of the
messengers paints as it were for the eye the manner in which they hasten
on the mountains with the joyful news. מבשּׂר is collective, every one
who brings the glad tidings. Shâlōm, peace and salvation: here both in
one. The summons, to keep feasts, etc., proceeds from the prophet
himself, and is, as Ursinus says, "partim gratulatoria, partim
exhortatoria." The former, because the feasts could not be properly kept
during the oppression by the enemy, or at any rate could not be visited
by those who lived at a distance from the temple; the latter, because
the chaggı̄m, i.e., the great yearly feasts, were feasts of thanksgiving
for the blessings of salvation, which Israel owed to the Lord, so that
the summons to celebrate these feasts involved the admonition to thank
the Lord for His mercy in destroying the hostile power of the world.
This is expressed still more clearly in the summons to pay their vows.
בּליּעל, abstract for concrete = אישׁ בל, as in [Sa2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006.md) and [Job
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#018.md). נכרת is not a participle, but a
perfect in pause.
