### [Joshua Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 14:1</span></span>

[Jos 14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md) form the heading and
introduction to the account of the division of the land among the nine
tribes and a half, which reaches to Josh 19, and is brought to a close
by the concluding formula in [Jos
19:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#051.md). The division of the land of
Canaan according to the boundaries laid down in [Num
34:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#002.md) was carried out, in accordance
with the instructions in [Num
34:16-29](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016.md), by the high priest Eleazar,
Joshua, and ten heads of fathers' houses of the nine tribes and a half,
whose names are given in [Num
34:18-28](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#018.md). "By the lot of their
inheritance," i.e., by casting lots for it: this is dependent upon the
previous clause, "which they distributed for inheritance to them." "As
the Lord commanded through Moses" ([Num
26:52-56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052.md); [Num
33:54](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#054.md), and [Num
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#013).md), "to the nine tribes and a
half" (this is also dependent upon the clause "which they distributed
for inheritance").

[Joshua 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 14:3</span></span>

So many tribes were to receive their inheritance, for the two tribes and
a half had already received theirs from Moses on the other side of the
Jordan, and the tribe of Levi was not to receive any land for an
inheritance. According to this, there seem to be only eight tribes and a
half to be provided for (2 1/2 + 1 + 8 1/2 = 12); but there were really
nine and a half, for the sons of Joseph formed two tribes in consequence
of the adoption of Ephraim and Manasseh by the patriarch Jacob ([Gen
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005).md). But although the Levites were
to have no share in the land, they were to receive towns to dwell in,
with pasture adjoining for their cattle; these the other tribes were to
give up to them out of their inheritance, according to the instructions
in [Num 35:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001.md) (see the notes upon
this passage).

So far as the division of the land itself was concerned, it was to be
distributed by lot, according to [Num
26:52](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052.md).; but, at the same time, the
distribution was carried out with such special regard to the relative
sizes of the different tribes, that the more numerous tribe received a
larger share of the land than one that was not so numerous. This could
only be accomplished, however, by their restricting the lot to the
discrimination of the relative situation of the different tribes, and
then deciding the extent and boundaries of their respective possessions
according to the number of families of which they were composed.

(Note: "This was the force of the lot: there were ten lots cast in such
a manner as to decide that some were to be next to the Egyptians, some
to have the sea-coasts, some to occupy the higher ground, and some to
settle in the valleys. When this was done, it remained for the heads of
the nation to determine the boundaries of their different territories
according to some equitable standard. It was their place, therefore, to
ascertain how many thousand heads there were in each tribe, and then to
adjudicate a larger or smaller space according to the size of the tribe"
(Calvin). Or, as Clericus observes ([Num
26:52](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052).md), "the lot seems to have had
respect to the situation alone, and not to the extent of territory at
all.")

The casting of the lots was probably effected, as the Rabbins assumed,
by means of two urns, one filled with slips having the names of the
tribes upon them; the other, with an equal number, representing separate
divisions of the land: so that when one slip, with a name upon it, was
taken out of one urn, another slip, with a division of the land upon it,
was taken from the other. The result of the lot was accepted as the
direct decree of God; "for the lot was not controlled in any way by the
opinion, or decision, or authority of men" (Calvin). See the fuller
remarks at [Num 26:56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#056.md).

In the account of the casting of the lots, the first fact which strikes
us is, that after the tribes of Judah and Joseph had received their
inheritance, an interruption took place, and the camp was moved from
Gilgal to Shiloh, and the tabernacle erected there ([Jos
18:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001).md); after which the other tribes
manifested so little desire to receive their inheritance, that Joshua
reproved them for their indolence ([Jos
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#003).md), and directed them to nominate a
committee of twenty-one from their own number, whom he sent out to
survey the land and divide it into seven parts; and it was not till
after this had been done that the casting of the lots was proceeded
with, and each of these seven tribes received its inheritance. The
reason for this interruption is not given; and the commentators have
differed in their opinions as to the cause (see Keil's former Comm. on
Joshua, pp. 347ff.). The following appears to be the most probable
supposition. When Joshua received the command from the Lord to divide
the land among the tribes, they made an approximative division of the
land into nine or ten parts, according to the general idea of its extent
and principal features, which they had obtained in connection with the
conquest of the country, and then commenced distributing it without any
more minute survey or more accurate measurement, simply fixing the
boundaries of those districts which came out first according to the size
of the tribes upon whom the lots fell. As soon as that was done, these
tribes began to move off into the territory allotted to them, and to
take possession of it. The exact delineation of the boundaries, however,
could not be effected at once, but required a longer time, and was
probably not finally settled till the tribe had taken possession of its
land. In this manner the tribes of Judah, Ephraim, and half Manasseh had
received their inheritance one after another. And whilst they were
engaged in taking possession, Shiloh was chosen, no doubt in accordance
with divine instructions, as the place where the tabernacle was to be
permanently erected; and there the sanctuary was set up, the whole camp,
of course, removing thither at the same time. But when the casting of
the lots was about to be continued for the remainder of the tribes, they
showed no great desire for fixed abodes, as they had become so
accustomed to a nomad life, through having been brought up in the
desert, that they were much more disposed to continue it, than to take
possession of a circumscribed inheritance, - a task which would require
more courage and exertion, on account of the remaining Canaanites, than
a life in tents, in which they might wander up and down in the land by
the side of the Canaanites, and supply their wants from its productions,
as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had formerly done, since the Canaanites who
were left were so weakened by the war that the Israelites had no
occasion for a moment's anxiety about them, provided they did not
attempt to expel or to exterminate them. But Joshua could not rest
contented with this, if he would remain faithful to the charge which he
had received from the Lord. He therefore reproved these tribes for their
tardiness, and commanded them to take steps for continuing the casting
of lots for the land. But as the tribe of Joseph had expressed its
dissatisfaction with the smallness of the inheritance allotted to it,
and by so doing had manifested its cowardice, which prevented it from
attacking the Canaanites who were still left in the territory that had
fallen to their lot, Joshua may possibly have had his eyes opened in
consequence to the fact that, if the casting of lots was continued in
the manner begun, and with nothing more than an approximative definition
of the different portions of the land, there was a possibility of still
greater dissatisfaction arising among the other tribes, since some of
them at any rate would be sure to receive portions of the land in which
the Canaanites were more numerous and still stronger than in the
possessions of Ephraim. He therefore gave orders, that before the
casting of lots was proceeded with any further, the rest of the land
should be carefully surveyed and divided into seven districts, and that
a statement of the result should be laid before him, that these seven
districts might be divided by lot among the seven tribes. This survey of
the land no doubt very clearly showed that what remained, after
deducting the possessions of Judah and Joseph, was too small for the
remaining seven tribes, in proportion to what had been already divided.
Moreover, it had also been discovered that Judah's share was larger than
this tribe required ([Jos 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#009).md).
Consequently it was necessary that certain partial alterations should be
made in the arrangements connected with the first division. The lot
itself could not be pronounced invalid when it had once been cast, as
its falling was regarded as the decision of God himself, and therefore
it was impossible to make a fresh division of the whole land among all
the tribes. The only thing that could be done was to leave the two
tribes in those districts which had fallen to them by lot ([Jos
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#005).md), but to take certain parts of
their territory for the other tribes, which would leave the lot in all
its integrity, as the lot itself had not determined either the size of
the boundaries. This will serve to explain both the interruption to the
casting of the lots, which had been commenced at Gilgal, and also the
peculiar manner in which it was continued at Shiloh.

[Joshua 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 14:6</span></span>

Caleb's Inheritance. - [Jos 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md).
Before the casting of the lots commenced, Caleb came to Joshua along
with the sons of Judah, and asked for the mountains of Hebron for his
possession, appealing at the same time to the fact, that forty-five
years before Moses had promised it to him on oath, because he had not
discouraged the people and stirred them up to rebellion, as the other
spies that were sent from Kadesh to Canaan had done, but had faithfully
followed the Lord.

(Note: The grounds upon which Knobel follows Maurer and others in
affirming that this account does not belong to the so-called Elohist,
but is merely a fragment taken from the first document of the Jehovist,
are formed partly from misinterpretations of particular verses and
partly from baseless assumptions. To the former belongs the assertion,
that, according to [Jos 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#008.md), [Jos
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012.md), Joshua was not one of the spies
(see the remarks on [Jos 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#008).md); to the
latter the assertion, that the Elohist does not represent Joshua as
dividing the land, or Caleb as receiving so large a territory (see on
the contrary, however, the exposition of [Jos
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#013).md), as well as the enumeration of
all kinds of words which are said to be foreign to the Elohistic
document.)

This occurred at Gilgal, where the casting of the lots as to take place.
Caleb was not "the head of the Judahites," as Knobel maintains, but
simply the head of a father's house of Judah, and, as we may infer from
his surname, "the Kenizzite" or descendant of Kenaz ("the Kenizzite"
here and [Num 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#012.md) is equivalent to
"son of Kenaz," [Jos 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#017.md), and [Jdg
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#013).md), head of the father's house
which sprang from Kenaz, i.e., of a subdivision of the Judahite family
of Hezron; for Caleb, the brother of Jerahmeel and father of Achzah,
according to [Ch1 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042.md) (cf. [Ch1
2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#049).md), was the same person as Caleb
the descendant of Hezron mentioned in [Ch1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018.md). From the surname "the Kenizzite"
we are of course not to understand that Caleb or his father Jephunneh is
described as a descendant of the Canaanitish tribe of Kenizzites ([Gen
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019).md); but Kenaz was a descendant of
Hezron, the son of Perez and grandson of Judah ([Ch1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#005.md), [Ch1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018.md), [Ch1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#025).md), of whom nothing further is
known. Consequently it was not the name of a tribe, but of a person,
and, as we may see from [Ch1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#015.md),
where one of the sons of Caleb is called Kenaz, the name was repeated in
the family. The sons of Judah who came to Joshua along with Caleb were
not the Judahites generally, therefore, or representatives of all the
families of Judah, but simply members or representatives of the father's
house of Judah which took its name from Kenaz, and of which Caleb was
the head at that time. Caleb reminded Joshua of the word which the Lord
had spoken concerning them in Kadesh-barnea, i.e., the promise of God
that they should both of them enter the land of Canaan ([Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024.md), [Num
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030).md), and then proceeded to observe
([Jos 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#007).md): "When I was forty years
old, and was sent by Moses as a spy to Canaan, I brought back an answer
as it was in my mind," i.e., according to the best of my convictions,
without fear of man or regard to the favour of the people.

[Joshua 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 14:8</span></span>

Whereas the other spies discouraged the people by exaggerated reports
concerning the inhabitants of Canaan, he had followed the Lord with
perfect fidelity ([Num 13:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#031).md). He
had not been made to waver in his faithfulness to the Lord and His
promises either by the evil reports which the other spies had brought of
the land, or by the murmuring and threats of the excited crowd (see [Num
14:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006).md). "My brethren" ([Jos
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#008).md) are the rest of the spies, of
course with the exception of Joshua, to whom Caleb was speaking.

(Note: That Joshua was not included was evident from this circumstance
alone, and consequently it is a complete perversion on the part of
Knobel to argue, that because the expression is a general one, i.e.,
because Joshua is not expressly excepted by name, therefore he cannot
have been one of the spies, not to mention the fact that the words
"concerning me and thee," in v. 6, are sufficient to show to any one
acquainted with the account in Num 13-14, that Joshua was really one of
them.)

המסין for המסוּ (see Ges. 75, anm. 17, and Ewald, 142, a.), from מסה =
מסס (see [Jos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#011).md).

[Joshua 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 14:9</span></span>

Jehovah swore at that time, that the land upon which his (Caleb's) foot
had trodden should be an inheritance for him and his sons for ever. This
oath is not mentioned in [Num 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020.md).,
nor yet in [Deu 1:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#035.md), where Moses
repeats the account of the whole occurrence to the people. For the oath
of Jehovah mentioned in [Num 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md),
[Num 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024.md), viz., that none of the
murmuring people should see the land of Canaan, but that Caleb alone
should come thither and his seed should possess it, cannot be the one
referred to, as the promise given to Caleb in this oath does not relate
to the possession of Hebron in particular, but to the land of Canaan
generally, "the land which Jehovah had sworn to their fathers." We must
assume, therefore, that in addition to what is mentioned in [Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024.md), God gave a special promise to
Caleb, which is passed over there, with reference to the possession of
Hebron itself, and that Joshua, who heard it at the time, is here
reminded of that promise by Caleb. This particular promise from God was
closely related to the words with which Caleb endeavoured to calm the
minds of the people when they rose up against Moses ([Num
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030).md), viz., by saying to them, "We
are well able to overcome it," notwithstanding the Anakites who dwelt in
Hebron and had filled the other spies with such great alarm on account
of their gigantic size. With reference to this the Lord had promised
that very land to Caleb for his inheritance. Upon this promise Caleb
founded his request ([Jos 14:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#010).md)
that Joshua would give him these mountains, of which Joshua had heard at
that time that there were Anakites and large fortified cities there,
inasmuch as, although forty-five years had elapsed since God had spoken
these words, and he was now eighty-five years old, he was quite as
strong as he had been then. From the words, "The Lord hath kept me alive
these forty-five years," Theodoret justly infers, that the conquest of
Canaan by Joshua was completed in seven years, since God spake these
words towards the end of the second year after the exodus from Egypt,
and therefore thirty-eight years before the entrance into Canaan. The
clause וגו הלך אשׁר ([Jos 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#010).md) is
also dependent upon וגו ארבּעים יד: viz., "these forty-five years that
Israel has wandered in the desert" (on this use of אשׁר, see Ewald, 331,
c.). The expression is a general one, and the years occupied in the
conquest of Canaan, during which Israel had not yet entered into
peaceful possession of the promised land, are reckoned as forming part
of the years of wandering in the desert. As another reason for his
request, Caleb adds in [Jos 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#011.md) : "I
am still as strong to-day as at that time; as my strength was then, so
is it now for war, and to go out and in" (see [Num
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#017).md).

[Joshua 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 14:12</span></span>

"The mountain," according to the context, is the mountainous region of
Hebron, where the spies had seen the Anakites ([Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md), [Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028).md). The two clauses, in [Jos
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012.md), beginning with כּי are not to
be construed as subordinate to one another, but are co-ordinate clauses,
and contain two distinct motives in support of his petition: viz., "for
thou heardest in that day," sc., what Jehovah said to me then, and also
"for (because) the Anakites are there;" ... "perhaps Jehovah is with me
(אתי for אתּי, see Ges. 103, 1, anm. 1, and Ewald, 264, b.), and I root
them out" (vid., [Jos 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014).md). The word
"perhaps" does not express a doubt, but a hope or desire, or else, as
Masius says, "hope mixed with difficulty; and whilst the difficulty
detracts from the value, the hope stimulates the desire for the gift."

[Joshua 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 14:13</span></span>

Then Joshua blessed Caleb, i.e., implored the blessing of God upon his
undertaking, and gave him Hebron for an inheritance. Hebron is mentioned
as the chief city, to which the surrounding country belonged; for Caleb
had asked for the mountains ([Jos
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#009).md), i.e., the mountainous country
with and around Hebron, which included, for example, the fortified town
of Debir also ([Jos 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#015).md).

[Joshua 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 14:14</span></span>

This inheritance, the historian adds, was awarded to Caleb because he
had followed the God of Israel with such fidelity. - In [Jos
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md) there follows another notice of
the earlier name of Hebron (see at [Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002)). The expression לפנים (before.md),
like the words "to this day," applies to the time when the book was
composed, at which time the name Kirjath-arba had long since fallen into
disuse; so that it by no means follows that the name Hebron was not so
old as the name Kirjath-arba, which was given to Hebron for the first
time when it was taken by Arba, "the great man among the Anakites,"
i.e., the strongest and most renowned of the Anakites (vid., [Jos
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013).md). The remark, "and the land had
rest from war," is repeated again at the close of this account from [Jos
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#023.md), to show that although there
were Anakites still dwelling in Hebron whom Caleb hoped to exterminate,
the work of distributing the land by lot was not delayed in consequence,
but was carried out in perfect peace.
