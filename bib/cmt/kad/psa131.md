### [Psalms Chapter 131](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 131:1</span></span>

This little song is inscribed לדוד because it is like an echo of the
answer ([Sa2 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#021)..md) with which David
repelled the mocking observation of Michal when he danced before the Ark
in a linen ephod, and therefore not in kingly attire, but in the common
raiment of the priests: I esteem myself still less than I now show it,
and I appear base in mine own eyes. In general David is the model of the
state of mind which the poet expresses here. He did not push himself
forward, but suffered himself to be drawn forth out of seclusion. He did
not take possession of the throne violently, but after Samuel has
anointed him he willingly and patiently traverses the long, thorny,
circuitous way of deep abasement, until he receives from God's hand that
which God's promise had assured to him. The persecution by Saul lasted
about ten years, and his kingship in Hebron, at first only incipient,
seven years and a half. He left it entirely to God to remove Saul and
Ishbosheth. He let Shimei curse. He left Jerusalem before Absalom.
Submission to God's guidance, resignation to His dispensations,
contentment with that which was allotted to him, are the distinguishing
traits of his noble character, which the poet of this Psalm indirectly
holds up to himself and to his contemporaries as a mirror, viz., to the
Israel of the period after the Exile, which, in connection with small
beginnings under difficult circumstances, had been taught humbly
contented and calm waiting.

With לבּי לא־גבהּ the poet repudiates pride as being the state of his
soul; with לא־רמוּ עיני (lo-ramū' as in [Pro
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#013.md), and before Ajin, e.g., also in
[Gen 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#010.md); [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md), in accordance with which the
erroneous placing of the accent in Baer's text is to be corrected),
pride of countenance and bearing; and with ולא־הלּכתּי, pride of
endeavour and mode of action. Pride has its seat in the heart, in the
eyes especially it finds its expression, and great things are its sphere
in which it diligently exercises itself. The opposite of "great things"
([Jer 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003.md); [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005).md) is not that which is little,
mean, but that which is small; and the opposite of "things too wonderful
for me" ([Gen 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014).md) is not that which
is trivial, but that which is attainable.

אם־לא does not open a conditional protasis, for where is the indication
of the apodosis to be found? Nor does it signify "but," a meaning it
also has not in [Gen 24:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#038.md); [Eze
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#006.md). In these passages too, as in the
passage before us, it is asseverating, being derived from the usual
formula of an oath: verily I have, etc. שׁוּה signifies ([Isa
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#025).md) to level the surface of a field
by ploughing it up, and has an ethical sense here, like ישׂר with its
opposites עקב and עפּל. The Poel סּומם is to be understood according to
דּוּמיּה in [Psa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md), and דּוּמם in
[Lam 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#026.md). He has levelled or made
smooth his soul, so that humility is its entire and uniform state; he
has calmed it so that it is silent and at rest, and lets God speak and
work in it and for it: it is like an even surface, and like the calm
surface of a lake. Ewald and Hupfeld's rendering: "as a weaned child on
its mother, so my soul, being weaned, lies on me," is refuted by the
consideration that it ought at least to be כּגמוּלה, but more correctly
כּן גמולה; but it is also besides opposed by the article which is
swallowed up in כּגּמל, according to which it is to be rendered: like
one weaned beside its mother (here כּגמול on account of the
determinative collateral definition), like the weaned one (here כּגּמול
because without any collateral definition: cf. with Hitzig, [Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md), and the like; moreover, also,
because referring back to the first גמול, cf. [Hab
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#008).md), is my soul beside me (Hitzig,
Hengstenberg, and most expositors). As a weaned child - viz. not one
that is only just begun to be weaned, but an actually weaned child
(גּמל, cognate גּמר eta, to bring to an end, more particularly to bring
suckling to an end, to wean) - lies upon its mother without crying
impatiently and craving for its mother's breast, but contented with the
fact that it has its mother - like such a weaned child is his soul upon
him, i.e., in relation to his Ego (which is conceived of in עלי as
having the soul upon itself, cf. [Psa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md); [Jer
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#018.md); Psychology, S. 151f., tr. p.
180): his soul, which is by nature restless and craving, is stilled; it
does not long after earthly enjoyment and earthly good that God should
give these to it, but it is satisfied in the fellowship of God, it finds
full satisfaction in Him, it is satisfied (satiated) in Him.

By the closing strain, [Psa 131:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#003.md), the
individual language of the Psalm comes to have a reference to the
congregation at large. Israel is to renounce all self-boasting and all
self-activity, and to wait in lowliness and quietness upon its God from
now and for evermore. For He resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto
the humble.
