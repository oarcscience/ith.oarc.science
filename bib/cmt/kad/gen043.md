### [Genesis Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 43:1</span></span>

When the corn brought from Egypt was all consumed, as the famine still
continued, Jacob called upon his sons to go down and fetch a little corn
(little in proportion to their need).

[Genesis 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 43:3</span></span>

Judah then declared, that they would not go there again unless their
father sent Benjamin with them; for the man (Joseph) had solemnly
protested (העד העד) that they should not see his face without their
youngest brother. Judah undertook the consultation with his father about
Benjamin's going, because Reuben, the eldest son, had already been
refused, and Levi, who followed Reuben and Simeon, had forfeited his
father's confidence through his treachery to the Shechemites (Gen 34).

[Genesis 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 43:6</span></span>

To the father's reproachful question, why they had dealt so ill with
him, as to tell the man that they had a brother, Judah replied: "The man
asked after us and our kinsmen: Is your father yet alive? have ye a
brother? And we answered him in conformity (פּי על as in [Exo
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#027), etc..md) with these words (i.e.,
with his questions). Could we know, then, that he would say, Bring your
brother down?" Joseph had not made direct inquiries, indeed, about their
father and their brother; but by his accusation that they were spies, he
had compelled them to give an exact account of their family
relationships. So that Judah, when repeating the main points of the
interview, could very justly give them in the form just mentioned.

[Genesis 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 43:8</span></span>

He then repeated the only condition on which they would go to Egypt
again, referring to the death by famine which threatened them, their
father, and their children, and promising that he would himself be
surety for the youth (הנּער, Benjamin was twenty-three years old), and
saying, that if he did not restore him, he would bear the blame (חטא to
be guilty of a sin and stone for it, as in [Kg1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#021).md) his whole life long. He then
concluded with the deciding words, "for if we had not delayed, surely we
should already have returned a second time."

[Genesis 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 43:11</span></span>

And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this;
take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the
man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh,
nuts, and almonds: After this, the old man gave way to what could not be
avoided, and let Benjamin go. But that nothing might be wanting on his
part, which could contribute to the success of the journey, he suggested
that they should take a present for the man, and that they should also
take the money which was brought back in their sacks, in addition to
what was necessary for the corn they were to purchase; and he then
commended them to the mercy of Almighty God. "If it must be so, yet do
this (אפוא belongs to the imperative, although it precedes it here, cf.
[Gen 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#037).md): take of the prize (the
most choice productions) of the land-a little balm and a little honey
(דּבשׁ the Arabian dibs, either new honey from bees, or more probably
honey from grapes, - a thick syrup boiled from sweet grapes, which is
still carried every year from Hebron to Egypt), gum-dragon and myrrh
(vid., [Gen 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025).md), pictachio nuts and
almonds." בּטנים, which are not mentioned anywhere else, are, according
to the Samar. vers., the fruit of the pistacia vera, a tree resembling
the terebinth, - long angular nuts of the size of hazel-nuts, with an
oily kernel of a pleasant flavour; it does not thrive in Palestine now,
but the nuts are imported from Aleppo.

[Genesis 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 43:12</span></span>

"And take second (i.e., more) money (משׁנה כּסף is different from
משׁנה־כּסף doubling of the money = double money, [Gen
43:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#015).md) in your hand; and the money
that returned in your sacks take with you again; perhaps it is a
mistake," i.e., was put in your sacks by mistake.

[Genesis 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 43:14</span></span>

Thus Israel let his sons go with the blessing, "God Almighty give you
mercy before the man, that he may liberate to you your other brother
(Simeon) and Benjamin;" and with this resigned submission to the will of
God, "And I, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved," i.e., if I am to lose my
children, let it be so! For this mode of expression, cf. [Est
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md) and [Kg2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#004.md). שׁכּלתּי with the pausal a,
answering to the feelings of the speaker, which is frequently used for
o; e.g., טרף for יטרף, [Gen 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027.md).

[Genesis 43:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 43:16</span></span>

When the brethren appeared before Joseph, he ordered his steward to take
them into the house, and prepare a dinner for them and for him. טבה the
original form of the imperative for טבח. But the brethren were alarmed,
thinking that they were taken into the house because of the money which
returned the first time (השּׁב which came back, they could not imagine
how), that he might take them unawares (lit., roll upon them), and fall
upon them, and keep them as salves, along with their asses. For the
purpose of averting what they dreaded, they approached ([Gen
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#019).md) the steward and told him, "at
the door of the house," before they entered therefore, how, at the first
purchase of corn, on opening their sacks, they found the money that had
been paid, "every one's money in the mouth of his sack, our money
according to its weight," i.e., in full, and had now brought it back,
together with some more money to buy corn, and they did not know who had
put their money in their sacks ([Gen
43:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#020).md). The steward, who was
initiated into Joseph's plans, replied in a pacifying tone, "Peace be to
you (לכם שׁלום is not a form of salutation here, but of encouragement,
as in [Jdg 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#023).md): fear not; your God
and the God of your father has given you a treasure in your sacks; your
money came to me;" and at the same time, to banish all their fear, he
brought Simeon out to them. He then conducted them into Joseph's house,
and received them in Oriental fashion as the guests of his lord. But,
previous to Joseph's arrival, they arranged the present which they had
brought with them, as they heard that they were to dine with him.

[Genesis 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 43:26</span></span>

When Joseph came home, they handed him the present with the most
reverential obeisance.

[Gen 43:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#027.md)

Joseph first of all inquired after their own and their father's health
(שׁלום first as substantive, then as adjective = שׁלם [Gen
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018).md), whether he was still living;
which they answered with thanks in the affirmative, making the deepest
bow. His eyes then fell upon Benjamin, the brother by his own mother,
and he asked whether this was their youngest brother; but without
waiting for their reply, he exclaimed, "God be gracious to thee, my
son!" יחנך for יחנך as in [Isa 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019.md)
(cf. Ewald, 251d). He addressed him as "my son," in tender and, as it
were, paternal affection, and with special regard to his youth. Benjamin
was 16 years younger than Joseph, and was quite an infant when Joseph
was sold.

[Gen 43:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#030.md)

And "his (Joseph's) bowels did yearn" (נכמרוּ lit., were compressed,
from the force of love to his brother), so that he was obliged to seek
(a place) as quickly as possible to weep, and went into the chamber,
that he might give vent to his feelings in tears; after which, he washed
his face and came out again, and, putting constraint upon himself,
ordered the dinner to be brought in.

[Gen 43:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#032.md)

Separate tables were prepared for him, for his brethren, and for the
Egyptians who dined with them. This was required by the Egyptian spirit
of caste, which neither allowed Joseph, as minister of state and a
member of the priestly order, to eat along with Egyptians who were below
him, nor the latter along with the Hebrews as foreigners. "They cannot
(i.e., may not) eat (cf. [Deu 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md);
[Deu 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#005.md); [Deu
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015).md). For this was an abomination to
the Egyptians." The Hebrews and others, for example, slaughtered and ate
animals, even female animals, which were regarded by the Egyptians as
sacred; so that, according to Herod. ii. 41, no Egyptian would use the
knife, or fork, or saucepan of a Greek, nor would any eat of the flesh
of a clean animal which had been cut up with a Grecian knife (cf. [Exo
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#022).md).

[Gen 43:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#033.md)

The brothers sat in front of Joseph, "the first-born according to his
birthright, and the smallest (youngest) according to his smallness
(youth);" i.e., the places were arranged for them according to their
ages, so that they looked at one another with astonishment, since this
arrangement necessarily impressed them with the idea that this great man
had been supernaturally enlightened as to their family affairs. To do
them honour, they brought (ישּׂא, Ges. 137, 3) them dishes from Joseph,
i.e., from his table; and to show especial honour to Benjamin, his
portion was five times larger than that of any of the others (ידות lit.,
hands, grasps, as in [Gen 47:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#024.md); [Kg2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007).md). The custom is met with
elsewhere of showing respect to distinguished guests by giving them the
largest and best pieces ([Sa1 9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#023.md);
Homer, Il. 7, 321; 8, 162, etc.), by double portions (e.g., the kings
among the Spartans, Herod. 6, 57), and even by fourfold portions in the
case of the Archons among the Cretans (Heraclid. polit., 3). But among
the Egyptians the number 5 appears to have been preferred to any other
(cf. [Gen 41:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#034.md); [Gen
45:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#022.md); [Gen
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#002.md), [Gen
47:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#024.md); [Isa
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018).md). By this partiality Joseph
intended, with a view to his further plans, to draw out his brethren to
show their real feelings towards Benjamin, that he might see whether
they would envy and hate him on account of this distinction, as they had
formerly envied him his long coat with sleeves, and hated him because he
was his father's favourite ([Gen
37:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#003).md). This honourable treatment and
entertainment banished all their anxiety and fear. "They drank, and
drank largely with him," i.e., they were perfectly satisfied with what
they ate and drank; not, they were intoxicated (cf. [Hag
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009).md).
