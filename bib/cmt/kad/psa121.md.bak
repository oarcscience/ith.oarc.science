The Consolation of Divine Protection

This song of degrees is the only one that is inscribed שׁיר למעלות and
not שׁיר המעלות. The lxx, Targum, and Jerome render it as in the other
instances; Aquila and Symmachus, on the contrary, ᾠδὴ (ᾆσμα) εἰς τάς
ἀναβάσεις, as the Midrash Sifrı̂ also mystically interprets it: Song upon
the steps, upon which God leads the righteous up into the other world.
Those who explain המעלות of the homeward caravans or of the pilgrimages
rightly regard this למעלות, occurring only once, as favouring their
explanation. But the Lamed is that of the rule or standard. The most
prominent distinguishing mark of [Psa
121:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md) is the step-like movement of
the thoughts: it is formed למּעלות, after the manner of steps. The view
that we have a pilgrim song before us is opposed by the beginning, which
leads one to infer a firmly limited range of vision, and therefore a
fixed place of abode and far removed from his native mountains. The
tetrastichic arrangement of the Psalm is unmistakeable.

[Psalms 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 121:1</span></span>

Apollinaris renders as meaninglessly as possible: ὄμματα δενδροκόμων
ὀρέων ὑπερεξετάνυσσα - with a reproduction of the misapprehended ἦρα of
the lxx. The expression in fact is אשּׂא, and not נשׂאתי. And the
mountains towards which the psalmist raises his eyes are not any
mountains whatsoever. In Ezekiel the designation of his native land from
the standpoint of the Mesopotamian plain is "the mountains of Israel."
His longing gaze is directed towards the district of these mountains,
they are his ḳibla, i.e., the sight-point of his prayer, as of Daniel's,
[Dan 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#011.md). To render "from which my
help cometh" (Luther) is inadmissible. מאין is an interrogative even in
[Jos 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#004.md), where the question is an
indirect one. The poet looks up to the mountains, the mountains of his
native land, the holy mountains ([Psa
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003.md); [Psa
137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md); [Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002).md), when he longingly asks: whence
will my help come? and to this question his longing desire itself
returns the answer, that his help comes from no other quarter than from
Jahve, the Maker of heaven and earth, from His who sits enthroned behind
and upon these mountains, whose helpful power reaches to the remotest
ends and corners of His creation, and with (עם) whom is help, i.e., both
the willingness and the power to help, so that therefore help comes from
nowhere but from (מן) Him alone. In [Psa
121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md) the poet has propounded a
question, and in [Psa 121:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002.md) replies to
this question himself. In [Psa 121:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003.md)
and further the answering one goes on speaking to the questioner. The
poet is himself become objective, and his Ego, calm in God, promises him
comfort, by unfolding to him the joyful prospects contained in that hope
in Jahve. The subjective אל expresses a negative in both cases with an
emotional rejection of that which is absolutely impossible. The poet
says to himself: He will, indeed, surely not abandon thy foot to the
tottering (למּוט, as in [Psa 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009.md), cf.
[Psa 55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023).md), thy Keeper will surely
not slumber; and then confirms the assertion that this shall not come to
pass by heightening the expression in accordance with the step-like
character of the Psalm: Behold the Keeper of Israel slumbereth not and
sleepeth not, i.e., He does not fall into slumber from weariness, and
His life is not an alternate waking and sleeping. The eyes of His
providence are ever open over Israel.

[Psalms 121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 121:5</span></span>

That which holds good of "the Keeper of Israel" the poet applies
believingly to himself, the individual among God's people, in [Psa
121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005.md) after [Gen
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015.md). Jahve is his Keeper, He is his
shade upon his right hand (היּמין as in [Jdg
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md); [Sa2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#009.md), and frequently; the construct
state instead of an apposition, cf. e.g., Arab. jânbu 'l-grbı̂yi, the
side of the western = the western side), which protecting him and
keeping him fresh and cool, covers him from the sun's burning heat. על,
as in [Psa 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md); [Psa
110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md), with the idea of an
overshadowing that screens and spreads itself out over anything (cf.
[Num 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009).md). To the figure of the
shadow is appended the consolation in [Psa
121:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006.md). הכּה of the sun signifies to
smite injuriously ([Isa 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010).md),
plants, so that they wither ([Psa
102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005).md), and the head ([Jon
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008).md), so that symptoms of sun-stroke
([Kg2 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#019), Judith 8:2f..md) appears. The
transferring of the word of the moon is not zeugmatic. Even the moon's
rays may become insupportable, may affect the eyes injuriously, and
(more particularly in the equatorial regions) produce fatal inflammation
of the brain.

(Note: Many expositors, nevertheless, understand the destructive
influence of the moon meant here of the nightly cold, which is mentioned
elsewhere in the same antithesis. [Gen
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#040.md); [Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030.md). De Sacy observes also: On dit
quelquefois d'un grand froid, comme d'un grand chaud, qu'il est brulant.
The Arabs also say of snow and of cold as of fire: jaḥrik, it burns.)

From the hurtful influences of nature that are round about him the
promise extends in [Psa 121:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#007.md) in
every direction. Jahve, says the poet to himself, will keep (guard) thee
against all evil, of whatever kind it may be and whencesoever it may
threaten; He will keep thy soul, and therefore thy life both inwardly
and outwardly; He will keep (ישׁמר־, cf. on the other hand ישׁפּט־ in
[Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009).md) thy going out and coming in,
i.e., all thy business and intercourse of life ([Deu
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#006), and frequently.md); for, as
Chrysostom observes, ἐν τούτοις ὁ βίος ἅπας, ἐν εἰσόδοις καὶ ἐξόδοις,
therefore: everywhere and at all times; and that from this time forth
even for ever. In connection with this the thought is natural, that the
life of him who stands under the so universal and unbounded protection
of eternal love can suffer no injury.
