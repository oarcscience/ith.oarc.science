[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 2:1</span></span>

What Shulamith now further says confirms what had just been said. City
and palace with their splendour please her not; forest and field she
delights in; she is a tender flower that has grown up in the quietness
of rural life.

1 I am a meadow-flower of Sharon,

A lily of the valleys.

We do not render: "the wild-flower," "the lily," ... for she seeks to
represent herself not as the one, but only as one of this class; the
definiteness by means of the article sometimes belongs exclusively to
the second number of the genit. word-chain. מלאך ה may equally (vid., at
[Sol 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#011.md), Hitz. on [Psa
113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md), and my Comm. on [Gen
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#020).md) mean "an angel" or "the angel of
Jahve;" and בת ישׂ "a virgin," or "the virgin of Israel" (the
personification of the people). For hhǎvatstsělěth (perhaps from
hhivtsēl, a denom. quadril. from bětsěl, to form bulbs or bulbous
knolls) the Syr. Pesh. ([Isa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001).md)
uses chamsaljotho, the meadow-saffron, colchicum autumnale; it is the
flesh-coloured flower with leafless stem, which, when the grass is mown,
decks in thousands the fields of warmer regions. They call it filius
ante patrem, because the blossoms appear before the leaves and the
seed-capsules, which develope themselves at the close of winter under
the ground. Shulamith compares herself to such a simple and common
flower, and that to one in Sharon, i.e., in the region known by that
name. Sharon is per aphaer. derived from ישׁרון. The most celebrated
plain of this name is that situated on the Mediterranean coast between
Joppa and Caesarea; but there is also a trans-Jordanic Sharon, [Ch1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016.md); and according to Eusebius and
Jerome, there is also another district of this name between Tabor and
the Lake of Tiberias,

(Note: Vid., Lagarde, Onomastica, p. 296; cf. Neubauer, Gographic du
Talm. p. 47.)

which is the one here intended, because Shulamith is a Galilean: she
calls herself a flower from the neighbourhood of Nazareth. Aquila
translates: "A rosebud of Sharon;" but שׁושׁנּה (designedly here the
fem. form of the name, which is also the name of a woman) does not mean
the Rose which was brought at a later period from Armenia and Persia, as
it appears,

(Note: Vid., Ewald, Jahrbuch, IV p. 71; cf. Wstemann, Die Rose, etc.,
1854.)

and cultivated in the East (India) and West (Palestine, Egypt, Europe).
It is nowhere mentioned in the canonical Scriptures, but is first found
in Sir. 24:14; 39:13; 50:8; Wisd. 2:8; and [Est
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#006.md), lxx. Since all the rosaceae are
five-leaved, and all the liliaceae are six-leaved, one might suppose,
with Aben Ezra, that the name sosan (susan) is connected with the
numeral שׁשׁ, and points to the number of leaves, especially since one
is wont to represent to himself the Eastern lilies as red. But they are
not only red, or rather violet, but also white: the Moorish-Spanish
azucena denotes the white lily.

(Note: Vid., Fleischer, Sitzungs-Berichten d. Schs. Gesell. d.
Wissensch. 1868, p. 305. Among the rich flora on the descent of the
Hauran range, Wetstein saw (Reisebericht, p. 148) a dark-violet
magnificent lily (susan) as large as his fist. We note here Rckert's
"Bright lily! The flowers worship God in the garden: thou art the priest
of the house.")

The root-word will thus, however, be the same as that of שׁשׁ, byssus,
and שׁישׁ, white marble. The comparison reminds us of [Hos
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005.md), "I shall be as the dew unto
Israel: he shall grow as the lily." העמקים are deep valleys lying
between mountains. She thinks humbly of herself; for before the
greatness of the king she appears diminutive, and before the comeliness
of the king her own beauty disappears - but he takes up her comparison
of herself, and gives it a notable turn.

2 As a lily among thorns,

So is my love among the daughters.

By החוחים are not meant the thorns of the plant itself, for the lily has
no thorns, and the thorns of the rose are, moreover, called kotsim, and
not hhohhim;

(Note: An Aramaic proverb: "from thorns sprouts the rose" (i.e., bad
fathers have often pious children), in Heb. is קוץ מוציא שׁושׁן; vid.,
Jalkut Samuel, 134.)

besides, ben (among) contradicts that idea, since the thorns are on the
plant itself, and it is not among them - thus the hhohhim are not the
thorns of the flower-stem, but the thorn-plants that are around. חוח
designates the thorn-bush, e.g., in the allegorical answer of King
Josiah to Amaziah, [Kg2 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#009.md).
Simplicity, innocence, gentleness, are the characteristics in which
Shulamith surpasses all בּנות, i.e., all women (vid., [Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009).md), as the lily of the valley
surpasses the thorn-bushes around it. "Although thorns surround her, yet
can he see her; he sees her quiet life, he finds her beautiful." But
continuing this reciprocal rivalry in the praise of mutual love, she
says:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 2:3</span></span>

3a As an apple-tree among the trees of the wood,

So is my beloved among the sons.

The apple-tree, the name of which, תּפּוּח, is formed from נפח, and
denominates it from its fragrant flower and fruit, is as the king among
fruit trees, in Shulamith's view. יער (from יער, to be rough, rugged,
uneven) is the wilderness and the forest, where are also found trees
bearing fruit, which, however, is for the most part sour and
unpalatable. But the apple-tree unites delicious fruit along with a
grateful shade; and just such a noble tree is the object of her love.

3b Under his shadow it delighted me to sit down;

And his fruit is sweet to my taste.

In concupivi et consedi the principal verb completes itself by the
co-ordinating of a verb instead of an adv. or inf. as [Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md); [Est
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#007.md); Ewald, 285. However, concupivi et
consedi is yet more than concupivi considere, for thereby she not only
says that she found delight in sitting down, but at the same time also
in sitting down in the shadow of this tree. The Piel חמּד, occurring
only here, expresses the intensity of the wish and longing. The shadow
is a figure of protection afforded, and the fruit a figure of enjoyment
obtained. The taste is denoted by חך = חנך, from חנך, to chew, or also
imbuere; and that which is sweet is called מתוק, from the smacking
connected with an agreeable relish. The usus loq. has neglected this
image, true to nature, of physical circumstances in words, especially
where, as here, they are transferred to the experience of the soul-life.
The taste becomes then a figure of the soul's power of perception
(αἰσθητικόν); a man's fruit are his words and works, in which his inward
nature expresses itself; and this fruit is sweet to those on whom that
in which the peculiar nature of the man reveals itself makes a happy,
pleasing impression. But not only does the person of the king afford to
Shulamith so great delight, he entertains her also with what can and
must give her enjoyment.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 2:4</span></span>

4 He has brought me into the wine-house,

And his banner over me is love.

After we have seen the ladies of the palace at the feast, in which wine
is presented, and after Solomon, till now absent, has entered the
banqueting-chamber (Arab. meglis), by היּין בּית we are not to
understand the vineyard, which would be called bēth hǎggephānim or bēth
hā'ǎnāvim, as in [Act 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md), Pesh. the
Mount of Olives, bēth zaite.

(Note: In Heb. יין does not denote the vine as a plant, as the Aethiop.
wain, whence asada wain, wine-court = vineyard, which Ewald compares;
Dillmann, however, ineptly cites "vine-arbour," and South-Germ.
"kamerte" = vinea camerata; in Heb. היין בּית is the house in which wine
is drunk.)

He has introduced her to the place where he royally entertains his
friends. Well knowing that she, the poor and sunburnt maiden, does not
properly belong to such a place, and would rather escape away from it,
he relieves her from her fear and bashfulness, for he covers her with
his fear-inspiring, awful, and thus surely protecting, banner; and this
banner, which he waves over her, and under which she is well concealed,
is "love." דּגל (from דּגל, to cover) is the name of the covering of the
shaft or standard, i.e., pannus, the piece of cloth fastened to a shaft.
Like a pennon, the love of the king hovers over her; and so powerful, so
surpassing, is the delight of this love which pervades and transports
her, that she cries out:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 2:5</span></span>

5 Support me with grape-cakes,

Refresh me with apples:

For I am sick with love.

She makes use of the intensive form as one in a high degree in need of
the reanimating of her almost sinking life: סמּך is the intens. of סמך,
to prop up, support, or, as here, to under-prop, uphold; and ripeed, the
intens. of רפד (R. רף), to raise up from beneath (vid., at [Pro
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016).md), to furnish firm ground and
support. The apple is the Greek attribute of Aphrodite, and is the
symbol of love; but here it is only a means of refreshing; and if
thoughts of love are connected with the apple-tree ([Sol
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md); [Sol
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005).md), that is explained from
Shulamith's rural home. Bttcher understands quinces; Epstein, citrons;
but these must needs have been more closely denoted, as at [Pro
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011.md), by some addition to the
expression. אשׁישׁות (from אשׁשׁ, to establish, make firm) are (cf. [Isa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md); [Hos
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001).md) grapes pressed together like
cakes; different from צמּוּקים, dried grapes (cf. דּבלה), fig-cakes
(Arab. dabbûle, a mass pressed together), and πλακοῦς, placenta, from
the pressed-out form. A cake is among the gifts ([Sa2
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019).md) which David distributed to the
people on the occasion of the bringing up of the ark; date-cakes, e.g.,
at the monastery at Sinai, are to the present day gifts for the
refreshment of travellers. If Shulamith's cry was to be understood
literally, one might, with Noack, doubt the correctness of the text; for
"love-sickness, even in the age of passion and sentimentality, was not
to be cured with roses and apples." But (1) sentimentality, i.e.,
susceptibility, does not belong merely to the Romantic, but also to
Antiquity, especially in the Orient, as e.g., is shown by the symptoms
of sympathy with which the prophets were affected when uttering their
threatenings of judgment; let one read such outbreaks of sorrow as [Isa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003.md), which, if one is disposed to
scorn, may be derided as hysterical fits. Moreover, the Indian, Persian,
and Arabic erotic (vid., e.g., the Romance Siret 'Antar) is as
sentimental as the German has at any time been. (2) The subject of the
passage here is not the curing of love-sickness, but bodily refreshment:
the cry of Shulamith, that she may be made capable of bearing the deep
agitation of her physical life, which is the consequence, not of her
love-sickness, but of her love-happiness. (3) The cry is not addressed
(although this is grammatically possible, since סמּכוּני is, according
to rule, = סמּכנה אתי) to the daughters of Jerusalem, who would in that
case have been named, but to some other person; and this points to its
being taken not in a literal sense. (4) It presupposes that one came to
the help of Shulamith, sick and reduced to weakness, with grapes and
apple-scent to revive her fainting spirit. The call of Shulamith thus
means: hasten to me with that which will revive and refresh me, for I am
sick with love. This love-sickness has also been experienced in the
spiritual sphere. St. Ephrem was once so overcome by such a joy that he
cried out: "Lord, withdraw Thine hand a little, for my heart is too weak
to receive so great joy." And J. R. Hedinger († 1704) was on his
deathbed overpowered with such a stream of heavenly delight that he
cried: "Oh, how good is the Lord! Oh, how sweet is Thy love, my Jesus!
Oh, what a sweetness! I am not worthy of it, my Lord! Let me alone; let
me alone!" As the spiritual joy of love, so may also the spiritual
longing of love consume the body (cf. [Job
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#027.md); [Psa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md); [Psa
84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003).md); there have been men who have
actually sunk under a longing desire after the Lord and eternity. It is
the state of love-ecstasy in which Shulamith calls for refreshment,
because she is afraid of sinking. The contrast between her, the poor and
unworthy, and the king, who appears to her as an ideal of beauty and
majesty, who raises her up to himself, was such as to threaten her life.
Unlooked for, extraordinary fortune, has already killed many. Fear,
producing lameness and even death, is a phenomenon common in the Orient.

(Note: "Ro‛b (רעב, thus in Damascus), or ra‛b (thus in the Hauran and
among the Beduins), is a state of the soul which with us is found only
in a lower degree, but which among the Arabians is psychologically
noteworthy. The wahm, i.e., the idea of the greatness and
irresistibility of a danger or a misfortune, overpowers the Arabian; all
power of body and of soul suddenly so departs from him, that he falls
down helpless and defenceless. Thus, on the 8th July 1860, in a few
hours, about 6000 Christian men were put to death in Damascus, without
one lifting his hand in defence, or uttering one word of supplication.
That the ro‛b kills in Arabia, European and native physicians have
assured me; and I myself can confirm the fact. Since it frequently
produces a stiffening of the limbs, with chronic lameness, every kind of
paralysis is called ro‛b, and every paralytic mar‛ûb. It is treated
medically by applying the 'terror-cup' (tâset er-ro‛b), covered over
with sentences engraved on it, and hung round with twenty bells; and
since, among the Arabians, the influence of the psychical on the
physical is stronger and more immediate than with us, the sympathetic
cure may have there sometimes positive results." - Wetstein.)

If Pharaoh's daughter, if the Queen of Sheba, finds herself in the
presence of Solomon, the feeling of social equality prevents all alarm.
But Shulamith is dazzled by the splendour, and disconcerted; and it
happens to her in type as it happened to the seer of Patmos, who, in
presence of the ascended Lord, fell at His feet as one dead, [Rev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017.md). If beauty is combined with
dignity, it has always, for gentle and not perverted natures, something
that awakens veneration and tremor; but if the power of love be
superadded, then it has, as a consequence, that combination of awe and
inward delight, the psychological appearance of which Sappho, in the
four strophes which begin with "Φαίνεταί μοι κῆνος ἴσος θεοῖσιν ἔμμεν
ὡνήρ," has described in a manner so true to nature. We may thus, without
carrying back modern sentimentality into antiquity, suppose that
Shulamith sank down in a paroxysm caused by the rivalry between the
words of love and of praise, and thus thanking him, - for Solomon
supports and bears her up, - she exclaims:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 2:6</span></span>

6 His left hand is under my head,

And his right hand doth embrace me.

With his left hand he supports her head that had fallen backwards, and
with his right he embraces her \[herzet\], as Luther rightly renders it
(as he also renders the name Habakkuk by "der Herzer" = the embracer);
for חבּק signifies properly to enfold, to embrace; but then generally,
to embrace lovingly, to fondle, of that gentle stroking with the hand
elsewhere denoted by חלּה, mulcere. The situation here is like that at
[Gen 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#013.md); [Gen
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#010.md); where, connected with the dat.,
it is meant of loving arms stretched out to embrace. If this
sympathetic, gentle embracing exercises a soothing influence on her,
overcome by the power of her emotions; so love mutually kindled now
celebrates the first hour of delighted enjoyment, and the happy
Shulamith calls to those who are witnesses of her joy:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 2:7</span></span>

7 I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem,

By the gazelles or the hinds of the field,

That ye arouse not and disturb not love

Till she pleases.

It is permitted to the Israelites to swear, נשׁבּע, only by God ([Gen
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#023).md); but to adjure, השׁבּיע, by
that which is not God, is also admissible, although this example before
us is perhaps the only direct one in Scripture. צבי (= צבי, dialect.
טבי), fem. צביה (Aram. טביתא, [Act
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036).md), plur. tsebaim or tsebajim, fem.
tsabaōth (according with the pl. of צבא), softened from tsebajōth, is
the name for the gazelle, from the elegance of its form and movements.
אילות is the connecting form of איּלות, whose consonantal Yod in the
Assyr. and Syr. is softened to the diphthong ailuv, ailaa; the gen. "of
the field," as not distinguishing but describing, belongs to both of the
animals, therefore also the first is without the article. או (after the
etymon corresponding to the Lat. vel) proceeds, leaving out of view the
repetition of this so-called Slumber-Song ([Sol
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#005.md); cf. [Sol
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#004.md), as also [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009).md), from the endeavour to give to
the adjuration the greatest impression; the expression is varied, for
the representations flit from image to image, and the one, wherever
possible, is surpassed by the other (vid., at [Pro
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#031).md).

Under this verse Hengst. remarks: "The bride would not adjure by the
hinds, much more would she adjure by the stage." He supposes that
Solomon is here the speaker; but a more worthless proof for this could
not be thought of. On the contrary, the adjuration by the gazelles,
etc., shows that the speaker here is one whose home is the field and
wood; thus also not the poet (Hitz.) nor the queen-mother (Bttch.),
neither of whom is ever introduced as speaking. The adjuration is that
love should not be disturbed, and therefore it is by the animals that
are most lovely and free, which roam through the fields. Zckler, with
whom in this one point Grtz agrees, finds here, after the example of
Bttch. and Hitz., the earnest warning against wantonly exciting love in
themselves (cf. Lat. irritamenta veneris, irritata voluptas) till God
Himself awakens it, and heart finds itself in sympathy with heart. But
the circumstances in which Shulamith is placed ill accord with such a
general moralizing. The adjuration is repeated, [Sol
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#005.md); [Sol
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#004.md), and wherever Shulamith finds
herself near her beloved, as she is here in his arms. What lies nearer,
then, than that she should guard against a disturbance of this
love-ecstasy, which is like a slumber penetrated by delightful dreams?
Instead of אתכם, תּעירוּ, and תּעוררוּ, should be more exactly the words
אתכן, תּעררנה, and תּעוררנה; but the gram. distinction of the genera is
in Heb. not perfectly developed. We meet also with the very same
synallage generis, without this adjuration formula, at [Sol
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008.md); [Sol
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001.md); [Sol
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#002.md); [Sol
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008.md), etc.; it is also elsewhere
frequent; but in the Song it perhaps belongs to the foil of the vulgar
given to the highly poetic. Thus also in the vulgar Arab. the fem. forms
jaḳtulna, taḳtulna, corresponding to תּקטלנה, are fallen out of use.
With העיר, expergefacere, there is connected the idea of an interruption
of sleep; with עורר, excitare, the idea, which goes further, of arousing
out of sleep, placing in the full activity of awakened life.

(Note: The distinction between these words is well explained by Lewisohn
in his Investigationes Linguae (Wilna, 1840), p. 21: "The מעיר את־הישׁן
is satisfied that the sleeper wakes, and it is left to him fully to
overcome the influence of sleep; the מעורר, however, arouses him at once
from sleepiness, and awakes him to such a degree that he is secured
against falling asleep again.")

The one adjuration is, that love should not be awakened out of its sweet
dream; the other, that it should not be disturbed from its being
absorbed in itself. The Pasek between מעירו and the word following has,
as at [Lev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md), the design of keeping
the two Vavs distinct, that in reading they might not run together; it
is the Pasek which, as Ben Asher says, serves "to secure to a letter its
independence against the similar one standing next it." האהמה is not
abstr. pro concreto, but love itself in its giving and receiving. Thus
closes the second scene of the first act: Shulamith lies like one
helpless in the arms of Solomon; but in him to expire is her life; to
have lost herself in him, and in him to find herself again, is her
happiness.

8 Hark, my beloved! lo, there he comes!

Springs over the mountains,

Bounds over the hills.

The word קול, in the expression דּודי קול, is to be understood of the
call of the approaching lover (Bttch.), or only of the sound of his
footsteps (Hitz.); it is an interjectional clause (sound of my
beloved!), in which kōl becomes an interjection almost the same as our
"horch" "hear!". Vid., under [Gen
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md). זה after הנּה sharpens it, as
the demonst. ce in ecce = en ce. בּא is though of as partic., as is
evident from the accenting of the fem. בּאה, e.g., [Jer
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#022.md). דּלּג is the usual word for
springing; the parallel קפץ (קפּץ), Aram. קפץ, קפז, signifies properly
contrahere (cogn. קמץ, whence Kametz, the drawing together of the mouth,
more accurately, of the muscles of the lips), particularly to draw the
body together, to prepare it for a spring. In the same manner, at the
present day, both in the city and in the Beduin Arab. kamaz, for which
also famaz, is used of the springing of a gazelle, which consists in a
tossing up of the legs stretched out perpendicularly. 'Antar says
similarly, as Shulamith here of the swift-footed schêbûb (D. M. Zeitung,
xxii. 362); wahu jegmiz gamazât el-gazâl, it leaps away with the
springing of a gazelle.

9 My beloved is like a gazelle,

Or a young one of the harts.

Lo, there he stands behind our wall!

He looks through the windows,

Glances through the lattices.

The figure used in [Sol 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md) is
continued in [Sol 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md). צבי is the
gazelle, which is thus designated after its Arab. name ghazāl, which has
reached us probably through the Moorish-Spanish gazela (distinct from
"ghasele," after the Pers. ghazal, love-poem). עפר is the young hart,
like the Arab. ghufar (ghafar), the young chamois, probably from the
covering of young hair; whence also the young lion may be called כּפיר.
Regarding the effect of או passing from one figure to another, vid.,
under [Sol 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007.md). The meaning would be
plainer were [Sol 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md) joined to [Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md), for the figures illustrate
quick-footed speed ([Sa2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018.md); [Ch1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md); cf. [Psa
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md) with [Hab
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019.md) and [Isa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006).md). In [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md) he comes with the speed of the
gazelle, and his eyes seek for the unforgotten one. כּתל (from כּתל,
compingere, condensare; whence, e.g., Arab. mukattal, pressed together,
rounded, ramass; vid., regarding R. כת at [Psa
87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006).md), Aram. כּוּתל ([Jos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015); Targ. word for קיר.md), is meant of
the wall of the house itself, not of the wall surrounding it. Shulamith
is within, in the house: her beloved, standing behind the wall, stands
without, before the house (Tympe: ad latus aversum parietis, viz., out
from it), and looks through the windows, - at one time through this one,
at another through that one, - that he might see her and feast his eyes
on her. We have here two verbs from the fulness of Heb. synon. for one
idea of seeing. השׁגּיח, from שׁגח, occurring only three times in the
O.T., refers, in respect of the roots ש, שך, שק, to the idea of piercing
or splitting (whence also שׁגּע, to be furious, properly pierced,
percitum esse; cf. oestrus, sting of a gadfly = madness, Arab.
transferred to hardiness = madness), and means fixing by reflexion and
meditation; wherefore השׁגּחח in post-bibl. Heb. is the name for Divine
Providence. הציץ, elsewhere to twinkle and to bloom, appears only here
in the sense of seeing, and that of the quick darting forward of the
glance of the eye, as blick glance and blitz lightning (blic) are one
word; "he saw," says Goethe in Werther, "the glance of the powder"
(Weigand).

(Note: In this sense: to look sharply toward, is הציץ (Talm.) - for Grtz
alone a proof that the Song is of very recent date; but this word
belongs, like סמדר, to the old Heb. still preserved in the Talm.)

The plurs. fenestrae and transennae are to be understood also as
synechdoche totius pro parte, which is the same as the plur. of categ.;
but with equal correctness we conceive of him as changing his standing
place. חלּון is the window, as an opening in the wall, from חלל,
perforare. חרכּים we combine most certainly (vid., [Pro
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027)) with (Arab..md) khark, fissura, so
that the idea presents itself of the window broken through the wall, or
as itself broken through; for the window in the country there consists
for the most part of a pierced wooden frame of a transparent nature, -
not (as one would erroneously conclude, from the most significant name
of a window שׂבכה, now schubbâke, from שׂבך, to twist, to lattice, to
close after the manner of our Venetian blinds) of rods or boards laid
crosswise. הציץ accords with the looking out through the pierced places
of such a window, for the glances of his eye are like the penetrating
rays of light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 2:10</span></span>

When now Shulamith continues:

10a My beloved answered and said to me,

Arise, my love, my fair one, and go forth!

the words show that this first scene is not immediately dramatic, but
only mediately; for Shulamith speaks in monologue, though in a dramatic
manner narrating an event which occurred between the commencement of
their love-relation and her home-bringing.

(Note: Grtz misinterprets this in order by the supplement of similar
ones to make the whole poem a chain of narrative which Shulamith
declaims to the daughters of Jerusalem. Thereby it certainly ceases to
be dramatic, but so much more tedious does it become by these interposed
expressions, "I said," "he said," "the sons of my mother said.")

She does not relate it as a dream, and thus it is not one. Solomon again
once more passes, perhaps on a hunting expedition into the northern
mountains after the winter with its rains, which made them inaccessible,
is over; and after long waiting, Shulamith at length again sees him, and
he invites her to enjoy with him the spring season. ענה signifies, like
ἀποκρίνεσθαι, not always to answer to the words of another, but also to
speak on the occasion of a person appearing before one; it is different
from ענה, the same in sound, which signifies to sing, properly to sing
through the nose, and has the root-meaning of replying (of the same root
as ענן, clouds, as that which meets us when we look up toward the
heavens); but taking speech in hand in consequence of an impression
received is equivalent to an answer. With קוּמי he calls upon her to
raise herself from her stupor, and with ולכי־לך, French va-t-en, to
follow him.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 2:11</span></span>

11 For, lo! the winter is past,

The rain is over, is gone.

12 The flowers appear in the land;

The time of song has come,

And the voice of the turtle makes itself heard in our land.

13 The fig-tree spices her green figs,

And the vines stand in bloom, they diffuse fragrance; -

Rise up, my love, my fair one, and go forth!

The winter is called סתו, perhaps from a verb סתה (of the same root as
סתר, סתם, without any example, since סוּת, [Gen
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md), is certainly not derived from a
verb סוּת), to conceal, to veil, as the time of being overcast with
clouds, for in the East winter is the rainy season; (Arab.) shataā is
also used in the sense of rain itself (vid., D. M. Zeitsch. xx. 618);
and in the present day in Jerusalem, in the language of the people, no
other name is used for rain but shataā (not metar). The word סתיו, which
the Kerı̂ substitutes, only means that one must not read סתו, but סתו,
with long a; in the same way עניו, humble, from ענה, to be bowed down,
and שׂליו, a quail, from שׂלה, to be fat, are formed and written. Rain
is here, however, especially mentioned: it is called gěshěm, from
gāshǎm, to be thick, massy (cf. revīvīm, of density). With עבר, to pass
by, there is interchanged חלף, which, like (Arab.) khalaf, means
properly to press on, and then generally to move to another place, and
thus to remove from the place hitherto occupied. In לו הלך, with the
dat. ethicus, which throws back the action on the subject, the winter
rain is thought of as a person who has passed by. נצּן, with the
noun-ending n, is the same as ניסן, and signifies the flower, as the
latter the flower-month, floral; in the use of the word, נצּן is related
to נץ and נצּה, probably as little flower is to flower. In hǎzzāmīr the
idea of the song of birds (Arab. gharad) appears, and this is not to be
given up. The lxx, Aquila, Symm., Targ., Jerome, and the Venet.
translate tempus putationis: the time of the pruning of vines, which
indeed corresponds to the usus loq. (cf. זמר, to prune the vine, and
מזמרה, a pruning-knife), and to similar names, such as אסיף ingathering
of fruit, but supplies no reason for her being invited out into the open
fields, and is on this account improbable, because the poet further on
speaks for the first time of vines. זמר (זמּר) is an onomatopoeia, which
for the most part denotes song and music; why should זמיר thus not be
able to denote singing, like זמרה, - but not, at least not in this
passage, the singing of men (Hengst.), for they are not silent in
winter; but the singing of birds, which is truly a sign of the spring,
and as a characteristic feature, is added

(Note: It is true that besides in this passage zāmǎr, of the singing of
birds, is not demonstrable, the Arab. zamar is only used of the shrill
cry of the ostrich, and particularly the female ostrich.)

to this lovely picture of spring? Thus there is also suitably added the
mention of the turtle-dove, which is a bird of passage (vid., [Jer
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007).md), and therefore a messenger of
spring. נשׁמע is 3rd pret.: it makes itself heard.

The description of spring is finished by a reference to the fig-tree and
the vine, the standing attributes of a prosperous and peaceful
homestead, [Kg1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005.md); [Kg2
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#031.md). פּג (from פּנג, and thus named,
not from their hardness, but their delicacy) are the little fruits of
the fig-tree which now, when the harvest-rains are over, and the spring
commences with the equinox of Nisan, already begin to assume a red
colour; the verb חנט does not mean "to grow into a bulb," as Bttch.
imagines; it has only the two meanings, condire (condiri, post-bibl.
syn. of בּשׁל) and rubescere. From its colour, wheat has the name חטּה =
חנטה; and here also the idea of colour has the preference, for becoming
fragrant does not occur in spring-in the history of the cursing of the
fig-tree at the time of the Passover, Mark ([Mar
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013).md) says, "for the time of figs was
not yet." In fig-trees, by this time the green of the fruit-formation
changes its colour, and the vines are סמדר, blossom, i.e., are in a
state of bloom (lxx κυπρίζουσαι; cf. [Sol
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#013), κυπρισμός.md) - it is a clause such
as [Exo 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#031.md), and to which "they
diffuse fragrance" ([Sol 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013).md) is
parallel. This word סמדר is usually regarded as a compound word,
consisting of סם, scent, and סמדר, brightness = blossom (vid., Gesen.
Thes.); it is undeniable that there are such compound formations, e.g.,
שׁלאנן, from שׁלה and שׁאן; חלּמישׁ, from (Arab.) ḥams, to be hard, and
hals, to be dark-brown.

(Note: In like manner as (Arab.) karbsh, corrugare, is formed of karb,
to string, and karsh, to wrinkle, combined; and another extension of
karsh is kurnash, wrinkles, and mukarnash, wrinkled. "One day," said
Wetstein to me, "I asked an Arab the origin of the word karnasa, to
wrinkle, and he replied that it was derived from a sheep's stomach that
had lain over night, i.e., the stomach of a slaughtered sheep that had
lain over night, by which its smooth surface shrinks together and
becomes wrinkled. In fact, we say of a wrinkled countenance that it is
mathal alkarash albayt." With right Wetstein gathers from this curious
fact how difficult it is to ascertain by purely etymological
considerations the view which guided the Semites in this or that
designation. Samdor is also a strange word; on the one side it is
connected with sadr, of the veiling of the eyes, as the effect of
terror; and on the other with samd, of stretching oneself straight out.
E. Meier takes סמדר as the name of the vine-blossom, as changed from
סמסר, bristling. Just as unlikely as that סמד is cogn. to חמד, Jesurun,
p. 221.)

But the traditional reading סמדר (not סמדר) is unfavourable to this
view; the middle ā accordingly, as in צלצל, presents itself as an
ante-tone vowel (Ewald, 154a), and the stem-word appears as a quadril.
which may be the expansion of סדּר, to range, put in order in the sense
of placing asunder, unfolding. Symm. renders the word by οἰνάνθη, and
the Talm. idiom shows that not only the green five-leaved blossoms of
the vine were so named, but also the fruit-buds and the first shoots of
the grapes. Here, as the words "they diffuse fragrance" (as at 7:14 of
the mandrakes) show, the vine-blossom is meant which fills the vineyard
with an incomparably delicate fragrance. At the close of the invitation
to enjoy the spring, the call "Rise up," etc., with which it began, is
repeated. The Chethı̂b לכי, if not an error in writing, justly set aside
by the Kerı̂, is to be read לכי (cf. Syr. bechi, in thee, levotechi, to
thee, but with occult i) - a North Palestinism for לך, like [Kg2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#002.md), where the Kerı̂ has substituted
the usual form (vid., under Ps 103 introd.) for this very dialectic
form, which is there undoubtedly original.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 2:14</span></span>

Solomon further relates how he drew her to himself out of her
retirement:

My dove in the clefts of the rock,

In the hiding-place of the cliff;

Let me see thy countenance,

Let me hear thy voice!

For thy voice is sweet and thy countenance comely.

"Dove" (for which Castellio, columbula, like vulticulum, voculam) is a
name of endearment which Shulamith shares with the church of God, [Psa
74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019.md); cf. [Psa
56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md); [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md). The wood-pigeon builds its nest
in the clefts of the rocks and other steep rocky places, [Jer
48:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#028.md).

(Note: Wetstein's Reisebericht, p. 182: "If the Syrian wood-pigeon does
not find a pigeon-tower, περιστερεῶνα, it builds its nest in the hollows
of rocky precipices, or in the walls of deep and wide fountains." See
also his Nord-arabien, p. 58: "A number of scarcely accessible mountains
in Arabia are called alkunnat, a rock-nest.")

That Shulamith is thus here named, shows that, far removed from
intercourse with the world, her home was among the mountains. חגוי, from
חגו, or also חגוּ, requires a verb הגה = (Arab.) khajja, findere. (סל,
as a Himyar. lexicographer defines it, is a cleft into the mountains
after the nature of a defile; with צוּר, only the ideas of
inaccessibility and remoteness are connected; with סלע, those of a
secure hiding-place, and, indeed, a convenient, pleasant residence.
מדרגה is the stairs; here the rocky stairs, as the two chalk-cliffs on
the Rgen, which sink perpendicularly to the sea, are called
"Stubbenkammer," a corruption of the Slavonic Stupnhkamen, i.e., the
Stair-Rock. "Let me see," said he, as he called upon her with enticing
words, "thy countenance;" and adds this as a reason, "for thy
countenance is lovely." The word מראיך, thus pointed, is sing.; the Jod
Otians is the third root letter of ראי, retained only for the sake of
the eye. It is incorrect to conclude from ashrēch, in [Ecc
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#017.md), that the ech may be also the
plur. suff., which it can as little be as êhu in [Pro
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018.md); in both cases the sing. ěshěr
has substituted itself for ashrē. But, inversely, mǎraīch cannot be
sing.; for the sing. is simply marēch. Also mǎrāv, [Job
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md), is not sing.: the sing. is
marēhu, [Job 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#016.md); [Sol
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015.md). On the other hand, the
determination of such forms as מראינוּ, מראיהם, is difficult: these
forms may be sing. as well as plur. In the passage before us, מראים is
just such a non-numer. plur. as פנים. But while panīm is an extensive
plur., as Bttcher calls it: the countenance, in its extension and the
totality of its parts, - marīm, like marōth, vision, a stately term,
[Exo 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002.md) (vid., Deitrich's Abhand. p.
19), is an amplificative plur.: the countenance, on the side of its
fulness of beauty and its overpowering impression.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sol 2:15</span></span>

There now follows a cantiuncula. Shulamith comes forward, and, singing,
salutes her beloved. Their love shall celebrate a new spring. Thus she
wishes everything removed, or rendered harmless, that would disturb the
peace of this love:

15 Catch us the foxes, the little foxes,

The spoilers of the vineyards;

For our vineyards are in bloom!

16 My beloved is mine, and I am his;

Who feeds his flock among the lilies.

If the king is now, on this visit of the beloved, engaged in hunting,
the call: "Catch us," etc., if it is directed at all to any definite
persons, is addressed to those who follow him. But this is a
vine-dresser's ditty, in accord with Shulamith's experience as the
keeper of a vineyard, which, in a figure, aims at her love-relation. The
vineyards, beautiful with fragrant blossom, point to her covenant of
love; and the foxes, the little foxes, which might destroy these united
vineyards, point to all the great and little enemies and adverse
circumstances which threaten to gnaw and destroy love in the blossom,
ere it has reached the ripeness of full enjoyment. שׁעלים comprehends
both foxes and jackals, which "destroy or injure the vineyards; because,
by their holes and passages which they form in the ground, loosening the
soil, so that the growth and prosperity of the vine suffers injury"
(Hitzig). This word is from שׁעל (R. של), to go down, or into the depth.
The little foxes are perhaps the jackals, which are called tǎnnīm, from
their extended form, and in height are seldom more than fifteen inches.
The word "jackal" has nothing to do with שׁוּעל, but is the
Persian-Turkish shaghal, which comes from the Sanscr. crgâla, the howler
(R. krag, like kap-âla, the skull; R. kap, to be arched). Moreover, the
mention of the foxes naturally follows 14a, for they are at home among
rocky ravines. Hitzig supposes Shulamith to address the foxes: hold for
us = wait, ye rascals! But אחז, Aram. אחד, does not signify to wait, but
to seize or lay hold of (synon. לכד, [Jdg
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#004).md), as the lion its prey, [Isa
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#029.md). And the plur. of address is
explained from its being made to the king's retinue, or to all who could
and would give help. Fox-hunting is still, and has been from old times,
a sport of rich landowners; and that the smaller landowners also sought
to free themselves from them by means of snares or otherwise, is a
matter of course, - they are proverbially as destroyers, Neh. 3:35
\[4:3\], and therefore a figure of the false prophets, [Eze
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#004.md). מחבּ כּרם are here instead of
מחבּלי הכּרם. The articles are generally omitted, because poetry is not
fond of the article, where, as here (cf. on the other hand, [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006).md), the thoughts and language permit
it; and the fivefold m is an intentional mere verborum sonus. The clause
וּכר סמדר is an explanatory one, as appears from the Vav and the subj.
preceding, as well as from the want of a finitum. סמדר maintains here
also, in pausa, the sharpening of the final syllable, as חץ, [Deu
28:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#042.md).

The 16th verse is connected with the 15th. Shulamith, in the pentast.
song, celebrates her love-relation; for the praise of it extends into
[Sol 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015.md), is continued in [Sol
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md), and not till [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md) does she address her beloved.
Luther translates:

My beloved is mine, and I am his;

He feeds (his flock) among the roses.

He has here also changed the "lilies" of the Vulgate into "roses;" for
of the two queens among the flowers, he gave the preference to the
popular and common rose; besides, he rightly does not translate הרעה, in
the mid. after the pascitur inter lilia of the Vulgate: who feeds
himself, i.e., pleases himself; for רעה has this meaning only when the
object expressly follows, and it is evident that בּשּׁו cannot possibly
be this object, after [Gen 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#002.md), - the
object is thus to be supplied. And which? Without doubt, gregem; and if
Heiligst., with the advocates of the shepherd-hypothesis, understands
this feeding (of the flock) among the lilies, of feeding on a flowery
meadow, nothing can be said against it. But at [Sol
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002.md)., where this saying of Shulamith
is repeated, she says that her beloved בּגּנּים feeds and gathers
lilies. On this the literal interpretation of the qui pascit (gregem)
inter lilia is wrecked; for a shepherd, such as the shepherd-hypothesis
supposes, were he to feed his flock in a garden, would be nothing better
than a thief; such shepherds, also, do not concern themselves with the
plucking of flowers, but spend their time in knitting stockings. It is
Solomon, the king, of whom Shulamith speaks. She represents him to
herself as a shepherd; but in such a manner that, at the same time, she
describes his actions in language which rises above ordinary
shepherd-life, and, so to speak, idealizes. She, who was herself a
shepherdess, knows from her own circle of thought nothing more lovely or
more honourable to conceive and to say of him, than that he is a
shepherd who feeds among lilies. The locality and the surroundings of
his daily work correspond to his nature, which is altogether beauty and
love. Lilies, the emblem of unapproachable highness, awe-inspiring
purity, lofty elevation above what is common, bloom where the lily-like
(king) wanders, whom the Lily names her own. The mystic interpretation
and mode of speaking takes "lilies" as the figurative name of holy
souls, and a lily-stalk as the symbol of the life of regeneration. Mary,
who is celebrated in song as the rosa mystica, is rightly represented in
ancient pictures with a lily in her hand on the occasion of the
Annunciation; for if the people of God are called by Jewish poets "a
people of lilies," she is, within this lily-community, this communio
sanctorum, the lily without a parallel.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sol 2:17</span></span>

Shulamith now further relates, in a dramatic, lively manner, what she
said to her beloved after she had saluted him in a song:

17 Till the day cools and the shadows flee away,

Turn; make haste, my beloved,

Like a gazelle or a young one of the hinds

On the craggy mountains.

With the perf., עד שׁ (cf. אם עד, [Gen
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#033).md) signifies, till something is
done; with the fut., till something will be done. Thus: till the evening
comes - and, therefore, before it comes - may he do what she requires of
him. Most interpreters explain סב, verte te, with the supplement ad me;
according to which Jerome, Castell., and others translate by revertere.
But [Psa 71:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#021.md) does not warrant this
rendering; and if Shulamith has her beloved before her, then by סב she
can only point him away from herself; the parall. [Sol
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014.md) has בּרח instead of סב, which
consequently means, "turn thyself from here away." Rather we may
suppose, as I explained in 1851, that she holds him in her embrace, as
she says, and inseparable from him, will wander with him upon the
mountains. But neither that ad me nor this mecum should have been here
(cf. on the contrary [Sol 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014).md)
unexpressed. We hold by what is written. Solomon surprises Shulamith,
and invites her to enjoy with him the spring-time; not alone, because he
is on a hunting expedition, and - as denoted by "catch us" (v. 15) -
with a retinue of followers. She knows that the king has not now time to
wander at leisure with her; and therefore she asks him to set forward
his work for the day, and to make haste on the mountains till "the day
cools and the shadows flee." Then she will expect him back; then in the
evening she will spend the time with him as he promised her. The verb
פּוּח, with the guttural letter Hheth and the labial Pe, signifies
spirare, here of being able to be breathed, i.e., cool, like the
expression ha' רוּח, [Gen 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#008.md) (where
the guttural Hheth is connected with Resh). The shadows flee away, when
they become longer and longer, as if on a flight, when they stretch out
([Psa 109:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#023.md); [Psa
102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012).md) and gradually disappear. Till
that takes place - or, as we say, will be done - he shall hasten with
the swiftness of a gazelle on the mountains, and that on the mountains
of separation, i.e., the riven mountains, which thus present hindrances,
but which he, the "swift as the gazelle" (vid., [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009).md), easily overcomes. Rightly,
Bochart: montes scissionis, ita dicti propter, ῥωξημούς et χάσματα.
Also, Luther's "Scheideberge" are "mountains with peaks, from one of
which to the other one must spring." We must not here think of Bithron
([Sa2 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#029).md), for that is a mountain
ravine on the east of Jordan; nor of Bar-Cochba's ביתר (Kirschbau,
Landau), because this mountain (whether it be sought for to the south of
Jerusalem or to be north of Antipatris) ought properly to be named ביתתר
(vid., Aruch). It is worthy of observation, that in an Assyrian list of
the names of animals, along with ṣbi (gazelle) and apparu (the young of
the gazelle or of the hind), the name bitru occurs, perhaps the name of
the rupicapra. At the close of the song, the expression "mountain of
spices" occurs instead of "mountain of separation," as here. There no
more hindrances to be overcome lie in view, the rock-cliffs have become
fragrant flowers. The request here made by Shulamith breathes
self-denying humility, patient modesty, inward joy in the joy of her
beloved. She will not claim him for herself till he has accomplished his
work. But when he associates with her in the evening, as with the Emmaus
disciples, she will rejoice if he becomes her guide through the new-born
world of spring. The whole scene permits, yea, moves us to think of
this, that the Lord already even now visits the church which loves Him,
