### [Numbers Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 24:1</span></span>

The third saying. - [Num 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001.md) and [Num
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#002.md). From the two revelations which
he had received before, Balaam, saw, i.e., perceived, that it pleased
Jehovah to bless Israel. This induced him not to go out for auguries, as
on the previous occasions. כּפעם־בּפעם, "as time after time," i.e., as
at former times ([Num 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003.md) and [Num
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#015).md). He therefore turned his face
to the desert, i.e., to the steppes of Moab, where Israel was encamped
([Num 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001).md). And when he lifted up his
eyes, "he saw Israel encamping according to its tribes; and the Spirit
of God came over him." The impression made upon him by the sight of the
tribes of Israel, served as the subjective preparation for the reception
of the Spirit of God to inspire him. Of both the earlier utterances it
is stated that "Jehovah put a word into his mouth" ([Num
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#005.md) and [Num
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#016).md); but of this third it is
affirmed that "the Spirit of God came over him." The former were
communicated to him, when he went out for a divine revelation, without
his being thrown into an ecstatic state; he heard the voice of God
within him telling him what he was to say. But this time, like the
prophets in their prophesyings, he was placed by the Spirit of God in a
state of ecstatic sight; so that, with his eyes closed as in
clairvoyance, he saw the substance of the revelation from God with his
inward mental eye, which had been opened by the Spirit of God. Thus not
only does he himself describe his own condition in [Num
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md) and [Num
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004.md), but his description is in
harmony with the announcement itself, which is manifestly the result
both in form and substance of the intuition effected within him by the
Spirit of God.

[Numbers 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 24:3</span></span>

[Num 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md) and [Num
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004.md) contain the preface to the
prophecy: "The divine saying of Balaam the son of Beor, the divine
saying of the man with closed eye, the divine saying of the hearer of
divine words, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down and with
opened eyes." For the participial noun נאם the meaning divine saying
(effatum, not inspiratum, Domini) is undoubtedly established by the
expression יהוה נאם, which recurs in [Num
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028.md) and [Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md), and is of constant use in the
predictions of the prophets; and this applies even to the few passages
where a human author is mentioned instead of Jehovah, such as [Num
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md), [Num
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004.md), and [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md), [Num
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#016.md); also [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md); [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md); and [Psa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002.md), where a נאם is ascribed to the
personified wickedness. Hence, when Balaam calls the following prophecy
a נאם, this is done for the purpose of designating it as a divine
revelation received from the Spirit of God. He had received it, and now
proclaimed it as a man העין שׁתם, with closed eye. שׁתם does not mean to
open, a meaning in support of which only one passage of the Mishnah can
be adduced, but to close, like סתם in [Dan
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026.md), and שׁתם in [Lam
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#008.md), with the שׁ softened into ס or שׂ
(see Roediger in Ges. thes., and Dietrich's Hebrew Lexicon). "Balaam
describes himself as the man with closed eye with reference to his state
of ecstasy, in which the closing of the outer senses went hand in hand
with the opening of the inner" (Hengstenberg). The cessation of all
perception by means of the outer senses, so far as self-conscious
reflection is concerned, was a feature that was common to both the
vision and the dream, the two forms in which the prophetic gift
manifested itself ([Num 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006).md), and
followed from the very nature of the inward intuition. In the case of
prophets whose spiritual life was far advanced, inspiration might take
place without any closing of the outward senses. But upon men like
Balaam, whose inner religious life was still very impure and
undeveloped, the Spirit of God could only operate by closing their
outward senses to impressions from the lower earthly world, and raising
them up to visions of the higher and spiritual world.

(Note: Hence, as Hengstenberg observes (Balaam, p. 449), we have to
picture Balaam as giving utterance to his prophecies with the eyes of
his body closed; though we cannot argue from the fact of his being in
this condition, that an Isaiah would be in precisely the same. Compare
the instructive information concerning analogous phenomena in the sphere
of natural mantik and ecstasy in Hengstenberg (pp. 449ff.), and
Tholuck's Propheten, pp. 49ff.)

What Balaam heard in this ecstatic condition was אל אמרי, the sayings of
God, and what he saw שׁדּי מחזה, the vision of the Almighty. The Spirit
of God came upon him with such power that he fell down (נפל), like Saul
in [Sa1 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#024.md); not merely "prostrating
himself with reverential awe at seeing and hearing the things of God"
(Knobel), but thrown to the ground by the Spirit of God, who "came like
an armed man upon the seer," and that in such a way that as he fell his
(spirit's) eyes were opened. This introduction to his prophecy is not an
utterance of boasting vanity; but, as Calvin correctly observes, "the
whole preface has no other tendency than to prove that he was a true
prophet of God, and had received the blessing which he uttered from a
celestial oracle."

The blessing itself in [Num 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#005.md).
contains two thoughts: (1) the glorious prosperity of Israel, and the
exaltation of its kingdom ([Num
24:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#005)); (2.md) the terrible power, so
fatal to all its foes, of the people which was set to be a curse or a
blessing to all the nations ([Num
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md), [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009).md).

[Numbers 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 24:5</span></span>

"How beautiful are thy tents, O Jacob! thy dwellings, O Israel! Like
valleys are they spread out, like gardens by the stream, like aloes
which Jehovah has planted, like cedars by the waters. Water will flow
out of his buckets, and his seed is by many waters. And loftier than
Agag be his king, and his kingdom will be exalted." What Balaam had seen
before his ecstasy with his bodily eyes, formed the substratum for his
inward vision, in which the dwellings of Israel came before his mental
eye adorned with the richest blessing from the Lord. The description
starts, it is true, from the time then present, but it embraces the
whole future of Israel. In the blessed land of Canaan the dwellings of
Israel will spread out like valleys. נחלים does not mean brooks here,
but valleys watered by brooks. נטּה, to extend oneself, to stretch or
spread out far and wide. Yea, "like gardens by the stream," which are
still more lovely than the grassy and flowery valleys with brooks. This
thought is carried out still further in the two following figures. אהלים
are aloe-trees, which grow in the East Indies, in Siam, in Cochin China,
and upon the Moluccas, and from which the aloe-wood was obtained, that
was so highly valued in the preparation of incense, on account of its
fragrance. As the aloes were valued for their fragrant smell, so the
cedars were valued on account of their lofty and luxuriant growth, and
the durability of their wood. The predicate, "which Jehovah hath
planted," corresponds, so far as the actual meaning is concerned, to מים
עלי, "by water;" for this was "an expression used to designate trees
that, on account of their peculiar excellence, were superior to ordinary
trees" (Calvin; cf. [Psa 104:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#016).md).

[Numbers 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 24:7</span></span>

And not only its dwellings, but Israel itself would also prosper
abundantly. It would have an abundance of water, that leading source of
all blessing and prosperity in the burning East. The nation is
personified as a man carrying two pails overflowing with water. דּליו is
the dual דּליים. The dual is generally used in connection with objects
which are arranged in pairs, either naturally or artificially (Ges. 88,
2). "His seed" (i.e., his posterity, not his sowing corn, the
introduction of which, in this connection, would, to say the least, be
very feeble here) "is," i.e., grows up, "by many waters," that is to
say, enjoys the richest blessings (comp. [Deu
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md) and [Deu
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010.md) with [Isa
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004.md); [Isa
65:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#023)). ירם (optative.md), "his king be
high before (higher than) Agag." Agag (עגג, the fiery) is not the proper
name of the Amalekite king defeated by Saul ([Sa1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#008).md), but the title (nomen
dignitatis) of the Amalekite kings in general, just as all the Egyptian
kings had the common name of Pharaoh, and the Philistine kings the name
of Abimelech.

(Note: See Hengstenberg (Dissertations, ii. 250; and Balaam, p. 458).
Even Gesenius could not help expressing some doubt about there being any
reference in this prophecy to the event described in [Sa1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#008.md)., "unless," he says, "you suppose
the name Agag to have been a name that was common to the kings of the
Amalekites" (thes. p. 19). He also points to the name Abimelech, of
which he says (p. 9): "It was the name of several kings in the land of
the Philistines, as of the king of Gerar in the times of Abraham ([Gen
20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#002.md); [Gen
21:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022).md), and of Isaac ([Gen
26:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001).md), and also of the king of Gath
in the time of David ([Psa 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md); coll.
[Sa1 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md), where the same king of
called Achish). It seems to have been the common name and title of those
kings, as Pharaoh was of the early kings of Egypt, and Caesar and
Augustus of the emperors of Rome.")

The reason for mentioning the king of the Amalekites was, that he was
selected as the impersonation of the enmity of the world against the
kingdom of God, which culminated in the kings of the heathen; the
Amalekites having been the first heathen tribe that attacked the
Israelites on their journey to Canaan ([Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008).md). The introduction of one
particular king would have been neither in keeping with the context, nor
reconcilable with the general character of Balaam's utterances. Both
before and afterward, Balaam predicts in great general outlines the good
that would come to Israel; and how is it likely that he would suddenly
break off in the midst to compare the kingdom of Israel with the
greatness of one particular king of the Amalekites? Even his fourth and
last prophecy merely announces in great general terms the destruction of
the different nations that rose up in hostility against Israel, without
entering into special details, which, like the conquest of the
Amalekites by Saul, had no material or permanent influence upon the
attitude of the heathen towards the people of God; for after the defeat
inflicted upon this tribe by Saul, they very speedily invaded the
Israelitish territory again, and proceeded to plunder and lay it waste
in just the same manner as before (cf. [Sa1
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md); [Sa1
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001.md).; [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012).md).

(Note: Even on the supposition (which is quite at variance with the
character of all the prophecies of Balaam) that in the name of Agag, the
contemporary of Saul, we have a vaticinium ex eventu, the allusion to
this particular king would be exceedingly strange, as the Amalekites did
not perform any prominent part among the enemies of Israel in the time
of Saul; and the command to exterminate them was given to Saul, not
because of any special harm that they had done to Israel at that time,
but on account of what they had done to Israel on their way out of Egypt
(comp. [Sa1 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002.md) with [Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008))..md)

מלכּו, his king, is not any one particular king of Israel, but quite
generally the king whom the Israelites would afterwards receive. For
מלכּו is substantially the same as the parallel מלכתו, the kingdom of
Israel, which had already been promised to the patriarchs ([Gen
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#006.md); [Gen
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#011).md), and in which the Israelites
were first of all to obtain that full development of power which
corresponded to its divine appointment; just as, in fact, the
development of any people generally culminates in an organized kingdom.
- The king of Israel, whose greatness was celebrated by Balaam, was
therefore neither the Messiah exclusively, nor the earthly kingdom
without the Messiah, but the kingdom of Israel that was established by
David, and was exalted in the Messiah into an everlasting kingdom, the
enemies of which would all be made its footstool ([Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md) and [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001).md).

[Numbers 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 24:8</span></span>

In [Num 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md) and [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md), Balaam proclaims still further:
"God leads him out of Egypt; his strength is as that of a buffalo: he
will devour nations his enemies, and crush their bones, and dash them in
pieces with his arrows. He has encamped, he lies down like a lion, and
like a lioness: who can drive him up? Blessed be they who bless thee,
and cursed they who curse thee!" The fulness of power that dwelt in the
people of Israel was apparent in the force and prowess with which their
God brought them out of Egypt. This fact Balaam repeats from the
previous saying ([Num 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022).md), for the
purpose of linking on to it the still further announcement of the manner
in which the power of the nation would show itself upon its foes in time
to come. The words, "he will devour nations," call up the image of a
lion, which is employed in [Num 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md)
to depict the indomitable heroic power of Israel, in words taken from
Jacob's blessing in [Gen 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md). The
Piel גּרם is a denom. verb from גּרם, with the meaning to destroy, crush
the bones, like שׁרשׁ, to root out (cf. Ges. 52, 2; Ewald, 120, e.).
הצּיו is not the object to ימחץ; for מחץ, to dash to pieces, does not
apply to arrows, which may be broken in pieces, but not dashed to
pieces; and the singular suffix in חצּיו can only apply to the singular
idea in the verse, i.e., to Israel, and not to its enemies, who are
spoken of in the plural. Arrows are singled out as representing weapons
in general.

(Note: The difficulty which many feel in connection with the word חצּיו
cannot be removed by alterations of the text. The only possible
conjecture חלציו (his loins) is wrecked upon the singular suffix, for
the dashing to pieces of the loins of Israel is not for a moment to be
thought of. Knobel's proposal, viz., to read קמיו, has no support in
[Deu 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#011.md), and is much too violent to
reckon upon any approval.)

Balaam closes this utterance, as he had done the previous one, with a
quotation from Jacob's blessing, which he introduces to show to Balak,
that, according to words addressed by Jehovah to the Israelites through
their own tribe-father, they were to overcome their foes so thoroughly,
that none of them should venture to rise up against them again. To this
he also links on the words with which Isaac had transferred to Jacob in
[Gen 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md) the blessing of Abraham in
[Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md), for the purpose of warning
Balak to desist from his enmity against the chosen people of God.

[Numbers 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 24:10</span></span>

This repeated blessing of Israel threw Balak into such a violent rage,
that he smote his hands together, and advised Balaam to fly to his
house: adding, "I said, I will honour thee greatly (cf. [Num
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#017.md) and [Num
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#037).md); but, behold, Jehovah has kept
thee back from honour." "Smiting the hands together" was either a sign
of horror ([Lam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015).md) or of violent
rage; it is in the latter sense that it occurs both here and in [Job
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023.md). In the words, "Jehovah hath
kept thee back from honour," the irony with which Balak scoffs at
Balaam's confidence in Jehovah is unmistakeable.

[Numbers 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 24:12</span></span>

But Balaam reminds him, on the other hand, of the declaration which he
made to the messengers at the very outset ([Num
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#018).md), that he could not on any
account speak in opposition to the command of Jehovah, and then adds,
"And now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will tell thee advisedly
what this people will do to thy people at the end of the days." יעץ, to
advise; here it denotes an announcement, which includes advice. The
announcement of what Israel would do to the Moabites in the future,
contains the advice to Balak, what attitude he should assume towards
Israel, if this people was to bring a blessing upon his own people and
not a curse. On "the end of the days," see at [Gen
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md).

[Numbers 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 24:15</span></span>

Balaam's fourth and last prophecy is distinguished from the previous
ones by the fact that, according to the announcement in [Num
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014.md), it is occupied exclusively with
the future, and foretells the victorious supremacy of Israel over all
its foes, and the destruction of all the powers of the world. This
prophecy is divided into four different prophecies by the fourfold
repetition of the words, "he took up his parable" ([Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md), [Num
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020.md), [Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md), and [Num
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#023).md). The first of these refers to
the two nations that were related to Israel, viz., Edom and Moab ([Num
24:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017).md); the second to Amalek, the
arch-enemy of Israel ([Num 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020).md); the
third to the Kenites, who were allied to Israel ([Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md) and [Num
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#022).md); and the fourth proclaims the
overthrow of the great powers of the world ([Num
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#023.md) and [Num
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024).md). - The introduction in [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md) and [Num
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#016.md) is the same as that of the
previous prophecy in [Num 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md) and
[Num 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004.md), except that the words, "he
which knew the knowledge of the Most High," are added to the expression,
"he that heard the words of God," to show that Balaam possessed the
knowledge of the Most High, i.e., that the word of God about to be
announced had already been communicated to him, and was not made known
to him now for the first time; though without implying that he had
received the divine revelation about to be uttered at the same time as
those which he had uttered before.

[Numbers 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 24:17</span></span>

The prophecy itself commences with a picture from the "end of the days,"
which rises up before the mental eye of the seer. "I see Him, yet not
now; I behold Him, but not nigh. A star appears out of Jacob, and a
sceptre rises out of Israel, and dashes Moab in pieces on both sides,
and destroys all the sons of confusion." The suffixes to אראנּוּ and
עשׁוּרנּוּ refer to the star which is mentioned afterwards, and which
Balaam sees in spirit, but "not now," i.e., not as having already
appeared, and "not nigh," i.e., not to appear immediately, but to come
forth out of Israel in the far distant future. "A star is so natural an
image and symbol of imperial greatness and splendour, that it has been
employed in this sense in almost every nation. And the fact that this
figure and symbol are so natural, may serve to explain the belief of the
ancient world, that the birth and accession of great kings was announced
by the appearance of stars" (Hengstenberg, who cites Justini hist.
xxxvii. 2; Plinii h. n. ii. 23; Sueton. Jul. Caes. c. 78; and Dio Cass.
xlv. p. 273). If, however, there could be any doubt that the rising star
represented the appearance of a glorious ruler or king, it would be
entirely removed by the parallel, "a sceptre arises out of Israel." The
sceptre, which was introduced as a symbol of dominion even in Jacob's
blessing ([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md), is employed
here as the figurative representation and symbol of the future ruler in
Israel. This ruler would destroy all the enemies of Israel. Moab and
([Num 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018).md) Edom are the first of
these that are mentioned, viz., the two nations that were related to
Israel by descent, but had risen up in hostility against it at that
time. Moab stands in the foremost rank, not merely because Balaam was
about to announce to the king of Moab what Israel would do to his people
in the future, but also because the hostility of the heathen to the
people of God had appeared most strongly in Balak's desire to curse the
Israelites. מואב פּאתי, "the two corners or sides of Moab," equivalent
to Moab on both sides, from one end to the other. For קרקר, the inf.
Pilp. of קוּר or קיר, the meaning to destroy is fully established by the
parallel מחץ, and by [Isa 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#005.md),
whatever may be thought of its etymology and primary meaning. And
neither the Samaritan text nor the passage in Jeremiah ([Jer
48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045).md), which is based upon this
prophecy, at all warrants an alteration of the reading קרקר into קדקד
(the crown of the head), since Jeremiah almost invariably uses earlier
writing in this free manner, viz., by altering the expressions employed,
and substituting in the place of unusual words wither more common ones,
or such as are similar in sound (cf. Kper, Jerem. libror, ss. interpres
atque vindex, pp. xii.ff. and p. 43). - כּל־בּני־שׁת does not mean "all
the sons of Seth," i.e., all mankind, as the human race is never called
by the name of Seth; and the idea that the ruler to arise out of Israel
would destroy all men, would be altogether unsuitable. It signifies
rather "all the sons of confusion," by which, according to the analogy
of Jacob and Israel ([Num 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017).md), Edom
and Seir ([Num 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018).md), the Moabites
are to be understood as being men of wild, warlike confusion. שׁת is a
contraction of שׁאת ([Lam 3:47](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#047).md), and
derived from שׁאה; and in [Jer 48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045.md)
it is correctly rendered שׁאון בּני.

(Note: On the other hand, the rendering, "all the sons of the drinker,
i.e., of Lot," which Hiller proposed, and v. Hoffmann and Kurtz have
renewed, is evidently untenable. For, in the first place, the fact
related in [Gen 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#032.md). does not
warrant the assumption that Lot ever received the name of the "drinker,"
especially as the word used in Gen 19 is not שׁתה, but שׁקה. Moreover,
the allusion to "all the sons of Lot," i.e., the Moabites and Ammonites,
neither suits the thoroughly synonymous parallelism in the saying of
Balaam, nor corresponds to the general character of his prophecies,
which announced destruction primarily only to those nations that rose up
in hostility against Israel, viz., Moab, Edom, and Amalek, whereas
hitherto the Ammonites had not assumed either a hostile or friendly
attitude towards them. And lastly, all the nations doomed to destruction
are mentioned by name. Now the Ammonites were not a branch of the
Moabites by descent, nor was their territory enclosed within the
Moabitish territory, so that it could be included, as Hoffmann supposes,
within the "four corners of Moab.")

In the announcement of destruction which is to fall upon the enemies of
Israel through the star and sceptre out of the midst of it, Moab is
followed by "its southern neighbour Edom."

[Numbers 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 24:18</span></span>

"And Edom becomes a possession, and Seir becomes a possession, its
enemies; but Israel acquires power." Whose possession Edom and Seir are
to become, is not expressly stated; but it is evident from the context,
and from איביו (its enemies), which is not a genitive dependent upon
Seir, but is in apposition to Edom and Seir, just as צריו in [Num
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md) is in apposition to גּוים. Edom
and Seir were his, i.e., Israel's enemies; therefore they were to be
taken by the ruler who was to arise out of Israel. Edom is the name of
the people, Seir of the country, just as in [Gen
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#004.md); so that Seir is not to be
understood as relating to the prae-Edomitish population of the land,
which had been subjugated by the descendants of Esau, and had lost all
its independence a long time before. In Moses' days the Israelites were
not allowed to fight with the Edomites, even when they refused to allow
them to pass peaceably through their territory (see [Num
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#021).md), but were commanded to leave
them in their possessions as a brother nation ([Deu
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004).md). In the future, however, their
relation to one another was to be a very different one; because the
hostility of Edom, already in existence, grew more and more into
obstinate and daring enmity, which broke up all the ties of affection
that Israel was to regard as holy, and thus brought about the
destruction of the Edomites. - The fulfilment of this prophecy commenced
with the subjugation of the Edomites by David ([Sa2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014.md); [Kg1
11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015.md); [Ch1
18:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012).md), but it will not be
completed till "the end of the days," when all the enemies of God and
His Church will be made the footstool of Christ ([Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001)..md). That David did not complete
the subjugation of Edom is evident, on the one hand, from the fact that
the Edomites revolted again under Solomon, though without success ([Kg1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014)..md); that they shook off the yoke
imposed upon them under Joram ([Kg2
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020).md); and notwithstanding their
defeat by Amaziah ([Kg2 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md); [Ch2
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#011).md) and Uzziah ([Kg2
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022.md); [Ch2
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#002).md), invaded Judah a second time
under Ahaz ([Ch2 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017).md), and
afterwards availed themselves of every opportunity to manifest their
hostility to the kingdom of Judah and the Jews generally, - as for
example at the conquest of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans ([Eze
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015.md); [Eze
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005.md); [Oba
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010.md) and [Oba
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#013).md), and in the wars between the
Maccabees and the Syrians (1 Macc. 5:3, 65; 2 Macc. 10:15; 12:38ff.), -
until they were eventually conquered by John Hyrcanus in the year b.c.
129, and compelled to submit to circumcision, and incorporated in the
Jewish state (Josephus, Ant. xiii. 9, 1, xv. 7, 9; Wars of the Jews, iv.
5, 5). But notwithstanding this, they got the government over the Jews
into their own hands through Antipater and Herod (Josephus, Ant. xiv. 8,
5), and only disappeared from the stage of history with the destruction
of the Jewish state by the Romans. On the other hand, the declarations
of the prophets ([Amo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md); [Oba
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017)..md), which foretell, with an
unmistakeable allusion to this prophecy, the possession of the remnant
of Edom by the kingdom of Israel, and the announcements in Isa 34 and
[Isa 63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md), [Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md)., [Eze
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md). and [Eze
35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md), comp. with [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md) and [Lam
4:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md), prove still more clearly that
Edom, as the leading foe of the kingdom of God, will only be utterly
destroyed when the victory of the latter over the hostile power of the
world has been fully and finally secured. - Whilst Edom falls, Israel
will acquire power. חיל עשׂה, to acquire ability or power ([Deu
8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#017.md); [Rut
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011).md), not merely to show itself brave
or strong. It is rendered correctly by Onkelos, "prosperabitur in
opibus;" and Jonathan, "praevalebunt in opibus et possidebunt eos."

[Numbers 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 24:19</span></span>

"And a ruler shall come out of Jacob, and destroy what is left out of
cities." The subject to ירדּ is indefinite, and to be supplied from the
verb itself. We have to think of the ruler foretold as star and sceptre.
The abbreviated form וירדּ is not used for the future ירדּה, but is
jussive in its force. One out of Jacob shall rule. מעיר is employed in a
collected and general sense, as in [Psa
72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016.md). Out of every city in which
there is a remnant of Edom, it shall be destroyed. שׁריד is equivalent
to אדום שׁארית ([Amo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012).md). The
explanation, "destroy the remnant out of the city, namely, out of the
holy city of Jerusalem" (Ewald and Baur), is forced, and cannot be
sustained from the parallelism.

[Numbers 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 24:20</span></span>

The second saying in this prophecy relates to the Amalekites. Balaam
sees them, not with the eyes of his body, but in a state of ecstasy,
like the star out of Jacob. "Beginning of the heathen is Amalek, and its
end is destruction." Amalek is called the beginning of the nations, not
"as belonging to the most distinguished and foremost of the nations in
age, power, and celebrity" (Knobel), - for in all these respects this
Bedouin tribe, which descended from a grandson of Esau, was surpassed by
many other nations, - but as the first heathen nation which opened the
conflict of the heathen nations against Israel as the people of God (see
at [Exo 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008)..md). As its beginning had
been enmity against Israel, its end would be "even to the perishing"
(אבד עדי), i.e., reaching the position of one who was perishing, falling
into destruction, which commenced under Saul and was completed under
Hezekiah.

[Numbers 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 24:21</span></span>

The third saying relates to the Kenites, whose origin is involved in
obscurity (see at [Gen 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019).md), as
there are no other Kenites mentioned in the whole of the Old Testament,
with the exception of [Gen 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019.md), than
the Kenites who went to Canaan with Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses
([Num 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md).: see [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md); [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md); [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md); [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010.md); [Sa1
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#029).md); so that there are not
sufficient grounds for the distinction between Canaanitish and
Midianitish Kenites, as Michaelis, Hengstenberg, and others suppose. The
hypothesis that Balaam is speaking of Canaanitish Kenites, or of the
Kenites as representatives of the Canaanites, is as unfounded as the
hypothesis that by the Kenites we are to understand the Midianites, or
that the Kenites mentioned here and in [Gen
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019.md) are a branch of the supposed
aboriginal Amalekites (Ewald). The saying concerning the Kenites runs
thus: "Durable is thy dwelling-place, and thy nest laid upon the rock;
for should Kain be destroyed until Asshur shall carry thee captive?"
This saying "applies to friends and not to foes of Israel" (v.
Hoffmann), so that it is perfectly applicable to the Kenites, who were
friendly with Israel. The antithetical association of the Amalekites and
Kenites answers perfectly to the attitude assumed at Horeb towards
Israel, on the one hand by the Amalekites, and on the other hand by the
Kenites, in the person of Jethro the leader of their tribe (see [Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008)., Ex 18.md). The dwelling-place of
the Kenites was of lasting duration, because its nest was laid upon a
rock (שׂים is a passive participle, as in [Sa2
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#032.md), and [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004).md). This description of the
dwelling-place of the Kenites cannot be taken literally, because it
cannot be shown that either the Kenites or the Midianites dwelt in
inaccessible mountains, as the Edomites are said to have done in [Oba
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003.md); [Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016.md). The words are to be interpreted
figuratively, and in all probability the figure is taken from the rocky
mountains of Horeb, in the neighbourhood of which the Kenites led a
nomade life before their association with Israel (see at [Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001).md). As v. Hoffmann correctly
observes: "Kain, which had left its inaccessible mountain home in Horeb,
enclosed as it was by the desert, to join a people who were only
wandering in search of a home, by that very act really placed its rest
upon a still safer rock." This is sustained in [Num
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#022.md) by the statement that Kain would
not be given up to destruction till Asshur carried it away into
captivity. אם כּי does not mean "nevertheless." It signifies "unless"
after a negative clause, whether the negation be expressed directly by
לא, or indirectly by a question; and "only" where it is not preceded by
either a direct or an indirect negation, as in [Gen
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#014.md); [Job
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#008.md). The latter meaning, however, is
not applicable here, because it is unsuitable to the עד־מה (until) which
follows. Consequently אם yl can only be understood in the sense of "is
it that," as in [Kg1 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#027.md); [Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md); [Job
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016.md), etc., and as introducing an
indirect query in a negative sense: "For is it (the case) that Kain
shall fall into destruction until...?" - equivalent to "Kain shall not
be exterminated until Asshur shall carry him away into captivity;" Kain
will only be overthrown by the Assyrian imperial power. Kain, the
tribe-father, is used poetically for the Kenite, the tribe of which he
was the founder. בּער, to exterminate, the sense in which it frequently
occurs, as in [Deu 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md); [Deu
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007.md), etc. (cf. [Sa2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#011.md); [Kg1
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#047).md). - For the fulfilment of this
prophecy we are not to look merely to the fact that one branch of the
Kenites, which separated itself, according to [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md), from its comrades in the south
of Judah, and settled in Naphtali near Kadesh, was probably carried away
into captivity by Tiglath-Pileser along with the population of Galilee
([Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md); but the name Asshur, as
the name of the first great kingdom of the world, which rose up from the
east against the theocracy, is employed, as we may clearly see from [Num
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024.md), to designate all the powers of
the world which took their rise in Asshur, and proceeded forth from it
(see also [Ezr 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022.md), where the Persian
king is still called king of Asshur or Assyria). Balaam did not foretell
that this worldly power would oppress Israel also, and lead it into
captivity, because the oppression of the Israelites was simply a
transitory judgment, which served to refine the nation of God and not to
destroy it, and which was even appointed according to the counsel of God
to open and prepare the way for the conquest of the kingdoms of the
world by the kingdom of God. To the Kenites only did the captivity
become a judgment of destruction; because, although on terms of
friendship with the people of Israel, and outwardly associated with
them, yet, as is clearly shown by [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md), they never entered inwardly into
fellowship with Israel and Jehovah's covenant of grace, but sought to
maintain their own independence side by side with Israel, and thus
forfeited the blessing of God which rested upon Israel.

(Note: This simple but historically established interpretation
completely removes the objection, "that Balaam could no more foretell
destruction to the friends of Israel than to Israel itself," by which
Kurtz would preclude the attempt to refer this prophecy to the Kenites,
who were in alliance with Israel. His further objections to v.
Hoffmann's view are either inconclusive, or at any rate do not affect
the explanation that we have given.)

[Numbers 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 24:23</span></span>

The fourth saying applies to Asshur, and is introduced by an exclamation
of woe: "Woe! who will live, when God sets this! and ships (come) from
the side of Chittim, and press Asshur, and press Eber, and he also
perishes." The words "Woe, who will live," point to the fearfulness of
the following judgment, which went deep to the heart of the seer,
because it would fall upon the sons of his own people (see at [Num
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005).md). The meaning is, "Who will
preserve his life in the universal catastrophe that is coming?"
(Hengstenberg). משּׂמו, either "since the setting of it," equivalent to
"from the time when God sets (determines) this" (ὅταν θῇ ταῦτα ὁ Θεός,
quando faciet ista Deus; lxx, Vulg.), or "on account of the setting of
it," i.e., because God determines this. שׂוּם, to set, applied to that
which God establishes, ordains, or brings to pass, as in [Isa
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007.md); [Hab
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md). The suffix in שׂוּמו is not to
be referred to Asshur, as Knobel supposes, because the prophecy relates
not to Asshur "as the mighty power by which everything was crushed and
overthrown," but to a power that would come from the far west and crush
Asshur itself. The suffix refers rather to the substance of the prophecy
that follows, and is to be understood in a neuter sense. אל is "God,"
and not an abbreviation of אלּה, which is always written with the
article in the Pentateuch (האל, [Gen
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008.md), [Gen
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025.md); [Gen
26:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#003.md); [Lev
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#027.md); [Deu
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#042.md); [Deu
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022.md); [Deu
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#011).md), and only occurs once without
the article, viz., in [Ch1 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#008.md). צים,
from צי ([Isa 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021).md), signifies ships,
like ציּים in the passage in [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), which is founded upon the
prophecy before us. מיּד, from the side, as in [Exo
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005.md); [Deu
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#037.md), etc. כּתּים is Cyprus with the
capital Citium (see at [Gen 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004).md),
which is mentioned as intervening between Greece and Phoenicia, and the
principal station for the maritime commerce of Phoenicia, so that all
the fleets passing from the west to the east necessarily took Cyprus in
their way ([Isa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001).md). The nations
that would come across the sea from the side of Cyprus to humble Asshur,
are not mentioned by name, because this lay beyond the range of Balaam's
vision. He simply gives utterance to the thought, "A power comes from
Chittim over the sea, to which Asshur and Eber, the eastern and the
western Shem, will both succumb" (v. Hoffmann). Eber neither refers to
the Israelites merely as Hebrews (lxx, Vulg.), nor to the races beyond
the Euphrates, as Onkelos and others suppose, but, like "all the sons of
Eber" in [Gen 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021.md), to the posterity
of Abraham who descended from Eber through Peleg, and also to the
descendants of Eber through Joktan: so that Asshur, as the
representative of the Shemites who dwelt in the far east, included Elam
within itself; whilst Eber, on the other hand, represented the western
Shemites, the peoples that sprang from Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram ([Gen
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021).md). "And he also shall perish for
ever:" these words cannot relate to Asshur and Eber, for their fate is
already announced in the word ענּוּ (afflict, press), but only to the
new western power that was to come over the sea, and to which the others
were to succumb. "Whatever powers might rise up in the world of peoples,
the heathen prophet of Jehovah sees them all fall, one through another,
and one after another; for at last he loses in the distance the power to
discern whence it is that the last which he sees rise up is to receive
its fatal blow" (v. Hoffmann, p. 520). The overthrow of this last power
of the world, concerning which the prophet Daniel was the fist to
receive and proclaim new revelations, belongs to "the end of the days,"
in which the star out of Jacob is to rise upon Israel as a "bright
morning star" ([Rev 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016).md).

Now if according to this the fact is firmly established, that in this
last prophecy of Balaam, "the judgment of history even upon the imperial
powers of the West, and the final victory of the King of the kingdom of
God were proclaimed, though in fading outlines, more than a thousand
years before the events themselves," as Tholuck has expressed it in his
Propheten und ihre Weissagung; the announcement of the star out of
Jacob, and the sceptre out of Israel, i.e., of the King and Ruler of the
kingdom of God, who was to dash Moab to pieces and take possession of
Edom, cannot have received its complete fulfilment in the victories of
David over these enemies of Israel; but will only be fully accomplished
in the future overthrow of all the enemies of the kingdom of God. By the
"end of days," both here and everywhere else, we are to understand the
Messianic era, and that not merely at its commencement, but in its
entire development, until the final completion of the kingdom of God at
the return of our Lord to judgment. In the "star out of Jacob," Balaam
beholds not David as the one king of Israel, but the Messiah, in whom
the royalty of Israel promised to the patriarchs ([Gen
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#006.md), [Gen
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#016.md); [Gen
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#011).md) attains its fullest
realization. The star and sceptre are symbols not of "Israel's royalty
personified" (Hengstenberg), but of the real King in a concrete form, as
He was to arise out of Israel at a future day. It is true that Israel
received the promised King in David, who conquered and subjugated the
Moabites, Edomites, and other neighbouring nations that were hostile to
Israel. But in the person of David and his rule the kingly government of
Israel was only realized in its first and imperfect beginnings. Its
completion was not attained till the coming of the second David ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md); [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md); [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md); [Eze
37:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024).md), the Messiah Himself, who
breaks in pieces all the enemies of Israel, and founds an everlasting
kingdom, to which all the kingdoms and powers of this world are to be
brought into subjection ([Sa2 7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md);
[Psa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md); 72, and [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001).md).

(Note: The application of the star out of Jacob to the Messiah is to be
found even in Onkelos; and this interpretation was so widely spread
among the Jews, that the pseudo-Messiah who arose under Hadrian, and
whom even R. Akiba acknowledged, took the name of Bar Cochba (son of a
star), on consequence of this prophecy, from which the nickname of Bar
Coziba (son of a lie) was afterward formed, when he had submitted to the
Romans, with all his followers. In the Christian Church also the
Messianic explanation was the prevalent one, from the time of Justin and
Irenaeus onwards (see the proofs in Calovii Bibl. ad h. l.), although,
according to a remark of Theodoret (qu. 44 ad Num.), there were some who
did not adopt it. The exclusive application of the passage to David was
so warmly defended, first of all by Grotius, and still more by
Verschuir, that even Hengstenberg and Tholuck gave up the Messianic
interpretation. But they both of them came back to it afterwards, the
former in his "Balaam" and the second edition of his Christology, and
the latter in his treatise on "the Prophets." At the present time the
Messianic character of the prophecy is denied by none but the supporters
of the more vulgar rationalism, such as Knobel and others; whereas G.
Baur (in his History of Old Testament Prophecy) has no doubt that the
prediction of the star out of Jacob points to the exalted and glorious
King, filled with the Holy Spirit, whom Isaiah ([Isa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md); [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)..md) and Micah ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002).md) expected as the royal founder of
the theocracy. Reinke gives a complete history of the interpretation of
this passage in his Beitrge, iv. 186ff.)

If, however, the star out of Jacob first rose upon the world in Christ,
the star which showed the wise men from the east the way to the new-born
"King of the Jews," and went before them, till it stood above the manger
at Bethlehem ([Mat 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001).md), is
intimately related to our prophecy. Only we must not understand the
allusion as being so direct, that Balaam beheld the very star which
appeared to the wise men, and made known to them the birth of the
Saviour of the world. The star of the wise men was rather an embodiment
of the star seen by Balaam, which announced to them the fulfilment of
Balaam's prophecy, - a visible sign by which God revealed to them the
fact, that the appearance of the star which Balaam beheld in the far
distant future had been realized at Bethlehem in the birth of Christ,
the King of the Jews. - The "wise men from the east," who had been made
acquainted with the revelations of God to Israel by the Jews of the
diaspora, might feel themselves specially attracted in their search for
the salvation of the world by the predictions of Balaam, from the fact
that this seer belonged to their own country, and came "out of the
mountains of the east" ([Num 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007).md); so
that they made his sayings the centre of their expectations of
salvation, and were also conducted through them to the Saviour of all
nations by means of supernatural illumination. "God unfolded to their
minds, which were already filled with a longing for the 'star out of
Jacob' foretold by Balaam, the meaning of the star which proclaimed the
fulfilment of Balaam's prophecy; He revealed to them, that is to say,
the fact that it announced the birth of the 'King of the Jews.' And just
as Balaam had joyously exclaimed, 'I see Him,' and 'I behold Him,' they
also could say, 'We have seen His star' " (Hengstenberg).

If, in conclusion, we compare Balaam's prophecy of the star that would
come out of Jacob, and the sceptre that would rise out of Israel, with
the prediction of the patriarch Jacob, of the sceptre that should not
depart from Judah, till the Shiloh came whom the nations would obey
([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md), it is easy to observe
that Balaam not only foretold more clearly the attitude of Israel to the
nations of the world, and the victory of the kingdom of God over every
hostile kingdom of the world; but that he also proclaimed the Bringer of
Peace expected by Jacob at the end of the days to be a mighty ruler,
whose sceptre would break in pieces and destroy all the enemies of the
nation of God. The tribes of Israel stood before the mental eye of the
patriarch in their full development into the nation in which all the
families of the earth were to be blessed. From this point of view, the
salvation that was to blossom in the future for the children of Israel
culminated in the peaceful kingdom of the Shiloh, in whom the dominion
of the victorious lion out of Judah was to attain its fullest
perfection. But the eye of Balaam, the seer, which had been opened by
the Spirit of God, beheld the nation of Israel encamped, according to
its tribes, in the face of its foes, the nations of this world. They
were endeavouring to destroy Israel; but according to the counsel of the
Almighty God and Lord of the whole world, in their warfare against the
nation that was blessed of Jehovah, they were to succumb one after the
other, and be destroyed by the king that was to arise out of Israel.
This determinate counsel of the living God was to be proclaimed by
Balaam, the heathen seer out of Mesopotamia the centre of the national
development of the ancient world: and, first of all, to the existing
representatives of the nations of the world that were hostile to Israel,
that they might see what would at all times tend to their peace - might
see, that is to say, that in their hostility to Israel they were
rebelling against the Almighty God of heaven and earth, and that they
would assuredly perish in the conflict, since life and salvation were
only to be found with the people of Israel, whom God had blessed. And
even though Balaam had to make known the purpose of the Lord concerning
His people primarily, and in fact solely, to the Moabites and their
neighbours, who were like-minded with them, his announcement was also
intended for Israel itself, and was to be a pledge to the congregation
of Israel for all time of the certain fulfilment of the promises of God;
and so to fill them with strength and courage, that in all their
conflicts with the powers of this world, they should rely upon the Lord
their God with the firmest confidence of faith, should strive with
unswerving fidelity after the end of their divine calling, and should
build up the kingdom of God on earth, which is to outlast all the
kingdoms of the world. - In what manner the Israelites became acquainted
with the prophecies of Balaam, so that Moses could incorporate them into
the Thorah, we are nowhere told, but we can infer it with tolerable
certainty from the subsequent fate of Balaam himself.

[Numbers 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 24:25</span></span>

At the close of this announcement Balaam and Balak departed from one
another. "Balaam rose up, and went and turned towards his place" (i.e.,
set out on the way to his house); "and king Balak also went his way."
למקמו ישׁב does not mean, "he returned to his place," into his home
beyond the Euphrates (equivalent to אל־מקמו ישׁב), but merely "he turned
towards his place" (both here and in [Gen
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#033).md). That he really returned home,
is not implied in the words themselves; and the question, whether he did
so, must be determined from other circumstances. In the further course
of the history, we learn that Balaam went to the Midianites, and advised
them to seduce the Israelites to unfaithfulness to Jehovah, by tempting
them to join in the worship of Peor ([Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016).md). He was still with them at the
time when the Israelites engaged in the war of vengeance against that
people, and was slain by the Israelites along with the five princes of
Midian ([Num 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md); [Jos
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#022).md). At the time when he fell into
the hands of the Israelites, he no doubt made a full communication to
the Israelitish general, or to Phinehas, who accompanied the army as
priest, concerning his blessings and prophecies, probably in the hope of
saving his life; though he failed to accomplish his end.

(Note: It is possible, however, as Hengstenberg imagines, that after
Balaam's departure from Balak, he took his way into the camp of the
Israelites, and there made known his prophecies to Moses or to the
elders of Israel, in the hope of obtaining from them the reward which
Balak had withheld, and that it was not till after his failure to obtain
full satisfaction to his ambition and covetousness here, that he went to
the Midianites, to avenge himself upon the Israelites, by the proposals
that he made to them. The objections made by Kurtz to this conjecture
are not strong enough to prove that it is inadmissible, though the
possibility of the thing does not involve either its probability or its
certainty.)
