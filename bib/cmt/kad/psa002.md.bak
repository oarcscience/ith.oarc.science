The Kingdom of God and of His Christ,to Which Everything Must Bow

The didactic [Psa 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) which began
with אשׁרי, is now followed by a prophetic Psalm, which closes with
אשׁרי. It coincides also in other respects with [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), but still more with Psalms of
the earlier time of the kings ([Psa
59:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#009.md); [Psa
83:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003).md) and with Isaiah's prophetic
style. The rising of the confederate nations and their rulers against
Jahve and His Anointed will be dashed to pieces against the
imperturbable all-conquering power of dominion, which Jahve has
entrusted to His King set upon Zion, His Son. This is the fundamental
thought, which is worked out with the vivid directness of dramatic
representation. The words of the singer and seer begin and end the
Psalm. The rebels, Jahve, and His Anointed come forward, and speak for
themselves; but the framework is formed by the composer's discourse,
which, like the chorus of the Greek drama, expresses the reflexions and
feelings which are produced on the spectators and hearers. The poem
before us is not purely lyric. The personality of the poet is kept in
the background. The Lord's Anointed who speaks in the middle of the
Psalm is not the anonymous poet himself. It may, however, be a king of
the time, who is here regarded in the light of the Messianic promise, or
that King of the future, in whom at a future period the mission of the
Davidic kingship in the world shall be fulfilled: at all events this
Lord's Anointed comes forward with the divine power and glory, with
which the Messiah appears in the prophets.

The Psalm is anonymous. For this very reason we may not assign it to
David (Hofm.) nor to Solomon (Ew.); for nothing is to be inferred from
[Act 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md), since in the New Testament
"hymn of David" and "psalm" are co-ordinate ideas, and it is always far
more hazardous to ascribe an anonymous Psalm to David or Solomon, than
to deny to one inscribed לדוד or לשׁלמה direct authorship from David or
Solomon. But the subject of the Psalm is neither David (Kurtz) nor
Solomon (Bleek). It might be David, for in his reign there is at least
one coalition of the peoples like that from which our Psalm takes its
rise, vid., [Sa2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md) : on the
contrary it cannot be Solomon, because in his reign, though troubled
towards its close ([Kg1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014)..md), no
such event occurs, but would then have to be inferred to have happened
from this Psalm. We might rather guess at Uzziah (Meier) or Hezekiah
(Maurer), both of whom inherited the kingdom in a weakened condition and
found the neighbouring peoples alienated from the house of David. The
situation might correspond to these times, for the rebellious peoples,
which are brought before us, have been hitherto subject to Jahve and His
Anointed. But all historical indications which might support the one
supposition or the other are wanting. If the God-anointed one, who
speaks in [Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md), were the psalmist
himself, we should at least know the Psalm was composed by a king filled
with a lofty Messianic consciousness. But the dramatic movement of the
Psalm up to the ועתה ([Psa 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010).md) which
follows, is opposed to such an identification of the God-anointed one
with the poet. But that Alexander Jannaeus (Hitz.), that blood-thirsty
ruler, so justly hated by his people, who inaugurated his reign by
fratricide, may be both at the same time, is a supposition which turns
the moral and covenant character of the Psalm into detestable falsehood.
The Old Testament knows no kingship to which is promised the dominion of
the world and to which sonship is ascribed ([Sa2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md); [Psa
89:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028).md), but the Davidic. The events of
his own time, which influenced the mind of the poet, are no longer clear
to us. But from these he is carried away into those tumults of the
peoples which shall end in all kingdoms becoming the kingdom of God and
of His Christ ([Rev 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md); [Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010).md).

In the New Testament this Psalm is cited more frequently than any other.
According to [Act 4:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md), [Act
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md) and [Act
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002.md) have been fulfilled in the
confederate hostility of Israel and the Gentiles against Jesus the holy
servant of God and against His confessors. In the Epistle to the
Hebrews, [Psa 110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) and [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md) stand side by side, the former
as a witness of the eternal priesthood of Jesus after the order of
Melchisedek, the latter as a witness of His sonship, which is superior
to that of the angels. Paul teaches us in [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md), comp. [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md), how the "to-day" is to be
understood. The "to-day" according to its proper fulfilment, is the day
of Jesus' resurrection. Born from the dead to the life at the right hand
of God, He entered on this day, which the church therefore calls dies
regalis, upon His eternal kingship.

The New Testament echo of this Psalm however goes still deeper and
further. The two names of the future One in use in the time of Jesus, ὁ
Χριστὸς and ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, [Joh
1:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#050.md); [Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063.md) (in the mouth of Nathanael and
of the High Priest) refer back to this Ps. and [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), just as ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου
incontrovertibly refers to [Psa 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md)
and [Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md). The view maintained by
De Wette and Hupfeld, that the Psalm is not applicable to the Christian
conceptions of the Messiah, seems almost as though these were to be
gauged according to the authoritative utterances of the professorial
chair and not according to the language of the Apostles. Even in the
Apocalypse, Ps 19:15; [Psa 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005.md), Jesus
appears exactly as this Psalm represents Him, as ποιμαίνων τὰ ἔθνη ἐν
ῥάβδῳ σιδηρᾷ. The office of the Messiah is not only that of Saviour but
also of Judge. Redemption is the beginning and the judgment the end of
His work. It is to this end that the Psalm refers. The Lord himself
frequently refers in the Gospels to the fact of His bearing side by side
with the sceptre of peace and the shepherd's staff, the sceptre of iron
also, [Mat 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#050.md)., [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md), [Luk
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027.md). The day of His coming is indeed
a day of judgment-the great day of the ὀργὴ τοῦ ἀγνίου, [Rev
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#017.md), before which the ultra-spiritual
Messianic creations of enlightened exegetes will melt away, just as the
carnal Messianic hopes of the Jews did before His first coming.

[Psalms 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 2:1</span></span>

The Psalm begins with a seven line strophe, ruled by an interrogative
Wherefore. The mischievous undertaking condemns itself, It is groundless
and fruitless. This certainty is expressed, with a tinge of involuntary
astonishment, in the question. למּה followed by a praet. enquires the
ground of such lawlessness: wherefore have the peoples banded together
so tumultuously (Aquila: ἐθορυβήθησαν)? and followed by a fut., the aim
of this ineffectual action: wherefore do they imagine emptiness? ריק
might be adverbial and equivalent to לריק, but it is here, as in [Psa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md), a governed accusative; for הגה
which signifies in itself only quiet inward musing and yearning,
expressing itself by a dull muttering (here: something deceitful, as in
[Psa 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013).md), requires an object. By
this ריק the involuntary astonishment of the question justifies itself:
to what purpose is this empty affair, i.e., devoid of reason and
continuance? For the psalmist, himself a subject and member of the
divine kingdom, is too well acquainted with Jahve and His Anointed not
to recognise beforehand the unwarrantableness and impotency of such
rebellion. That these two things are kept in view, is implied by [Psa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md), which further depicts the
position of affairs without being subordinated to the למה. The fut.
describes what is going on at the present time: they set themselves in
position, they take up a defiant position (התיצּב as in [Sa1
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#016).md), after which we again (comp.
the reverse order in [Psa 83:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006).md) have a
transition to the perf. which is the more uncoloured expression of the
actual: נוסד (with יחד as the exponent of reciprocity) prop. to press
close and firm upon one another, then (like Arab. sâwada, which,
according to the correct observation of the Turkish Kamus, in its
signification clam cum aliquo locutus est, starts from the very same
primary meaning of pressing close to any object): to deliberate
confidentially together (as [Psa 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014.md)
and נועץ [Psa 71:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#010).md). The subjects
מלכי־ארץ and רוזנים (according to the Arabic razuna, to be weighty: the
grave, dignitaries, σεμνοί, augusti) are only in accordance with the
poetic style without the article. It is a general rising of the people
of the earth against Jahve and His משׁיח, Χριστὸς, the king anointed by
Him by means of the holy oil and most intimately allied to Him. The
psalmist hears ([Psa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003).md) the decision
of the deliberating princes. The pathetic suff. êmō instead of êhém
refers back to Jahve and His Anointed. The cohortatives express the
mutual kindling of feeling; the sound and rhythm of the exclamation
correspond to the dull murmur of hatred and threatening defiance: the
rhythm is iambic, and then anapaestic. First they determine to break
asunder the fetters (מוסרות = מאסרות) to which the את, which is
significant in the poetical style, points, then to cast away the cords
from them (ממּנוּ a nobis, this is the Palestinian mode of writing,
whereas the Babylonians said and wrote mimeenuw a nobis in distinction
from ממּנוּ ab eo, B. Sota 35a) partly with the vexation of captives,
partly with the triumph of freedmen. They are, therefore, at present
subjects of Jahve and His Anointed, and not merely because the whole
world is Jahve's, but because He has helped His Anointed to obtain
dominion over them. It is a battle for freedom, upon which they are
entering, but a freedom that is opposed to God.

[Psalms 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 2:4</span></span>

Above the scene of this wild tumult of battle and imperious arrogance
the psalmist in this six line strophe beholds Jahve, and in spirit hears
His voice of thunder against the rebels. In contrast to earthly rulers
and events Jahve is called יושׁב בּשּׁמים: He is enthroned above them in
unapproachable majesty and ever-abiding glory; He is called אדני as He
who controls whatever takes place below with absolute power according to
the plan His wisdom has devised, which brooks no hindrance in execution.
The futt. describe not what He will do, but what He does continually
(cf. [Isa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004)..md). למו also belongs,
according to [Psa 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#009.md); [Psa
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013.md), to ישׂחק (שׂחק which is more
usual in the post-pentateuchal language = צחק). He laughs at the defiant
ones, for between them and Him there is an infinite distance; He derides
them by allowing the boundless stupidity of the infinitely little one to
come to a climax and then He thrusts him down to the earth undeceived.
This climax, the extreme limit of the divine forbearance, is determined
by the אז, as in [Deu 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#019.md), cf. שׁם
[Psa 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md); 36:13, which is a "then"
referring to the future and pointing towards the crisis which then
supervenes. Then He begins at once to utter the actual language of His
wrath to his foes and confounds them in the heat of His anger,
disconcerts them utterly, both outwardly and in spirit. בּהל, Arab. bhl,
cogn. בּלהּ, means originally to let loose, let go, then in Hebrew
sometimes, externally, to overthrow, sometimes, of the mind, to confound
and disconcert.

[Psa 2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md)

[Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md) is like a peal of thunder
(cf. [Isa 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033).md); בּחרונו, [Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md), like the lightning's destructive
flash. And as the first strophe closed with the words of the rebels, so
this second closes with Jahve's own words. With ואני begins an adverbial
clause like [Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md); [Gen
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#013.md); [Psa
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017.md). The suppressed principal clause
(cf. [Isa 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014); Ew. 341, c.md) is easily
supplied: ye are revolting, whilst notwithstanding I.... With ואני He
opposes His irresistible will to their vain undertaking. It has been
shown by Bttcher, that we must not translate "I have anointed" (Targ.,
Symm.). נסך, Arab. nsk, certainly means to pour out, but not to pour
upon, and the meaning of pouring wide and firm (of casting metal,
libation, anointing) then, as in הצּיג, הצּיק, goes over into the
meaning of setting firmly in any place (fundere into fundare,
constituere, as lxx, Syr., Jer., and Luther translate), so that
consequently נסיך the word for prince cannot be compared with משׁיח, but
with נציב.

(Note: Even the Jalkut on the Psalms, 620, wavers in the explanation of
נסכתי between אמשׁחתיה I have anointed him, (after [Dan
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#003).md), אתיכתיה (I have cast him (after
[Exo 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004) and freq..md), and גדלתיו I
have made him great (after [Mic 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004).md).
Aquila, by rendering it καὶ ἐδιασάμην (from διάζεσθαι = ὑφαίνειν), adds
a fourth possible rendering. A fifth is נסך to purify, consecrate
(Hitz.), which does not exist, for the Arabic nasaka obtains this
meaning from the primary signification of cleansing by flooding with
water (e.g., washing away the briny elements of a field). Also in [Pro
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023.md) נסּכתּי means I am cast =
placed.)

The Targum rightly inserts וּמניתיהּ (et praefeci eum) after רבּיתי
(unxi), for the place of the anointing is not על־ציּון. History makes no
mention of a king of Israel being anointed on Zion. Zion is mentioned as
the royal seat of the Anointed One; there he is installed, that He may
reign there, and rule from thence, [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md). It is the hill of the city of
David ([Sa2 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007.md), [Sa2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009.md); [Kg1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001).md) including Moriah, that is
intended. That hill of holiness, i.e., holy hill, which is the
resting-place of the divine presence and therefore excels all the
heights of the earth, is assigned to Him as the seat of His throne.

[Psalms 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 2:7</span></span>

The Anointed One himself now speaks and expresses what he is, and is
able to do, by virtue of the divine decree. No transitional word or
formula of introduction denotes this sudden transition from the speech
of Jahve to that of His Christ. The psalmist is the seer: his Psalm is
the mirrored picture of what he saw and the echo of what he heard. As
Jahve in opposition to the rebels acknowledges the king upon Zion, so
the king on Zion appeals to Him in opposition to the rebels. The name of
God, יהוה, has Rebia magnum and, on account of the compass of the full
intonation of this accent, a Gaja by the Sheb (comp. אלהי [Psa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md), אלהים [Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md), אדני [Psa
90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001).md).

(Note: We may observe here, in general, that this Gaja (Metheg) which
draws the Sheb into the intonation is placed even beside words with the
lesser distinctives Zinnor and Rebia parvum only by the Masorete
Ben-Naphtali, not by Ben-Asher (both about 950 a.d.). This is a point
which has not been observed throughout even in Baer's edition of the
Psalter so that consequently e.g., in [Psa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011.md) it is to be written אלהים; in
[Psa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002) on the other hand (with Dech.md)
יהוה, not יהוה.)

The construction of ספּר with אל (as [Psa
69:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027.md), comp. אמר [Gen
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#002.md); [Jer
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md), דּבּר [Ch2
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#019.md), הודיע [Isa
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#019).md): to narrate or make an
announcement with respect to... is minute, and therefore solemn.
Self-confident and fearless, he can and will oppose to those, who now
renounce their allegiance to him, a חק, i.e., an authentic, inviolable
appointment, which can neither be changed nor shaken. All the ancient
versions, with the exception of the Syriac, read חק־יהוה together. The
line of the strophe becomes thereby more symmetrical, but the expression
loses in force. אל־חק rightly has Olewejored. It is the amplificative
use of the noun when it is not more precisely determined, known in
Arabic grammar: such a decree! majestic as to its author and its matter.
Jahve has declared to Him: בּני אתּה,

(Note: Even in pause here אתּה remains without a lengthened ā (Psalter
ii. 468), but the word is become Milel, while out of pause, according to
Ben-Asher, it is Milra; but even out of pause (as in [Psa
89:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010.md), [Psa
89:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#012.md); [Psa
90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002).md) it is accented on the penult. by
Ben-Naphtali. The Athnach of the books תאם (Ps., Job, Prov.),
corresponding to the Zakeph of the 21 other books, has only a half
pausal power, and as a rule none at all where it follows Olewejored, cf.
[Psa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007.md); [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md); [Psa
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md); [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md); [Psa
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014.md); [Psa
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md), etc. (Baer, Thorath Emeth p.
37).)

and that on the definite day on which He has begotten or born him into
this relationship of son. The verb ילד (with the changeable vowel i)

(Note: The changeable i goes back either to a primary form ילד, ירשׁ,
שׁאל, or it originates directly from Pathach; forms like ירשׁוּה and
שׁאלך favour the former, ē in a closed syllable generally going over
into Segol favours the latter.))

unites in itself, like γεννᾶν, the ideas of begetting and bearing (lxx
γεγέννηκα, Aq. ἔτεκον); what is intended is an operation of divine power
exalted above both, and indeed, since it refers to a setting up (נסך) in
the kingship, the begetting into a royal existence, which takes place in
and by the act of anointing (משׁח). Whether it be David, or a son of
David, or the other David, that is intended, in any case 2 Sam 7 is to
be accounted as the first and oldest proclamation of this decree; for
there David, with reference to his own anointing, and at the same time
with the promise of everlasting dominion, receives the witness of the
eternal sonship to which Jahve has appointed the seed of David in
relation to Himself as Father, so that David and his seed can say to
Jahve: אבי אתּה, Thou art my Father, [Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md), as Jahve can to him: בּני אתּה,
Thou art My son. From this sonship of the Anointed one to Jahve, the
Creator and Possessor of the world, flows His claim to and expectation
of the dominion of the world. The cohortative, natural after challenges,
follows upon שׁאל, Ges. 128, 1. Jahve has appointed the dominion of the
world to His Son: on His part therefore it needs only the desire for it,
to appropriate to Himself that which is allotted to Him. He needs only
to be willing, and that He is willing is shown by His appealing to the
authority delegated to Him by Jahve against the rebels. This authority
has a supplement in [Psa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md), which is
most terrible for the rebellious ones. The suff. refer to the גּוים, the
ἔθνη, sunk in heathenism. For these his sceptre of dominion ([Psa
90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002).md) becomes a rod of iron, which
will shatter them into a thousand pieces like a brittle image of clay
([Jer 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011).md). With נפּץ alternates רעע
(= רעץ frangere), fut. תּרע; whereas the lxx (Syr., Jer.), which renders
ποιμανεῖς αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥάβδῳ (as [Co1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021).md) σιδηρᾷ, points it תּרעם from
רעה. The staff of iron, according to the Hebrew text the instrument of
punitive power, becomes thus with reference to שׁבט as the shepherd's
staff [Psa 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md), an instrument of despotism.

[Psalms 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 2:10</span></span>

The poet closes with a practical application to the great of the earth
of that which he has seen and heard. With ועתּה, καὶ νῦν ([Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028).md), itaque, appropriate conclusions
are drawn from some general moral matter of face (e.g., [Pro
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#007).md) or some fact connected with the
history of redemption (e.g., [Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022).md). The exhortation is not
addressed to those whom he has seen in a state of rebellion, but to
kings in general with reference to what he has prophetically seen and
heard. שׁפטי ארץ are not those who judge the earth, but the judges,
i.e., rulers ([Amo 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#003), cf. 1:8.md),
belonging to the earth, throughout its length or breadth. The Hiph.
השׂכּיל signifies to show intelligence or discernment; the Niph. נוסר as
a so-called Niph. tolerativum, to let one's self be chastened or
instructed, like נועץ [Pro 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010.md), to
allow one's self to be advised, נדרשׁ [Eze
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md), to allow one's self to be
sought, נמצא to allow one's self to be found, [Ch1
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009.md), and frequently. This general
call to reflection is followed, in [Ch1
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011.md), by a special exhortation in
reference to Jahve, and in [Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md),
in reference to the Son. עבדוּ and גּילוּ answer to each other: the
latter is not according to [Hos 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md)
in the sense of חילוּ [Psa 96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md), but,
- since "to shake with trembling" (Hitz.) is a tautology, and as an
imperative גילו everywhere else signifies: rejoice, - according to [Psa
100:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#002.md), in the sense of rapturous
manifestation of joy at the happiness and honour of being permitted to
be servants of such a God. The lxx correctly renders it: ἀγελλιᾶσθε αὐτῷ
ἐν τρόμῳ. Their rejoicing, in order that it may not run to the excess of
security and haughtiness, is to be blended with trembling (בּ as [Zep
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017).md), viz., with the trembling of
reverence and self-control, for God is a consuming fire, [Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md).

The second exhortation, which now follows, having reference to their
relationship to the Anointed One, has been missed by all the ancient
versions except the Syriac, as though its clearness had blinded the
translators, since they render בר, either בּר purity, chastity,
discipline (lxx, Targ., Ital., Vulg.), or בּר pure, unmixed (Aq., Symm.,
Jer.: adorate pure). Thus also Hupfeld renders it "yield sincerely,"
whereas it is rendered by Ewald "receive wholesome warning," and by
Hitzig "submit to duty" (בּר like the Arabic birr = בּר); Olshausen even
thinks, there may be some mistake in בר, and Diestel decides for בו
instead of בר. But the context and the usage of the language require
osculamini filium. The Piel נשּׁק means to kiss, and never anything
else; and while בּר in Hebrew means purity and nothing more, and בּר as
an adverb, pure, cannot be supported, nothing is more natural here,
after Jahve has acknowledged His Anointed One as His Son, than that בּר
([Pro 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#002), even בּרי = בּני.md) - which
has nothing strange about it when found in solemn discourse, and here
helps one over the dissonance of פּן בּן - should, in a like absolute
manner to חק, denote the unique son, and in fact the Son of God.

(Note: Apart from the fact of בר not having the article, its
indefiniteness comes under the point of view of that which, because it
combines with it the idea of the majestic, great, and terrible, is
called by the Arabian grammarians Arab. 'l-tnkı̂r lt'dı̂m or ltktı̂r or
lthwı̂l; by the boundlessness which lies in it it challenges the
imagination to magnify the notion which it thus expresses. An Arabic
expositor would here (as in [Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md)
above) render it "Kiss a son and such a son!" (vid., Ibn Hishâm in De
Sacy's Anthol. Grammat. p. 85, where it is to be translated hic est vir,
qualis vir!). Examples which support this doctrine are בּיר [Isa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002.md) by a hand, viz., God's almighty
hand which is the hand of hands, and [Isa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md) מפּני־חרב before a sword, viz.,
the divine sword which brooks no opposing weapon.)

The exhortation to submit to Jahve is followed, as Aben-Ezra has
observed, by the exhortation to do homage to Jahve's Son. To kiss is
equivalent to to do homage. Samuel kisses Saul ([Sa1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001).md), saying that thereby he does
homage to him.

(Note: On this vid., Scacchi Myrothecium, to. iii. (1637) c. 35.)

The subject to what follows is now, however, not the Son, but Jahve. It
is certainly at least quite as natural to the New Testament
consciousness to refer "lest He be angry" to the Son (vid., [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016)..md), and since the warning against
putting trust (חסות) in princes, [Psa
118:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#009.md); [Psa
146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md), cannot be applied to the Christ
of God, the reference of בו to Him (Hengst.) cannot be regarded as
impossible. But since חסה בּ is the usual word for taking confiding
refuge in Jahve, and the future day of wrath is always referred to in
the Old Testament (e.g., [Psa 110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005).md)
as the day of the wrath of God, we refer the ne irascatur to Him whose
son the Anointed One is; therefore it is to be rendered: lest Jahve be
angry and ye perish דּרך. This דּרך is the accus. of more exact
definition. If the way of any one perish. [Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md), he himself is lost with regard to
the way, since this leads him into the abyss. It is questionable whether
כּמעט means "for a little" in the sense of brevi or facile. The usus
loquendi and position of the words favour the latter (Hupf.). Everywhere
else כּמעט means by itself (without such additions as in [Ezr
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008.md); [Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md); [Eze
16:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#047).md) "for a little, nearly, easily."
At least this meaning is secured to it when it occurs after hypothetical
antecedent clauses as in [Psa 81:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#015.md);
[Sa2 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#037.md); [Job
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#022.md). Therefore it is to be rendered:
for His wrath might kindle easily, or might kindle suddenly. The poet
warns the rulers in their own highest interest not to challenge the
wrathful zeal of Jahve for His Christ, which according to [Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md) is inevitable. Well is it with all
those who have nothing to fear from this outburst of wrath, because they
hide themselves in Jahve as their refuge. The construct state חוסי
connects בו, without a genitive relation, with itself as forming
together one notion, Ges. 116, 1. חסה the usual word for fleeing
confidingly to Jahve, means according to its radical notion not so much
refugere, confugere, as se abdere, condere, and is therefore never
combined with אל, but always with בּ.

(Note: On old names of towns, which show this ancient חסה. Wetzstein's
remark on [Job 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#008.md) \[Comm. on Job, en
loc.\]. The Arabic still has hsy in the reference of the primary meaning
to water which, sucked in and hidden, flows under the sand and only
comes to sight on digging. The rocky bottom on which it collects beneath
the surface of the sand and by which it is prevented from oozing away or
drying up is called Arab. hasâ or hisâ a hiding-place or place of
protection, and a fountain dug there is called Arab. ‛yn 'l-hy.)
