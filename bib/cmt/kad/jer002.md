I. General Admonitions and Reproofs Belonging to the Time of Josiah -
Jeremiah 2-22

If we compare the six longer discourses in these chapters with the
sayings and prophecies gathered together in the other portions of the
book, we observe between them this distinction in form and matter, that
the former are more general in their character than the latter.
Considered as to their form, these last prophecies have, with few
exceptions, headings in which we are told both the date of their
composition and the circumstances under which they were uttered; while
in the headings of these six discourses, if we except the somewhat
indefinite notice, "in the days of Josiah" ([Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006).md), we find nowhere mentioned either
their date or the circumstances which led to their composition. Again,
both the shorter sayings and the lengthier prophecies between [Jer
21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md) and the end of the book are
unmistakeably to be looked upon as prophetic addresses, separately
rounded off; but the discourses of our first part give us throughout the
impression that they are not discourses delivered before the people, but
treatises compiled in writing from the oral addresses of the prophet. As
to their matter, too, we cannot fail to notice the difference that,
whereas from [Jer 21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md) onwards the
king of Babylon is named as the executor of judgment upon Judah and the
nations, in the discourses of Jer 2-20 the enemies who are to execute
judgment are nowhere defined, but are only generally described as a
powerful and terrible nation coming from the north. And so, in rebuking
the idolatry and the prevailing sins of the people, no reference is made
to special contemporary events; but there are introduced to a great
extent lengthy general animadversions on their moral degeneracy, and
reflections on the vanity if idolatry and the nature of true wisdom.
From these facts we infer the probable conclusion that these discourses
are but comprehensive summaries of the prophet's labours in the days of
Josiah. The probability becomes certainty when we perceive that the
matters treated in these discourses are arranged according to their
subjects. The first discourse (Jer 2:1-3:5) gives, so to speak, the
programme of the subjects of all the following discourses: that disloyal
defection to idolatry, with which Israel has from of old requited the
Lord for His love and faithfulness, brings with it sore chastening
judgments. In the second discourse (Jer 3:6-6:30) faithless Judah is
shown, in the fall of the ten tribes, what awaits itself in case of
stiff-necked persistence in idolatry. In the third (Jer 7-10) is torn
from it the support of a vain confidence in the possession of the temple
and in the offering of the sacrifices commanded by the law. In the
fourth (Jer 11-13) its sins are characterized as a breach of the
covenant; and rejection by the Lord is declared to be its punishment. In
the fifth (Jer 14-17) the hope is destroyed that the threatened
chastisement can be turned aside by intercession. Finally, in the sixth
(Jer 18-20) the judgment of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the
kingdom of Judah is exhibited in symbolical acts. In this arrangement
and distribution of what the prophet had to announce to the people in
his endeavours to save them, if possible, from destruction, we can
recognise a progression from general admonitions and threatenings to
more and more definite announcement of coming judgments; and when, on
the other hand, we see growing greater and bitterer the prophet's
complaints against the hatreds and persecutions he has to endure (cf.
[Jer 12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md); [Jer
15:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010.md), [Jer
15:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015.md); [Jer
17:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014.md); [Jer
18:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md), [Jer
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020).md), we can gather that the
expectation of the people's being saved from impending destruction was
growing less and less, that their obduracy was increasing, and that
judgment must inevitably come upon them. These complaints of the prophet
cease with Jer 20, though later he had much fiercer hatred to endure.

None of these discourses contains any allusions to events that occurred
after Josiah's death, or stand in any relation to such events. Hence we
believe we are safe in taking them for a digest of the quintessence of
Jeremiah's oral preaching in the days of Josiah, and this arranged with
reference to the subject-matter. It was by this preaching that Jeremiah
sought to give a firm footing to the king's reformatory efforts to
restore and inspire new life into the public worship, and to develope
the external return to the legal temple worship into an inward
conversion to the living God. And it was thus he sought, while the
destruction of the kingdom was impending, to save all that would let
themselves be saved; knowing as he did that God, in virtue of His
unchangeable covenant faithfulness, would sharply chastise His faithless
people for its obstinate apostasy from Him, but had not determined to
make an utter end of it.

The Love and Faithfulness of the Lord, and Israel's Disloyalty and
Idolatry - Jeremiah 2:1-3:5

The Lord has loved Israel sincerely ([Jer
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002).md), but Israel has fallen from the
Lord its God and followed after imaginary gods ([Jer
2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#004).md); therefore He will yet further
punish it for this unparalleled sin ([Jer
2:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009).md). From of old Israel has been
renegade, and has by its idolatry contracted fearful guilt, being led
not even by afflictions to return to the Lord ([Jer
2:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020).md); therefore must the Lord
chastise ([Jer 2:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031).md), because they
will not repent ([Jer 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001).md). This
discourse is of a quite general character; it only sketches the main
thoughts which are extended in the following discourses and prophecies
concerning Judah. So that by most critics it is held to be the discourse
by which Jeremiah inaugurated his ministry; for, as Hitzig puts it, "in
its finished completeness it gives the impression of a first-uttered
outpouring of the heart, in which are set forth, without restraint,
Jahveh's list of grievances against Israel, which has long been running
up." It unquestionably contains the chief of the thoughts uttered by the
prophet at the beginning of his ministry.

[Jeremiah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 2:1</span></span>

"And then came to me the word of Jahveh, saying: Go and publish in the
ears of Jerusalem, saying: I have remembered to thy account the love of
thy youth, the lovingness of thy courtship time, thy going after me in
the wilderness, in a land unsown. Holy was Israel to the Lord, his
first-fruits of the produce: all who would have devoured him brought
guilt upon themselves: evil came upon him, is the saying of Jahveh." The
[Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md) and [Jer
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003.md) are not "in a certain sense the
text of the following reproof" (Graf), but contain "the main idea which
shows the cause of the following rebuke" (Hitz.): The Lord has rewarded
the people of Israel with blessings for its love to Him. זכר with ל
pers. and accus. rei means: to remember to one's account that it may
stand him in good stead afterwards - cf. [Neh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019.md); [Neh
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#022.md), [Neh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031.md); [Psa
98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003.md); [Psa
106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045.md), etc. - that it may be repaid
with evil, [Neh 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014.md); [Neh
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#029.md); [Psa
79:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008.md), etc. The perfect זכרתּי is to be
noted, and not inverted into the present. It is a thing completed that
is spoken of; what the Lord has done, not what He is going on with. He
remembered to the people Israel the love of its youth. חסד, ordinarily,
condescending love, graciousness and favour; here, the self-devoting,
nestling love of Israel to its God. The youth of Israel is the time of
the sojourn in Egypt and of the exodus thence ([Hos
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md); here the latter, as is shown by
the following: lovingness of the courtship. The courtship comprises the
time from the exodus out of Egypt till the concluding of the covenant at
Sinai ([Exo 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008).md). When the Lord
redeemed Israel with a strong hand out of the power of Egypt, He chose
it to be His spouse, whom He bare on eagles' wings and brought unto
Himself, [Exo 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004.md). The love of the
bride to her Lord and Husband, Israel proved by its following Him as He
went before in the wilderness, the land where it is not sown, i.e.,
followed Him gladly into the parched, barren wilderness. "Thy going
after me" is decisive for the question so much debated by commentators,
whether חסד and אהבה stand for the love of Israel to its God, or God's
love to Israel. The latter view we find so early as Chrysostom, and
still in Rosenm. and Graf; but it is entirely overthrown by the לכתּך
אחרי, which Chrysost. transforms into ποιῆσας ἐξακολουθῆσαι μου, while
Graf takes no notice of it. The reasons, too, which Graf, after the
example of Rosenm. and Dathe, brings in support of this and against the
only feasible exposition, are altogether valueless. The assertion that
the facts forbid us to understand the words of the love of Israel to the
Lord, because history represents the Israelites, when vixdum Aegypto
egressos, as refractarios et ad aliorum deorum cultum pronos, cannot be
supported by a reference to [Deu 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#006.md),
[Deu 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#024.md); [Isa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md); [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md)., [Psa
106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007.md). History knows of no apostasy of
Israel from its God and no idolatry of the people during the time from
the exodus out of Egypt till the arrival at Sinai, and of this time
alone Jeremiah speaks. All the rebellions of Israel against its God fall
within the time after the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai, and
during the march from Sinai to Canaan. On the way from Egypt to Sinai
the people murmured repeatedly, indeed, against Moses; at the Red Sea,
when Pharaoh was pursuing with chariots and horsemen ([Exo
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011)..md); at Marah, where they were not
able to drink the water for bitterness (15:24); in the wilderness of
Sin, for lack of bread and meat ([Jer
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#002)..md); and at Massah, for want of
water ([Jer 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002)..md). But in all these
cases the murmuring was no apostasy from the Lord, no rebellion against
God, but an outburst of timorousness and want of proper trust in God, as
is abundantly clear from the fact that in all these cases of distress
and trouble God straightway brings help, with the view of strengthening
the confidence of the timorous people in the omnipotence of His helping
grace. Their backsliding from the Lord into heathenism begins with the
worship of the golden calf, after the covenant had been entered into at
Sinai (Ex 32), and is continued in the revolts on the way from Sinai to
the borders of Canaan, at Taberah, at Kibroth-hattaavah (Num 11), in the
desert of Paran at Kadesh (Num 13; 20); and each time it was severely
punished by the Lord.

Neither are we to conclude, with J. D. Mich., that God interprets the
journey through the desert in meliorem partem, and makes no mention of
their offences and revolts; nor with Graf, that Jeremiah looks steadily
away from all that history tells of the march of the Israelites through
the desert, of their discontent and refractoriness, of the golden calf
and of Baal Peor, and, idealizing the past as contrasted with the much
darker present, keeps in view only the brighter side of the old times.
Idealizing of this sort is found neither elsewhere in Jeremiah nor in
any other prophet; nor is there anything of the kind in our verse, if we
take up rightly the sense of it and the thread of the thought. It
becomes necessary so to view it, only if we hold the whole forty years'
sojourn of the Israelites in the wilderness to be the espousal time, and
make the marriage union begin not with the covenanting at Sinai, but
with the entrance of Israel into Canaan. Yet more entirely without
foundation is the other assertion, that the words rightly given as the
sense is, "stand in no connection with the following, since then the
point in hand is the people's forgetfulness of the divine benefits, its
thanklessness and apostasy, not at all the deliverances wrought by
Jahveh in consideration of its former devotedness." For in [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md) it is plainly enough told how God
remembered to the people its love. Israel was so shielded by Him, as His
sanctuary, that whoever touched it must pay the penalty. קדשׁ are all
gifts consecrated to Jahveh. The Lord has made Israel a holy offering
consecrated to Him in this, that He has separated it to Himself for a
סגלּה, for a precious possession, and has chosen it to be a holy people:
[Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md).; [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md); [Deu
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md). We can explain from the Torah of
offering the further designation of Israel: his first-fruits; the first
of the produce of the soil or yield of the land belonged, as קדשׁ, to
the Lord: [Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); [Num
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#008.md), etc. Israel, as the chosen people
of God, as such a consecrated firstling. Inasmuch as Jahveh is Creator
and Lord of the whole world, all the peoples are His possession, the
harvest of His creation. But amongst the peoples of the earth He has
chosen Israel to Himself for a firstling-people (,ראשׁית הגּוים [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001).md), and so pronounced it His
sanctuary, not to be profaned by touch. Just as each laic who ate of a
firstling consecrated to God incurred guilt, so all who meddled with
Israel brought guilt upon their heads. The choice of the verb אכליו is
also to be explained from the figure of firstling-offerings. The eating
of firstling-fruit is appropriation of it to one's own use. Accordingly,
by the eating of the holy people of Jahveh, not merely the killing and
destroying of it is to be understood, but all laying of violent hands on
it, to make it a prey, and so all injury or oppression of Israel by the
heathen nations. The practical meaning of יאשׁמוּ is given by the next
clause: mischief came upon them. The verbs יאשׁמוּ and תּבא dna יא are
not futures; for we have here to do not with the future, but with what
did take place so long as Israel showed the love of the espousal time to
Jahveh. Hence rightly Hitz.: "he that would devour it must pay the
penalty." An historical proof of this is furnished by the attack of the
Amalekites on Israel and its result, [Exo
17:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md).

[Jeremiah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 2:4</span></span>

But Israel did not remain true to its first love; it has forgotten the
benefits and blessings of its God, and has fallen away from Him in
rebellion.

[Jer 2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#004.md)

"Hear the word of Jahveh, house of Jacob, and all families of the house
of Israel. [Jer 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005.md). Thus saith
Jahveh, What have your fathers found in me of wrongfulness, that they
are gone far from me, and have gone after vanity, and are become vain?
[Jer 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md). And they said not, Where is
Jahveh that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us in the
wilderness, in the land of steppes and of pits, in the land of drought
and of the shadow of death, in a land that no one passes through and
where no man dwells? [Jer 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007.md). And I
brought you into a land of fruitful fields, to eat its fruit and its
goodness: and ye came and defiled my land, and my heritage ye have made
an abomination. [Jer 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008.md). The priests
said not, Where is Jahveh? and they that handled the law knew me not:
the shepherds fell away from me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal,
and after them that profit not are they gone." The rebuke for
ungrateful, faithless apostasy is directed against the whole people. The
"house of Jacob" is the people of the twelve tribes, and the parallel
member, "all families of the house of Israel," is an elucidative
apposition. The "fathers" in [Jer 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005.md)
are the ancestors of the now living race onwards from the days of the
Judges, when the generation arising after the death of Joshua and his
contemporaries forsook the Lord and served the Baals ([Jdg
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#010)..md). עול, perversity, wrongfulness,
used also of a single wicked deed in [Psa
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004.md), the opposite to acting in truth
and good faith. Jahveh is a God of faithfulness (אמוּנה); in Him is no
iniquity (אין עול), [Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md). The
question, what have they found...? is answered in the negative by [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md). To remove far from me and follow
after vanity, is tantamount to forsaking Jahveh and serving the false
gods (Baals), [Jdg 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md). הבל, lit.,
breath, thence emptiness, vanity, is applied so early as the song of
Moses, [Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md), to the false gods,
as being nonentities. Here, however, the word means not the gods, but
the worship of them, as being groundless and vain; bringing no return to
him who devotes himself to it, but making him foolish and useless in
thought and deed. By the apostle in [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md) יהבּלוּ is expressed by
ἐματαιώ́θησαν. Cf. [Kg2 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#015.md), where
the second hemistich of our verse is applied to the ten tribes.

[Jer 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md)

They said not, Where is Jahveh? i.e., they have no longer taken any
thought of Jahveh; have not recalled His benefits, though they owed to
Him all they had become and all they possessed. He has brought them out
of Egypt, freed them from the house of bondage ([Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004).md), and saved them from the
oppression of the Pharaohs, meant to extirpate them ([Exo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007)..md). He has led them through
pathless and inhospitable deserts, miraculously furnished them with
bread and water, and protected them from all dangers ([Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015).md). To show the greatness of His
benefits, the wilderness is described as parched unfruitful land, as a
land of deadly terrors and dangers. ,ארץ ערבה land of steppes or heaths,
corresponds to the land unsown of [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md). "And of pits," i.e., full of
dangerous pits and chasms into which one may stumble unawares. Land of
drought, where one may have to pine through thirst. And of the shadow of
death: so Sheol is named in [Job 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md)
as being a place of deep darkness; here, the wilderness, as a land of
the terrors of death, which surround the traveller with darkness as of
death: [Isa 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md); [Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md); [Job
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md). A land through which no one
passes, etc., i.e., which offers the traveller neither path nor shelter.
Through his frightful desert God has brought His people in safety.

[Jer 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007.md)

And He has done yet more. He has brought them into a fruitful and
well-cultivated land. כּרמל, fruitful fields, the opposite of
wilderness, [Jer 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#026.md); [Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md). To eat up its fruit and its
good; cf. the enumeration of the fruits and useful products of the land
of Canaan, [Deu 8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md). And this rich
and splendid land the ungrateful people have defiled by their sins and
vices (cf. [Lev 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024).md), and idolatry
(cf. [Eze 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#018).md); and the heritage of
Jahveh they have thus made an abomination, an object of horror. The land
of Canaan is called "my heritage," the especial domain of Jahveh,
inasmuch as, being the Lord of the earth, He is the possessor of the
land and has given it to the Israelites for a possession, yet dwells in
the midst of it as its real lord, Num. 25:34. - In [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008.md) the complaint briefly given in
[Jer 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md) is expanded by an account of
the conduct of the higher classes, those who gave its tone to the spirit
of the people. The priests, whom God had chosen to be the ministers of
His sanctuary, asked not after Him, i.e., sought neither Him nor His
sanctuary. They who occupy themselves with the law, who administer the
law: these too are the priests as teachers of the law ([Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).md), who should instruct the people
as to the Lord's claims on them and commandments ([Lev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011.md); [Deu
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010).md). They knew not Jahveh, i.e.,
they took no note of Him, did not seek to discover what His will and
just claims were, so as to instruct the people therein, and press them
to keep the law. The shepherds are the civil authorities, princes and
kings (cf. [Jer 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001)..md): those who by
their lives set the example to the people, fell away from the Lord; and
the prophets, who should have preached God's word, prophesied בּבּעל, by
Baal, i.e., inspired by Baal. Baal is here a generic name for all false
gods; cf. [Jer 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013.md). ,לא those who
profit not, are the Baals as unreal gods; cf. [Isa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009.md); [Sa1
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#021.md). The utterances as to the
various ranks form a climax, as Hitz. rightly remarks. The ministers of
public worship manifested no desire towards me; those learned in the law
took no knowledge of me, of my will, of the contents of the book of the
law; the civil powers went the length of rising up against my law; and
the prophets fairly fell away to false gods, took inspiration from Baal,
the incarnation of the lying spirit.

[Jeremiah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 2:9</span></span>

Such backsliding from God is unexampled and appalling. [Jer
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009.md). "Therefore will I further contend
with you, ad with your children's children will I contend. [Jer
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#010.md). For go over to the islands of
the Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and observe well, and see if
such things have been; [Jer 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md).
whether a nation hath changed it gods, which indeed are no gods? but my
people hath changed its glory for that which profits not. [Jer
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012.md). Be horrified, ye heavens, at
this, and shudder, and be sore dismayed, saith Jahveh. [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md). For double evil hath my people
done; me have they forsaken, the fountain of living waters, to hew out
for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, the hold no water."

In the preceding verses the fathers were charged with the backsliding
from the Lord; in [Jer 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009.md) punishment
is threatened against the now-living people of Israel, and on their
children's children after them. For the people in its successive and
even yet future generations constitutes a unity, and in this unity a
moral personality. Since the sins of the fathers transmit themselves to
the children and remoter descendants, sons and grandsons must pay the
penalty of the fathers' guilt, that is, so long as they share the
disposition of their ancestors. The conception of this moral unity is at
the foundation of the threatening. That the present race persists in the
fathers' backsliding from the Lord is clearly expressed in [Jer
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#017.md). In "I will further chide or
strive," is intimated implicite that God had chidden already up till
now, or even earlier with the fathers. ריב, contend, when said of God,
is actual striving or chastening with all kinds of punishment. This must
God do as the righteous and holy one; for the sin of the people is an
unheard of sin, seen in no other people. "The islands of the Chittim"
are the isles and coast lands of the far west, as in [Eze
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#006.md); כּתּים having originally been
the name for Cyprus and the city of Cition, see in [Gen
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004.md). In contrast with these distant
western lands, Kedar is mentioned as representative of the races of the
east. The Kedarenes lived as a pastoral people in the eastern part of
the desert between Arabia Petraea and Babylonia; see in [Gen
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#013.md) and [Eze
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#021.md). Peoples in the two opposite
regions of the world are individualizingly mentioned instead of all
peoples. התבּוננוּ, give good heed, serves to heighten the expression.
אם = הןintroduces the indirect question; cf. Ew. 324, c. The unheard of,
that which has happened amongst no people, is put interrogatively for
rhetorical effect. Has any heathen nation changed its gods, which indeed
are not truly gods? No; no heathen nation has done this; but the people
of Jahveh, Israel, has exchanged its glory, i.e., the God who made
Himself known to it in His glory, for false gods that are of no profit.
כּבוד is the glory in which the invisible God manifested His majesty in
the world and amidst His people. Cf. the analogous title given to God,
,נּאון ישׂראל [Amo 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007.md); [Hos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md). The exact antithesis to כּבודו
would be בּשׁת, cf. [Jer 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024.md); [Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013.md); but Jeremiah chose לאto
represent the exchange as not advantageous. God showed His glory to the
Israelites in the glorious deeds of His omnipotence and grace, like
those mentioned in [Jer 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005.md) and [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md). The Baals, on the other hand, are
not אלהים, but, אלילים nothings, phantoms without a being, that bring no
help or profit to their worshippers. Before the sin of Israel is more
fully set forth, the prophet calls on heaven to be appalled at it. The
heavens are addressed as that part of the creation where the glory of
God is most brightly reflected. The rhetorical aim is seen in the piling
up of words. חרב, lit., to be parched up, to be deprived of the
life-marrow. Israel has committed two crimes: a. It has forsaken Jahveh,
the fountain of living water. ,מים חיּיםliving water, i.e., water that
originates and nourishes life, is a significant figure for God, with
whom is the fountain of life ([Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010).md), i.e., from whose Spirit all
life comes. Fountain of living water (here and [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013).md) is synonymous with well of life
in [Pro 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011.md); [Pro
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014.md); [Pro
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027.md), Sir. 21:13. b. The other sin is
this, that they hew or dig out wells, broken, rent, full of crevices,
that hold no water. The delineation keeps to the same figure. The dead
gods have no life and can dispense no life, just as wells with rents or
fissures hold no water. The two sins, the forsaking of the living God
and the seeking out of dead gods, cannot really be separated. Man,
created by God and for God, cannot live without God. If he forsake the
living God, he passes in spite of himself into the service of dead,
unreal gods. Forsaking the living God is eo ipso exchanging Him for an
imaginary god. The prophet sets the two moments of the apostasy from God
side by side, so as to depict to the people with greater fulness of
light the enormity of their crime. The fact in [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md) that no heathen nation changes
its gods for others, has its foundation in this, that the gods of the
heathen are the creations of men, and that the worship of them is
moulded by the carnal-mindedness of sinful man; so that there is less
inducement to change, the gods of the different nations being in nature
alike. But the true God claims to be worshipped in spirit and in truth,
and does not permit the nature and manner of His worship to depend on
the fancies of His worshippers; He makes demands upon men that run
counter to carnal nature, insisting upon the renunciation of sensual
lusts and cravings and the crucifixion of the flesh, and against this
corrupt carnal nature rebels. Upon this reason for the fact adduced,
Jeremiah does not dwell, but lays stress on the fact itself. This he
does with the view of bringing out the distinction, wide as heaven,
between the true God and the false gods, to the shaming of the
idolatrous people; and in order, at the same time, to scourge the folly
of idolatry by giving prominence to the contrast between the glory of
God and the nothingness of the idols.

[Jeremiah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 2:14</span></span>

By this double sin Israel has drawn on its own head all the evil that
has befallen it. Nevertheless it will not cease its intriguing with the
heathen nations. [Jer 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014.md). "Is Israel
a servant? is he a home-born slave? why is he become a booty? [Jer
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015.md). Against him roared the young
lions, let their voice be heard, and made his land a waste; his cities
were burnt up void of inhabitants. [Jer
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016.md). Also the sons of Noph and
Tahpanes feed on the crown of thy head. [Jer
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#017.md). Does not this bring it upon
thee, thy forsaking Jahveh thy God, at the time when He led thee on the
way? [Jer 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018.md). And now what hast thou
to do with the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile? and what
with the way to Assur, to drink the waters of the river? [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019.md). Thy wickedness chastises thee,
and thy backslidings punish thee; then know and see that it is evil and
bitter to forsake Jahveh thy God, and to have no fear of me, saith the
Lord Jahveh of hosts." The thought from [Jer
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014.md) is this: Israel was plundered
and abused by the nations like a slave. To characterize such a fate as
in direct contradiction to its destiny is the aim of the question: Is
Israel a servant? i.e., a slave or a house-born serf. עבד is he who has
in any way fallen into slavery, יליד בּיתa slave born in the house of
his master. The distinction between these two classes of salves does not
consist in the superior value of the servant born in the house by reason
of his attachment to the house. This peculiarity is not here thought of,
but only the circumstance that the son of a salve, born in the house,
remained a slave without any prospect of being set free; while the man
who has been forced into slavery by one of the vicissitudes of life
might hope again to acquire his freedom by some favourable turn of
circumstances. Another failure is the attempt of Hitz. to interpret עבד
as servant of Jahveh, worshipper of the true God; for this
interpretation, even if we take no account of all the other arguments
that make against it, is rendered impossible by .יליד That expression
never means the son of the house, but by unfailing usage the slave born
in the house of his master. Now the people of Israel had not been born
as serf in the land of Jahveh, but had become עבד, i.e., slave, in Egypt
([Deu 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015).md); but Jahveh has redeemed
it from this bondage and made it His people. The questions suppose a
state of affairs that did not exist. This is shown by the next question,
one expressing wonder: Why then is he it become a prey? Slaves are
treated as a prey, but Israel was no slave; why then has such treatment
fallen to his lot? Propheta per admirationem quasi de re nova et absurda
sciscitatur. An servus est Israel? atqui erat liber prae cunctis
gentibus, erat enim filius primogenitus Dei; necesse est igitur quaerere
aliam causam, cur adeo miser sit (Calv.). Cf. the similar turn of the
thought in [Jer 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031.md). How Israel
became a prey is shown in [Jer 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015.md)
and [Jer 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016.md). These verses do not
treat of future events, but of what has already happened, and, according
to [Jer 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018.md) and [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019.md), will still continue. The
imperff. ישׁאגוּ and ירעוּך alternate consequently with the perff. נתנוּ
and נצּתה, and are governed by היה לבז, so that they are utterances
regarding events of the past, which have been and are still repeated.
Lions are a figure that frequently stands for enemies thirsting for
plunder, who burst in upon a people or land; cf. [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md); [Isa
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#029.md), etc. Roared עליו, against him,
not, over him: the lion roars when he is about to rush upon his prey,
[Amo 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004.md), [Amo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#008.md); [Psa
104:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021.md); [Jdg
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005.md); when he has pounced upon it he
growls or grumbles over it; cf. [Isa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md). - In [Jer
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015.md) the figurative manner passes into
plain statement. They made his land a waste; cf. [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md); [Jer
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md), etc., where instead of שׁית we
have the more ordinary שׂוּם. The Cheth. נצּתה from יצת, not from the
Ethiop. נצה (Graf, Hitz.), is to be retained; the Keri here, as in [Jer
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006.md), is an unnecessary correction;
cf. Ew. 317, a. In this delineation Jeremiah has in his eye chiefly the
land of the ten tribes, which had been ravaged and depopulated by the
Assyrians, even although Judah had often suffered partial devastations
by enemies; cf. [Kg1 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025.md).

[Jer 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016.md)

Israel has had to submit to spoliation at the hands of the Egyptians
too. The present reference to the Egyptians is explained by the
circumstances of the prophet's times-from the fact, namely, that just as
Israel and Judah had sought the help of Egypt against the Assyrians (cf.
[Hos 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md); [Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004.md), and [Isa
30:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001).md) in the time of Hezekiah, so
now in Jeremiah's times Judah was expecting and seeking help from the
same quarter against the advancing power of the Chaldeans; cf. [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md). Noph and Tahpanes are two former
capitals of Egypt, here put as representing the kingdom of the Pharaohs.
nop נף, in [Hos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md) mop מף contracted
from מנף, Manoph or Menoph, is Memphis, the old metropolis of Lower
Egypt, made by Psammetichus the capital of the whole kingdom. Its ruins
lie on the western bank of the Nile, to the south of Old Cairo, close by
the present village of Mitrahenny, which is built amongst the ruins; cf.
Brugsch Reiseberichte aus Egypten, 60ff., and the remarks on [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md) and [Isa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md). תחפנס, elsewhere spelt as here
in the Keri תּחפּנחס - cf. [Jer 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007.md).,
[Jer 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md); [Jer
46:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#014.md), [Eze
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018.md) -was a strong border city on the
Pelusiac arm of the Nile, called by the Greeks Δάφναι (Herod. ii. 20),
by the lxx Τάφναι; see in [Eze 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018.md).
A part of the Jews who had remained in the land fled hither after the
destruction of Jerusalem, [Jer 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007.md).
,ירעוּך קדקד feed upon thy crown (lit., feed on thee in respect of thy
crown), is a trope for ignominious devastation; for to shave one bald is
a token of disgrace and sorrow, cf. [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md); [Jer
48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037.md), [Isa
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#017.md); and with this Israel is
threatened in [Isa 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020.md). רעה, to eat
up by grazing, as in [Job 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026.md) and
[Job 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#021.md); in the latter passage in
the sense of depopulari. We must then reject the conjectures of J. D.
Mich., Hitz., and others, suggesting the sense: crush thy head for thee;
a sense not at all suitable, since crushing the head would signify the
utter destruction of Israel. - The land of Israel is personified as a
woman, as is shown by the fem. suffix in ירעוּך. Like a land closely
cropped by herds, so is Israel by the Egyptians. In [Jer
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003.md) also the enemies are represented
as shepherds coming with their flocks against Jerusalem, and pitching
their tents round about the city, while each flock crops its portion of
ground. In [Jer 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010.md) shepherds lay
the vineyard waste.

[Jer 2:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#017.md)

In [Jer 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#017.md) the question as to the
cause of the evil is answered. זאת is the above-mentioned evil, that
Israel had become a prey to the foe. This thy forsaking of Jahveh makes
or prepares for thee. תּעשׂה is neuter; the infin. עזבך is the subject
of the clause, and it is construed as a neuter, as in [Sa1
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#023.md). The fact that thou hast
forsaken Jahveh thy God has brought this evil on thee. At the time when
He led thee on the way. The participle מוליך is subordinated to עת in
the stat. constr. as a partic. standing for the praeterit. durans; cf.
Ew. 337, c. בּדּרך is understood by Ros. and Hitz. of the right way
([Psa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008).md); but in this they forget
that this acceptation is incompatible with the בּעת, which circumscribes
the leading within a definite time. God will lead His people on the
right way at all times. The way on which He led them at the particular
time is the way through the Arabian desert, cf. [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md), and בּדּרך is to be understood as
in [Deu 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#033.md); [Exo
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#008.md); [Exo
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md), etc. Even thus early their
fathers forsook the Lord: At Sinai, by the worship of the golden calf;
then when the people rose against Moses and Aaron in the desert of
Paran, called a rejecting (נאץ) of Jahveh in [Num
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md); and at Shittim, where Israel
joined himself to Baal Peor, [Num
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md). The forsaking of Jahveh is not
to be limited to direct idolatry, but comprehends also the seeking of
help from the heathen; this is shown by the following 18th verse, in
which the reproaches are extended to the present bearing of the people.
' מה־לּך לדרך וגו, lit., what is to thee in reference to the way of
Egypt (for the expression, see [Hos
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#009).md), i.e., what hast thou to do with
the way of Egypt? Why dost thou arise to go into Egypt, to drink the
water of the Nile? שׁחור, the black, turbid stream, is a name for the
Nile, taken from its dark-grey or black mud. The Nile is the life-giving
artery of Egypt, on whose fertilizing waters the fruitfulness and the
prosperity of the country depend. To drink the waters of the Nile is as
much as to say to procure for oneself the sources of Egypt's life, to
make the power of Egypt useful to oneself. Analogous to this is the
drinking the waters of the river, i.e., the Euphrates. What is meant is
seeking help from Egyptians and Assyrians. The water of the Nile and of
the Euphrates was to be made to furnish them with that which the
fountain of living water, i.e., Jahveh ([Jer
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014).md), supplied to them. This is an
old sin, and with it Israel of the ten tribes is upbraided by Hosea
([Hos 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md); [Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002).md). From this we are not to infer
"that here we have nothing to do with the present, since the existing
Israel, Judah, was surely no longer a suitor for the assistance of
Assyria, already grown powerless" (Hitz.). The limitation of the
reproach solely to the past is irreconcilable with the terms of the
verse and with the context ([Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019).md). מה־לּך לדרךcannot grammatically
be translated: What hadst thou to do with the way; just as little can we
make תּיסּרך hath chastised thee, since the following: know and see, is
then utterly unsuitable to it. תּיסּרך and תּוכיחך are not futures, but
imperfects, i.e., expressing what is wont to happen over again in each
similar case; and so to be expressed in English by the present: thy
wickedness, i.e., thy wicked work, chastises thee. The wickedness was
shown in forsaking Jahveh, in the משׁבות, backslidings, the repeated
defection from the living God; cf. [Jer
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022.md); [Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md); [Jer
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007.md). As to the fact, we have no
historical evidence that under Josiah political alliance with Egypt or
Assyria was compassed; but even if no formal negotiations took place,
the country was certainly even then not without a party to build its
hopes on one or other of the great powers between which Judah lay,
whenever a conflict arose with either of them. - וּדעי, with the Vav of
consecution (see Ew. 347, a): Know then, and at last comprehend, that
forsaking the Lord thy God is evil and bitter, i.e., bears evil and
bitter fruit, prepares bitter misery for thee. "To have no fear of me"
corresponds "to forsake," lit., thy forsaking, as second subject; lit.,:
and the no fear of me in thee, i.e., the fact that thou hast no awe of
me. פּחדּתי, awe of me, like פּחדּך in [Deu
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025.md).

[Jeremiah 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 2:20</span></span>

All along Israel has been refractory; it cannot and will not cease from
idolatry. [Jer 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md). "For of old time
thou hast broken thy yoke, torn off thy bands; and hast said: I will not
serve; but upon every high hill, and under every green tree, thou
stretchedst thyself as a harlot. [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md). And I have planted thee a noble
vine, all of genuine stock: and how hast thou changed thyself to me into
the bastards of a strange vine? [Jer
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#022.md). Even though thou washedst thee
with natron and tookest much soap, filthy remains thy guilt before me,
saith the Lord Jahveh. [Jer 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023.md). How
canst thou say, I have not defiled me, after the Baals have I not gone?
See thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done-thou lightfooted
camel filly, entangling her says. [Jer
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024.md). A wild she-ass used to the
wilderness, that in her lust panteth for air; her heat, who shall
restrain it? all that seek her run themselves weary; in her month they
will find her. [Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025.md). Keep thy
foot from going barefoot, and thy throat from thirst; but thou sayest,
It is useless; no; for I have loved strangers, and after them I go."
[Jer 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md). מעולם, from eternity, i.e.,
from immemorial antiquity, has Israel broken the yoke of the divine law
laid on it, and torn asunder the bands of decency and order which the
commands of God, the ordinances of the Torah, put on, to nurture it to
be a holy people of the Lord; torn them as an untamed bullock ([Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018).md) or a stubborn cow, [Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md). מוסרות, bands, are not the bands
or cords of love with which God drew Israel, [Hos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004) (Graf.md), but the commands of God
whose part it was to keep life within the bounds of purity, and to hold
the people back from running riot in idolatry. On this head see [Jer
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005.md); and for the expression, [Psa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003.md). The Masoretes have taken שׁברתי
and נתקתי for the 1st person, pointing accordingly, and for אעבוד, as
unsuitable to this, they have substituted אעבור. Ewald has decided in
favour of these readings; but he is thus compelled to tear the verse to
pieces and to hold the text to be defective, since the words from
ותּאמרי onwards are not in keeping with what precedes. Even if we
translate: I offend transgress not, the thought does not adapt itself
well to the preceding; I have of old time broken thy yoke, etc.; nor can
we easily reconcile with it the grounding clause; for on every high
hill,...thou layest a whoring, where Ew. is compelled to force on כּי
the adversative sig. Most commentators, following the example of the lxx
and Vulg., have taken the two verbs for 2nd person; and thus is
maintained the simple and natural thought that Israel has broken the
yoke laid on it by God, renounced allegiance to Him, and practised
idolatry on every hand. The spelling ,נתּקתּי ,שׁברתּי i.e., the
formation of the 2nd pers. perf. with y, is frequently found in Jer.;
cf. [Jer 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033.md); [Jer
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004.md); [Jer
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md); [Jer
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021.md), etc. It is really the fuller
original spelling tiy which has been preserved in Aramaic, though seldom
found in Hebrew; in Jer. it must be accounted an Aramaism; cf. Ew. 190,
c; Gesen. 44, 2, Rem. 4. With the last clause, on every high hill, etc.,
cf. [Hos 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md) and [Eze
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013.md) with the comm. on [Deu
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002.md). Stretchest thyself as a harlot
or a whoring, is a vivid description of idolatry. צעה, bend oneself, lie
down ad coitum, like κατακλίνεσθαι, inclinari.

[Jer 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md)

In this whoring with the false gods, Israel shows its utter corruption.
I have planted thee a noble vine; not, with noble vines, as we translate
in [Isa 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md), where Israel is compared
to a vineyard. Here Israel is compared to the vine itself, a vine which
Jahveh has planted; cf. [Psa 80:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md);
[Hos 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md). This vine was all (כּלּה,
in its entirety, referred to שׂורק, as collect.) genuine seed; a proper
shoot which could bear good grapes (cf. [Eze
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005).md); children of Abraham, as they
are described in [Gen 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019.md). But how
has this Israel changed itself to me (לי, dativ. incommodi) into
bastards! סוּרי is accus., dependent on נהפכתּ; for this constr. cf.
[Lev 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#025.md); [Psa
114:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#008.md). סוּרים sig. not shoots or
twigs, but degenerate sprouts or suckers. The article in הגּפן is
generic: wild shoots of the species of the wild vine; but this is not
the first determining word; cf. for this exposition of the article [Jer
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#004.md); [Sa2
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030), etc., Ew. 290, a3.md); and for the
omission of the article with נכריּה, cf. Ew. 293, a. Thus are removed
the grammatical difficulties that led Hitz. to take ' סוּרי וגוquite
unnaturally as vocative, and Graf to alter the text. "A strange vine" is
an interloping vine, not of the true, genuine stock planted by Jahveh
([Jer 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#010).md), and which bears poisonous
berries of gall. [Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md).

[Jer 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#022.md)

Though thou adoptedst the most powerful means of purification, yet
couldst thou not purify thyself from the defilement of thy sins. נתר,
natron, is mineral, and בּרית vegetable alkali. נכתּם introduces the
apodosis; and by the participle a lasting condition is expressed. This
word, occurring only here in the O.T., sig. in Aram. to be stained,
filthy, a sense here very suitable. לפני, before me, i.e., before my
eyes, the defilement of thy sins cannot be wiped out. On this head see
[Isa 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md); [Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md), [Psa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009.md).

[Jer 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023.md)

And yet Judah professes to be pure and upright before God. This plea
Jeremiah meets by pointing to the open practising of idolatrous worship.
The people of Judah personified as a woman - זונה in [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md) - is addressed. איך is a question
expressing astonishment. נדמאתי, of defilement by idolatry, as is shown
by the next explanatory clause: the Baals I have not followed. בּעלים is
used generically for strange gods, [Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016.md). The public worship of Baal had
been practised in the kingdom of Judah under Joram, Ahaziah, and
Athaliah only, and had been extirpated by Jehu, [Kg2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#018.md). Idolatry became again rampant
under Ahaz (by his instigation), Manasseh, and Amon, and in the first
year of Josiah's reign. Josiah began to restore the worship of Jahveh in
the twelfth year of his reign; but it was not till the eighteenth that
he was able to complete the reformation of the public services. There is
then no difficulty in the way of our assuming that there was yet public
worship of idols in Judah during the first five years of Jeremiah's
labours. We must not, however, refer the prophet's words to this alone.
The following of Baal by the people was not put an end to when the
altars and images were demolished; for this was sufficient neither to
banish from the hearts of the people the proneness to idolatry, nor
utterly to suppress the secret practising of it. The answer to the
protestation of the people, blinded in self-righteousness, shows,
further, that the grosser publicly practised forms had not yet
disappeared. "See thy way in the valley." Way, i.e., doing and
practising. בּגּיא with the article must be some valley known for
superstitions cultivated there; most commentators suggest rightly the
valley of Ben or Bne-Hinnom to the south of Jerusalem, where children
were offered to Moloch; see on [Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md). The next words, "and know what
thou hast done," do not, taken by themselves, imply that this form of
idol-worship was yet to be met with, but only that the people had not
yet purified themselves from it. If, however, we take them in connection
with what follows, they certainly do imply the continued existence of
practices of that sort. The prophet remonstrates with the people for its
passionate devotion to idolatry by comparing it to irrational animals,
which in their season of heat yield themselves to their instinct. The
comparison gains in pointedness by his addressing the people as a
camel-filly and a wild she-ass. 'בּכרה is vocative, co-ordinate with the
subject of address, and means the young filly of the camel. קלּה,
running lightly, nimbly, swiftly. 'משׂרכת דר, intertwining, i.e.,
crossing her says; rushing right and left on the paths during the season
of heat. Thus Israel ran now after one god, now after another, deviating
to the right and to the left from the path prescribed by the law, [Deu
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#014.md). To delineate yet more sharply
the unruly passionateness with which the people rioted in idolatry,
there is added the figure of a wild ass running herself weary in her
heat. Hitz. holds the comparison to be so managed that the figure of the
she-camel is adhered to, and that this creature is compared to a wild
ass only in respect of its panting for air. But this view could be well
founded only if the Keri נפשׁהּ were the original reading. Then we might
read the words thus: (like) a wild ass used to the wilderness she (the
she-camel) pants in the heat of her soul for air. But this is
incompatible with the Cheth. נפשׁו, since the suffix points back to
פּרה, and requires בּאוּת נפשׁו to be joined with 'פּרה ל, so that שׁאפה
must be spoken of the latter. Besides, taken on its own account, it is a
very unnatural hypothesis that the behaviour of the she-camel should be
itself compared to the gasping of the wild ass for breath; for the camel
is only a figure of the people, and [Jer
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024.md) is meant to exhibit the unbridled
ardour, not of the camel, but of the people. So that with the rest of
the comm. we take the wild ass to be a second figure for the people.
פּרה differs only orthographically from פּרא, the usual form of the
word, and which many codd. have here. This is the wood ass, or rather
wild ass, since the creature lives on steppes, not in woods. It is of a
yellowish colour, with a white belly, and forms a kind of link between
the deer species and the ass; by reason of its arrow-like speed not
easily caught, and untameable. Thus it is used as an emblem of boundless
love of freedom, [Gen 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012.md), and of
unbridled licentiousness, see on [Job
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005.md) and [Job
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005.md). פּרהas nom. epicaen. has the
adj. next it, למּד ,ti t, in the masc., and so too in the apposition
בּאוּת נפשׁו; the fem. appears first in the statement as to its
behaviour, שׁאפה: she pants for air to cool the glow of heat within.
תּאנה sig. neither copulation, from אנה, approach (Dietr.), nor aestus
libidinosus (Schroed., Ros.). The sig. approach, meet, attributed to
אנה, Dietr. grounds upon the Ags. gelimpan, to be convenient, opportune;
and the sig. slow is derived from the fact that Arab. ̀ny is used of the
boiling of water. The root meaning of אנה, Arab. ̀ny, is, according to
Fleischer, tempestivus fuit, and the root indicates generally any effort
after the attainment of the aim of a thing, or impulse; from which come
all the meanings ascribed to the word, and for תּאנה in the text before
us the sig. heat, i.e., the animal instinct impelling to the
satisfaction of sexual cravings.

[Jer 2:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024.md)

In [Jer 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024.md) בּחדשׁהּ is variously
interpreted. Thus much is beyond all doubt, that the words are still a
part of the figure, i.e., of the comparison between the idolatrous
people and the wild ass. The use of the 3rd person stands in the way of
the direct reference of the words to Israel, since in what precedes and
in what follows Israel is addressed (in 2nd pers.). חדשׁ can thus mean
neither the new moon as a feast (L. de Dieu, Chr. B. Mich.), still less
tempus menstruum (Jerome, etc.), but month; and the suffix in הדשׁהּ is
to be referred, not with Hitz. to תּאנתהּ, but to פּרה. The suffixes in
מבקשׁיה and ימצאוּנה absolutely demand this. "Her month" is the month
appointed for the gratification of the wild ass's natural impulse, i.e.,
as Bochart rightly explains it (Hieroz. ii. p. 230, ed. Ros.) mensis quo
solent sylvestres asinae maris appetitu fervere. The meaning of the
comparison is this: the false gods do not need anxiously to court the
favour of the people; in its unbridled desires it gives itself up to
them; cf. [Jer 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002.md); [Hos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#007.md), [Hos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015.md). With this is suitably coupled
the warning of [Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025.md) : hold back,
i.e., keep thy foot from getting bare (יהף is subst. not adjective,
which would have had to be fem., since רגל is fem.), and thy throat from
thirst, viz., by reason of the fever of running after the idols. This
admonition God addresses by the prophet to the people. It is not to wear
the sandals off its feet by running after amours, nor so to heat its
throat as to become thirsty. Hitz. proposes unsuitably, because in the
face of the context, to connect the going barefoot with the visiting of
the sanctuary, and the thirsting of the throat ([Kg1
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026).md) with incessant calling on the
gods. The answer of the people to this admonition shows clearly that it
has been receiving an advice against running after the gods. The Chet.
וגורנך is evidently a copyists's error for וּגרונך. The people replies:
נואשׁ, desperatum (est), i.e., hopeless; thy advice of all in vain; cf.
[Jer 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md), and on [Isa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010.md). The meaning is made clearer by
לוא: no; for I love the aliens, etc. זרים are not merely strange gods,
but also strange peoples. Although idolatry is the matter chiefly in
hand, yet it was so bound up with intriguing for the favour of the
heathen nations that we cannot exclude from the words some reference to
this also.

[Jeremiah 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 2:26</span></span>

And yet idolatry brings to the people only disgrace, giving no help in
the time of need. [Jer 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026.md). "As a
thief is shamed when he is taken, so is the house of Israel put to
shame; they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their
prophets. [Jer 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027.md). Because they say
to the wood, Thou art my father; and to the stone, Thou hast borne me:
for they have turned to me the back and not the face; but in the time of
their trouble they say, Arise, and help us. [Jer
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#028.md). Where then are thy gods that
thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can help thee in the time
of thy trouble; for as many as are thy cities, so many are thy gods,
Judah." The thought in [Jer 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026.md) and
[Jer 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027.md) is this, Israel reaps from
its idolatry but shame, as the thief from stealing when he is caught in
the act. The comparison in [Jer 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026.md)
contains a universal truth of force at all times. The perf. הובישׁוּ is
the timeless expression of certainty (Hitz.), and refers to the past as
well as to the future. Just as already in past time, so also in the
future, idolatry brings but shame and confusion by the frustration of
the hopes placed in the false gods. The "house of Israel" is all Israel
collectively, and not merely the kingdom of the ten tribes. To give the
greater emphasis to the reproaches, the leading ranks are mentioned one
by one. אמרים, not: who say, but because (since) they say to the wood,
etc., i.e., because they hold images of wood and stone for the gods to
whom they owe life and being; whereas Jahveh alone is their Creator or
Father and Genitor, [Deu 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md), [Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018.md); [Isa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007.md); [Mal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md). אבן is fem., and thus is put for
mother. The Keri ילדתּנוּ is suggested solely by the preceding אמרים,
while the Chet. is correct, and is to be read ילדתּני, inasmuch as each
one severally speaks thus. - With "for they have turned" follows the
reason of the statement that Israel will reap only shame from its
idolatry. To the living God who has power to help them they turn their
back; but when distress comes upon them they cry to Him for help (קוּמה
והושׁיענוּ as in [Psa 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008).md). But then
God will send the people to their gods (idols); then will it discover
they will not help, for all so great as their number is. The last clause
of [Jer 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#028.md) runs literally: the
number of thy cities are thy gods become, i.e., so great is the number
of thy gods; cf. [Jer 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013.md). Judah is
here directly addressed, so that the people of Judah may not take for
granted that what has been said is of force for the ten tribes only. On
the contrary, Judah will experience the same as Israel of the ten tribes
did when disaster broke over it.

[Jeremiah 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 2:29</span></span>

Judah has refused to let itself be turned from idolatry either by
judgments or by the warnings of the prophets; nevertheless it holds
itself guiltless, and believes itself able to turn aside judgment by
means of its intrigues with Egypt. [Jer
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#029.md). "Wherefore contend ye against
me? ye are all fallen away from me, saith Jahveh. [Jer
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030.md). In vain have I smitten your
sons; correction have they not taken: your sword hath devoured your
prophets, like a devouring lion. [Jer
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031.md). O race that ye are, mark the
word of Jahveh. Was I a wilderness to Israel, or a land of dread
darkness? Why saith my people, We wander about, come no more to thee?
[Jer 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#032.md). Does a maiden forget her
ornaments, a bride her girdle? but my people hath forgotten me days
without number. [Jer 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033.md). How finely
thou trimmest thy ways to seek love! therefore to misdeeds thou
accustomest thy ways. [Jer 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#034.md). Even
in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor ones;
not at housebreaking hast thou caught them, but by reason of all this.
[Jer 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035.md). And thou sayest, I am
innocent, yea His wrath hath turned from me: behold, I will plead at law
with thee for that thou hast said, I have not sinned. [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036.md). Why runnest thou so hard to
change thy way? for Egypt too thou shalt come to shame, as thou wast put
to shame for Asshur. [Jer 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#037.md). From
this also shalt thou come forth, beating thy hands upon thy head; for
Jahveh rejecteth those in whom thou trustest, and thou shalt not prosper
with them." The question in [Jer 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#029.md),
Wherefore contend ye against me? implies that the people contended with
God as to His visitations, murmured at the divine chastisements they had
met with; not as to the reproaches addressed to them on account of their
idolatry (Hitz., Graf). ריב with אל, contend, dispute against, is used
of the murmuring of men against divine visitations, [Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md); [Job
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013.md). Judah has no ground for
discontent with the Lord; for they have all fallen away from Him, and
([Jer 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031).md) let themselves be turned
to repentance neither by afflictions, nor by warnings, nor by God's
goodness to them. לשּׁוא, to vanity, i.e., without effect, or in vain.
Hitz. and Graf wish to refer "your sons" to the able-bodied youth who
had at different times been slain by Jahveh in war. The lxx seem to have
taken it thus, expression לקחוּ by ἐδέξασθε; for the third pers. of the
verb will not agree with this acceptation of "your sons," since the
reproach of not having taken correction could not apply to such as had
fallen in war, but only to those who had escaped. This view is
unquestionably incorrect, because, as Hitz. admits the subject, those
addressed in לקחוּ, must be the people. Hence it follows of necessity
that in בּניכם too the people is meant. The expression is similar to
בּני עמּך, [Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md), and is used for
the members of the nation, those who constitute the people; or rather it
is like בּני יהוּדה, [Joe 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006.md), where
Judah is looked on by the prophet as a unity, where sons are the members
of the people. הכּה, too, is not to be limited to those smitten or slain
in war. It is used of all the judgments with which God visits His
people, of sword, pestilence, famine, failure of crops, drought, and of
all kinds of diseases; cf. [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024.md)., [Deu
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#022.md), [Deu
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md). מוּסר is instruction by word
and by warning, as well as correction by chastisement. Most comm. take
the not receiving of correction to refer to divine punitive visitations,
and to mean refusal to amend after such warning; Ros., on the other
hand, holds the reference to be to the warnings and reproofs of the
prophets (מוּסר( stehpohic instructionem valet, ut [Pro
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#012.md), [Pro
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023) cet..md). But both these references
are one-sided. If we refer "correction have they not taken" to divine
chastisement by means of judgments, there will be no connection between
this and the following clause: your sword devoured your prophets; and we
are hindered from restraining the reference wholly to the admonitions
and rebukes of the prophets by the close connection of the words with
the first part of the verse, a connection indicated by the omission of
all particles of transition. We must combine the two references, and
understand מוּסר both of the rebukes or warnings of the prophets and of
the chastisements of God, holding at the same time that it was the
correction of the people by the prophets that Jer. here chiefly kept in
view. In administering this correction the prophets not only applied to
the hearts of the people as judgments from God all the ills that fell
upon them, but declared to the stiff-necked sinners the punishments of
God, and by their words showed those punishments to be impending: e.g.,
Elijah, 1 Kings 17 and 18, [Kg2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009.md).;
Elisha, [Kg2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023.md); the prophet at
Bethel, [Kg1 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#004.md). Thus this portion
of the verse acquires a meaning for itself, which simplifies the
transition from the first to the third clause, and we gain the following
thought: I visited you with punishments, and made you to be instructed
and reproved by prophets, but ye have slain the prophets who were sent
to you. Nehemiah puts it so in [Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026.md); but Jeremiah uses a much
stronger expression, Your sword devoured your prophets like a lion which
destroys, in order to set full before the sinners' eyes the savage
hatred of the idolatrous people against the prophets of God. Historical
examples of this are furnished by [Kg1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004.md), [Kg1
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#013.md); [Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md); [Ch2
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021.md)., [Kg2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md); [Jer
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#023.md).

The prophet's indignation grows hotter as he brings into view God's
treatment of the apostate race, and sets before it, to its shame, the
divine long-suffering and love. הדּור, O generation ye! English: O
generation that ye are! (cf. Ew. 327, a), is the cry of indignation; cf.
[Deu 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md), where Moses calls the
people a perverse foolish generation. ראוּ: see, observe, give heed to
the word of the Lord. This verb is often used of perceptions by any
sense, as expressive of that sense by which men apprehend most of the
things belonging to the outward world. Have I been for Israel a
wilderness, i.e., an unfruitful soil, offering neither means of support
nor shelter? This question contains a litotes, and is as much as to say:
have not I richly blessed Israel with earthly goods? Or a land of dread
darkness? מאפּליה, lit., a darkness sent by Jahveh; cf. the analogous
form שׁלהבתיה, [Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md).

(Note: Ewald, Gram. 270, c, proposes to read with the lxx מאפלּיּה,
because (he says) it is nowhere possible, at least not in the language
of the prophets, for the name Jah (God) to express merely greatness. But
this is not to the point. Although a darkness sent by Jah be a great
darkness, it by no means follows that the name Jah is used merely to
express greatness. But by תּרדּמת ; [Sa1
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#012.md), it is put beyond a doubt that
darkness of Jah means a darkness sent or spread out by Jah.)

The desert is so called not merely because it is pathless ([Job
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#023).md), but as a land in which the
traveller is on all sides surrounded by deadly dangers; cf. [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md) and [Psa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#005.md). Why then will His people insist
on being quit of Him? We roam about unfettered (as to רוּד, see on [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md), i.e., we will no longer bear
the yoke of His law; cf. [Jer 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md). By
a comparison breathing love and longing sadness, the prophet seeks to
bring home to the heart of the people a feeling of the unnaturalness of
their behaviour towards the Lord their God. Does a bride, then, forget
her ornaments? etc. קשׁרים, found besides in [Isa
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020.md), is the ornamental girdle with
which the bride adorns herself on the wedding-day; cf. [Isa
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020.md) with [Isa
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md). God is His people's best
adornment; to Him it owes all the precious possessions it has. It should
keep fast hold of Him as its most priceless treasure, should prize Him
more highly than the virgin her jewels, than the bride her girdle. but
instead of this it has forgotten its God, and that not for a brief time,
but throughout countless days. ימים is accus. of duration of time.
Jeremiah uses this figure besides, as Calv. observed, to pave the way
for what comes next. Volebat enim Judaeos conferre mulieribus adulteris,
quae dum feruntur effreni sua libidine, rapiuntur post suos vagos
amores.

[Jeremiah 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 2:33</span></span>

In [Jer 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033.md) the style of address is
ironical. How good thou makest thy way! i.e., how well thou knowest to
choose out and follow the right way to seek love. היטיב דּרך sig.
usually: strive after a good walk and conversation; cf. [Jer
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#003.md), [Jer
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#005.md); [Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md), etc.; here, on the other hand,
to take the right way for gaining the end in view. "Love" here is seen
from the context to be love to the idols, intrigues with the heathen and
their gods. Seek love = strive to gain the love of the false gods. To
attain this end thou hast taught thy ways misdeeds, i.e., accustomed thy
ways to misdeeds, forsaken the commandments of thy God which demand
righteousness and the purifying of one's life, and accommodated thyself
to the immoral practices of the heathen. הרעות, with the article as in
[Jer 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005.md), the evil deeds which are
undisguisedly visible; not: the evils, the misfortunes which follow thee
closely, as Hitz. interprets in the face of the context. For in [Jer
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#034.md) we have indisputable evidence
that the matter in hand is not evils and misfortunes, but evil deeds or
misdemeanours; since there the cleaving of the blood of innocent souls
to the hems of the garments is mentioned as one of the basest "evils,"
and as such is introduced by the גּם of gradation. The "blood of souls"
is the blood of innocent murdered men, which clings to the skirts of the
murderers' clothes. כּנפים are the skirts of the flowing garment, [Eze
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#003.md); [Sa1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#027.md); [Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md). The plural נמצאוּ before דּם is
explained by the fact that נפשׁות is the principal idea. אביונים are not
merely those who live in straitened circumstances, but pious oppressed
ones as contrasted with powerful transgressors and oppressors; cf. Ps.
40:18; [Psa 72:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#013.md)., [Psa
86:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001.md), etc. By the next clause
greater prominence is given to the fact that they were slain being
innocent. The words: not בּמּחתּרת, at housebreaking, thou tookest them,
contain an allusion to the law in [Exo
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md) and onwards; according to which
the killing of a thief caught in the act of breaking in was not a cause
of blood-guiltiness. The thought runs thus: The poor ones thou hast
slain were no thieves or robbers whom thou hadst a right to slay, but
guiltless pious men; and the killing of them is a crime worthy of death.
[Exo 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md). The last words כּי על
כּל־אלּה are obscure, and have been very variously interpreted. Changes
upon the text are not to the purpose. For we get no help from the
reading of the lxx, of the Syr. and Arab., which seem to have read אלּה
as אלה, and which have translated δρυΐ́ oak or terebinth; since "upon
every oak" gives no rational meaning. Nor from the connection of the
words with the next verse (Venem., Schnur., Ros., and others): yet with
all this, or in spite of all this, thou saidst; since neither does כּי
mean yet, nor can the ו before תאמרי, in this connection, introduce the
sequel thought. The words manifestly belong to what goes before, and
contain a contrast: not in breaking in by night thou tookest them, but
upon, or on account of all this. על in the sig. upon gives a suitable
sense only if, with Abarb., Ew., Ng., we refer אלּה to בּכנפיך and take
מצאתים as 1st pers.: I found it (the blood of the slain souls) not on
the place where the murder took place, but upon all these, sc. lappets
of the clothes, i.e., borne openly for display. But even without
dwelling on the fact that מחתּרת does not mean the scene of a murder or
breaking in, this explanation is wrecked on the unmistakeably manifest
allusion to the law, אם בּמּחתּרת ימּצא הגּנּב, [Exo
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001.md), which is ignored, or at least
obscured, by that view. The allusion to this passage of the law shows
that מצאתים is not 1st but 2nd pers., and that the suffix refers to the
innocent poor who were slain. Therefore, with Hitz. and Graf, we take על
כּל־ אלּה in the sig. "on account of all this," and refer the "all this"
to the idolatry before mentioned. Consequently the words bear this
meaning: Not for a crime thou killedst the poor, but because of thine
apostasy from God and thy fornication with the idols, their blood
cleaves to thy raiment. the words seem, as Calv. surmised, to point to
the persecution and slaying of the prophets spoken of in [Jer
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030.md), namely, to the innocent blood
with which the godless king Manasseh filled Jerusalem, [Kg2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md); [Kg2
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#004.md); seeking as he did to crush out
all opposition to the abominations of idolatry, and finding in his way
the prophets and the godly of the land, who by their words and their
lives lifted up their common testimony against the idolaters and their
abandoned practices.

[Jeremiah 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 2:35</span></span>

Yet withal the people holds itself to be guiltless, and deludes itself
with the belief that God's wrath has turned away from it, because it has
for long enjoyed peace, and because the judgment of devastation of the
land by enemies, threatened by the earlier prophets, had not immediately
received its fulfilment. For this self-righteous confidence in its
innocence, God will contend with His people (אותך for אתּך as in [Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 2:36</span></span>

Yet in spite of its proud security Judah seeks to assure itself against
hostile attacks by the eager negotiation of alliances. This thought is
the link between [Jer 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035.md) and the
reproach of [Jer 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036.md). Why runnest
thou to change thy way? תּזלּי for תּאזלי, from אזל, go, with מאד, go
impetuously or with strength, i.e., go in haste, run; cf. [Sa1
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#019). To change, shift (שׁנּות.md) one's
way, is to take another way than that on which one has hitherto gone.
The prophet's meaning is clear from the second half of the verse: "for
Egypt, too, wilt thou come to shame, as for Assyria thou hast come to
shame." Changing they way, is ceasing to seek help from Assyria in order
to form close relations with Egypt. The verbs תּבשׁי and בּשׁתּ show
that the intrigues for the favour of Assyria belong to the past, for the
favour of Egypt to the present. Judah was put to shame in regard to
Assyria under Ahaz, [Ch2 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md); and
after the experience of Assyria it had had under Hezekiah and Manasseh,
there could be little more thought of looking for help thence. But what
could have made Judah under Josiah, in the earlier days of Jeremiah, to
seek an alliance with Egypt, considering that Assyria was at that time
already nearing its dissolution? Graf is therefore of opinion that the
prophet is here keeping in view the political relations in the days of
Jehoiakim, in which and for which time he wrote his book, rather than
those of Josiah's times, when the alliance with Asshur was still in
force; and that he has thus in passing cast a stray glance into a time
influenced by later events. But the opinion that in Josiah's time the
alliance with Asshur was still existing cannot be historically proved.
Josiah's invitation to the passover of all those who remained in what
had been the kingdom of the ten tribes, does not prove that he exercised
a kind of sovereignty over the provinces that had formerly belonged to
the kingdom of Israel, a thing he could have done only as vassal of
Assyria; see against this view the remarks on [Kg2
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015.md). As little does his setting
himself against the now mighty Pharaoh Necho at Mediggo show clearly
that he remained faithful to the alliance with Asshur in spite of the
disruption of the Assyrian empire; see against this the remarks on [Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md). Historically only thus much is
certain, that Jehoiakim was raised to the throne by Pharaoh Necho, and
that he was a vassal of Egypt. During the period of this subjection the
formation of alliances with Egypt was for Judah out of the question.
Such a case could happen only when Jehoiakim had become subject to the
Chaldean king Nebuchadnezzar, and was cherishing the plan of throwing
off the Chaldean yoke. But the reference of the words to this design is
devoid of the faintest probability, [Jer
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035.md) and [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036.md); and the discourse throughout is
far from giving the impression that Judah had already lost its political
independence; they rather imply that the kingdom was under the sway
neither of Assyrians nor Egyptians, but was still politically
independent. We may very plausibly refer to Josiah's time the resolution
to give up all trust in the assistance of Assyria and to court the
favour of Egypt. We need not seek for the outward inducement to this in
the recognition of the beginning decline of the Assyrian power; it might
equally well lie in the growth of the Egyptian state. that the power of
Egypt had made considerable progress in the reign of Josiah, is made
clear by Pharaoh Necho's enterprise against Assyria in the last year of
Josiah, from Necho's march towards the Euphrates. Josiah's setting
himself in opposition to the advance of the Egyptians, which cost him
his life at Megiddo, neither proves that Judah was then allied with
Assyria nor excludes the possibility of intrigues for Egypt's favour
having already taken place. It is perfectly possible that the taking of
Manasseh a captive to Babylon by Assyrian generals may have shaken the
confidence in Assyria of the idolatrous people of Judah, and that, their
thoughts turning to Egypt, steps may have been taken for paving the way
towards an alliance with this great power, even although the godly king
Josiah took no part in these proceedings. The prophets' warning against
confidence in Egypt and against courting its alliance, is given in terms
so general that it is impossible to draw any certain conclusions either
with regard to the principles of Josiah's government or with regard to
the circumstances of the time which Jeremiah was keeping in view.

[Jeremiah 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 2:37</span></span>

Also from this, i.e., Egypt, shalt thou go away (come back), thy hands
upon thy head, i.e., beating them on thy head in grief and dismay (cf.
for this gesture [Sa2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019).md). זה
refers to Egypt, thought of as a people as in [Jer
46:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#008.md); [Isa
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016.md), [Isa
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#025.md); and thus is removed Hitz.'s
objection, that in that case we must have מבטחים .זאת, objects of
confidence. The expression refers equally to Egypt and to Assyria. As
God has broken the power of Assyria, so will He also overthrow Egypt's
might, thus making all trust in it a shame. להם, in reference to them.
