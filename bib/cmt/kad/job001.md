### [Job Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

Ἐπ ̓ αὐτῶν τῶν λέξεων \[τοῦ βιβλίου\] γενόμενοι σαφηνίσωμεν τὴν
ἔννοιαν,αὐτοῦ ποδηγούντος ἡμᾶς πρὸς τὴν ἑρμηνείαν, τοῦ καὶ τὸν ἅγιονἸὼβ
πρὸς τοὺς ἀγῶνας ἐνισχύσαντος. - Olympiodoros.

The Opening - [Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

Job's Piety in the Midst of the Greatest Prosperity - [Job
1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

The book begins in prose style: as Jerome says, Prosa incipit, versu
labitur, pedestri sermone finitur. Prologue and epilogue are accordingly
excepted from the poetical accentuation, and are accented according to
the usual system, as the first word shows; for אישׁ has, in correct
editions, Tebir, a smaller distinctive, which does not belong to the
poetical accentuation. The writer does not begin with ויהי, as the
writers of the historico-prophetical books, who are conscious that they
are relating a portion of the connection of the collective Israelitish
history, e.g., [Sa1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md), אישׁ ויהי,
but, as the writer of the book of Esther ([Est
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005).md) for similar reasons, with היה
אישׁ, because he is beginning a detached extra-Israelitish history.

[Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 1:1</span></span>

1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man
was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.

The lxx translates, ἐν χώρᾳ τῇ Αὐσίτιδι; and adds at the close of the
book, ἐπὶ τοῖς ὁρίοις τῆν Ἰδουμαίας καὶ Ἀραβίας, therefore north-east
from Idumea, towards the Arabian desert. There, in the Arabian desert
west from Babylon, under the Caucabenes, according to Ptolemy (v. 19,
2), the Αἰσῖται (Αἰσεῖται), i.e., the Uzzites, dwelt. This determination
of the position of Uz is the most to be relied on. It tends indirectly
to confirm this, that Οὖσος, in Jos. Ant. i. 6, 4, is described as
founder of Trachonitis and Damascus; that the Jakut Hamawi and Moslem
tradition generally (as recently Fries, Stud. u. Krit. 1854, ii.)
mention the East Haran fertile tract of country north-west of Tm and
Bzn, el-Bethenije, the district of Damascus in which Job dwelt;

(Note: Vid., Abulfeda, Historia anteislam. p. 26 (cf. 207f.), where it
says, "The whole of Bethenije, a part of the province of Damascus,
belonged to Job as his possession.")

that the Syrian tradition also transfers the dwelling-place of Job to
Hauran, where, in the district of Damascus, a monastery to his honour is
called Dair Ejjub (vid., Volck, Calendarium Syriacum, p. 29). All these
accounts agree that Uz is not to be sought in Idumaea proper (Gebl). And
the early historical genealogies ([Gen
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#023.md); [Gen
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md); [Gen
36:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#028).md) are not unfavourable to this,
since they place Uz in relation to Seir-Edom on the one hand, and on the
other to Aram: the perplexing double occurrence of such names as Tm and
Dma, both in Idumaea and East Hauran, perhaps just results from the
mixing of the different tribes through migration. But at all events,
though Uz did not lie in Gebl, yet both from [Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md), and on account of the reference
in the book of Job itself to the Horites, a geographical connection
between Idumaea and Ausitis is to be held; and from [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md) one is warranted in supposing,
that עוץ, with which the Arabic name of Esau, ‛yṣ ('l-‛yṣ), perhaps not
accidentally accords, was the collective name of the northern part of
the Arabian desert, extending north-east from Idumaea towards Syria.
Here, where the aborigines of Seir were driven back by the Aramaic
immigrants, and to where in later times the territory of Edom extended,
dwelt Job. His name is not symbolic with reference to the following
history. It has been said, איּוב signifies one hostilely treated, by
Satan namely.

(Note: Geiger (DMZ, 1858, S. 542f.) conjectures that, Sir. xlix. 9 (καὶ
γὰρ ἐμνήσθη τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἐν ὄμβρῳ), τῶν ἐχθρῶν is a false translation of
איוב. Renan assents; but τῶν εχθρῶν suits there excellently, and Job
would be unnaturally dragged in.)

But the following reasons are against it: (1) that none of the other
names which occur in the book are symbolically connected with the
history; (2) that the form קטּול has never a properly passive
signification, but either active, as יסּור, reprover (as parallel form
with קטּל), or neuter, as ילּוד, born, שׁכּור, drunken, also
occasionally infinitive (vid., Frst, Concord. p. 1349 s.), so that it
may be more correct, with Ewald, after the Arabic (אוּב, cognate with
שׁוּב, perhaps also בּוא), to explain the "one going of himself."
Similar in sound are, יוב, the name of one of the sons of Issachar ([Gen
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013).md); the name of the Idumaean king,
יובב, [Gen 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#033.md) (which the lxx,
Aristeas, Jul. Africanus,

(Note: Vid., Routh, Relinquiae ii. 154f.: Ἐκ τοῦ Ἠσαῦ ἄλλοι τε πολλοὶ
καὶ Ραγουὴλ γεννᾶται ἀφ ̓ οὗ Ζάρεδ, ἐξ οὗ Ἰὼβ ὅς κατὰ συγχώρησιν θεοῦ
ὑπὸ διαβόλου ἐπειράσθη καὶ ἐνίκησε τὸν πειράζοντα.)

combine with Job); and the name of the king of Mauritania, Juba, which
in Greek is written Ἰόβας (Didymus Chalcenter. ed. Schmidt, p. 305):
perhaps all these names belong to the root יב, to shout with joy. The
lxx writes Ἰώβ with lenis; elsewhere the א at the beginning is rendered
by asper, e.g., Αβραάμ, Ἡλίας. Luther writes Hiob; he has preferred the
latter mode, that it may not be read Job with the consonantal Jod, when
it should be Iob, as e.g., it is read by the English. It had been more
correctly Ijob, but Luther wished to keep to the customary form of the
name so far as he could; so we, by writing Iob with vowel I, do not wish
to deviate too much from the mode of writing and pronunciation customary
since Luther.

(Note: On the authorizing of the writing Iob, more exactly ob, also job
(not, however, Ijjob, which does not correspond to the real
pronunciation, which softens ij into , and uw into ), vid., Fleischer's
Beitrge zur arab. Sprachkunde (Abh. der schs. Gesellschaft d.
Wissenschaften, 1863), S. 137f. \[The usual English form Job is adopted
here, though Dr. Delitzsch writes Iob in the original work. - Tr.\])

The writer intentionally uses four synonyms together, in order to
describe as strongly as possible Job's piety, the reality and purity of
which is the fundamental assumption of the history. תּם, with the whole
heart disposed towards God and what is good, and also well-disposed
toward mankind; ישׁר, in thought and action without deviation conformed
to that which is right; אלהים ירא, fearing God, and consequently being
actuated by the fear of God, which is the beginning (i.e., principle) of
wisdom; מרע סר, keeping aloof from evil, which is opposed to God. The
first predicate recalls [Gen 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027.md),
the fourth the proverbial Psalms ([Psa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md); [Psa
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027).md) and [Pro
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#016.md). This mingling of expressions
from Genesis and Proverbs is characteristic. First now, after the
history has been begun in praett., aorr. follow.

[Job 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 1:2</span></span>

2, 3 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. His
substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and
five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and servants in
great number; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the
east.

It is a large, princely household. The numbers are large, but must not
on that account be considered an invention. The four animals named
include both kinds. With the doubled אלפי corresponds the also
constructive מאות, the Tsere of which is never shortened, though in the
singular one says מאת, from מאה. The aorists, especially of the verb היה
(הוה), which, according to its root, signifies not so much esse as
fieri, existere, are intended to place us at once in the midst of his
prosperity. Ex iis, says Leo Africanus in reference to flocks, Arabes
suas divitias ac possessiones aestimant. In fine, Job was without his
equal among the קרם בני. So the tribes are called which extend from
Arabia Deserta, lying to the east of Palestine, northwards to the
countries on the Euphrates, and south over Arabia Petraea and Felix. The
wisdom of these tribes, treasured up in proverbs, songs, and traditions,
is mentioned in [Kg1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#010.md), side by
side with the wisdom of the Egyptians. The writer now takes a very
characteristic feature from the life of Job, to show that, even in the
height of prosperity, he preserved and manifested the piety affirmed of
him.

[Job 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 1:4</span></span>

4, 5 And his sons went and feasted in the house of him whose day it was,
and sent and called for their sisters to eat and drink with them. And it
happened, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent
and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered
burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, I may
be that my sons have sinned, and dismissed God from their hearts. Thus
did Job continually.

The subordinate facts precede, [Job
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#004.md), in perff.; the chief fact
follows, [Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md), in fut. consec. The
perff. describe, according to Ges. 126, 3, that which has happened
repeatedly in the past, as e.g., [Rut
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007.md); the fut. consec. the customary
act of Job, in conjunction with this occurrence. The consecutio temporum
is exactly like [Sa1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003.md).

It is questionable whether אישׁ בּית is a distinct adverbial expression,
in domu unuiscujusque, and יומו also distinct, die ejus (Hirz. and
others); or whether the three words are only one adverbial expression,
in domo ejus cujus dies erat, which latter we prefer. At all events,
יומו here, in this connection, is not, with Hahn, Schlottm., and others,
to be understood of the birthday, as [Job
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001.md). The text, understood simply as it
stands, speaks of a weekly round (Oehler and others). The seven sons
took it in turn to dine with one another the week round, and did not
forget their sisters in the loneliness of the parental home, but added
them to their number. There existed among them a family peace and union
which had been uninterruptedly cherished; but early on the morning of
every eighth day, Job instituted a solemn service for his family, and
offered sacrifices for his ten children, that they might obtain
forgiveness for any sins of frivolity into which they might have fallen
in the midst of the mirth of their family gatherings.

The writer might have represented this celebration on the evening of
every seventh day, but he avoids even the slightest reference to
anything Israelitish: for there is no mention in Scripture of any
celebration of the Sabbath before the time of Israel. The sacred
observance of the Sabbath, which was consecrated by God the Creator, was
first expressly enjoined by the Sinaitic Thora. Here the family
celebration falls on the morning of the Sunday, - a remarkable prelude
to the New Testament celebration of Sunday in the age before the giving
of the law, which is a type of the New Testament time after the law. The
fact that Job, as father of the family, is the Cohen of his house, - a
right of priesthood which the fathers of Israel exercised at the first
passover (מצרים פסח), and from which a relic is still retained in the
annual celebration of the passover (הדורות פסח), - is also
characteristic of the age prior to the law. The standpoint of this age
is also further faithfully preserved in this particular, that עולה here,
as also [Job 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#008.md), appears distinctly
as an expiatory offering; whilst in the Mosaic ritual, although it still
indeed serves לכפר ([Lev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004).md), as does
every blood-offering, the idea of expiation as its peculiar intention is
transferred to הטאת and אשׁם. Neither of these forms of expiatory
offering is here mentioned. The blood-offering still bears its most
general generic name, עולה, which it received after the flood. This name
indicates that the offering is one which, being consumed by fire, is
designed to ascend in flames and smoke. העלה refers not so much to
bringing it up to the raised altar, as to causing it to rise in flame
and smoke, causing it to ascend to God, who is above. קדּשׁ is the
outward cleansing and the spiritual preparation for the celebration of
the sacred festival, as [Exo 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#014.md). It
is scarcely necessary to remark, that the masculine suffixes refer also
to the daughters. There were ten whole sacrifices offered by Job on each
opening day of the weekly round, at the dawn of the Sunday; and one has
therefore to imagine this round of entertainment as beginning with the
first-born on the first day of the week. "Perhaps," says Job, "my
children have sinned, and bidden farewell to God in their hearts."
Undoubtedly, בּרך signifies elsewhere ([Kg1
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md); [Psa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003).md), according to a so-called
ἀντιφραστικὴ εὐφημία, maledicere. This signification also suits [Job
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#005.md), but does not at all suit [Job
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009.md). This latter passage supports the
signification valedicere, which arises from the custom of pronouncing a
benediction or benedictory salutation at parting (e.g., [Gen
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#010).md). Job is afraid lest his
children may have become somewhat unmindful of God during their mirthful
gatherings. In Job's family, therefore, there was an earnest desire for
sanctification, which was far from being satisfied with mere outward
propriety of conduct. Sacrifice (which is as old as the sin of mankind)
was to Job a means of grace, by which he cleansed himself and his family
every week from inward blemish. The futt. consec. are followed by
perff., which are governed by them. כּכה, however, is followed by the
fut., because in historical connection (cf. on the other hand, [Num
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#026).md), in the signification, faciebat
h.e. facere solebat (Ges. 127, 4, b). Thus Job did every day, i.e.,
continually. As head of the family, he faithfully discharged his
priestly vocation, which permitted him to offer sacrifice as an early
Gentile servant of God. The writer has now made us acquainted with the
chief person of the history which he is about to record, and in [Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md) begins the history itself.

[Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 1:6</span></span>

6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
before Jehovah; and Satan came also in the midst of them.

The translation "it happened on a day" is rejected in Ges. 109, rem. 1,
c.

(Note: The references to Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar have been carefully
verified according to the English edition published by Bagster and Sons,
London. - Tr.)

The article, it is there said, refers to what precedes - the day, at the
time; but this favourite mode of expression is found at the beginning of
a narrative, even when it cannot be considered to have any reference to
what has preceded, e.g., [Kg2 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#018.md).
The article is used in the opposite manner here, because the narrator in
thought connects the day with the following occurrence; and this frees
it from absolute indefiniteness: the western mode of expression is
different. From the writer assigning the earthly measure of time to the
place of God and spirits, we see that celestial things are represented
by him parabolically. But the assumptions on which he proceeds are
everywhere recognised in Scripture; for (1.) האלהים בּני, as the name of
the celestial spirits, is also found out of the book of Job ([Gen
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002.md); cf. [Psa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md); [Psa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007.md); [Dan
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025).md). They are so called, as beings
in the likeness of God, which came forth from God in the earliest
beginning of creation, before this material world and man came into
existence ([Job 28:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004).md): the
designation בּני points to the particular manner of their creation. (2.)
Further, it is the teaching of Scripture, that these are the nearest
attendants upon God, the nearest created glory, with which He has
surrounded himself in His eternal glory, and that He uses them as the
immediate instruments of His cosmical rule. This representation
underlies [Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md), which Philo
correctly explains, διαλέγεται ὁ τῶν ὅλων πατὴρ ταῖς ἑαυτοῦ δυνάμεσιν;
and in [Psa 59:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006.md), a psalm which is
closely allied to the book of Job, קהל and סוד, of the holy ones, is
just the assembly of the heavenly spirits, from which, as ἄγγελοι of
God, they go forth into the universe and among men. (3.) It is also
further the teaching of Scripture, that one of these spirits has
withdrawn himself from the love of God, has reversed the truth of his
bright existence, and in sullen ardent self-love is become the enemy of
God, and everything godlike in the creature. This spirit is called, in
reference to God and the creature, השּׂטן ,er, from the verb שׂטן, to
come in the way, oppose, treat with enmity, - a name which occurs first
here, and except here occurs only in [Zac
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md) and [Ch1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001.md). Since the Chokma turned, with a
decided preference, to the earliest records of the world and mankind
before the rise of nationalities, it must have known the existence of
this God-opposing spirit from Gen. 2f. The frequent occurrence of the
tree of life and the way of life in the Salomonic Proverbs, shows how
earnestly the research of that time was engaged with the history of
Paradise: so that it cannot be surprising that it coined the name השּׂטן
for that evil spirit. (4.) Finally, it agrees with [Kg1
22:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019.md); [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md), on the one hand, and Rev. 12 on
the other, that Satan here appears still among the good spirits,
resembling Judas Iscariot among the disciples until his treachery was
revealed. The work of redemption, about which his enmity to God overdid
itself, and by which his damnation is perfected, is during the whole
course of the Old Testament history incomplete.

Herder, Eichhorn, Lutz, Ewald, and Umbreit, see in this distinct placing
of Satan in relation to the Deity and good spirits nothing but a change
of representations arising from foreign influences; but if Jesus Christ
is really the vanquisher of Satan, as He himself says, the realm of
spirits must have a history, which is divided into two eras by this
triumph. Moreover, both the Old and New Testaments agree herein, that
Satan is God's adversary, and consequently altogether evil, and must
notwithstanding serve God, since He makes even evil minister to His
purpose of salvation, and the working out of His plan in the government
of the world. This is the chief thought which underlies the further
progress of the scene. The earthly elements of time, space, and
dialogue, belong to the poetic drapery.

Instead of על התיצּב, לפני is used elsewhere ([Pro
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029).md): על is a usage of language
derived from the optical illusion to the one who is in the foreground
seeming to surpass the one in the background. It is an assembly day in
heaven. All the spirits present themselves to render their account, and
expecting to receive commands; and the following dialogue ensues between
Jehovah and Satan: -

[Job 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 1:7</span></span>

7 Then Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou? Satan answered
Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking
up and down in it.

The fut. follows מאין in the signification of the praes., Whence comest
thou? the perf. would signify, Whence hast thou come? (Ges. 127, 2).
Cocceius subtly observes: Notatur Satanas velut Deo nescio h.e. non
adprobante res suas agere. It is implied in the question that his
business is selfish, arbitrary, and has no connection with God. In his
answer, בּ שׁוּט, as [Sa2 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#002.md),
signifies rapid passing from one end to the other; התלּך, an observant
roaming forth. Peter also says of Satan, περιπατεῖ ([Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008)..md).

(Note: Among the Arabs the devil is called 'l-ḥârt, el-hharith - the
active, busy, industrious one.)

He answers at first generally, as expecting a more particular question,
which Jehovah now puts to him.

[Job 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 1:8</span></span>

8 Then said Jehovah to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for
there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
that feareth God and escheweth evil.

By כּי Jehovah gives the reason of His inquiry. Had Satan been observant
of Job, even he must have confessed that there was on the earth real
genuine piety. לב שׂים, animum advertere (for לב is animus, נפשׁ anima),
is construed with על, of the object on which the attention falls, and on
which it fixes itself, or אל, of the object towards which it is directed
([Job 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003).md). The repetition of the four
predicates used of Job ([Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001).md) in
the mouth of Jehovah (though without the waw combining both pairs there)
is a skilful touch of the poet. Further on, the narrative is also
interwoven with poetic repetitions (as e.g., Job 34 and Gen 1), to give
it architectural symmetry, and to strengthen the meaning and impression
of what is said. Jehovah triumphantly displays His servant, the
incomparable one, in opposition to Satan; but this does not disconcert
him: he knows how, as on all occasions, so here also, to deny what
Jehovah affirms.

[Job 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 1:9</span></span>

9-11 Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for
nought? Hast Thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and
about all that he hath on every side? Hast Thou not blessed the work of
his hands, and his substance is increased in the land? But put forth
Thine hand now, and touch all that he hath: truly he will renounce Thee
to Thy face.

Satan is, according to the [Rev 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010.md),
the κατήγωρ who accuses the servants of God day and night before God. It
is a fact respecting the invisible world, though expressed in the
language and imagery of this world. So long as he is not finally
vanquished and condemned, he has access to God, and thinks to justify
himself by denying the truth of the existence and the possibility of the
continuance of all piety. God permits it; for since everything happening
to the creature is placed under the law of free development, evil in the
world of spirits is also free to maintain and expand itself, until a
spiritual power comes forward against it, by which the hitherto wavering
conflict between the principles of good and evil is decided. This is the
truth contained in the poetic description of the heavenly scene, sadly
mistaken by Umbreit in his Essay on Sin, 1853, in which he explains
Satan, according to [Psa 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md), as a
creation of our author's fancy. The paucity of the declarations
respecting Satan in the Old Testament has misled him. And indeed the
historical advance from the Old Testament to the New, though in itself
well authorized, has in many ways of late induced to the levelling of
the heights and depths of the New Testament. Formerly Umbreit was of the
opinion, as many are still, that the idea of Satan is derived from
Persia; but between Ahriman (Angramainyus) and Satan there is no
striking resemblance;

(Note: Moreover, it is still questionable whether the form of the
ancient doctrine of fire-worship among the Persians did not result from
Jewish influences. Vid., Stuhr, Religionssysteme der herdn. Vlker des
Orients, S. 373-75.)

whereas Diestel, in his Abh. ber Set-Typhon, Asasel und Satan, Stud. u.
Krit., 1860, 2, cannot indeed recognise any connection between עזאזל and
the Satan of the book of Job, but maintains a more complete harmony in
all substantial marks between the latter and the Egyptian Typhon, and
infers that "to Satan is therefore to be denied a purely Israelitish
originality, the natural outgrowth of the Hebrew mind. It is indeed no
special honour for Israel to be able to call him their own. He never has
taken firm hold on the Hebrew consciousness." But how should it be no
honour for Israel, the people to whom the revelation of redemption was
made, and in whose history the plan of redemption was developed, to have
traced the poisonous stream of evil up to the fountain of its first free
beginning in the spiritual world, and to have more than superficially
understood the history of the fall of mankind by sin, which points to a
disguised superhuman power, opposed to the divine will? This perception
undoubtedly only begins gradually to dawn in the Old Testament; but in
the New Testament, the abyss of evil is fully disclosed, and Satan has
so far a hold on the consciousness of Jesus, that He regards His life's
vocation as a conflict with Satan. And the Protevangelium is deciphered
in facts, when the promised seed of the woman crushed the serpent's
head, but at the same time suffered the bruising of its own heel.

The view (e.g., Lutz in his Biblishce Dogmatik) that Satan as he is
represented in the book of Job is not the later evil spirit, is to be
rejected: he appears here only first, say Herder and Eichhorn, as
impartial executor of judgment, and overseer of morality, commissioned
by God. But he denies what God affirms, acknowledges no love towards God
in the world which is not rooted in self-love, and is determined to
destroy this love as a mere semblance. Where piety is dulled, he
rejoices in its obscurity; where it is not, he dims its lustre by
reflecting his own egotistical nature therein. Thus it is in [Zac
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md), and so here. Genuine love
loves God חנּם (adverb from חן, like gratis from gratia): it loves Him
for His own sake; it is a relation of person to person, without any
actual stipulations and claim. But Job does not thus fear God; ירא is
here praet., whereas in [Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md) and
[Job 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008.md) it is the adjective. God has
indeed hitherto screened him from all evil; שׂכתּ from שׂוּך, sepire,
and בּעד (בּעד) composed of בּ and עד, in the primary signification
circum, since עד expresses that the one joins itself to the other, and
בּ that it covers it, or covers itself with it. By the addition of
מסּביב, the idea of the triple בּעד is still strengthened. מעשׂה, lxx,
Vulg., have translated by the plural, which is not false according to
the thought; for ידים מעשׂה is, especially in Deuteronomy, a favourite
collective expression for human enterprise. פּרץ, a word, with the
Sanskrito-Sem. frangere, related to פּרק, signifying to break through
the bounds, multiply and increase one's self unboundedly ([Gen
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#030), and freq..md). The particle אוּלם,
proper only to the oldest and classic period, and very commonly used in
the first four books of the Pentateuch, and in our book, generally
ואוּלם, is an emphatic "nevertheless;" Lat. (suited to this passage at
least) verum enim vero. אם־לא is either, as frequently, a shortened
formula of asseveration: May such and such happen to me if he do not,
etc., = forsooth he will (lxx ἦ μήν); or it is half a question: Attempt
only this and this, whether he will not deny thee, = annon, as [Job
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002.md); [Job
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#020.md). The first perhaps suits the
character of Satan better: he affirms that God is mistaken. בּרך
signifies here also, valedicere: he will say farewell to thee, and
indeed על־פּניך (as [Isa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#003).md),
meeting thee arrogantly and shamelessly: it signifies, properly, upon
thy countenance, i.e., say it to thee, to the very face, that he will
have nothing more to do with thee (comp. on [Job
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#005).md). In order now that the truth of
His testimony to Job's piety, and this piety itself, may be tried,
Jehovah surrenders all Job's possessions, all that is his, except
himself, to Satan.

[Job 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 1:12</span></span>

12 Then Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand;
only upon himself put not forth thy hand. And Satan went forth from the
presence of Jehovah.

Notice well: The divine permission appears at the same time as a divine
command, for in general there is not a permission by which God remains
purely passive; wherefore God is even called in Scripture creator mali
(the evil act as such only excepted), [Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md). Further, the divine arrangement
has not its foundation in the sin which still clings to Job. For in the
praise conferred upon Job, it is not said that he is absolutely without
sin: universal liability to sin is assumed not only of all the
unrighteousness, but even of all the righteousness, of Adam's race.
Thirdly, the permission proceeds, on the contrary, from God's purpose to
maintain, in opposition to Satan, the righteousness which, in spite of
the universal liability to sin, is peculiar to Job; and if we place this
single instance in historical connection with the development of the
plan of redemption, it is a part of the conflict of the woman's seed
with the serpent, and of the gradual degradation of Satan to the lake of
fire. After Jehovah's permission, Satan retires forthwith. The license
is welcome to him, for he delights in the work of destruction. And he
hopes to conquer. For after he has experienced the unlimited power of
evil over himself, he has lost all faith in the power of good, and is
indeed become himself the self-deceived father of lies.

[Job 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 1:13</span></span>

13-15 And it came to pass one day, when his sons and his daughters were
eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother, that a
messenger came to Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses
feeding beside them, when the Sabeans fell upon them, and carried them
away, and smote the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am
escaped alone to tell thee.

The principal clause, היּום ויהי, in which the art. of היּום has no more
reference to anything preceding than in [Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md), is immediately followed by an
adverbial clause, which may be expressed by participles, Lat. filiis
ejus filiabusque convivantibus. The details which follow are important.
Job had celebrated the usual weekly worship early in the morning with
his children, and knew that they were met together in the house of his
eldest son, with whom the order of mutual entertainment came round
again, when the messengers of misfortune began to break in upon him: it
is therefore on the very day when, by reason of the sacrifice offered,
he was quite sure of Jehovah's favour. The participial construction, the
oxen were ploughing (vid., Ges. 134, 2, c), describes the condition
which was disturbed by the calamity that befell them. The verb היוּ
stands here because the clause is a principal one, not as [Job
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#013.md), adverbial. על־ידי, properly "at
hand," losing its radical meaning, signifies (as [Jdg
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#026).md) "close by." The interpretation
"in their places," after [Num 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017.md), is
untenable, as this signification of יד is only supported in the sing.
שׁבא is construed as fem., since the name of the country is used as the
name of the people. In Genesis three races of this name are mentioned:
Cushite ([Gen 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007).md), Joktanish ([Gen
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#028).md), and Abrahamic ([Gen
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003).md). Here the nomadic portion of
this mixed race in North Arabia from the Persian Gulf to Idumaea is
intended. Luther, for the sake of clearness, translates here, and [Kg1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md), Arabia. In ואמּלטה, the waw, as
is seen from the Kametz, is waw convertens, and the paragogic ah, which
otherwise indicates the cohortative, is either without significance, or
simply adds intensity to the verbal idea: I have saved myself with great
difficulty. For this common form of the 1 fut. consec., occurring four
times in the Pentateuch, vid., Ges. 49, 2. The clause לך להגּיד is
objective: in order that - so it was intended by the calamity - I might
tell thee.

[Job 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 1:16</span></span>

The Second Messenger:

16 While he was yet speaking, another came, and said, The fire of God
fell from heaven, and set fire to the sheep and servants, and consumed
them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

The fire of God, which descends, is not a suitable expression for Samm
(Schlottm.), that wind of the desert which often so suddenly destroys
man and beast, although indeed it is indicated by certain atmospheric
phenomena, appearing first of a yellow colour, which changes to a leaden
hue and spreads through the atmosphere, so that the sun when at the
brightest becomes a dark red. The writer, also, can scarcely have
intended lightning (Rosenm., Hirz., Hahn), but rain of fire or
brimstone, as with Sodom and Gomorrha, and as [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038.md); [Kg2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#012.md).

[Job 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 1:17</span></span>

The Third Messenger:

17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
Chaldeans ranged themselves in three bands, and rushed upon the camels,
and carried them away, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword;
and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

Without any authority, Ewald sees in this mention of the Chaldeans an
indication of the composition of the book in the seventh century b.c.,
when the Chaldeans under Nabopolassar began to inherit the Assyrian
power. Following Ewald, Renan observes that the Chaldeans first appear
as such marauders about the time of Uzziah. But in Genesis we find
mention of early Semitic Chaldeans among the mountain ranges lying to
the north of Assyria and Mesopotamia; and later, Nahor Chaldeans of
Mesopotamia, whose existence is traced back to the patriarchal times
(vid., Genesis, p. 422),

(Note: This reference is to Delitzsch's Commentar ber die Genesis, 1860,
a separate work from the Keil and Delitzsch series. - Tr.)

and who were powerful enough at any time to make a raid into Idumaea. To
make an attack divided into several ראשׁים, heads, multitudes, bands
(two - Gen. [Job 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#015.md); three - [Jdg
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016.md), [Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011.md); or four - Judg. [Job
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034).md), is an ancient military
stratagem; and פּשׁט, e.g., [Jdg 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#033.md),
is the proper word for attacks of such bands, either for plunder or
revenge. In לפי־חרב, at the edge of the sword, l'epe, ל is like the
usual acc. of manner.

[Job 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 1:18</span></span>

The Fourth Messenger:

18 While he was yet speaking, another also came, and said, Thy sons and
thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's
house: and, behold, a great wind came across from the desert, and smote
the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and
they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

Instead of עוד, we have עד here: the former denotes continuity in time,
the latter continuity in space, and they may be interchanged. עד in the
signif. "while" is here construed with the participle, as [Neh
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#003.md); comp. other constructions, [Job
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021.md); [Sa1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019.md); [Jon
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002.md). "From the other side of the
desert" is equivalent to, from its farthest end. הנּערים are the
youthful sons and daughters of Job, according to the epicene use of נער
in the Pentateuch (youths and maidens). In one day Job is now bereft of
everything which he accounted the gift of Jehovah, - his herds, and with
these his servants, which he not only prizes as property, but for whom
he has also a tender heart (Job 31); last of all, even his dearest ones,
his children. Satan has summoned the elements and men for the
destruction of Job's possessions by repeated strokes. That men and
nations can be excited by Satan to hostile enterprises, is nothing
surprising (cf. [Rev 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#008).md); but here,
even the fire of God and the hurricane are attributed to him. Is this
poetry or truth? Luther, in the Larger Catechism, question 4, says the
same: "The devil causes strife, murder, rebellion, and war, also thunder
and lightning, and hail, to destroy corn and cattle, to poison the
atmosphere," etc., - a passage of our creed often ridiculed by
rationalism; but it is correct if understood in accordance with
Scripture, and not superstitiously. As among men, so in nature, since
the Fall two different powers of divine anger and divine love are in
operation: the mingling of these is the essence of the present Kosmos.
Everything destructive to nature, and everything arising therefrom which
is dangerous and fatal to the life of man, is the outward manifestation
of the power of anger. In this power Satan has fortified himself; and
this, which underlies the whole course of nature, he is able to make use
of, so far as God may permit it as being subservient to His chief design
(comp. [Rev 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#013.md) with [Th2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009).md). He has no creative power. Fire
and storm, by means of which he works, are of God; but he is allowed to
excite these forces to hostility against man, just as he himself is
become an instrument of evil. It is similar with human demonocracy,
whose very being consists in placing itself en rapport with the hidden
powers of nature. Satan is the great juggler, and has already manifested
himself as such, even in paradise and in the temptation of Jesus Christ.
There is in nature, as among men, an entanglement of contrary forces
which he knows how to unloose, because it is the sphere of his special
dominion; for the whole course of nature, in the change of its
phenomena, is subject not only to abstract laws, but also to concrete
supernatural powers, both bad and good.

[Job 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 1:20</span></span>

The Conduct of Job:

20, 21 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, and said, Naked came I out of
my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and
Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.

The first three messengers Job has heard, sitting, and in silence; but
at the news of the death of his children, brought by the fourth, he can
no longer overcome his grief. The intensity of his feeling is indicated
by rising up (cf. [Jon 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006).md); his torn
heart, by the rending of his mantle; the conscious loss of his dearest
ones, by cutting off the hair of his head. He does not, however, act
like one in despair, but, humbling himself under the mighty hand of God,
falls to the ground and prostrates himself, i.e., worshipping God, so
that his face touches the earth. השׁתּחוה, se prosternere, this is the
gesture of adoration, προσκήνησις.

(Note: Vid., Hlemann's Abh. ber die biblische Gestaltung der Anbetung,
in his Bibelstudien, Abth. 1 (1859).)

יצתי is defectively written, as [Num
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#011.md); cf. infra, [Job
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#018.md). The occurrence of שׁמּה here is
remarkable, and may have given rise to the question of Nicodemus, [Joh
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#004.md) : μὴ δύναται ἄνθρωπος εἰς τῆν
κοιλίαν τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ δεύτερον εἰσελθεῖν. The writer of Ecclesiastes
([Ecc 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014).md) has left out this
difficult שׁמה. It means either being put back into a state of
unconsciousness and seclusion from the light and turmoil of this world,
similar to his former state in his mother's womb, which Hupfeld, in his
Commentatio in quosdam Iobeidos locos, 1853, favours; or, since the idea
of אמּי בּטן may be extended, return to the bosom of mother earth (Ew.,
Hirz., Schlottm., et al.), so that שׁמה is not so much retrospective as
rather prospective with reference to the grave (Bttch.), which we
prefer; for as the mother's bosom can be compared to the bosom of the
earth ([Psa 139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015).md), because it is of
the earth, and recalls the original forming of man from the earth, so
the bosom of the earth is compared to the mother's, Sir. 40:1: ἀφ ̓
ἡμέρας ἐξόδου ἐκ γαστρὸς μητρὸς ἕως ἡμέρας ἐπιταφῆς εἰς μητέρα πάντων.
The writer here intentionally makes Job call God יהוה. In the dialogue
portion, the name יהוה occurs only once in the mouth of Job ([Job
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009).md); most frequently the speakers
use אלוה and שׁדי. This use of the names of God corresponds to the early
use of the same in the Pentateuch, according to which שׁדי is the proper
name of God in the patriarchal days, and יהוה in the later days, to
which they were preparatory. The traditional view, that Elohim describes
God according to the attribute of justice, Jehovah according to the
attribute of mercy, is only in part correct; for even when the advent of
God to judgment is announced, He is in general named Jehovah. Rather,
אלהים (plur. of אלוהּ, fear), the Revered One, describes God as object;
יהוה or יהוה, on the other hand, as subject. אלהים describes Him in the
fulness of His glorious majesty, including also the spirits, which are
round about Him; יהוה as the Absolute One. Accordingly, Job, when he
says יהוה, thinks of God not only as the absolute cause of his fate, but
as the Being ordering his life according to His own counsel, who is ever
worthy of praise, whether in His infinite wisdom He gives or takes away.
Job was not driven from God, but praised Him in the midst of suffering,
even when, to human understanding and feeling, there was only occasion
for anguish: he destroyed the suspicion of Satan, that he only feared
God for the sake of His gifts, not for His own sake; and remained, in
the midst of a fourfold temptation, the conqueror.

(Note: In Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield (vid., Jul. Hamberger,
Gott und seine Offenbarung, S. 71), there is much that reminds one of
the book of Job, especially the repeated misfortunes which befall the
worthy clergyman, his submission under all, and the issue which
counterbalances his misfortune. But what is copied from the book of Job
appears to be only superficial, not to come from the depth of the
spiritual life.)

Throughout the whole book he does not go so far as to deny God (אלהים
בּרך), and thus far he does not fall into any unworthy utterances
concerning His rule.

[Job 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 1:22</span></span>

22 In all this Job sinned not, nor attributed folly to God.

In all this, i.e., as the lxx correctly renders it: which thus far had
befallen him; Ewald et al. translate incorrectly: he gave God no
provocation. תּפלה signifies, according to [Job
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012.md), comp. [Job
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#006.md), saltlessness and tastelessness,
dealing devoid of meaning and purpose, and is to be translated either,
he uttered not, non edidit, anything absurd against God, as Jerome
translates, neque stultum quid contra Deum locutus est; or, he did not
attribute folly to God: so that נתן ל are connected, as [Psa
68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035.md); [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016.md). Since נתן by itself nowhere
signifies to express, we side with Hirzel and Schlottm. against Rdiger
(in his Thes.) and Oehler, in favour of the latter. The writer hints
that, later on, Job committed himself by some unwise thoughts of the
government of God.
