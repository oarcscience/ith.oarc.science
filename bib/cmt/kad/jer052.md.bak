[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 52:0</span></span>

Historical Account of the Capture and Destruction of Jerusalem, the Fate
of Zedekiah and the People, and the Liberation of Jehoiachin from
Imprisonment

By the closing formula, [Jer 51:64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#064.md),
the contents of Jer 52 are separated from, and marked as an appendix to,
the prophecies of Jeremiah; yet nothing is said regarding the author of
this chapter. However, if we keep in mind the nature of its contents,
then, from the very fact that it gives an account of the liberation of
King Jehoiachin from prison, and of his elevation to royal honours, it
necessarily follows that it cannot have been composed by Jeremiah,
because the prophet can scarcely have lived till this occurred, which
was less than 561 b.c. It must further be considered that the contents
of this chapter also agree, almost word for word, with [Kg2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md) -25, 30; moreover, the
introductory notice regarding Zedekiah's ascension of the throne, his
age, and the character of his rule, given [Jer
52:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001.md), was unnecessary for the object
of this appendix. The same holds true of the notice regarding the
liberation of Jehoiachin from prison, at the close, [Jer
52:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031.md), which does not seem to stand
in any close and intimate connection with the history of the destruction
of Jerusalem and the fate of Zedekiah, while both of these events are
closely connected with the plan and aim of the Books of Kings, and are
written quite in their spirit. On these grounds, most expositors, both
ancient and modern, assume that this historical appendix to the
prophecies of Jeremiah has been derived from the Second Book of Kings.
But weighty reasons oppose this assumption. (1.) The very fact that the
name of the king of Babylon is throughout written Nebuchadrezzar makes
it unlikely that the narrative was derived from [Kg2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md)., because the name is there
constantly written Nebuchadnezzar, - a form which also occurs in
Jeremiah, though not often (see pp. 245f., note). (2.) This chapter
contains notices which are not found in 2 Kings 24 and 25. Thus, it is
stated, in [Jer 52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010.md), the
Nebuchadnezzar also caused all the princes of Judah to be executed at
Riblah, and King Zedekiah, who had been carried to Babylon, to be put in
prison till his death; in [Jer
52:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#019.md) we find a whole series of
special remarks as to the vessels of the temple and the ornaments of the
brazen pillars, - observations which are not met with either in 2 Kings,
or in the description of the building of the temple, 1 Kings 7. We
further find, in [Jer 52:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028.md), a
notice regarding three deportations of the people, giving the numbers,
not roundly, but precisely, as they are nowhere else given in the
historical books of the Old Testament, Were this statement the only
additional detail given by this chapter, as compared with 2 Kings, one
might perhaps suppose that it was an interpolation from another source,
added to the rest of the account that has been derived from 2 Kings 24
and 25; but this opinion, which even in itself is not very probable, is
excluded by the other additions found in [Jer
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010.md) and in 19-23. If the author of
this chapter had been able to derive, and had actually derived, these
additional particulars from a historical source, treating of the later
times of the kingdom of Judah, which has not come down to us, and which
contained more than our canonical books of Kings and Chronicles, he
would no doubt have also found there the account of the three
deportations, and taken it from that source. We must therefore assume
that this chapter, and [Kg2 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md) on
to [Kg2 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#030.md), have both a common
origin, in which the fall of the kingdom of Judah was more fully
described than in the historical books of the canon; in this way, the
remarkable coincidence, almost word for word, between the narrative
portions which are common to the two extracts, is accounted for quite as
easily as the differences that have just been mentioned. From a critical
examination of the state of both texts now before us, no certain
conclusions can be drawn regarding their mutual relation. The
differences of this kind arise partly from errors and omissions by later
copyists, partly also from the circumstance that the epitomizers have
not throughout kept rigorously to the words of their source. Regarding
the author of the original written document, we cannot even make any
supposition that could pretend to anything like probability. Baruch, as
the editor of the collection of Jeremiah's prophecies, may have made the
extract from it which we find in this chapter. We have already, in
substance, given the exposition while treating of [Kg2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md)., so that we may here content
ourselves with briefly putting together the deviations of this text from
the other, and explaining its peculiarities.

[Jeremiah 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 52:1</span></span>

Fate of King Zedekiah at the taking of Jerusalem; cf. [Kg2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md); [Kg2
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#007.md), and [Jer
39:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md). The statements regarding
Zedekiah's ascension and his government, [Jer
52:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001.md), agree word for word with [Kg2
24:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md), even to the variation
השׁליכו, [Jer 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#003.md), for השׁליכו
(Kings). The length of the siege of Jerusalem, [Jer
52:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004.md), and the flight, capture, and
condemnation of King Zedekiah and the princes of Judah, [Jer
52:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007.md), not only agrees with [Kg2
25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md), but also with [Jer
39:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md), where it is merely the
forcible entrance into the city by the Chaldeans that receives special
detail; see on [Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md). The
variation ויּחנוּ, [Jer 52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004.md), instead
of ויּחן ([Kg2 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001).md), does not affect
the sense. As to the account given of the flight, capture, and
condemnation of the king, both Jer 39 and 2 Kings omit the notices given
in [Jer 52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010.md), "and also all the
princes of Judah he caused to be slain (i.e., executed) at Riblah," and
in [Jer 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011.md), "and he put him in the
prison-house till the day of his death." בּית־הפּקדּות has been rendered
οἰκία μυλῶνος by the lxx; on this fact Hitzig bases the opinion that the
Hebrew words signify "the house of punishment," or "the house of
correction," in which Zedekiah was obliged to turn the mill like other
culprits, and as Samson was once obliged to do ([Jdg
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021).md). But this meaning of the words
cannot be substantiated. פּקדּה means "oversight, mustering, or
visitation (Heimsuchung), or vengeance," e.g., [Isa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003), but not punishment (Strafe.md), and
the plural, "watches" ([Eze 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001).md) and
"custody," Ezek. 54:11; hence the expression used here signifies "the
house of custody," or "the house of the watches." The translation of the
lxx can decide nothing against this, because their interpretation is
based upon traditions which are themselves unfounded. Regarding this,
Ewald well remarks (History of the People of Israel, iii. p. 748 of 2nd
ed.): "That Zedekiah must have laboured at the mill, as is mentioned in
later chronicles (see Aug. Mai, Scriptorum veterum nova collectio, t. i.
P. 2, p. 6; cf. Chr. Sam. Ch. xlv.), is probably a mere inference from
[Lam 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#013.md)."

[Jeremiah 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 52:12</span></span>

The destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple, and the carrying away of
the people, which are only very summarily stated in [Jer
39:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#008.md), are here related in complete
accordance with the account given in [Kg2
25:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md). The deviations for the most
part originated through the freedom exercised by the epitomizer in his
work, or only when mistakes were made by later copyists. The text before
us has some amplifications (especially the notices regarding the
ornaments of the brazen pillars, [Jer
52:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#023).md) which are found nowhere else in
the Old Testament. The difference in date between [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012) ("on the tenth of the month".md)
and the passage in Kings ("on the seventh of the month") has arisen
through one number having been mistaken for another in copying; it
cannot now be decided which is correct; see on [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md). As to Nebuzaradan, see on [Jer
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013.md). Instead of עמד , is found עבד
in [Kg2 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md), which certainly is a
simpler reading, but one having less appearance of being the original.
The only strange point is the want of the relative אשׁר in plain prose
before עמד, which is probably to be pointed עמד. בּירוּשׁלים, instead of
ירוּשׁלים (Kings), is a pregnant expression for "he came into
Jerusalem." - [Jer 52:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#014.md). From the
expression את־כּל־חומות, as given in [Jer
52:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#014.md), "all" is omitted in Kings, as
being not indispensable for the meaning.

[Jeremiah 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 52:15</span></span>

The first words, "And of the poor of the people," are wanting in Kings,
and have been brought here, through an error on the part of the copyist,
from the beginning of the next verse; for "the poor of the people" are
first treated of in [Jer 52:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#016.md), where
it is stated that Nebuzaradan left them in the land, while [Jer
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#015.md) treats of those who were carried
away to Babylon. The word האמון, instead of ההמון (Kings), seems to have
originated simply through the exchange of א for ה, and to mean, like the
other, the multitude of people. Hitzig and Graf are of opinion that אמון
here, as in [Pro 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030.md), means
workmaster or artificer, and that האמון denotes the same persons
(collectively) who are designated החרשׁ והמּסגּר in [Pro
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#001.md); [Pro
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#002.md), and [Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md). But this view is opposed by the
parallel passage, [Jer 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009.md), where the
whole of this verse occurs, and יתר העם הנּשׁארים stands instead of יתר
האמון. "The rest of the people of Jerusalem" are divided, by ואת־ואת,
into those who went over to the Chaldeans, and the rest of the people
who were taken prisoners by the Chaldeans at the capture of the city.
The statement that both of these two classes of the population of
Jerusalem were carried away to Babylon is so far limited by the further
declaration, in [Jer 52:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#016.md), that
Nebuzaradan did not carry away every one, without exception, but let a
portion of the humbler inhabitants of the country, who had no property,
remain in the land, as vinedressers and husbandmen, that they might till
the land. Instead of מדּלּות הארץ there occurs in Kings מדּלּת, and in
[Jer 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010.md), more distinctly, מן העם
הדּלּים, "some of the people, the humbler ones," who had no property of
their own. דּלּה, pl. דּלּות, is an abstract noun, "poverty;" the
singular is used collectively, hence the plural is here used to supply
the deficiency. For יגבים, from יגב, to plough, there is found instead,
in [Kg2 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012.md), Kethib גּבים, from
גּוּב, with the same meaning.

[Jeremiah 52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 52:17</span></span>

The carrying away of the vessels of the temple is more fully stated than
in [Kg2 25:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013.md). The large brazen
articles, the two pillars at the porch (cf. [Kg1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#015)..md), the bases ([Kg1
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027)..md), and the brazen sea ([Kg1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023)..md), which were too vast in their
proportions to be easily carried away to Babylon, were broken to pieces
by the Chaldeans, who carried off the brass of which they were made.
אשׁר לבּית is more correct than אשׁר (Kings), and "all their brass" is
more precise than simply "their brass" (Kings). In the enumeration of
the smaller brazen vessels used for the temple service, [Jer
52:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#018.md), there is omitted, in 2 Kings,
ואת־המּזרקות, "and the bowls" (used in sacrifice); this omission is
perhaps due merely to an error in transcription. The enumeration of the
gold and silver vessels in [Jer 52:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#019.md)
has been much more abbreviated in [Kg2
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#015.md), where only "the fire-pans and
the bowls" are mentioned, while in the text here, besides these there
are named "the basons," then "the pots (Eng. vers. caldrons), and the
candlesticks, and the pans (Eng. vers. spoons), and the cups." For
particulars regarding these different vessels, see on [Kg1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040.md), [Kg1
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045.md), [Kg1
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050.md). In [Jer
52:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#020.md), reference is made to the fact
that the mass of metal in the vessels that were carried away was without
weight. The same is stated in [Kg2
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#016.md), where, however, there is no
mention of the twelve brazen bulls; while in the text of Jeremiah, אשׁר
תּחת המּכנות is faulty, and we must read instead, אשׁר תּחתּיו והמּכנות.
The assertion of Graf, in his commentary on this verse, and of Thenius
on [Kg2 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#016.md), - that the notice
regarding the twelve brazen bulls is incorrect, because these were then
no longer in Jerusalem (27:19), but had previously been removed by Ahaz
from under the brazen sea for Tiglath-pileser, - we have already, under
[Kg2 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md), shown to be erroneous. The
apposition of כּל־הכּלים to לנחשׁתּם explains the reference of the
suffix. In [Jer 52:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#021.md), the
narrator, in order to call attention to the amount of art exhibited on
the vessels destroyed by the Chaldeans, gives a brief description of the
brazen pillars with their capitals. This description is much shortened
in [Kg2 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#017.md), and contains notices
completing that which is given of these works of art in 1 Kings 7. For
details, see the passage referred to.

[Jeremiah 52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 52:24</span></span>

The account given regarding the arrest of the chief officers of the
temple and of the city, and concerning their transportation to Riblah,
where Nebuchadnezzar caused them to be executed, agrees with [Kg2
25:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md), except in some unimportant
variations, which, however, do not alter the sense; the explanation has
been already given in the commentary on that passage. In 2 Kings, the
account of the appointment of Gedaliah as the governor of Judah,
together with that of his assassination by Ishmael, which follows the
narrative just referred to, is here omitted, because the matter has bee
already more fully stated in the passage [Jer
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007.md) on to [Jer
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007.md), and had no close connection with
the object of the present chapter. Instead of this, there follows here,
in [Jer 52:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028.md) (as a continuation of
the remark made, [Jer 52:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#027.md), "Thus was
Judah carried away captive out of his own land"), a calculation of the
number of the Jews taken to Babylon at the three deportations: in the
seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, 3023 Jews; in the eighteenth year, 832
souls from Jerusalem; and in the twenty-third year, 745 souls, - in all,
4600 persons. The correctness of these data is vouched for by the
exactness of the separate numbers, and the agreement of the sum with the
individual items. In other respects, however, they present various
difficulties. There is, first, the chronological discrepancy that the
second deportation is here placed in the eighteenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar, in contradiction with [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md), according to which, the
deportation after the taking of Jerusalem occurred in the nineteenth
year of Nebuchadnezzar; and 832 souls could not well be carried out of
Jerusalem during the siege. This difference can be settled only by
assuming that this list of deportations was derived from another source
than the preceding notice regarding the destruction of Jerusalem, in
which the years of Nebuchadnezzar's reign were reckoned in some other
way than elsewhere in Jeremiah and in the books of Kings, probably from
the date of the actual commencement of his reign, which followed a year
after he first appeared in Judah, from which his reign is dated
elsewhere; see Comm. on Daniel at [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md). According to this mode of
computation, the seventh year would correspond to the eighth of the
common reckoning, and be the year in which Jehoiachin was carried away
to Babylon, together with a large number of the people. But this does
not agree with 3023, which is given as the number of those who were
carried away; for, at that time, according to [Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md), [Kg2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016.md), as many as 10,000 Jews, or,
according to another view of these verses, even 18,000, were carried
away to Babylon. This difference does not permit of being explained in
any way. Ewald (History of the People of Israel, iii. p. 738)
accordingly assumes that in [Jer
52:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028.md), after שׁבע, the word עשׂרה has
been omitted, as in [Ch2 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009.md), where
the age of Jehoiachin is given; hence he thinks that, instead of "in the
seventh," we must read "in the seventeenth year of Nebuchadnezzar." On
such a view, the reference would be to a deportation which took place
under Zedekiah, a year before the capture, or during the time of the
siege of Jerusalem, and that, too, out of the country districts of Judah
in contrast with Jerusalem, [Jer
52:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#029.md). This supposition is favoured
not merely by the small number of those who are said to have been
carried away, but also by the context of the narrative, inasmuch as, in
what precedes, it is only the capture of Jerusalem and the deportation
of the people in Zedekiah's time that is treated of. Ngelsbach has
objected to this supposition, that it was not likely the great mass of
the people would be carried away during the war, at a time when the
approach of the Egyptian army (cf. [Jer
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005).md) was an object of dread. But the
objection does not weaken the supposition, since the former rests on two
presuppositions that are quite erroneous: viz., first, that the
deportation took place before the defeat of the auxiliary army from
Egypt, where as it may have followed that event; and secondly, that the
Chaldeans, by keeping the hostile Jews in the country, might have been
able to get some assistance against the Egyptian army, whereas, by
removing the hostile population of Judah, they would but diminish the
number of the enemies with which they had to contend. We therefore
regard this conjecture as highly probable, because it is the means of
settling all difficulties, and because we can thereby account for the
small number of those who were carried away in the deportations during
and after the destruction of Jerusalem.

Regarding the third deportation, which was effected by Nebuzaradan ([Jer
52:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#030).md) in the twenty-third, or,
according to another reckoning, in the twenty-fourth year of
Nebuchadnezzar, i.e., in the fifth year after the destruction of
Jerusalem, we have no other information; for the statement of Josephus,
Antt. x. 9. 7, that Nebuchadnezzar made war upon the Ammonites and
Moabites in that year, has not been placed beyond a doubt, and is
probably a mere inference from this verse, taken in connection with the
prophecies in Jer 48 and 49. Yet there is nothing improbable in the
statement, viewed by itself. For it must be borne in mind that, after
the appointment of Gedaliah as governor, and the departure of the
Chaldean hosts, many Jews, who had fled during the war, returned into
the country. Hence, in spite of the fact that, after the murder of
Gedaliah, a multitude of Jews, fearing the vengeance of the Chaldeans,
fled to Egypt, many may have still remained in the country; and many
other fugitives may not have returned till afterwards, and given
occasion to the Chaldeans for removing other 745 disturbers of the peace
to Babylon, four or five years after Jerusalem had been laid in ashes.
This deportation may have taken place on the occasion of the subjugation
of the Moabites, Ammonites, and Idumeans, or during the war with the
Phoenicians, possibly because they had rendered assistance to these
nations against the Chaldeans. These verses thus contain nothing to
justify the assumption of M. von Niebuhr (Gesch. Assyr. und Babels, S.
58, note) and Ngelsbach, that they are a gloss. The paucity of those who
were carried away is not to be attributed to a desire on the part of the
writer of this inserted portion to represent the calamity as not so very
terrible after all; nor is it due to the substitution of the number of
the Levites for that of the entire people, - two wholly arbitrary
assumptions: it is completely explained by a consideration of the
historical circumstances. The best of the population of Judah had
already been carried away, and Zedekiah and his counsellors must have
said to themselves, when they rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, that the
latter would not spare this time; thus they must have defended
themselves to the utmost, as is shown by the very fact that the siege of
Jerusalem lasted eighteen months. In this manner, war, pestilence, and
famine carried off a great number of the population of Jerusalem; so
that, of men who were able-bodied and fit for war, and who could be
carried into exile, not more than 4600 fell into the hands of the
Chaldeans. During the war, also, many had concealed themselves in
inaccessible places, while the lowest of the people were left behind in
the country to cultivate the fields. Still more strange might appear the
circumstance that the sum-total of those who were carried away to
Babylon, viz., 10,000 with Jehoiachin, and 4600 under Zedekiah, - 14,
600 in all, - is evidently disproportionate to the number of those who
returned to Jerusalem and Judah under Zerubbabel, which number is given
in [Ezr 2:64](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#064.md) at 42, 360, exclusive of
men and maid servants. For this reason, Graf is of opinion that still
later deportations may have taken place, of which no mention is made
anywhere. This assumption, however, has little probability. On the other
hand, we must consider these points: (1.) In the accounts given of those
who were carried away, only full-grown and independent persons of the
male sex are reckoned, while, along with fathers, both their wives and
their children went into exile. (2.) Even so early as the first capture
of Jerusalem in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, a number of prisoners of
war, perhaps not inconsiderable, came to Babylon; these might unite with
the thousands of their brethren who were carried thither at a later
period. (3.) When the exiles had settled down in Babylon, and there
found not only a means of livelihood, but even in many instances, as is
clear from several intimations, attained to opulence as citizens, many,
even of those who had been left in the country, may have gone to
Babylon, in the hope of finding there greater prosperity than in Judah,
now laid waste and depopulated by war. (4.) From the time when the
10,000 were carried away with Jehoiachin, in the year 599 b.c., till the
return under Zerubbabel, 536 b.c., 63 years, i.e., nearly two
generations, had passed, during which the exiles might largely increase
in numbers. If we take all these elements into consideration, then, in
the simple fact that the number of those who returned amounts to nearly
three times the numbers of those given as having been carried away under
Jehoiachin and Zedekiah, we cannot find such a difficulty as entitles us
to doubt the correctness of the numbers handed down to us.

The closing portion of this chapter, viz., the notice regarding the
liberation of Jehoiachin from imprisonment, ad his elevation to royal
honours by Evil-merodach after Nebuchadnezzar's death, substantially
agrees with the account given of that even in [Kg2
25:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md). The difference of date, "on
the twenty-fifth of the month" ([Jer
52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031).md), and "on the twenty-seventh of
the month" in 2 Kings, has arisen through the entrance of a clerical
error into one text or the other. The few remaining variations of the
two texts have no influence on the meaning. As to the fact itself, and
its importance for the people languishing in exile, we may refer to the
explanation given at [Kg2 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md).
