### [Ezekiel Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 18:1</span></span>

In the word of God contained in this chapter, the delusion that God
visits the sins of fathers upon innocent children is overthrown, and the
truth is clearly set forth that every man bears the guilt and punishment
of his own sins ([Eze 18:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001).md). The
righteous lives through his righteousness ([Eze
18:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#005).md), but cannot save his wicked
son thereby ([Eze 18:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010).md); whilst
the son who avoids the sins and wickedness of his father, will live
through his own righteousness ([Eze
18:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014).md). The man who repents and
avoids sin is not even charged with his own sin; and, on the other hand,
the man who forsakes the way of righteousness, and gives himself up to
unrighteousness, will not be protected from death even by his own former
righteousness ([Eze 18:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021).md). Thus
will God judge every man according to his way; and it is only by
repentance that Israel itself can live ([Eze
18:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030).md). The exposition of these
truths is closely connected with the substance and design of the
preceding and following prophecies. In the earlier words of God, Ezekiel
had taken from rebellious Israel every support of false confidence in
the preservation of the kingdom from destruction. But as an impenitent
sinner, even when he can no longer evade the punishment of his sins,
endeavours as much as possible to transfer the guilt from himself to
others, and comforts himself with the thought that he has to suffer for
sins that other shave committed, and hardens himself against the
chastisement of God through such false consolation as this; so even
among the people of Israel, when the divine judgments burst upon them,
the delusion arose that the existing generation had to suffer for the
fathers' sins. If, then, the judgment were ever to bear the fruit of
Israel's conversion and renovation, which God designed, the impenitent
generation must be deprived even of this pretext for covering over its
sins and quieting its conscience, by the demonstration of the justice
which characterized the government of God in His kingdom.

The proverb and the word of God. - [Eze
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md). And the word of Jehovah came to
me, saying, [Eze 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md). Why do you use
this proverb in the land of Israel, saying, Fathers eat sour grapes, and
the sons' teeth are set on edge. [Eze
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#003.md). As I live, is the saying of the
Lord Jehovah, this proverb shall not be used any more in Israel. [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md). Behold, all souls are mine; as
the father's soul, so also the soul of the son, - they are mine; the
soul which sinneth, it shall die. - On [Eze
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md) compare [Eze
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022.md). מה־לּכם, what is to you, what
are you thinking of, that...? is a question of amazement. על־אדמת , in
the land of Israel ([Eze 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022).md), not
"concerning the land of Israel," as Hvernick assumes. The proverb was
not, "The fathers have eaten sour grapes," for we have not אכלוּ, as in
[Jer 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029.md), but יאכלוּ, they eat, are
accustomed to eat, and אבות has no article, because it applies to all
who eat sour grapes. Bōsĕr, unripe, sour grapes, like bēsĕr in Job 16:33
(see the comm. in loc.). The meaning of the proverb is self-evident. The
sour grapes which the fathers eat are the sins which they commit; the
setting of the children's teeth on edge is the consequence thereof,
i.e., the suffering which the children have to endure. The same proverb
is quoted in [Jer 31:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029.md), and there
also it is condemned as an error. The origin of such a proverb is easily
to be accounted for from the inclination of the natural man to transfer
to others the guilt which has brought suffering upon himself, more
especially as the law teaches that the sins of the fathers are visited
upon the children ([Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).md), and the
prophets announce that the Lord would put away Judah from before His
face on account of the sins of Manasseh ([Kg2
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#003.md); [Jer
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004).md), while Jeremiah complains in
[Lam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md) that the people are bearing
the fathers' sins. Nevertheless the proverb contained a most dangerous
and fatal error, for which the teaching of the law concerning the
visitation of the sins of the fathers, etc., was not accountable, and
which Jeremiah, who expressly mentions the doctrine of the law ([Jer
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018).md), condemns as strongly as
Ezekiel. God will visit the sins of the fathers upon the children who
hate Him, and who also walk in the footsteps of their fathers' sins; but
to those who love Him, and keep His commandments, He will show mercy to
the thousandth generation. The proverb, on the other hand, teaches that
the children would have to atone for their fathers' sins without any
culpability of their own. How remote such a perversion of the truth as
to the transmission of sins and their consequences, viz., their
punishment, was from the law of Moses, is evident from the express
command in [Deu 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016.md), that the
children were not to be put to death with the fathers for the sins which
the latter had committed, but that every one was to die for his own sin.
What God here enjoins upon the judicial authorities must apply to the
infliction of his own judgments. Consequently what Ezekiel says in the
following verses in opposition to the delusion, which this proverb
helped to spread abroad, is simply a commentary upon the words, "every
one shall die for his own sin," and not a correction of the law, which
is the interpretation that many have put upon these prophetic utterances
of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. In [Eze 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#003.md),
the Lord declares with an oath that this proverb shall not be used any
more. The apodosis to 'אם יהיה וגו, which is not expressed, would be an
imprecation, so that the oath contains a solemn prohibition. God will
take care that this proverb shall not be used any more in Israel, not so
much by the fact that He will not give them any further occasion to make
use of it, as by the way in which He will convince them, through the
judgments which He sends, of the justice of His ways. The following is
Calvin's admirable paraphrase: "I will soon deprive you of this boasting
of yours; for your iniquity shall be made manifest, so that all the
world may see that you are but enduring just punishment, which you
yourselves have deserved, and that you cannot cast it upon your fathers,
as you have hitherto attempted to do." At the same time, this only gives
one side; we must also add the other, which is brought out so
prominently in [Jer 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029.md)., namely,
that after the judgment God will manifest His grace so gloriously in the
forgiveness of sins, that those who are forgiven will fully recognise
the justice of the judgments inflicted. Experience of the love and
compassion of the Lord, manifesting itself in the forgiveness of sin,
bows down the heart so deeply that the pardoned sinner has no longer any
doubt of the justice of the judgments of God. "In Israel" is added, to
show that such a proverb is opposed to the dignity of Israel. In [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md), the reason assigned fore the
declaration thus solemnly confirmed by an oath commences with a general
thought which contains the thesis for further discussion. All souls are
mine, the soul of the father as well as that of the son, saith the Lord.
In these words, as Calvin has well said, "God does not merely vindicate
His government or His authority, but shows that He is moved with
paternal affection towards the whole of the human race which He created
and formed." There is no necessity for God to punish the one for the
other, the son for the father, say because of the possibility that the
guilty person might evade Him; and as the Father of all, He cannot treat
the one in a different manner from the other, but can only punish the
one by whom punishment has been deserved. The soul that sinneth shall
die. הנּפשׁ is used here, as in many other passages, for "man," and מוּת
is equivalent to suffering death as a punishment. "Death" is used to
denote the complete destruction with which transgressors are threatened
by the law, as in [Deu 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015.md) (compare
[Jer 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008.md); [Pro
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#010).md). This sentence is explained in
the verses which follow (vv. 5-20).

[Ezekiel 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 18:5</span></span>

The Righteous Man Shall Not Die

[Eze 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#005.md). If a man is righteous, and
doeth right and righteousness, [Eze
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006.md). And doth not eat upon the
mountains, and doth not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of
Israel, and doth not defile his neighbour's wife, and doth not approach
his wife in her uncleanness, [Eze
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#007.md). Oppresseth no one, restoreth his
security (lit., debt-pledge), committeth no robbery, giveth his bread to
the hungry, and covereth the naked with clothes, [Eze
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008.md). Doth not give upon usury, and
taketh not interest, withholdeth his hand from wrong, executeth judgment
of truth between one and another, [Eze
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#009.md). Walketh in my statutes, and
keepeth my rights to execute truth; he is righteous, he shall live, is
the saying of the Lord "Jehovah." - The exposition of the assertion,
that God only punishes the sinner, not the innocent, commences with a
picture of the righteousness which has the promise of life. The
righteousness consists in the fulfilment of the commandments of the law:
viz., (1) those relating to religious duties, such as the avoidance of
idolatry, whether of the grosser kind, such as eating upon the
mountains, i.e., observing sacrificial festivals, and therefore
sacrificing to idols (cf. [Deu 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002)..md),
or of a more refined description, e.g., lifting up the eyes to idols, to
look to them, or make them the object of trust, and offer supplication
to them (cf. [Psa 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md); [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019).md), as Israel had done, and was
doing still (cf. [Eze 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013)); and (2.md)
those relating to moral obligations, such as the avoidance of adultery
(compare [Exo 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#014.md); [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md); [Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md); and for טמּא, [Gen
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#005).md), and of conjugal intercourse
with a wife during menstruation, which was a defilement of the marriage
relation (cf. [Lev 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019.md); [Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018).md). All these sins were forbidden
in the law on pain of death. To these there are appended duties to a
neighbour ([Eze 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#007)..md), viz., to
abstain from oppressing any one ([Exo
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028.md); [Lev
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#014.md), [Lev
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#017).md), to restore the pledge to a
debtor ([Exo 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md); [Deu
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006.md), [Deu
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010)..md). חוב is hardly to be taken in
any other sense than as in apposition to חבלתו, "his pledge, which is
debt," equivalent to his debt-pledge or security, like דּרכּך זמּה in
[Eze 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#027.md). The supposition of Hitzig,
that חוב is a participle, like קום in [Kg2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md), in the sense of debtor, is a far
less natural one, and has no valid support in the free rendering of the
lxx, ἐνεχυρασμὸν ὀφείλοντος. The further duties are to avoid taking
unlawful possession of the property of another (cf. Lev. 5:23); to feed
the hungry, clothe the naked (cf. [Isa
58:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005.md); [Mat
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#026.md); [Jam
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015).md); to abstain from practising
usury ([Deu 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#020.md); cf. [Exo
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#024).md) and taking interest ([Lev
25:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036).md); in judicial sentences, to
draw back the hand from wrong, and promote judgment of truth, - a
sentence in accordance with the true nature of the case (see the comm.
on [Zac 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009).md); and, lastly, to walk in
the statutes and rights of the Lord, - an expression which embraces, in
conclusion, all that is essential to the righteousness required by the
law. - This definition of the idea of true righteousness, which
preserves from death and destruction, and ensures life to the possessor,
is followed in [Eze 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010.md). by a
discussion of the attitude which God sustains towards the sons.

[Ezekiel 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 18:10</span></span>

The righteousness of the father does not protect the wicked, unrighteous
son from death. - [Eze 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010.md). If,
however, he begetteth a violent son, who sheddeth blood, and doeth only
one of these things, [Eze 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#011.md). But
he himself hath not done all this, - if he even eateth upon the
mountains, and defileth his neighbour's wife, [Eze
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#012.md). Oppresseth the suffering and
poor, committeth robbery, doth not restore a pledge, lifteth up his eyes
to idols, committeth abomination, [Eze
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013.md). Giveth upon usury, and taketh
interest: should he live? He shall not live! He hath done all these
abominations; he shall be put to death; his blood shall be upon him. -
The subject to והוליד, in [Eze 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010.md),
is the righteous man described in the preceding verses. פּריץ, violent,
literally, breaking in or through, is rendered more emphatic by the
words "shedding blood" (cf. [Hos 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002).md).
We regard אח in the next clause as simply a dialectically different form
of writing and pronouncing, for אך, "only," and he doeth only one of
these, the sins previously mentioned ([Eze
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006)..md). מאחד, with a partitive מן, as
in [Lev 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md), where it is used in a
similar connection; the form מאחד is also met with in [Deu
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#007.md). The explanation given by the
Targum, "and doeth one of these to his brother," is neither warranted by
the language nor commended by the sense. עשׂה is never construed with
the accusative of the person to whom anything is done; and the
limitation of the words to sins against a brother is unsuitable in this
connection. The next clause, לא עשׂה...והוּא, which has also been
variously rendered, we regard as an adversative circumstantial clause,
and agree with Kliefoth in referring it to the begetter (father): "and
he (the father) has not committed any of these sins." For it yields no
intelligible sense to refer this clause also to the son, since כּל־אלּה
cannot possibly refer to different things from the preceding מאלּה, and
a man cannot at the same time both do and not do the same thing. The כּי
which follows signifies "if," as is frequently the case in the
enumeration of particular precepts or cases; compare, for example, [Exo
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001.md), [Exo
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007.md),[Exo
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017.md), etc., where it is construed
with the imperfect, because the allusion is to things that may occur.
Here, on the contrary, it is followed by the perfect, because the sins
enumerated are regarded as committed. The emphatic גּם (even) forms an
antithesis to אח מאחד (אך), or rather an epanorthosis of it, inasmuch as
כּי גּם resumes and carries out still further the description of the
conduct of the wicked son, which was interrupted by the circumstantial
clause; and that not only in a different form, but with a gradation in
the thought. The thought, for instance, is as follows: the violent son
of a righteous father, even if he has committed only one of the sins
which the father has not committed, shall die. And if he has committed
even the gross sins named, viz., idolatry, adultery, violent oppression
of the poor, robbery, etc., should he then continue to live? The ו in
וחי introduces the apodosis, which contains a question, that is simply
indicated by the tone, and is immediately denied. The antique form חי
for חיּה, 3rd pers. perf., is taken from the Pentateuch (cf. [Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022.md) and [Num
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#008).md). The formulae מות יוּמת and
דּמיו בּו dna are also derived from the language of the law (cf. [Lev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009.md), [Lev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011.md), [Lev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#013), etc..md).

[Ezekiel 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 18:14</span></span>

The son who avoids his father's sin will live; but the father will die
for his own sins. - [Eze 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014.md). And
behold, he begetteth a son, who seeth all his father's sins which he
doeth; he seeth them, and doeth not such things. [Eze
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#015.md). He eateth not upon the
mountains, and lifteth not up his eyes to the idols of the house of
Israel; he defileth not his neighbour's wife, [Eze
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#016.md). And oppresseth no one; he doth
not withhold a pledge, and committeth not robbery; giveth his bread to
the hungry, and covereth the naked with clothes. [Eze
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#017.md). He holdeth back his hand from
the distressed one, taketh not usury and interest, doeth my rights,
walketh in my statutes; he will not die for the sin of his father; he
shall live. [Eze 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#018.md). His father,
because he hath practised oppression, committed robbery upon his
brother, and hath done that which is not good in the midst of his
people; behold, he shall die for his sin. [Eze
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#019.md). And do ye say, Why doth the son
not help to bear the father's sin? But the son hath done right and
righteousness, hath kept all my statutes, and done them; he shall live.
[Eze 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020.md). The soul that sinneth, it
shall die. A son shall not help to bear the father's sin, and a father
shall not help to bear the sin of the son. The righteousness of the
righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be
upon him. - The case supposed in these verses forms the antithesis to
the preceding one; the father is the transgressor in this instance, and
the son a keeper of the law. The subject to הוליד in [Eze
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014.md) is not the righteous man
described in [Eze 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#015.md), but a man who
is described immediately afterwards as a transgressor of the
commandments of God. The Chetib וירא bite in the last clause of [Eze
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014.md) is not to be read ויּרא, καὶ
φοβηθῇ, et timuerit, as it has been by the translators of the Septuagint
and Vulgate; nor is it to be altered into ויּראה, as it has been by the
Masoretes, to make it accord with [Eze
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#028.md); but it is the apocopated form
ויּרא, as in the preceding clause, and the object is to be repeated from
what precedes, as in the similar case which we find in [Exo
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#015), (18.md). Ewald and Hitzig propose
to alter מעני in [Eze 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#017.md) into מעול
after [Eze 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008.md), but without the
slightest necessity. The lxx are not to be taken as an authority for
this, since the Chaldee and Syriac have both read and rendered עני; and
Ezekiel, when repeating the same sentences, is accustomed to make
variations in particular words. Holding back the hand from the
distressed, is equivalent to abstaining from seizing upon him for the
purpose of crushing him (compare [Eze
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#012).md); בּתוך, in the midst of his
countrymen = בּתוך עמּו, is adopted from the language of the Pentateuch.
מת after הנּה is a participle. The question, "Why does the son not help
to bear?" is not a direct objection on the part of the people, but is to
be taken as a pretext, which the people might offer on the ground of the
law, that God would visit the sin of the fathers upon the sons in
justification of their proverb. Ezekiel cites this pretext for the
purpose of meeting it by stating the reason why this does not occur.
נשׂא ב, to carry, near or with, to join in carrying, or help to carry
(cf. [Num 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#017).md). This proved the
proverb to be false, and confirmed the assertion made in [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md), to which the address therefore
returns ([Eze 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020).md). The
righteousness of the righteous man will come upon him, i.e., upon the
righteous man, namely, in its consequences. The righteous man will
receive the blessing of righteousness, but the unrighteous man the curse
of his wickedness. There is no necessity for the article, which the Keri
proposes to insert before רשׁע.

[Ezekiel 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 18:21</span></span>

Turning to good leads to life; turning to evil is followed by death. -
[Eze 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md). But if the wicked man
turneth from all his sins which he hath committed, and keepeth all my
statutes, and doeth right and righteousness, he shall live, and not die.
[Eze 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#022.md). All his transgressions
which he hath committed, shall not be remembered to him: for the sake of
the righteousness which he hath done he will live. [Eze
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md). Have I then pleasure in the
death of the wicked? is the saying of Jehovah: and not rather that he
turn from his ways, and live? [Eze
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md). But if the righteous man turn
from his righteousness, and doeth wickedness, and acteth according to
all the abominations which the ungodly man hath done, should he live?
All the righteousness that he hath done shall not be remembered: for his
unfaithfulness that he hath committed, and for his sin that he hath
sinned, for these he shall die. [Eze
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025.md). And ye say, "The way of the
Lord is not right." Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not right? Is
it not your ways that are not right? [Eze
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#026.md). If a righteous man turneth from
his righteousness, and doeth wickedness, and dieth in consequence, he
dieth for his wickedness that he hath done. - The proof that every one
must bear his sin did not contain an exhaustive reply to the question,
in what relation the righteousness of God stood to the sin of men? For
the cases supposed in vv. 5-20 took for granted that there was a
constant persistence in the course once taken, and overlooked the
instances, which are by no means rare, when a man's course of life is
entirely changed. It still remained, therefore, to take notice of such
cases as these, and they are handled in [Eze
18:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md). The ungodly man, who repents
and turns, shall live; and the righteous man, who turns to the way of
sin, shall die. "As the righteous man, who was formerly a sinner, is not
crushed down by his past sins; so the sinner, who was once a righteous
man, is not supported by his early righteousness. Every one will be
judged in that state in which he is found" (Jerome). The motive for the
pardon of the repenting sinner is given in [Eze
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md), in the declaration that God has
no pleasure in the death of the wicked man, but desires his conversion,
that he may live. God is therefore not only just, but merciful and
gracious, and punishes none with death but those who either will not
desist from evil, or will not persevere in the way of His commandments.
Consequently the complaint, that the way of the Lord, i.e., His conduct
toward men, is not weighed (יתּכן, see comm. on [Sa1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003).md), i.e., not just and right, is
altogether unfounded, and recoils upon those who make it. It it not
God's ways, but the sinner's, that are wrong ([Eze
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025).md). The proof of this, which
Hitzig overlooks, is contained in the declarations made in [Eze
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md) and [Eze
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#026.md), - viz. in the fact that God
does not desire the death of the sinner, and in His mercy forgives the
penitent all his former sins, and does not lay them to his charge; and
also in the fact that He punishes the man who turns from the way of
righteousness and gives himself up to wickedness, on account of the sin
which he commits; so that He simply judges him according to his deeds. -
In [Eze 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md), ועשׂה is the
continuation of the infinitive שׁוּב, and וחי is interrogatory, as in
[Eze 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 18:27</span></span>

The vindication of the ways of God might have formed a fitting close to
this divine oracle. But as the prophet was not merely concerned with the
correction of the error contained in the proverb which was current among
the people, but still more with the rescue of the people themselves from
destruction, he follows up the refutation with another earnest call to
repentance. - [Eze 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#027.md). If a wicked
man turneth from his wickedness which he hath done, and doeth right and
righteousness, he will keep his soul alive. [Eze
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#028.md). If he seeth and turneth from
all his transgressions which he hath committed, he shall live and not
die. [Eze 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#029.md). And the house of
Israel saith, The way of the Lord is not right. Are may ways not right,
O house of Israel? Is it not rather your ways that are not right? [Eze
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030.md). Therefore, every one according
to his ways, will I judge you, O house of Israel, is the saying of the
Lord Jehovah. Turn and repent of all your transgressions, that it may
not become to you a stumbling-block to guilt. [Eze
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031.md). Cast from you all your
transgressions which ye have committed, and make yourselves a new heart
and a new spirit! And why will ye die, O house of Israel? [Eze
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#032.md). For I have no pleasure in the
death of the dying, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. Therefore repent,
that ye may live. - For the purpose of securing an entrance into their
hearts for the call to repentance, the prophet not only repeats, in [Eze
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#027.md) and [Eze
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#028.md), the truth declared in [Eze
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md) and [Eze
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#022.md), that he who turns from his sin
finds life, but refutes once more in [Eze
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#029.md), as he has already done in [Eze
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025.md), the charge that God's ways are
not right. The fact that the singular יתּכן is connected with the plural
דּרכיכם, does not warrant our altering the plural into דּרכּכם, but may
be explained in a very simple manner, by assuming that the ways of the
people are all summed up in one, and that the meaning is this: what you
say of my way applies to your own ways, - namely, "it is not right;
there is just measure therein." לכן, "therefore, etc.;" because my way,
and not yours, is right, I will judge you, every one according to his
way. Repent, therefore, if ye would escape from death and destruction.
שׁוּבוּ is rendered more emphatic by השׁיבוּ, sc. פניכם, as in [Eze
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#006.md). In the last clause of [Eze
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030.md), עון is not to be taken as the
subject of the sentence according to the accents, but is a genitive
dependent upon מכשׁול, as in [Eze 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019.md)
and [Eze 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md); and the subject is to
be found in the preceding clause: that it (the sinning) may not become
to you a stumbling-block of iniquity, i.e., a stumbling-block through
which ye fall into guilt and punishment. - The appeal in [Eze
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031.md) points back to the promise in
[Eze 11:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#018.md). השׁליך, to cast away.
The application of this word to transgressions may be explained from the
fact that they consisted for the most part of idols and idolatrous
images, which they had made. - "Make yourselves a new heart and a new
spirit:" a man cannot, indeed, create either of these by his own power;
God alone can give them ([Eze 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019).md).
But a man both can and should come to God to receive them: in other
words, he can turn to God, and let both heart and spirit be renewed by
the Spirit of God. And this God is willing to do; for He has no pleasure
בּמות המת, in the death of the dying one. In the repetition of the
assurance given in [Eze 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md), המּת is
very appropriately substituted for רשׁע, to indicate to the people that
while in sin they are lying in death, and that it is only by conversion
and renewal that they can recover life again.
