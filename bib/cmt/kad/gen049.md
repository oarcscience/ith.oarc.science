### [Genesis Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 49:1</span></span>

The Blessing. - [Gen 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md), [Gen
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#002.md). When Jacob had adopted and
blessed the two sons of Joseph, he called his twelve sons, to make known
to them his spiritual bequest. In an elevated and solemn tone he said,
"Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall
you (יקרא for יקרה, as in [Gen 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#004.md),
[Gen 42:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#038).md) at the end of the days!
Gather yourselves together and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and hearken unto
Israel your father!" The last address of Jacob-Israel to his twelve
sons, which these words introduce, is designated by the historian ([Gen
49:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#028).md) "the blessing," with which
"their father blessed them, every one according to his blessing." This
blessing is at the same time a prophecy. "Every superior and significant
life becomes prophetic at its close" (Ziegler). But this was especially
the case with the lives of the patriarchs, which were filled and
sustained by the promises and revelations of God. As Isaac in his
blessing (Gen 27) pointed out prophetically to his two sons, by virtue
of divine illumination, the future history of their families; "so Jacob,
while blessing the twelve, pictured in grand outlines the lineamenta of
the future history of the future nation" (Ziegler). The groundwork of
his prophecy was supplied partly by the natural character of his twelve
sons, and partly by the divine promise which had been given by the Lord
to him and to his fathers Abraham and Isaac, and that not merely in
these two points, the numerous increase of their seed and the possession
of Canaan, but in its entire scope, by which Israel had been appointed
to be the recipient and medium of salvation for all nations. On this
foundation the Spirit of God revealed to the dying patriarch Israel the
future history of his seed, so that he discerned in the characters of
his sons the future development of the tribes proceeding from them, and
with prophetic clearness assigned to each of them its position and
importance in the nation into which they were to expand in the promised
inheritance. Thus he predicted to the sons what would happen to them "in
the last days," lit., "at the end of the days" (ἐπ ̓ ἐσχάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν,
lxx), and not merely at some future time. אחרית, the opposite of ראשׁית,
signifies the end in contrast with the beginning ([Deu
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#012.md); [Isa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010).md); hence הימים אחרית in prophetic
language denoted, not the future generally, but the last future (see
Hengstenberg's History of Balaam, pp. 465-467, transl.), the Messianic
age of consummation ([Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Eze
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#008.md), [Eze
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#016.md); [Jer
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#024.md); [Jer
48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047.md); [Jer
49:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#039.md), etc.: so also [Num
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014.md); [Deu
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#030).md), like ἐπ ̓ ἐσχάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν
([Pe2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md), or ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις
([Act 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017.md); [Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001).md). But we must not restrict "the
end of the days" to the extreme point of the time of completion of the
Messianic kingdom; it embraces "the whole history of the completion
which underlies the present period of growth," or "the future as
bringing the work of God to its ultimate completion, though modified
according to the particular stage to which the work of God had advanced
in any particular age, the range of vision opened to that age, and the
consequent horizon of the prophet, which, though not absolutely
dependent upon it, was to a certain extent regulated by it" (Delitzsch).

For the patriarch, who, with his pilgrim-life, had been obliged in the
very evening of his days to leave the soil of the promised land and seek
a refuge for himself and his house in Egypt, the final future, with its
realization of the promises of God, commenced as soon as the promised
land was in the possession of the twelve tribes descended from his sons.
He had already before his eyes, in his twelve sons with their children
and children's children, the first beginnings of the multiplication of
his seed into a great nation. Moreover, on his departure from Canaan he
had received the promise, that the God of his fathers would make him
into a great nation, and lead him up again to Canaan ([Gen
46:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003).md). The fulfilment of this
promise his thoughts and hopes, his longings and wishes, were all
directed. This constituted the firm foundation, though by no means the
sole and exclusive purport, of his words of blessing. The fact was not,
as Baumgarten and Kurtz suppose, that Jacob regarded the time of Joshua
as that of the completion; that for him the end was nothing more than
the possession of the promised land by his seed as the promised nation,
so that all the promises pointed to this, and nothing beyond it was
either affirmed or hinted at. Not a single utterance announces the
capture of the promised land; not a single one points specially to the
time of Joshua. On the contrary, Jacob presupposes not only the increase
of his sons into powerful tribes, but also the conquest of Canaan, as
already fulfilled; foretells to his sons, whom he sees in spirit as
populous tribes, growth and prosperity on the soil in their possession;
and dilates upon their relation to one another in Canaan and to the
nations round about, even to the time of their final subjection to the
peaceful sway of Him, from whom the sceptre of Judah shall never depart.
The ultimate future of the patriarchal blessing, therefore, extends to
the ultimate fulfilment of the divine promises-that is to say, to the
completion of the kingdom of God. The enlightened seer's-eye of the
patriarch surveyed, "as though upon a canvas painted without
perspective," the entire development of Israel from its first foundation
as the nation and kingdom of God till its completion under the rule of
the Prince of Peace, whom the nations would serve in willing obedience;
and beheld the twelve tribes spreading themselves out, each in his
inheritance, successfully resisting their enemies, and finding rest and
full satisfaction in the enjoyment of the blessings of Canaan.

It is in this vision of the future condition of his sons as grown into
tribes that the prophetic character of the blessing consists; not in the
prediction of particular historical events, all of which, on the
contrary, with the exception of the prophecy of Shiloh, fall into the
background behind the purely ideal portraiture of the peculiarities of
the different tribes. The blessing gives, in short sayings full of bold
and thoroughly original pictures, only general outlines of a prophetic
character, which are to receive their definite concrete form from the
historical development of the tribes in the future; and throughout it
possesses both in form and substance a certain antique stamp, in which
its genuineness is unmistakeably apparent. Every attack upon its
genuineness has really proceeded from an a priori denial of all
supernatural prophecies, and has been sustained by such
misinterpretations as the introduction of special historical allusions,
for the purpose of stamping it as a vaticinia ex eventu, and by other
untenable assertions and assumptions; such, for example, as that people
do not make poetry at so advanced an age or in the immediate prospect of
death, or that the transmission of such an oration word for word down to
the time of Moses is utterly inconceivable-objections the emptiness of
which has been demonstrated in Hengstenberg's Christology i. p. 76
(transl.) by copious citations from the history of the early Arabic
poetry.

[Genesis 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 49:3</span></span>

Reuben, my first-born thou, my might and first-fruit of my strength;
pre-eminence in dignity and pre-eminence in power. - As the first-born,
the first sprout of the full virile power of Jacob, Reuben, according to
natural right, was entitled to the first rank among his brethren, the
leadership of the tribes, and a double share of the inheritance ([Gen
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md); [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017).md). (שׂאת: elevation, the dignity
of the chieftainship; עז, the earlier mode of pronouncing עז, the
authority of the first-born.) But Reuben had forfeited this prerogative.
"Effervescence like water - thou shalt have no preference; for thou
didst ascend thy father's marriage-bed: then hast thou desecrated; my
couch has he ascended." פּחז: lit., the boiling over of water,
figuratively, the excitement of lust; hence the verb is used in [Jdg
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004.md); [Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md), for frivolity and insolent pride.
With this predicate Jacob describes the moral character of Reuben; and
the noun is stronger than the verb פחזת of the Samaritan, and אתרעת or
ארתעת efferbuisti, aestuasti of the Sam. Vers., ἐξύβρισας of the lxx,
and ὑπερζέσας of Symm. תּותר is to be explained by יתר: have no
pre-eminence. His crime was, lying with Bilhah, his father's concubine
([Gen 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022).md). חלּלתּ is used
absolutely: desecrated hast thou, sc., what should have been sacred to
thee (cf. [Lev 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008).md). From this
wickedness the injured father turns away with indignation, and passes to
the third person as he repeats the words, "my couch he has ascended." By
the withdrawal of the rank belonging to the first-born, Reuben lost the
leadership in Israel; so that his tribe attained to no position of
influence in the nation (compare the blessing of Moses in [Deu
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006).md). The leadership was transferred
to Judah, the double portion to Joseph ([Ch1
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001).md), by which, so far as the
inheritance was concerned, the first-born of the beloved Rachel took the
place of the first-born of the slighted Leah; not, however, according to
the subjective will of the father, which is condemned in [Deu
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015.md)., but according to the leading
of God, by which Joseph had been raised above his brethren, but without
the chieftainship being accorded to him.

[Genesis 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 49:5</span></span>

"Simeon and Levi are brethren:" emphatically brethren in the full sense
of the word; not merely as having the same parents, but in their modes
of thought and action. "Weapons of wickedness are their swords." The
ἅπαξ lec. מכרת is rendered by Luther, etc., weapons or swords, from
כּוּר = כּרה, to dig, dig through, pierce: not connected with μάχαιρα.
L. de Dieu and others follow the Arabic and Aethiopic versions: "plans;"
but חמס כּלי, utensils, or instruments, of wickedness, does not accord
with this. Such wickedness had the two brothers committed upon the
inhabitants of Shechem ([Gen 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#025)..md),
that Jacob would have no fellowship with it. "Into their counsel come
not, my soul; with their assembly let not my honour unite." סוד, a
council, or deliberative consensus. תּחד, imperf. of יחד; כּבודי, like
[Psa 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md); [Psa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md), etc., of the soul as the noblest
part of man, the centre of his personality as the image of God. "For in
their wrath have they slain men, and in their wantonness houghed oxen."
The singular nouns אישׁ and שׁור, in the sense of indefinite generality,
are to be regarded as general rather than singular, especially as the
plural form of both is rarely met with; of אישׁ, only in [Psa
141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004.md); [Pro
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#004.md), and [Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md); of שׁור־שׁור, only in [Hos
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md). רצון: inclination, here in a
bad sense, wantonness. עקּר: νευροκοπεῖν, to sever the houghs (tendons
of the hind feet), - a process by which animals were not merely lamed,
but rendered useless, since the tendon once severed could never be
healed again, whilst as a rule the arteries were not cut so as to cause
the animal to bleed to death (cf. [Jos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006.md), [Jos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#009.md); [Sa2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004).md). In [Gen
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#028.md) it is merely stated that the
cattle of the Shechemites were carried off, not that they were lamed.
But the one is so far from excluding the other, that it rather includes
it in such a case as this, where the sons of Jacob were more concerned
about revenge than booty. Jacob mentions the latter only, because it was
this which most strikingly displayed their criminal wantonness. On this
reckless revenge Jacob pronounces the curse, "Cursed be their anger, for
it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I shall divide them in
Jacob, and scatter them in Israel." They had joined together to commit
this crime, and as a punishment they should be divided or scattered in
the nation of Israel, should form no independent or compact tribes. This
sentence of the patriarch was so fulfilled when Canaan was conquered,
that on the second numbering under Moses, Simeon had become the weakest
of all the tribes ([Num 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#014).md); in
Moses' blessing (Deut 33) it was entirely passed over; and it received
no separate assignment of territory as an inheritance, but merely a
number of cities within the limits of Judah ([Jos
19:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001).md). Its possessions, therefore,
became an insignificant appendage to those of Judah, into which they
were eventually absorbed, as most of the families of Simeon increased
but little ([Ch1 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#027).md); and those
which increased the most emigrated in two detachments, and sought out
settlements for themselves and pasture for their cattle outside the
limits of the promised land ([Ch1
4:38-43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#038).md). Levi also received no
separate inheritance in the land, but merely a number of cities to dwell
in, scattered throughout the possessions of his brethren (Josh 21:1-40).
But the scattering of Levi in Israel was changed into a blessing for the
other tribes through its election to the priesthood. Of this
transformation of the curse into a blessing, there is not the slightest
intimation in Jacob's address; and in this we have a strong proof of its
genuineness. After this honourable change had taken place under Moses,
it would never have occurred to any one to cast such a reproach upon the
forefather of the Levites. How different is the blessing pronounced by
Moses upon Levi ([Deu 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008)..md)! But
though Jacob withdrew the rights of primogeniture from Reuben, and
pronounced a curse upon the crime of Simeon and Levi, he deprived none
of them of their share in the promised inheritance. They were merely put
into the background because of their sins, but they were not excluded
from the fellowship and call of Israel, and did not lose the blessing of
Abraham, so that their father's utterances with regard to them might
still be regarded as the bestowal of a blessing ([Gen
49:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#028).md).

[Genesis 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 49:8</span></span>

Judah, the fourth son, was the first to receive a rich and unmixed
blessing, the blessing of inalienable supremacy and power. "Judah thou,
thee will thy brethren praise! thy hand in the neck of thy foes! to thee
will thy father's sons bow down!" אתּה, thou, is placed first as an
absolute noun, like אני in [Gen 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004.md);
[Gen 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027.md); יודוּך is a play upon
יהוּדה like אודה in [Gen 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035.md). Judah,
according to [Gen 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035.md), signifies: he
for whom Jehovah is praised, not merely the praised one. "This nomen,
the patriarch seized as an omen, and expounded it as a presage of the
future history of Judah." Judah should be in truth all that his name
implied (cf. [Gen 27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036).md). Judah had
already shown to a certain extent a strong and noble character, when he
proposed to sell Joseph rather than shed his blood ([Gen
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#026)..md); but still more in the manner
in which he offered himself to his father as a pledge for Benjamin, and
pleaded with Joseph on his behalf ([Gen
43:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#009.md); [Gen
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#016)..md); and it was apparent even in
his conduct towards Thamar. In this manliness and strength there
slumbered the germs of the future development of strength in his tribe.
Judah would put his enemies to flight, grasp them by the neck, and
subdue them ([Job 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#012.md), cf. [Exo
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md); [Psa
18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041).md). Therefore his brethren would
do homage to him: not merely the sons of his mother, who are mentioned
in other places ([Gen 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md); [Jdg
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#019).md), i.e., the tribes descended from
Leah, but the sons of his father-all the tribes of Israel therefore; and
this was really the case under David ([Sa2
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md), cf. [Sa1
18:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006.md), and [Sa1
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#016).md). This princely power Judah
acquired through his lion-like nature.

[Gen 49:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md)

"A young lion is Judah; from the prey, my son, art thou gone up: he has
lain down; like a lion there he lieth, and like a lioness, who can rouse
him up!" Jacob compares Judah to a young, i.e., growing lion, ripening
into its full strength, as being the "ancestor of the lion-tribe." But
he quickly rises "to a vision of the tribe in the glory of its perfect
strength," and describes it as a lion which, after seizing prey, ascends
to the mountain forests (cf. [Sol
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008).md), and there lies in majestic
quiet, no one daring to disturb it. To intensify the thought, the figure
of a lion is followed by that of the lioness, which is peculiarly fierce
in defending its young. The perfects are prophetic; and עלה relates not
to the growth or gradual rise of the tribe, but to the ascent of the
lion to its lair upon the mountains. "The passage evidently indicates
something more than Judah's taking the lead in the desert, and in the
wars of the time of the Judges; and points to the position which Judah
attained through the warlike successes of David" (Knobel). The
correctness of this remark is put beyond question by [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), where the figure is carried out
still further, but in literal terms. "The sceptre shall not depart from
Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, till Shiloh come and
the willing obedience of the nations be to him." The sceptre is the
symbol of regal command, and in its earliest form it was a long staff,
which the king held in his hand when speaking in public assemblies
(e.g., Agamemnon, Il. 2, 46, 101); and when he sat upon his throne he
rested in between his feet, inclining towards himself (see the
representation of a Persian king in the ruins of Persepolis, Niebuhr
Reisebeschr. ii. 145). מחקק the determining person or thing, hence a
commander, legislator, and a commander's or ruler's staff ([Num
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018).md); here in the latter sense, as
the parallels, "sceptre" and "from between his feet," require. Judah -
this is the idea - was to rule, to have the chieftainship, till Shiloh
came, i.e., for ever. It is evident that the coming of Shiloh is not to
be regarded as terminating the rule of Judah, from the last clause of
the verse, according to which it was only then that it would attain to
dominion over the nations. כּי עד has not an exclusive signification
here, but merely abstracts what precedes from what follows the given
terminus ad quem, as in [Gen 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#013.md), or
like אשׁר עד [Gen 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015.md); [Psa
112:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#008.md), or עד [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), and ἕως [Mat
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018.md).

But the more precise determination of the thought contained in [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md) is dependent upon our
explanation of the word Shiloh. It cannot be traced, as the Jerusalem
Targum and the Rabbins affirm, to the word שׁיל filius with the suffix ה
= ו "his son," since such a noun as שׁיל is never met with in Hebrew,
and neither its existence nor the meaning attributed to it can be
inferred from שׁליה, afterbirth, in [Deu
28:57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#057.md). Nor can the paraphrases of
Onkelos (donec veniat Messias cujus est regnum), of the Greek versions
(ἕως ἐὰν ἔλθη τὰ ἀποκείμενα αὐτῷ; or ᾧ ἀπόκειται, as Aquila and
Symmachus appear to have rendered it), or of the Syriac, etc., afford
any real proof, that the defective form שׁלה, which occurs in 20 MSS,
was the original form of the word, and is to be pointed שׁלּה for שׁלּו
= לו אשׁר. For apart from the fact, that שׁ for אשׁר would be unmeaning
here, and that no such abbreviation can be found in the Pentateuch, it
ought in any case to read הוּא שׁלּו "to whom it (the sceptre) is due,"
since שׁלּו alone could not express this, and an ellipsis of הוּא in
such a case would be unparalleled. It only remains therefore to follow
Luther, and trace שׁילה to שׁלה, to be quiet, to enjoy rest, security.
But from this root Shiloh cannot be explained according to the analogy
of such forms כּידור קימשׁ For these forms constitute no peculiar
species, but are merely derived from the reduplicated forms, as קמּשׁ,
which occurs as well as קימשׁ, clearly shows; moreover they are none of
them formed from roots of ה.ל שׁילה points to שׁילון, to the formation
of nouns with the termination n, in which the liquids are eliminated,
and the remaining vowel ו is expressed by ה (Ew. 84); as for example in
the names of places, שׁלה or שׁלו, also שׁילו ([Jdg
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021.md); [Jer
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012).md) and גּלה ([Jos
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#051).md), with their derivatives שׁלני
([Kg1 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#029.md); [Kg1
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#015).md) and גּלני ([Sa2
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012).md), also אבדּה ([Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020).md) for אבדּון ([Pro
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011), etc..md), clearly prove. Hence
שׁילון either arose from שׁליון (שׁלה), or was formed directly from
שׁוּל = שׁלה, like גּלון from גּיל. But if שׁילון is the original form
of the word, שׁילה cannot be an appellative noun in the sense of rest,
or a place of rest, but must be a proper name. For the strong
termination n loses its n after o only in proper names, like שׁלמה,
מגדּו by the side of מגדּון ([Zac
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011).md) and דּודו ([Jdg
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001).md). אבדּה forms no exception to
this; for when used in [Pro 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md) as a
personification of hell, it is really a proper name. An appellative noun
like שׁילה, in the sense of rest, or place of rest, "would be
unparalleled in the Hebrew thesaurus; the nouns used in this sense are
שׁלו, שׁלוה, שׁלום, מנוּחה" For these reasons even Delitzsch pronounces
the appellative rendering, "till rest comes," or till "he comes to a
place of rest," grammatically impossible. Shiloh or Shilo is a proper
name in every other instance in which it is used in the Old Testament,
and was in fact the name of a city belonging to the tribe of Ephraim,
which stood in the midst of the land of Canaan, upon an eminence above
the village of Turmus Aya, in an elevated valley surrounded by hills,
where ruins belonging both to ancient and modern times still bear the
name of Seiln. In this city the tabernacle was pitched on the conquest
of Canaan by the Israelites under Joshua, and there it remained till the
time of Eli ([Jdg 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#031.md); [Sa1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003.md); [Sa1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012)..md), possibly till the early part
of Saul's reign.

Some of the Rabbins supposed our Shiloh to refer to the city. This
opinion has met with the approval of most of the expositors, from Teller
and Eichhorn to Tuch, who regard the blessing as a vaticinium ex eventu,
and deny not only its prophetic character, but for the most part its
genuineness. Delitzsch has also decided in its favour, because Shiloh or
Shilo is the name of a town in every other passage of the Old Testament;
and in [Sa1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012.md), where the name is
written as an accusative of direction, the words are written exactly as
they are here. But even if we do not go so far as Hoffmann, and
pronounce the rendering "till he (Judah) come to Shiloh" the most
impossible of all renderings, we must pronounce it utterly
irreconcilable with the prophetic character of the blessing. Even if
Shilo existed in Jacob's time (which can neither be affirmed nor
denied), it had acquired no importance in relation to the lives of the
patriarchs, and is not once referred to in their history; so that Jacob
could only have pointed to it as the goal and turning point of Judah's
supremacy in consequence of a special revelation from God. But in that
case the special prediction would really have been fulfilled: not only
would Judah have come to Shiloh, but there he would have found permanent
rest, and there would the willing subjection of the nations to his
sceptre have actually taken place. Now none of these anticipations and
confirmed by history. It is true we read in [Jos
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md), that after the promised land had
been conquered by the defeat of the Canaanites in the south and north,
and its distribution among the tribes of Israel had commenced, and was
so far accomplished, that Judah and the double tribe of Joseph had
received their inheritance by lot, the congregation assembled at Shilo,
and there erected the tabernacle, and it was not till after this had
been done, that the partition of the land was proceeded with and brought
to completion. But although this meeting of the whole congregation at
Shilo, and the erection of the tabernacle there, was generally of
significance as the turning point of the history, it was of equal
importance to all the tribes, and not to Judah alone. If it were to this
event that Jacob's words pointed, they should be rendered, "till they
come to Shiloh," which would be grammatically allowable indeed, but very
improbable with the existing context. And even then nothing would be
gained. For, in the first place, up to the time of the arrival of the
congregation at Shilo, Judah did not possess the promised rule over the
tribes. The tribe of Judah took the first place in the camp and on the
march ([Num 2:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003.md); [Num
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014).md), - formed in fact the van of
the army; but it had no rule, did not hold the chief command. The
sceptre or command was held by the Levite Moses during the journey
through the desert, and by the Ephraimite Joshua at the conquest and
division of Canaan. Moreover, Shilo itself was not the point at which
the leadership of Judah among the tribes was changed into the command of
nations. Even if the assembling of the congregation of Israel at Shiloh
([Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001).md) formed so far a turning
point between two periods in the history of Israel, that the erection of
the tabernacle for a permanent continuance at Shilo was a tangible
pledge, that Israel had now gained a firm footing in the promised land,
had come to rest and peace after a long period of wandering and war, had
entered into quiet and peaceful possession of the land and its
blessings, so that Shilo, as its name indicates, became the
resting-place of Israel; Judah did not acquire the command over the
twelve tribes at that time, nor so long as the house of God remained at
Shilo, to say nothing of the submission of the nations. It was not till
after the rejection of "the abode of Shiloh," at and after the removal
of the ark of the covenant by the Philistines (1 Sam 4), with which the
"tabernacle of Joseph" as also rejected, that God selected the tribe of
Judah and chose David ([Psa 78:60-72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060).md).
Hence it was not till after Shiloh had ceased to be the spiritual centre
for the tribes of Israel, over whom Ephraim had exercised a kind of rule
so long as the central sanctuary of the nation continued in its
inheritance, that by David's election as prince (נגיד) over Israel the
sceptre and the government over the tribes of Israel passed over to the
tribe of Judah. Had Jacob, therefore, promised to his son Judah the
sceptre or ruler's staff over the tribes until he came to Shiloh, he
would have uttered no prophecy, but simply a pious wish, which would
have remained entirely unfulfilled.

With this result we ought not to rest contented; unless, indeed, it
could be maintained that because Shiloh was ordinarily the name of a
city, it could have no other signification. But just as many other names
of cities are also names of persons, e.g., Enoch ([Gen
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#017).md), and Shechem ([Gen
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002).md); so Shiloh might also be a
personal name, and denote not merely the place of rest, but the man, or
bearer, of rest. We regard Shiloh, therefore, as a title of the Messiah,
in common with the entire Jewish synagogue and the whole Christian
Church, in which, although there may be uncertainty as to the
grammatical interpretation of the word, there is perfect agreement as to
the fact that the patriarch is here proclaiming the coming of the
Messiah. "For no objection can really be sustained against thus
regarding it as a personal name, in closest analogy to שׁלמה"
(Hoffmann). The assertion that Shiloh cannot be the subject, but must be
the object in this sentence, is as unfounded as the historiological
axiom, "that the expectation of a personal Messiah was perfectly foreign
to the patriarchal age, and must have been foreign from the very nature
of that age," with which Kurtz sets aside the only explanation of the
word which is grammatically admissible as relating to the personal
Messiah, thus deciding, by means of a priori assumptions which
completely overthrow the supernaturally unfettered character of
prophecy, and from a one-sided view of the patriarchal age and history,
how much the patriarch Jacob ought to have been able to prophesy. The
expectation of a personal Saviour did not arise for the first time with
Moses, Joshua, and David, or first obtain its definite form after one
man had risen up as the deliverer and redeemer, the leader and ruler of
the whole nation, but was contained in the germ in the promise of the
seed of the woman, and in the blessing of Noah upon Shem. It was then
still further expanded in the promises of God to the patriarchs. - "I
will bless thee; be a blessing, and in thee shall all the families of
the earth be blessed," - by which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (not merely
the nation to descend from them) were chosen as the personal bearers of
that salvation, which was to be conveyed by them through their seed to
all nations. When the patriarchal monad was expanded into a dodekad, and
Jacob had before him in his twelve sons the founders of the
twelve-tribed nation, the question naturally arose, from which of the
twelve tribes would the promised Saviour proceed? Reuben had forfeited
the right of primogeniture by his incest, and it could not pass over to
either Simeon or Levi on account of their crime against the Shechemites.
Consequently the dying patriarch transferred, both by his blessing and
prophecy, the chieftainship which belonged to the first-born and the
blessing of the promise to his fourth son Judah, having already, by the
adoption of Joseph's sons, transferred to Joseph the double inheritance
associated with the birthright. Judah was to bear the sceptre with
victorious lion-courage, until in the future Shiloh the obedience of the
nations came to him, and his rule over the tribes was widened into the
peaceful government of the world. It is true that it is not expressly
stated that Shiloh was to descend from Judah; but this follows as a
matter of course from the context, i.e., from the fact, that after the
description of Judah as an invincible lion, the cessation of his rule,
or the transference of it to another tribe, could not be imagined as
possible, and the thought lies upon the surface, that the dominion of
Judah was to be perfected in the appearance of Shiloh.

Thus the personal interpretation of Shiloh stands in the most beautiful
harmony with the constant progress of the same revelation. To Shiloh
will the nations belong. ולו refers back to שׁילה. יקּהת, which only
occurs again in [Pro 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md), from יקהה
with dagesh forte euphon., denotes the obedience of a son, willing
obedience; and עמּים in this connection cannot refer to the associated
tribes, for Judah bears the sceptre over the tribes of Israel before the
coming of Shiloh, but to the nations universally. These will render
willing obedience to Shiloh, because as a man of rest He brings them
rest and peace.

As previous promises prepared the way for our prophecy, so was it still
further unfolded by the Messianic prophecies which followed; and this,
together with the gradual advance towards fulfilment, places the
personal meaning of Shiloh beyond all possible doubt. - In the order of
time, the prophecy of Balaam stands next, where not only Jacob's
proclamation of the lion-nature of Judah is transferred to Israel as a
nation ([Num 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024.md); [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009).md), but the figure of the sceptre
from Israel, i.e., the ruler or king proceeding from Israel, who will
smite all his foes ([Gen 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#017).md), is
taken verbatim from [Gen 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md), [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md) of this address. In the sayings
of Balaam, the tribe of Judah recedes behind the unity of the nation.
For although, both in the camp and on the march, Judah took the first
place among the tribes ([Num 2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#002.md);
[Num 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#012.md); [Num
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014).md), this rank was no real
fulfilment of Jacob's blessing, but a symbol and pledge of its
destination to be the champion and ruler over the tribes. As champion,
even after the death of Joshua, Judah opened the attack by divine
direction upon the Canaanites who were still left in the land ([Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)..md), and also the war against
Benjamin ([Jdg 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018).md). It was also a
sign of the future supremacy of Judah, that the first judge and
deliverer from the power of their oppressors was raised up to Israel
from the tribe of Judah in the person of the Kenizzite Othniel ([Jdg
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009)..md). From that time forward Judah
took no lead among the tribes for several centuries, but rather fell
back behind Ephraim, until by the election of David as king over all
Israel, Judah was raised to the rank of ruling tribe, and received the
sceptre over all the rest ([Ch1 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004).md).
In David, Judah grew strong ([Ch1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002).md), and became a conquering lion,
whom no one dared to excite. With the courage and strength of a lion,
David brought under his sceptre all the enemies of Israel round about.
But when God had given him rest, and he desired to build a house to the
Lord, he received a promise through the prophet Nathan that Jehovah
would raise up his seed after him, and establish the throne of his
kingdom for ever ([Sa2 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013)..md).
"Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I
(Jehovah) will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for
Solomon (i.e., Friederich, Frederick, the peaceful one) shall be his
name, and I will give peace and rest unto Israel in his days...and I
will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever." Just as
Jacob's prophecy was so far fulfilled in David, that Judah had received
the sceptre over the tribes of Israel, and had led them to victory over
all their foes; and David upon the basis of this first fulfilment
received through Nathan the divine promise, that the sceptre should not
depart from his house, and therefore not from Judah;so the commencement
of the coming of Shiloh received its first fulfilment in the peaceful
sway of Solomon, even if David did not give his son the name Solomon
with an allusion to the predicted Shiloh, which one might infer from the
sameness in the meaning of שׁלמה and שׁילה when compared with the
explanation given of the name Solomon in [Ch1
28:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009.md). But Solomon was not the true
Shiloh. His peaceful sway was transitory, like the repose which Israel
enjoyed under Joshua at the erection of the tabernacle at Shiloh ([Jos
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#023.md); [Jos
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md); [Jos
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#044).md); moreover it extended over
Israel alone. The willing obedience of the nations he did not secure;
Jehovah only gave rest from his enemies round about in his days, i.e.,
during his life.

But this first imperfect fulfilment furnished a pledge of the complete
fulfilment in the future, so that Solomon himself, discerning in spirit
the typical character of his peaceful reign, sang of the King's Son who
should have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of
the earth, before whom all kings should bow, and whom all nations should
serve (Ps 72); and the prophets after Solomon prophesied of the Prince
of Peace, who should increase government and peace without end upon the
throne of David, and of the sprout out of the rod of Jesse, whom the
nations should seek ([Isa 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md); [Isa
11:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md); and lastly, Ezekiel, when
predicting the downfall of the Davidic kingdom, prophesied that this
overthrow would last until He should come to whom the right belonged,
and to whom Jehovah would give it ([Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027).md). Since Ezekiel in his words,
"till He come to whom the right belongs," takes up, and is generally
admitted, our prophecy "till Shiloh come," and expands it still further
in harmony with the purpose of his announcement, more especially from
[Psa 72:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md), where righteousness and
judgment are mentioned as the foundation of the peace which the King's
Son would bring; he not only confirms the correctness of the personal
and Messianic explanation of the word Shiloh, but shows that Jacob's
prophecy of the sceptre not passing from Judah till Shiloh came, did not
preclude a temporary loss of power. Thus all prophecies, and all the
promises of God, in fact, are so fulfilled, as not to preclude the
punishment of the shins of the elect, and yet, notwithstanding that
punishment, assuredly and completely attain to their ultimate
fulfilment. And thus did the kingdom of Judah arise from its temporary
overthrow to a new and imperishable glory in Jesus Christ ([Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014).md), who conquers all foes as the
Lion of the tribe of Judah ([Rev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005).md),
and reigns as the true Prince of Peace, as "our peace" ([Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014).md), for ever and ever.

[Gen 49:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md)

In [Gen 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md) and [Gen
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#012.md) Jacob finishes his blessing on
Judah by depicting the abundance of his possessions in the promised
land. "Binding his she-ass to the vine, and to the choice vine his ass's
colt; he washes his garment in wine, and his cloak in the blood of the
grape: dull are the eyes with wine, and white the teeth with milk." The
participle אסרי has the old connecting vowel, i, before a word with a
preposition (like [Isa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#016.md); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014), etc..md); and בּני in the construct
state, as in [Gen 31:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#039.md). The subject
is not Shiloh, but Judah, to whom the whole blessing applies. The former
would only be possible, if the fathers and Luther were right in
regarding the whole as an allegorical description of Christ, or if
Hoffmann's opinion were correct, that it would be quite unsuitable to
describe Judah, the lion-like warrior and ruler, as binding his ass to a
vine, coming so peacefully upon his ass, and remaining in his vineyard.
But are lion-like courage and strength irreconcilable with a readiness
for peace? Besides, the notion that riding upon an ass is an image of a
peaceful disposition seems quite unwarranted; and the supposition that
the ass is introduced as an animal of peace, in contrast with the
war-horse, is founded upon [Zac 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md),
and applied to the words of the patriarch in a most unhistorical manner.
This contrast did not exist till a much later period, when the
Israelites and Canaanites had introduced war-horses, and is not
applicable at all to the age and circumstances of the patriarchs, since
at that time the only animals there were to ride, beside camels, were
asses and she-asses ([Gen 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#003.md) cf.
[Exo 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020.md); [Num
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#021).md); and even in the time of the
Judges, and down to David's time, riding upon asses was a distinction of
nobility or superior rank ([Jdg 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#014.md);
[Jdg 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004.md); [Jdg
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#014.md); [Sa2
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#027).md). Lastly, even in [Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md), [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md) Judah is not depicted as a lion
eager for prey, or as loving war and engaged in constant strife, but,
according to Hoffmann's own words, "as having attained, even before the
coming of Shiloh, to a rest acquired by victory over surrounding foes,
and as seated in his place with the insignia of his dominion." Now, when
Judah's conflicts are over, and he has come to rest, he also may bind
his ass to the vine and enjoy in peaceful repose the abundance of his
inheritance. Of wine and milk, the most valuable productions of his
land, he will have such a superabundance, that, as Jacob hyperbolically
expresses it, he may wash his clothes in the blood of the grape, and
enjoy them so plentifully, that his eyes shall be inflamed with wine,
and his teeth become white with milk.

Zebulun, to the shore of the ocean will he dwell, and indeed (והוּא
isque) towards the coast of ships, and his side towards Zidon (directed
up to Zidon)." This blessing on Leah's sixth son interprets the name
Zebulun (i.e., dwelling) as an omen, not so much to show the tribe its
dwelling-place in Canaan, as to point out the blessing which it would
receive from the situation of its inheritance (compare [Deu
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019).md). So far as the territory
allotted to the tribe of Zebulun under Joshua can be ascertained from
the boundaries and towns mentioned in [Jos
19:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md), it neither reached to the
Mediterranean, nor touched directly upon Zidon (see my Comm. on Joshua).
It really lay between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean, near to
both, but separated from the former by Naphtali, from the latter by
Asher. So far was this announcement, therefore, from being a vaticinium
ex eventu taken from the geographical position of the tribe, that it
contains a decided testimony to the fact that Jacob's blessing was not
written after the time of Joshua. ימּים denotes, not the two seas
mentioned above, but, as [Jdg 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017.md)
proves, the Mediterranean, as a great ocean ([Gen
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#010).md). "The coast of ships:" i.e.,
where ships are unloaded, and land the treasures of the distant parts of
the world for the inhabitants of the maritime and inland provinces ([Deu
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019).md). Zidon, as the old capital,
stands for Phoenicia itself.

[Genesis 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 49:14</span></span>

"Issachar is a bony ass, lying between the hurdles. He saw that rest was
a good (טוב subst.), and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his
shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute." The foundation of
this award also lies in the name שׂכר ישּׂא, which is probably
interpreted with reference to the character of Issachar, and with an
allusion to the relation between שׂכר and שׂכיר, a daily labourer, as an
indication of the character and fate of his tribe. "Ease at the cost of
liberty will be the characteristic of the tribe of Issachar"
(Delitzsch). The simile of a bony, i.e., strongly-built ass,
particularly adapted for carrying burdens, pointed to the fact that this
tribe would content itself with material good, devote itself to the
labour and burden of agriculture, and not strive after political power
and rule. The figure also indicated "that Issachar would become a
robust, powerful race of men, and receive a pleasant inheritance which
would invite to comfortable repose." (According to Jos. de bell. jud.
iii. 3, 2, Lower Galilee, with the fruitful table land of Jezreel, was
attractive even to τὸν ἥκιστα γῆς φιλόπονον). Hence, even if the simile
of a bony ass contained nothing contemptible, it did not contribute to
Issachar's glory. Like an idle beast of burden, he would rather submit
to the yoke and be forced to do the work of a slave, than risk his
possessions and his peace in the struggle for liberty. To bend the
shoulder to the yoke, to come down to carrying burdens and become a mere
serf, was unworthy of Israel, the nation of God that was called to rule,
however it might befit its foes, especially the Canaanites upon whom the
curse of slavery rested ([Deu 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#011.md);
[Jos 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md); [Kg1
9:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020.md); [Isa
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027).md). This was probably also the
reason why Issachar was noticed last among the sons of Leah. In the time
of the Judges, however, Issachar acquired renown for heroic bravery in
connection with Zebulun ([Jdg 5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014.md),
[Jdg 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#018).md). The sons of Leah are
followed by the four sons of the two maids, arranged, not according to
their mothers or their ages, but according to the blessing pronounced
upon them, so that the two warlike tribes stand first.

[Genesis 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 49:16</span></span>

"Dan will procure his people justice as one of the tribes of Israel. Let
Dan become a serpent by the way, a horned adder in the path, that biteth
the horse's heels, so that its rider falls back." Although only the son
of a maid-servant, Dan would not be behind the other tribes of Israel,
but act according to his name (ידין דּן), and as much as any other of
the tribes procure justice to his people (i.e., to the people of Israel;
not to his own tribe, as Diestel supposes). There is no allusion in
these words to the office of judge which was held by Samson; they merely
describe the character of the tribe, although this character came out in
the expedition of a portion of the Danites to Laish in the north of
Canaan, a description of which is given in Judg 18, as well as in the
"romantic chivalry of the brave, gigantic Samson, when the cunning of
the serpent he overthrew the mightiest foes" (Del.). שׁפיפן: κεράστης,
the very poisonous horned serpent, which is of the colour of the sand,
and as it lies upon the ground, merely stretching out its feelers,
inflicts a fatal wound upon any who may tread upon it unawares (Diod.
Sic. 3, 49; Pliny. 8, 23).

[Genesis 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 49:18</span></span>

But this manifestation of strength, which Jacob expected from Dan and
promised prophetically, presupposed that severe conflicts awaited the
Israelites. For these conflicts Jacob furnished his sons with both
shield and sword in the ejaculatory prayer, "I wait for Thy salvation, O
Jehovah!" which was not a prayer for his own soul and its speedy
redemption from all evil, but in which, as Calvin has strikingly shown,
he expressed his confidence that his descendants would receive the help
of his God. Accordingly, the later Targums (Jerusalem and Jonathan)
interpret these words as Messianic, but with a special reference to
Samson, and paraphrase [Gen 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md)
thus: "Not for the deliverance of Gideon, the son of Joash, does my soul
wait, for that is temporary; and not for the redemption of Samson, for
that is transitory; and not for the redemption of Samson, for that is
transitory; but for the redemption of the Messiah, the Son of David,
which Thou through Thy word hast promised to bring to Thy people the
children of Israel: for this Thy redemption my soul waits."

(Note: This is the reading according to the text of the Jerusalem
Targum, in the London Polyglot as corrected from the extracts of Fagius
in the Critt. Sacr., to which the Targum Jonathan also adds, "for Thy
redemption, O Jehovah, is an everlasting redemption." But whilst the
Targumists and several fathers connect the serpent in the way with
Samson, by many others the serpent in the way is supposed to be
Antichrist. On this interpretation Luther remarks: Puto Diabolum hujus
fabulae auctorem fuisse et finxisse hanc glossam, ut nostras
cogitationes a vero et praesente Antichristo abduceret.)

"Gad - a press presses him, but he presses the heel." The name Gad
reminds the patriarch of גּוּד to press, and גּדוּד the pressing host,
warlike host, which invades the land. The attacks of such hosts Gad will
bravely withstand, and press their heel, i.e., put them to flight and
bravely pursue them, not smite their rear-guard; for עקב does not
signify the rear-guard even in [Jos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#013.md), but only the reserves (see my
commentary on the passage). The blessing, which is formed from a triple
alliteration of the name Gad, contains no such special allusions to
historical events as to enable us to interpret it historically, although
the account in [Ch1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018.md). proves that
the Gadites displayed, wherever it was needed, the bravery promised them
by Jacob. Compare with this [Ch1
12:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md), where the Gadites who come to
David are compared to lions, and their swiftness to that of roes.

"Out of Asher (cometh) fat, his bread, and he yieldeth royal dainties."
לחמו is in apposition to שׁמנה, and the suffix is to be emphasized: the
fat, which comes from him, is his bread, his own food. The saying
indicates a very fruitful soil. Asher received as his inheritance the
lowlands of Carmel on the Mediterranean as far as the territory of Tyre,
one of the most fertile parts of Canaan, abounding in wheat and oil,
with which Solomon supplied and household of king Hiram ([Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011).md).

"Naphtali is a hind let loose, who giveth goodly words." The hind or
gazelle is a simile of a warrior who is skilful and swift in his
movements ([Sa2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018.md); [Ch1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md), cf. [Psa
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md); [Hab
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019).md). שׁלהה here is neither hunted,
nor stretched out or grown slim; but let loose, running freely about
([Job 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005).md). The meaning and allusion
are obscure, since nothing further is known of the history of the tribe
of Naphtali, than that Naphtali obtained a great victory under Barak in
association with Zebulun over the Canaanitish king Jabin, which the
prophetess Deborah commemorated in her celebrated song (Judg 4 and 5).
If the first half of the verse be understood as referring to the
independent possession of a tract of land, upon which Naphtali moved
like a hind in perfect freedom, the interpretation of Masius (on Josh
19) is certainly the correct one: "Sicut cervus emissus et liber in
herbosa et fertili terra exultim ludit, ita et in sua fertili sorte
ludet et excultabit Nephtali." But the second half of the verse can
hardly refer to "beautiful sayings and songs, in which the beauty and
fertility of their home were displayed." It is far better to keep, as
Vatablius does, to the general thought: tribus Naphtali erit fortissima,
elegantissima et agillima et erit facundissima.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 49:22</span></span>

Turning to Joseph, the patriarch's heart swelled with grateful love, and
in the richest words and figures he implored the greatest abundance of
blessings upon his head.

[Gen 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022.md)

"Son of a fruit-tree is Joseph, son of a fruit-tree at the well,
daughters run over the wall." Joseph is compared to the branch of a
fruit-tree planted by a well ([Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003).md), which sends it shoots over the
wall, and by which, according to Ps 80, we are probably to understand a
vine. בּן an unusual form of the construct state for בּן, and פּרת
equivalent to פּריּה with the old feminine termination ath, like זמרת,
[Exo 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md). - בּנות are the twigs and
branches, formed by the young fruit-tree. The singular צעדה is to be
regarded as distributive, describing poetically the moving forward,
i.e., the rising up of the different branches above the wall (Ges. 146,
4). עלי, a poetical form, as in [Gen
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017.md).

[Gen 49:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#023.md)

"Archers provoke him, and shoot and hate him; but his bow abides in
strength, and the arms of his hands remain pliant, from the hands of the
Mighty One of Jacob, from thence, from the Shepherd, the Stone of
Israel." From the simile of the fruit-tree Jacob passed to a warlike
figure, and described the mighty and victorious unfolding of the tribe
of Joseph in conflict with all its foes, describing with prophetic
intuition the future as already come (vid., the perf. consec.). The
words are not to be referred to the personal history of Joseph himself,
to persecutions received by him from his brethren, or to his sufferings
in Egypt; still less to any warlike deeds of his in Egypt (Diestel):
they merely pointed to the conflicts awaiting his descendants, in which
they would constantly overcome all hostile attacks. מרר: Piel, to
embitter, provoke, lacessere. רבּוּ: perf. o from רבב to shoot. בּאיתן:
"in a strong, unyielding position" (Del.). פּזז: to be active, flexible;
only found here, and in [Sa2 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016.md) of a
brisk movement, skipping or jumping. זרעי: the arms, "without whose
elasticity the hands could not hold or direct the arrow." The words
which follow, "from the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob," are not to be
linked to what follows, in opposition to the Masoretic division of the
verses; they rather form one sentence with what precedes: "pliant remain
the arms of his hands from the hands of God," i.e., through the hands of
God supporting them. "The Mighty One of Jacob," He who had proved
Himself to be the Mighty One by the powerful defence afforded to Jacob;
a title which is copied from this passage in [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024.md), etc. "From thence," an emphatic
reference to Him, from whom all perfection comes - "from the Shepherd
([Gen 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015).md) and Stone of Israel." God
is called "the Stone," and elsewhere "the Rock" ([Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md), [Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018), etc..md), as the immoveable
foundation upon which Israel might trust, might stand firm and
impregnably secure.

[Gen 49:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025.md)

"From the God of thy father, may He help thee, and with the help of the
Almighty, may He bless thee, (may there come) blessings of heaven from
above, blessings of the deep, that lieth beneath, blessings of the
breast and of the womb. The blessing of thy father surpass the blessings
of my progenitors to the border of the everlasting hills, may they come
upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the illustrious among his
brethren." From the form of a description the blessing passes in [Gen
49:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025.md) into the form of a desire, in
which the "from" of the previous clause is still retained. The words
"and may He help thee," "may He bless thee," form parentheses, for "who
will help and bless thee." ואת is neither to be altered into ואל (and
from God), as Ewald suggests, in accordance with the lxx, Sam., Syr.,
and Vulg., nor into מאת as Knobel proposes; and even the supplying of מן
before את from the parallel clause (Ges. 154, 4) is scarcely allowable,
since the repetition of מן before another preposition cannot be
supported by any analogous case; but את may be understood here, as in
[Gen 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001.md); [Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md), in the sense of helpful
communion: "and with," i.e., with (in) the fellowship of, "the Almighty,
may He bless thee, let there be (or come) blessings," etc. The verb
תּחיין follows in [Gen 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026.md) after the
whole subject, which is formed of many parallel members. The blessings
were to come from heaven above and from the earth beneath. From the God
of Jacob and by the help of the Almighty should the rain and dew of
heaven ([Gen 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#028).md), and fountains and
brooks which spring from the great deep or the abyss of the earth, pour
their fertilizing waters over Joseph's land, "so that everything that
had womb and breast should become pregnant, bring forth, and suckle."

(Note: "Thus is the whole composed in pictorial words. Whatever of man
and cattle can be fruitful shall multiply and have enough. Childbearing,
and the increase of cattle, and of the corn in the field, are not our
affair, but the mercy and blessing of God." - Luther.)

הרים from הרה signifies parentes (Chald., Vulg.); and תּאוה signifies
not desiderium from אוה, but boundary from תּאה, [Num
34:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#007.md), = תּוה, [Sa1
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#014.md); [Eze
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md), to mark or bound off, as most of
the Rabbins explain it. על גּבר to be strong above, i.e., to surpass.
The blessings which the patriarch implored for Joseph were to surpass
the blessings which his parents transmitted to him, to the boundary of
the everlasting hills, i.e., surpass them as far as the primary
mountains tower above the earth, or so that they should reach to the
summits of the primeval mountains. There is no allusion to the lofty and
magnificent mountain-ranges of Ephraim, Bashan, and Gilead, which fell
to the house of Joseph, either here or in [Deu
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#015.md). These blessings were to descend
upon the head of Joseph, the נזיר among his brethren, i.e., "the
separated one," from נזר separavit. Joseph is so designated, both here
and [Deu 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#016.md), not on account of his
virtue and the preservation of his chastity and piety in Egypt, but
propter dignitatem, qua excellit, ab omnibus sit segregatus (Calv.), on
account of the eminence to which he attained in Egypt. For this meaning
see [Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md); whereas no example can
be found of the transference of the idea of Nasir to the sphere of
morality.

[Genesis 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 49:27</span></span>

"Benjamin - a world, which tears in pieces; in the morning he devours
prey, and in the evening he divides spoil." Morning and evening together
suggest the idea of incessant and victorious capture of booty (Del.).
The warlike character which the patriarch here attributes to Benjamin,
was manifested by that tribe, not only in the war which he waged with
all the tribes on account of their wickedness in Gibeah (Judg 20), but
on other occasions also ([Jdg 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014).md),
in its distinguished archers and slingers ([Jdg
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md); [Ch1
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040.md), [Ch1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md); [Ch2
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008.md); [Ch2
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#017).md), and also in the fact that the
judge Ehud ([Jdg 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015)..md), and Saul,
with his heroic son Jonathan, sprang from this tribe ([Sa1
11:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md) and 13; [Sa2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#019)..md).

[Genesis 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 49:28</span></span>

The concluding words in [Gen 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#028.md),
"All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve," contain the thought, that
in his twelve sons Jacob blessed the future tribes. "Every one with that
which was his blessing, he blessed them," i.e., every one with his
appropriate blessing (אשׁר accus. dependent upon בּרך which is construed
with a double accusative); since, as has already been observed, even
Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, though put down through their own fault,
received a share in the promised blessing.

[Genesis 49:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 49:29</span></span>

Death of Jacob. - After the blessing, Jacob again expressed to his
twelve sons his desire to be buried in the sepulchre of his fathers (Gen
24), where Isaac and Rebekah and his own wife Leah lay by the side of
Abraham and Sarah, which Joseph had already promised on oath to perform
([Gen 47:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#029).md). He then drew his feet
into the bed to lie down, for he had been sitting upright while blessing
his sons, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered to his people
(vid., [Gen 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008).md). ויּגוע instead of
ויּמת indicates that the patriarch departed from this earthly life
without a struggle. His age is not given here, because that has already
been done at [Gen 47:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#028.md).
