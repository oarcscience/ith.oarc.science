Call to Arms against Ungrateful Persecutors, Addressed to God

This Psalms 35 and Ps 34 form a pair. They are the only Psalms in which
the name מלאך יהוה is mentioned. The Psalms that belong to the time of
David's persecution by Saul are the Psalms which are more especially
pervaded by such retrospective references to the Tפra. And in fact this
whole Psalm is, as it were, the lyrical expansion of that which David
expresses before Saul in [Sa1 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#015.md).
The critical opinion as to the authorship of this Psalm is closely
allied with that respecting the author of Ps 40 and 69 to which Ps 35 is
nearly related; cf. [Psa 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md), [Psa
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027.md) with [Psa
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md).; [Psa
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013.md) with [Psa
69:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011.md).; whereas the relation of Ps 71
to Ps 35 is decidedly a secondary one. Hitzig conjectures it to be
Jeremiah; but [Psa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md) are
appropriate in the lips of a persecuted king, and not of a persecuted
prophet. The points of contact of the writings of Jeremiah with our
Psalm ([Jer 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#019.md)., [Jer
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012.md); [Lam
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016).md), may therefore in this instance
be more safely regarded as reminiscences of an earlier writer than in Ps
69. Throughout the whole Psalm there prevails a deep vexation of spirit
(to which corresponds the suffix מו-, as in Ps 59; [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md); [Psa
11:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md); [Psa
17:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md); 22; [Psa
64:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001).md) and strong emotion; it is not
until the second part, where the poet describes the base ingratitude of
his enemies, that the language becomes more clam and transparent, and a
more quiet sadness takes the place of indignation and rage.

Each of the three parts opens with a cry for deliverance; and closes, in
the certain assumption that it will take place, with a vow of
thanksgiving. The divisions cannot therefore be mistaken, viz., [Psa
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md), [Psa
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011.md), [Psa
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md). The relative numbers of the
stichs in the separate groups is as follows: 6. 6. 5. 5. 7. 7. 5. 6. 6.
6. 5.

There are only a few Psalms of David belonging to the time of Saul's
persecution, which, like Ps 22, keep within the limits of deep inward
grief; and in scarcely a single instance do we find him confining
himself to the expression of the accursed fate of his enemies with
prophetic certainty, as that which he confidently expects will be
realised (as, e.g., in [Psa 7:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013).md).
But for the most part the objective announcement of punishment is
swallowed up by the force of his inmost feelings, and changed into the
most importunate prayer (as in [Psa
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007.md); [Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013), and frequently.md); and this
feverish glow of feeling becomes still more harshly prominent, when the
prayer for the revelation of divine judgment in punishment passes over
into a wish that it may actually take place. In this respect Ps 7, 35,
69, 109 form a fearful gradation. In Ps 109, the old expositors count as
many as thirty anathemas. What explanation can we give of such language
coming from the lips and heart of the poet? Perhaps as paroxysms of a
desire for revenge? His advance against Nabal shows that even a David
was susceptible of such feelings; but [Sa1
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#032.md). also shows that only a gentle
stirring up of his conscience was needed to dissuade him from it. How
much more natural-we throw out this consideration in agreement with
Kurtz - that the preponderance of that magnanimity peculiar to him
should have maintained its ascendancy in the moments of the highest
religious consecration in which he composed his Psalms! It is
inconceivable that the unholy fire of personal passion could be here
mingled with the holy fire of his love to God. It is in fact the Psalms
more especially, which are the purest and most faithful mirror of the
piety of the Old Testament: the duty of love towards one's enemies,
however, is so little alien to the Old Testament ([Exo
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004.md)., [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md); [Pro
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#022.md); [Pro
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017.md); [Pro
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021.md)., [Job
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#029)..md), that the very words of the
Old Testament are made use of even in the New to inculcate this love.
And from Ps 7, in its agreement with the history of his conduct towards
Saul, we have seen that David was conscious of having fulfilled this
duty. All the imprecatory words in these Psalms come, therefore, from
the pure spring of unself-seeking zeal for the honour of God. That this
zeal appears in this instance as zeal for his own person or character
arises from the fact, that David, as the God-anointed heir of the
kingdom, stands in antagonism to Saul, the king alienated from God; and,
that to his mind the cause of God, the continuance of the church, and
the future of Israel, coincide with his own destiny. The fire of his
anger is kindled at this focus (so to speak) of the view which he has of
his own position in the course of the history of redemption. It is
therefore a holy fire; but the spirit of the New Testament, as Jesus
Himself declare sin [Luk 9:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055.md), is in
this respect, nevertheless, a relatively different spirit from that of
the Old. That act of divine love, redemption, out of the open fountain
of which there flowed forth the impulse of a love which embraces and
conquers the world, was then as yet not completed; and a curtain then
still hung before eternity, before heaven and hell, so that imprecations
like [Psa 69:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#020.md) were not
understood,even by him who uttered them, in their infinite depth of
meaning. Now that this curtain is drawn up, the New Testament faith
shrinks back from invoking upon any one a destruction that lasts לעולם;
and love seeks, so long as a mere shadow of possibility exists, to
rescue everything human from the perdition of an unhappy future-a
perdition the full meaning of which cannot be exhausted by human
thought.

In connection with all this, however, there still remains one important
consideration. The curses, which are contained in the Davidic Psalms of
the time of Saul's persecution, are referred to in the New Testament as
fulfilled in the enemies of Jesus Christ, [Act
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020.md); [Rom
11:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007.md). One expression found in our
Psalm, ἐμίσησάν με δωρεάν (cf. [Psa
69:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005).md) is used by Jesus ([Joh
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025).md) as fulfilled in Him; it
therefore appears as though the whole Psalm ought to be, or at least may
be, taken typically as the words of Christ. But nowhere in the Gospels
do we read an imprecation used by Jesus against His own and the enemies
of the kingdom of God; David's imprecations are not suited to the lips
of the Saviour, nor do the instances in which they are cited in the New
Testament give them the impress of being His direct words: they are
treated as the language of prophecy by virtue of the Spirit, whose
instrument David was, and whose work the Scriptures are. And it is only
in this sense that the Christian adopts them in prayer. For after the
pattern of his Lord, who on the cross prayed "Father forgive them," he
desires that even his bitterest enemies may not be eternally lost, but,
though it be only when in articulo mortis, that they may come to their
right mind. Even the anathemas of the apostle against the Judaising
false teachers and against Alexander the smith ([Gal
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#009.md); [Gal
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012.md); [Ti2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014).md), refer only to temporal removal
and chastisement, not to eternal perdition. They mark the extreme
boundary where, in extraordinary instances, the holy zeal of the New
Testament comes in contact with the holy fervour of the Old Testament.

[Psalms 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 35:1</span></span>

The psalmist begins in a martial and anthropomorphical style such as we
have not hitherto met with. On the ultima-accentuation of ריבה, vid., on
[Psa 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008.md). Both את are signs of the
accusative. This is a more natural rendering here, where the psalmist
implores God to subjugate his foes, than to regard את as equivalent to
עם (cf. [Isa 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025.md) with ib. [Psa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md); [Job
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#002).md); and, moreover, for the very
same reason the expression in this instance is לחם, (in the Kal, which
otherwise only lends the part. לחם, [Psa
56:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#002)., to the Niph. נלחם.md) instead of
the reciprocal form הלּחם. It is usually supposed that לחם means
properly vorare, and war is consequently conceived of as a devouring of
men; but the Arabic offers another primary meaning: to press close and
compact (Niph. to one another), consequently מלחמה means a dense crowd,
a dense bustle and tumult (cf. the Homeric κλόνος). The summons to Jahve
to arm, and that in a twofold manner, viz., with the מגן for warding off
the hostile blow and צנּה (vid., Ps 5:13) which covers the body like a
testudo - by which, inasmuch as it is impossible to hold both shields at
the same time, the figure is idealised - is meant to express, that He is
to make Himself felt by the foes, in every possible way, to their own
confounding, as the unapproachable One. The ב of בּעזרתי (in the
character of help turned towards me) is the so-called Beth essentiae,

(Note: The Hebrew Beth essentiae is used much more freely and
extensively than the Arabic, which is joined exclusively to the
predicate of a simple clause, where in our language the verb is "to be,"
and as a rule only to the predicate of negative clauses: laisa
bi-hakı̂mim, he is not wise, or laisa bi-l-hakı̂mi, he is not the wise
man. The predicate can accordingly be indeterminate or determinate.
Moreover, in Hebrew, where this ב is found with the predicate, with the
complement of the subject, or even, though only as a solecism (vid.,
Gesenius' Thesaurus p. 175), with the subject itself, the word to which
it is prefixed may be determinate, whether as an attribute determined by
itself ([Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003), בּאל שׁדּי.md), by a
suffix (as above, [Psa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002.md), cf. [Psa
146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md); [Exo
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#004.md); [Pro
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#026).md), or even by the article. At all
events no syntactic objection can be brought against the interpretations
of בעשׁן, "in the quality of smoke," [Psa
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md); cf. בּהבל, [Psa
78:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#033.md), and of בּנּפשׁ, "in the
character of the soul," [Lev 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011)..md)

as in [Exo 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#004.md); [Pro
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#026.md); [Isa
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010) (tanquam argentum.md), and
frequently. הריק has the same meaning as in [Exo
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#009.md), cf. [Gen
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014.md), viz., to bring forth, draw
forth, to draw or unsheath (a sword); for as a sword is sheathed when
not in use, so a spear is kept in the δουροδόκη (Odyss. i. 128). Even
Parchon understands סגר to mean a weapon; and the word σάγαρις, in
Herodotus, Xenophon, and Strabo, a northern Asiatic, more especially a
Scythian, battle-axe, has been compared here;

(Note: Probably one and the same word with the Armenian sakr, to which
are assigned the (Italian) meanings mannaja, scure, brando ferro, in
Ciakciak's Armenian Lexicon; cf. Lagarde's Gesammelte Abhandlungen,
1866, S. 203.)

but the battle-axe was not a Hebrew weapon, and סגר, which, thus
defectively written, has the look of an imperative, also gives the best
sense when so taken (lxx σύγκλεισον, Targ. וּטרוק), viz., close, i.e.,
cut off, interclude scil. viam. The word has Dech, because לקראת רדפי,
"casting Thyself against my persecutors," belongs to both the preceding
summonses. Dachselt rightly directs attention to the similar sequence of
the accents in [Psa 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md); [Psa
66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015.md). The Mosaic figure of Jahve as a
man of war (אישׁ מלחמה, [Exo 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003.md);
[Deu 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041)..md) is worked out here with
brilliant colours, under the impulse of a wrathful spirit. But we see
from [Psa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003.md) what a spiritual
meaning, nevertheless, the whole description is intended to convey. In
God's intervention, thus manifested in facts, he would gladly hear His
consolatory utterance to himself. The burden of his cry is that God's
love may break through the present outward appearance of wrath and make
itself felt by him.

[Psalms 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 35:4</span></span>

Throughout the next two strophes follow terrible imprecations. According
to Frst and others the relation of בּושׁ and חפר is like that of
erblassen, to turn pale (cf. [Isa
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022.md) with [Psa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006).md), and errצthen, to turn red, to
blush. בושׁ has, however, no connection with בוץ, nor has חפר, Arab.
chfr, chmr, any connection with Arab. hmr, to be red; but, according to
its radical notion, בּושׁ means disturbari (vid., Ps 6:11), and חפר,
obtegere, abscondere (vid., [Psa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006).md). יסּגוּ, properly "let them be
made to fall back" (cf. e.g., [Isa
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#017).md). On the figure on [Psa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md) cf. [Psa
83:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#014.md). The clauses respecting the
Angel of Jahve, [Psa 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md) and [Psa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006.md), are circumstantial clauses,
viz., clauses defining the manner. דּחה (giving, viz., them, the push
that shall cause their downfall, equivalent to דּחם or דּחם, [Psa
68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028).md) is closely connected with the
figure in [Psa 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006.md), and רדפם, with
the figure in [Psa 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md); consequently
it seems as though the original position of these two clauses respecting
the Angel of Jahve had been disturbed; just as in Ps 34, the ע strophe
and the פ strophe have changed their original places. It is the Angel,
who took off Pharaoh's chariot wheels so that they drave them heavily
([Exo 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025).md) that is intended here.
The fact that this Angel is concerned here, where the point at issue is
whether the kingship of the promise shall be destroyed at its very
beginning or not, harmonises with the appearing of the מלאך ה at all
critical junctures in the course of the history of redemption. חלקלקּות,
loca passim lubrica, is an intensive form of expression for חלקות rof
noisserp, [Psa 73:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018.md). Just as דּחה
recalls to mind Ex 15, so רדפם recalls Judg 5. In this latter passage
the Angel of Jahve also appears in the midst of the conquerors who are
pursuing the smitten foe, incarnate as it were in Deborah.

[Psalms 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 35:7</span></span>

[Psa 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007.md) also needs re-organising,
just as in [Psa 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md). the original
positions of דחה and רדפס are exchanged. שׁחת רשׁתּם would be a pit
deceptively covered over with a net concealed below; but, as even some
of the older critics have felt, שׁחת is without doubt to be brought down
from [Psa 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007.md) into [Psa
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007.md): without cause, i.e., without any
provocation on my part, have they secretly laid their net for me (as in
[Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md); [Psa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005).md), without cause have they digged
a pit for my soul. In [Psa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008.md) the
foes are treated of collectively. לא ידע is a negative circumstantial
clause (Ew. 341, b): improviso, as in [Pro
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006.md); [Isa
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#011.md) extrem. Instead of תּלכּדנּוּ
the expression is תּלכּדוּ, as in [Hos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#003.md); the sharper form is better
adapted to depict the suddenness and certainty of the capture. According
to Hupfeld, the verb שׁאה signifies a wild, dreary, confused noise or
crash, then devastation and destruction, a transition of meaning which -
as follows from שׁואה (cf. תּהוּ) as a name of the desolate steppe, from
שׁוא, a waste, emptiness, and from other indications - is solely brought
about by transferring the idea of a desolate confusion of tones to a
desolate confusion of things, without any intermediate notion of the
crashing in of ruins. But it may be asked whether the reverse is not
rather the case, viz., that the signification of a waste, desert,
emptiness or void is the primary one, and the meaning that has reference
to sound (cf. Arab. hwâ, to gape, be empty; to drive along, fall down
headlong, then also: to make a dull sound as of something falling, just
like rumor from ruere, fragor (from frangi) the derived one. Both
etymology (cf. תּהה, whence תּהוּ) and the preponderance of other
meanings, favour this latter view. Here the two significations are found
side by side, inasmuch as שׁואה in the first instance means a waste =
devastation, desolation, and in the second a waste = a heavy, dull
sound, a rumbling (δουπεῖν). In the Syriac version it is rendered: "into
the pit which he has digged let him fall," as though it were שׁחת in the
second instance instead of שׁואה; and from his Hupfeld, with J. H.
Michaelis, Stier, and others, is of opinion, that it must be rendered:
"into the destruction which he himself has prepared let him fall." But
this quam ipse paravit is not found in the text, and to mould the text
accordingly would be a very arbitrary proceeding.

[Psalms 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 35:9</span></span>

This strophe, with which the first part of the song closes, contains the
logical apodosis of those imprecatory jussives. The downfall of the
power that is opposed to God will be followed by the joy of triumph. The
bones of the body, which elsewhere are mentioned as sharing only in the
anguish of the soul ([Psa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003.md); [Psa
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011.md); [Psa
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md); [Psa
51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010).md), are here made to share (as
also in [Psa 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010).md) in the joy, into
which the anxiety, that agitated even the marrow of the bones, is
changed. The joy which he experiences in his soul shall throb through
every member of his body and multiply itself, as it were, into a choir
of praiseful voices. כּל with a conjunctive accent and without Makkeph,
as also in [Pro 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007.md) (not כּל־, vid.,
the Masora in Baer's Psalterium p. 133), is to be read cāl (with קמץ
רחב, opp. קמץ חטוף) according to Kimchi. According to Lonzano, however,
it is to be read col, the conjunctive accent having an equal power with
Makkeph; but this view is false, since an accent can never be placed
against Kametz chatuph. The exclamation מי כמוך is taken from [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md), where, according to the Masora,
it is to be pointed מי כמוך, as Ben Naphtali also points it in the
passage before us. The Dagesh, which is found in the former passage and
is wanting here, sharpens and hardens at the same time; it requires that
the expression should be emphatically pronounced (without there being
any danger in this instance of its being slurred over); it does not
serve to denote the closer connection, but to give it especial
prominence. חזק ממּנוּ, stronger than he, is equivalent to: strong,
whereas the other is weak, just as in [Jer
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#011.md), cf. [Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013.md), צדּיק ממּנוּ, righteous, whereas
he is ungodly. The repetition of ועני is meant to say: He rescues the
עני, who is אביון (poor) enough already, from him who would take even
the few goods that he possesses.

[Psalms 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 35:11</span></span>

The second part begins with two strophes of sorrowful description of the
wickedness of the enemy. The futures in [Psa
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011.md), [Psa
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012.md) describe that which at present
takes place. עדי חמס are μάρτυρες ἄδικοι (lxx). They demand from him a
confession of acts and things which lie entirely outside his
consciousness and his way of acting (cf. [Psa
69:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005).md): they would gladly brand him as
a perjurer, as an usurper, and as a plunderer. What David complains of
in [Psa 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012.md), we hear Saul confess in
[Sa1 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#018.md); the charge of ingratitude
is therefore well-grounded. שׁכול לנפשׁי is not dependent on ישׁלּמוּני,
in which case one would have looked for כּשׁול rather than שׁכול, but a
substantival clause: "bereavement is to my soul," its condition is that
of being forsaken by all those who formerly showed me marks of
affection; all these have, as it were, died off so far as I am
concerned. Not only had David been obliged to save his parents by
causing them to flee to Moab, but Michal was also torn from him,
Jonathan removed, and all those at the court of Saul, who had hitherto
sought the favour and friendship of the highly-gifted and
highly-honoured son-in-law of the king, were alienated from him. And how
sincerely and sympathisingly had he reciprocated their leanings towards
himself! By ואני in [Psa 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013.md), he
contrasts himself with the ungrateful and unfeeling ones. Instead of
לבשׁתּי שׁק, the expression is לבוּשׁי שׁק; the tendency of poetry for
the use of the substantival clause is closely allied to its fondness for
well-conceived brevity and pictorial definition. He manifested towards
them a love which knew no distinction between the ego and tu, which
regarded their sorrow and their guilt as his own, and joined with them
in their expiation for it; his head was lowered upon his breast, or he
cowered, like Elijah ([Kg1 18:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#042).md),
upon the ground with his head hanging down upon his breast even to his
knees, so that that which came forth from the inmost depths of his
nature returned again as it were in broken accents into his bosom.
Riehm's rendering, "at their ungodliness and hostility my prayer for
things not executed came back," is contrary to the connection, and makes
one look for אלי instead of אל־חיקי. Perret-Gentil correctly renders it,
Je priai la tte penche sur la poitrine.

The Psalmist goes on to say in [Psa
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014.md), I went about as for a friend,
for a brother to me, i.e., as if the sufferer had been such to me. With
התחלּך, used of the solemn slowness of gait, which corresponds to the
sacredness of pain, alternates שׁחח used of the being bowed down very
low, in which the heavy weight of pain finds expression. כּאבל־אם, not:
like the mourning (from אבל, like הבל from הבל) of a mother (Hitzig),
but, since a personal אבל is more natural, and next to the mourning for
an only child the loss of a mother (cf. [Gen
24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067).md) strikes the deepest wound: like
one who mourns (אבל־,

(Note: According to the old Babylonian reading (belonging to a period
when Pathach and Segol were as yet not distinguished from one another),
כּאבל (with the sign of Pathach and the stroke for Raphe below = );
vid., Pinsker, Zur Geschichte des Karaismus, S. 141, and Einleitung, S.
118.)

like לבן־, [Gen 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#012.md), from אבל,
construct state, like טמא) for a mother (the objective genitive, as in
[Gen 27:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#041.md); [Deu
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#008.md); [Amo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010.md); [Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026).md). קדר signifies the colours,
outward appearance, and attire of mourning: with dark clothes, with
tearful unwashed face, and with neglected beard. But as for them - how
do they act at the present time, when he finds himself in צלע ([Psa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017.md); [Job
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#012).md), a sideway direction, i.e.,
likely to fall (from צלע, Arab. ḍl‛, to incline towards the side)? They
rejoice and gather themselves together, and this assemblage of
ungrateful friends rejoicing over another's misfortune, is augmented by
the lowest rabble that attach themselves to them. The verb נכה means to
smite; Niph. נכּא, [Job 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#006.md), to be
driven forth with a whip, after which the lxx renders it μάστιγες, Symm.
πλῆκται, and the Targum conterentes me verbis suis; cf. הכּה בּלשׂון,
[Jer 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md). But נכים cannot by itself
mean smiters with the tongue. The adjective נכה signifies elsewhere with
רגלים, one who is smitten in the feet, i.e., one who limps or halts, and
with רוּח, but also without any addition, in [Isa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md), one smitten in spirit, i.e., one
deeply troubled or sorrowful. Thus, therefore, נכים from נכה, like גּאים
from גּאה, may mean smitten, men, i.e., men who are brought low or
reduced (Hengstenberg). It might also, after the Arabic nawika, to be
injured in mind, anwak, stupid, silly (from the same root נך, to prick,
smite, wound, cf. ichtalla, to be pierced through = mad), be understood
as those mentally deranged, enraged at nothing or without cause. But the
former definition of the notion of the word is favoured by the
continuation of the idea of the verbal adjective נכים by ולא ידעתּי,
persons of whom I have hitherto taken no notice because they were far
removed from me, i.e., men belonging to the dregs of the people (cf.
[Job 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#018.md); [Job
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001).md). The addition of ולא ידעתי
certainly makes Olshausen's conjecture that we should read נכרים
somewhat natural; but the expression then becomes tautological, and
there are other instances also in which psalm-poesy goes beyond the
ordinary range of words, in order to find language to describe that
which is loathsome, in the most glaring way. פרע, to tear, rend in
pieces, viz., with abusive and slanderous words (like Arab. qr‛ II) also
does not occur anywhere else.

And what remarkable language we now meet with in [Psa
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016.md)! מעוג does not mean scorn or
buffoonery, as Bttcher and Hitzig imagine,

(Note: The Talmudic עגה (לשׁון), B. Sanhedrin 101b, which is said to
mean "a jesting way of speaking," has all the less place here, as the
reading wavers between עגה (עגא) and אגא.)

but according to [Kg1 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#012.md), a cake of
a round formation (like the Talmudic עגּה, a circle); לעג, jeering,
jesting. Therefore לעגי מעוג means: mockers for a cake, i.e., those who
for a delicate morsel, for the sake of dainty fare, make scornful jokes,
viz., about me, the persecuted one, vile parasites; German Tellerlecker,
Bratenriecher, Greek κνισσοκόλακες, ψωμοκόλακες, Mediaeval Latin
buccellarii. This לעגי מלוג, which even Rashi interprets in
substantially the same manner, stands either in a logical co-ordinate
relation (vid., on [Isa 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011).md) or in a
logical as well as grammatical subordinate relation to its regens חנפי.
In the former case, it would be equivalent to: the profane, viz., the
cake-jesters; in the latter, which is the more natural, and quite
suitable: the profane (= the profanest, vid., [Psa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013.md); [Isa
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019.md); [Eze
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#024).md) among cake-jesters. The בּ is
not the Beth of companionship or fellowship, to express which עם or את
([Hos 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005).md) would have been used, but
Beth essentiae or the Beth of characterisation: in the character of the
most abject examples of this class of men do they gnash upon him with
their teeth. The gerund חרק (of the noise of the teeth being pressed
together, like Arab. ḥrq, of the crackling of a fire and the grating of
a file), which is used according to Ges. 131, 4, b, carries its subject
in itself. They gnash upon him with their teeth after the manner of the
profanest among those, by whom their neighbour's honour is sold for a
delicate morsel.

[Psalms 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 35:17</span></span>

Just as the first part of the Psalm closed with wishes, and thanksgiving
for their fulfilment, so the second part also closes with a prayer and
thanksgiving. כּמּה (compounded of כּ, instar, and the interrogative מה
which is drawn into the genitive by it; Aramaic כּמא, Arabic kam,
Hebrew, like בּמּה, with Dag. forte conjunct., properly: the total of
what?), which elsewhere means quot, here has the signification of
quousque, as in [Job 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019.md). משּׁאיהם
from שׁאה, the plural of which may be both שׁאים and שׁאות (this latter,
however, does not occur), like the plural of אימה, terror, אימים and
אימות. The suffix, which refers to the enemies as the authors of the
destructions ([Pro 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025).md), shows that
it is not to be rendered "from their destroyers" (Hitzig). If God
continues thus to look on instead of acting, then the destructions,
which are passing over David's soul, will utterly destroy it. Hence the
prayer: lead it back, bring that back, which is already well night borne
away to destruction. On יהידה vid., [Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md). The כּפירים, which is intended
literally in [Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md), is here
emblematical. אודך is the cohortative. עצוּם as a parallel word to רב
always refers, according to the context, to strength of numbers or to
strength of power.

[Psalms 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 35:19</span></span>

I the third part, [Psa 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md) the
description of the godlessness of his enemies is renewed; but the soul
of the praying psalmist has become more tranquil, and accordingly the
language also is more clear and moves on with its accustomed calmness.
שׁקר and חנּם are genitives, having an attributive sense (vid., on [Sa2
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#023).md). The verb קרץ signifies both to
pinch = nip, [Job 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006.md) (cf. the Arabic
karada, to cut off), and to pinch together, compress = to wink,
generally used of the eyes, but also of the lips, [Pro
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#030.md), and always as an insidiously
malicious gesture. אל rules over both members of the verse as in [Psa
75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006.md), and frequently. שׁלום in [Psa
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020.md) is the word for whatever
proceeds from good intentions and aims at the promotion or restoration
of a harmonious relationship. רגעי־ארץ (from רגע, cf. ענוי־ארץ, [Psa
76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md), [Zep
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003.md), צפוּניך, [Psa
83:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004).md) are those who quietly and
unostentatiously walk in the ways of God. Against such they devise
mischievous, lying slanders and accusations. And with wide-opened mouth,
i.e., haughty scorn, they cry, as they carouse in sight of the
misfortune of those they have persecuted: now we have that which we have
longed to see. האח (composed of ההּ and אח) is a cry of joy, and more
especially of malignant joy at another's hurt (cf. [Eze
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 35:22</span></span>

The poet takes up this malignant "now our eye sees it" and gives another
turn to it. With יהוה, alternates in [Psa
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#022.md), [Psa
35:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#023.md), cf. [Psa
35:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#017.md), אדני, the pronominal force of
which is revived in the combination אלחי ואדני (vid., [Psa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002).md). חעיר, carrying its object
within itself, signifies to stir, rouse up, and הקיץ, to break off, tear
one's self away, gather one's self up from, sleep. "To my right," viz.,
to prove it by facts; "to my cause," to carry it on in my defence.

[Psalms 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 35:25</span></span>

On the metonymical use of נפשׁ, like τὸ ὀρεκτικόν for ὄρεξις, vid.,
Psychol. S. 203 tr. p. 239. The climax of desire is to swallow David up,
i.e., to overpower him and clear him out of the way so that there is not
a trace of him left. בּלּענוּהוּ with ע before נ, as in [Psa
132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md), and frequently; on the law of
the vowels which applies to this, vid., Ewald, ֗60, a. שׂמחי רעתי is a
short form of expression for רעתי שׂמחים (בּ) על. To put on shame and
dishonour ([Psa 109:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#029), cf. Ps 18.md), so
that these entirely cover them, and their public external appearance
corresponds with their innermost nature.

[Psalms 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 35:27</span></span>

Those who wish that David's righteousness may be made manifest and be
avenged are said to take delight in it. When this takes place, Jahve's
righteousness is proved. יגדּל, let Him be acknowledged and praised as
great, i.e., let Him be magnified! David desires that all who remain
true to him may thus speak; and he, on his part, is determined to stir
up the revelation of God's righteousness in his heart, and to speak of
that of which his heart is full ([Psa
71:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#024).md).
