### [Esther Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001)

[Esther](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">est 8:0</span></span>

Mordochai Advanced to Haman's Position. Counter-Edict for the
Preservation of Jews - Esther 8

The king bestowed the house of Haman on Esther, and advanced Mordochai
to Haman's place of prime minister (vv. 1 and 2). Esther then earnestly
besought the king for the abolition of the edict published by Haman
against the Jews, and the king permitted her and Mordochai to send
letters in the king's name to all the Jews in his kingdom, commanding
them to stand for their life, and to slay their enemies, on the day
appointed for their own extermination ([Est
8:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#003)). These measures diffused great
joy throughout the kingdom ([Est
8:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015)).

[Esther 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 8:1</span></span>

By the execution of Haman, his property was confiscated, and the king
decreed that the house of the Jews' enemy should be given to Esther. The
"house of Haman" undoubtedly means the house with all that pertained to
it. "And Mordochai came before the king, for Esther had told him what he
was to her," viz., her kinsman and foster-father, [Est
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#007). This information effected
Mordochai's appearance before the king, i.e., his reception into the
number of the high dignitaries who beheld the face of the king, i.e.,
were allowed personal access to him; comp. [Est
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#010), [Est
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#014); [Est
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#009).

[Est 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#002)

And the king took off his seal-ring which he had taken from Haman (comp.
[Est 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#010)), and gave it to Mordochai.
מן העביר, to cause to go from some one, i.e., to take away. By this act
Mordochai was advanced to the post of first minister of the king; comp.
[Gen 41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042), 1 Macc. 6:15. The king's
seal gave the force of law to royal edicts, the seal taking the place of
the signature. See rem. on [Est 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008)
and [Est 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#010).

[Esther 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 8:3</span></span>

The chief enemy of the Jews was now destroyed; but the edict, written in
the king's name, sealed with the royal seal, and published in all the
provinces of the kingdom, for the destruction of all the Jews on the
13th day of the twelfth month, was still in force, and having been
issued in due legal form, could not, according to the laws of the
Persians and Medes, be revoked. Queen Esther therefore entreated the
king to annul the designs of Haman against the Jews. [Est
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#003) and [Est
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#004). "Esther spake again before the
king, and fell down at his feet, and wept, and besought him to do away
with (העביר, to cause to depart) the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and
his device that he devised against the Jews. And the king held out his
golden sceptre towards Esther, and Esther arose and stood before the
king." This verse gives a summary of the contents of Esther's speech,
which is reported verbally in [Est 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#005)
and [Est 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#006), so that we must
translate the imperfects ותּתחנּן ותּבך - ותּפּל: She spoke before the
king, falling at his feet and beseeching him with weeping, that he would
do away with המן רעת, the evil that Haman had done, and his device
against the Jews. The king stretched out his sceptre (comp. [Est
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011)) as a sign that he would
graciously grant her petition; whereupon she arose, stood before the
king, and made known her request.

[Esther 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">est 8:5</span></span>

The introductory formula are in part similar to those used [Est
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#019); [Est
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#004), [Est
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#008); [Est
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#003); but the petition referring to a
great and important matter, they are strengthened by two new phrases:
"If the thing is advisable (כּשׁר, proper, convenient, advantageous, a
later word occurring again only [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006); [Ecc
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#010), - in [Ecc
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021); [Ecc
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004), [Ecc
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#010) of the same book, כּשׁרון) before
the king, and if I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written (let a
writing be used, like [Est 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#009)), to
frustrate (להשׁיב, i.e., to put out of force) the letters, the device of
Haman ... which he wrote to destroy the Jews, who are in all the
provinces of the king." המן מחשׁבת, the device, the proposal of Haman,
is added to הסּפרים, briefly to characterize the contents of the
letters. On the matter itself, comp. [Est
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#008). and [Est
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012). "For how shall I endure to see
the destruction of my people?" The verbs וראיתי אוּכל are so combined
that the second is governed by the first, וראיתי standing instead of the
infinitive; comp. Ew. 285, c. ראה cons. בּ denotes an interested
beholding, whether painful or joyous, of something; comp. [Gen
44:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#034). מולרת in parallelism with אם
denotes those who are of like descent, the family, members of a tribe.

[Esther 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 8:7</span></span>

The king could not simply revoke the edict issued by Haman in due legal
form, but, ready to perform the request of the queen, he first assures
her of his good intentions, reminding her and Mordochai that he has
given the house of Haman to Esther and hanged Haman, because he laid
hand on the Jews (תּלוּ אתו, him they have executed); and then grants
them permission, as he had formerly done to Haman, to send letters to
the Jews in the king's name, and sealed with the king's seal, and to
write בּעיניכם כּטּוב, "as seems good to you," i.e., to give in writing
such orders as might in Esther's and Mordochai's judgment render the
edict of Haman harmless. "For," he adds, "what is written in the king's
name and sealed with his seal cannot be reversed." This confirmatory
clause is added by the king with reference to the law in general, not as
speaking of himself objectively as "the king." להשׁיב אין refers to
Esther's request: להשׁיב יכּתב ([Est
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#005)). ונחתּום, infin. abs. used
instead of the perfect.

[Esther 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 8:9</span></span>

These letters were prepared in the same manner as those of Haman ([Est
3:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012)), on the 23rd day of the third
month, the month Sivan, and sent into all the provinces. "And it was
written according to all that Mordochai commanded." They were sent to
the Jews and to the satraps, etc., of the whole wide realm from India to
Ethiopia (see [Est 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)), while those
of Haman had been issued only to the satraps, etc. The rest coincides
with [Est 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012). ויּכתּב, and he
(Mordochai) wrote. To show the speed with which the letters were
despatched, (messengers) "on horseback, on coursers, government
coursers, the sons of the stud," is added to הרצים בּיד. רכשׁ is a
collective, meaning swift horses, coursers; comp. [Kg1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#008). אחשׁתּרנים ([Est
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011) and [Est
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#014)) answers to the Old-Persian
kschatrana, from kschatra, government, king, and means government,
royal, or court studs. So Haug in Ewald's bibl. Jahrb. v. p. 154. The
older explanation, mules, on the other hand, is founded on the modern
Persian estar, which, to judge from the Sanscrit avatara, must in
ancient Persian have been apatara. רמּכים, ἁπ. λεγ. from רמּך, answering
to the Syriac remakaa', herd, especially a herd of horses, and to the
Arabic ramaka, stud, is explained by Bertheau as a superlative form for
the animal who excels the rest of the herd of stud in activity, perhaps
the breeding stallion, while others understand it of the stud in
general. The contents of the edict follow in [Est
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011) and [Est
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#012) : "that the king allows the Jews
in every city to assemble and to stand for their life (i.e., to fight
for their lives, comp. [Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)), to
destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish all the power (חיל, military
power) of the people and province that should assault them, children and
women, and to plunder their property, upon a certain day," etc. The
appointed time is thus stated as in [Est
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013). The Jews were thus authorized to
attack and destroy all enemies who should assault them on the day
appointed for their extermination. [Est
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#013) coincides with [Est
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#014), with this difference, that the
Jews are to be ready on this day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
[Est 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#014) also is similar to [Est
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#015), except that the expression is
strengthened by an addition to הרצים as in [Est
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#010), and by that of דּחוּפים, urged
on, to מבהלים, hastened, to point out the utmost despatch possible.

[Esther 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 8:15</span></span>

The joy experienced throughout the kingdom at these measures. [Est
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015). After transacting with the king
this measure so favourable to the Jews, Mordochai went out from the king
in a garment of deep blue and white material (comp. [Est
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#006)), and with a great crown of gold,
and a mantle of byssus and purple. תּכריך, ἁπ. λεγ., in the Aramaean
תּכריכא, a wide mantle or covering. The meaning is not, as Bertheau
remarks, that he left the king in the garment which had been, according
to [Est 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#008)., presented to him, nor
that he left him with fresh tokens of his favour, clothed in a garment,
crown, and mantle just bestowed on him, but that he left him in a
magnificent state garment, and otherwise festally apparelled, that he
might thus show, even by his external appearance, the happiness of his
heart. Of these remarks, the first and last are quite correct; the
second, however, can by no means be so, because it affords no answer to
the question how Mordochai had obtained crown and mantle during his stay
with the king and in the royal palace. The garments in which Mordochai
left the king are evidently the state garments of the first minister,
which Mordochai received at his installation to his office, and, as
such, no fresh token of royal favour, but only his actual induction in
his new dignity, and a sign of this induction to all who saw him issue
from the palace so adorned. "The city of Susa rejoiced and was glad,"
i.e., rejoiced for gladness. The city, i.e., its inhabitants on the
whole.

[Est 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#016)

The Jews (i.e., in Susa, for those out of the city are not spoken of
till [Est 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017)) had light and
gladness, and delight and honour." אורה (this form occurs only here and
[Psa 109:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#012)), light, is a figurative
expression for prosperity. יקר, honour - in the joy manifested by the
inhabitants of Susa at the prevention of the threatened destruction.

[Est 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017)

And in every province and city ... there was joy and a glad day, a feast
day, comp. [Est 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#019), [Est
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#022), while Haman's edict had caused
grief and lamentation, [Est 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#003). "And
many of the people of the land (i.e., of the heathen inhabitants of the
Persian empire) became Jews, for the fear of the Jews fell upon them."
מתיהדים, to confess oneself a Jew, to become a Jew, a denominative
formed from יהוּדי, occurs only here. On the confirmatory clause, comp.
[Exo 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016); [Deu
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#025). This conversion of many of the
heathen to Judaism must not be explained only, as by Clericus and
Grotius, of a change of religion on the part of the heathen, ut sibi hoc
modo securitatem et reginae favorem pararent, metuentes potentiam
Mardechaei. This may have been the inducement with some of the
inhabitants of Susa. But the majority certainly acted from more
honourable motives, viz., a conviction, forced upon them by the
unexpected turn of affairs in favour of the Jews, of the truth of the
Jewish religion; and the power of that faith and trust in God manifested
by the Jews, and so evidently justified by the fall of Haman and the
promotion of Mordochai, contrasted with the vanity and misery of
polytheism, to which even the heathen themselves were not blind. When we
consider that the same motives in subsequent times, when the Jews as a
nation were in a state of deepest humiliation, attracted the more
earnest-minded of the heathen to the Jewish religion, and induced them
to become proselytes, the fact here related will not appear surprising.
