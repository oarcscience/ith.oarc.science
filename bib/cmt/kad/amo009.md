### [Amos Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 9:0</span></span>

Destruction of the Sinful Kingdom, and Establishment of the New Kingdom
of God - [Amo 9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md)

The prophet sees the Lord standing by the altar, and giving command to
overthrow the temple, that the whole nation may be buried beneath the
ruins ([Amo 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001).md). Should any one
escape, the Lord will pursue him everywhere, and overtake and destroy
him ([Amo 9:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002).md); for He is the
Almighty God, and the Judge of the world ([Amo
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005.md) and [Amo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006).md); and Israel has become like the
heathen, so that it deserves no sparing. Nevertheless it shall not be
utterly destroyed, but simply sifted, and the sinful mass be slain ([Amo
9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007).md). Then will the fallen
tabernacle of David be raised up again, and the kingdom of God be
glorified by the reception of all nations ([Amo
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012).md), and richly blessed with the
fulness of the gifts of divine grace ([Amo
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md), [Amo
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014).md), and never destroyed again ([Amo
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015).md). As the chapter gives the final
development of the judgment threatened in the preceding one, so is it
also closely attached in form to ch. 7 and [Amo
8:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md), commencing with a vision just
as they do. But whilst the preceding visions simply indicate the
judgment which is to fall upon the sinful nation, and are introduced
with the words, "The Lord showed me" ([Amo
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001.md), [Amo
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004.md), [Amo
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007.md); [Amo
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001).md), this closing vision shows the
Lord engaged in the execution of the judgment, and commences accordingly
with the words, "I saw the Lord standing," etc.

[Amos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 9:1</span></span>

"I saw the Lord standing by the altar; and He said, Smite the top, that
the thresholds may tremble, and smash them upon the head of all of them;
and I will slay their remnant with the sword: a fugitive of them shall
not flee; and an escaped one of them shall not escape." The correct and
full interpretation not only of this verse, but of the whole chapter,
depends upon the answer to be given to the question, what altar we are
to understand by hammizbēăch. Ewald, Hitzig, Hofmann, and Baur follow
Cyril in thinking of the temple at Bethel, because, as Hitzig says, this
vision attaches itself in an explanatory manner to the close of [Amo
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014.md), and because, according to
Hofmann, "if the word of the prophet in general was directed against the
kingdom, the royal house and the sanctuary of the ten tribes, the
article before hammizbēăch points to the altar of the sanctuary in the
kingdom of Israel, to the altar at Bethel, against which he has already
prophesied in a perfectly similar manner in [Amo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#014.md)." But there is no ground whatever
for the assertion that our vision contains simply an explanation of [Amo
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014.md). The connection with [Amo
8:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md) is altogether not so close,
that the object of the prophecy in the one chapter must of necessity
cover that of the other. And it is quite incorrect to say that the word
of the prophet throughout is directed simply against the kingdom of the
ten tribes, or that, although Amos does indeed reprove the sins of Judah
as well as those of Israel, he proclaims destruction to the kingdom of
Jeroboam alone. As early as [Amo 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#005.md)
he announces desolation to Judah by fire, and the burning of the palaces
of Jerusalem; and in [Amo 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md), again,
he gives utterance to a woe upon the self-secure in Zion, as well as
upon the careless ones in Samaria. And lastly, it is evident from [Amo
9:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md) of the present chapter, that
the sinful kingdom which is to be destroyed from the face of the earth
is not merely the kingdom of the ten tribes, but the kingdoms of Judah
and Israel, which are embraced in one. For although it is stated
immediately afterwards that the Lord will not utterly destroy the house
of Jacob, but will shake the house of Israel among all nations, the
house of Jacob cannot mean the kingdom of Judah, and the house of Israel
the kingdom of the ten tribes, because such a contrast between Judah and
Israel makes the thought too lame, and the antithesis between the
destruction of the sinful kingdom and the utter destruction of the
nation is quite obliterated. Amos does not generally draw such a
distinction between the house of Jacob and the house of Israel, as that
the first represents Judah, and the second the ten tribes; but he uses
the two epithets as synonymous, as we may see from a comparison of [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008.md) with [Amo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014.md), where the rejection of the pride
of Israel and the hating of its palaces ([Amo
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008).md) are practically interpreted by
the raising up of a nation which oppresses the house of Israel in all
its borders ([Amo 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014).md). And so also
in the chapter before us, the "house of Israel" ([Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009).md) is identical with "Israel" and
the "children of Israel" ([Amo 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007).md),
whom God brought up out of Egypt. But God brought up out of Egypt not
the ten tribes, but the twelve. And consequently it is decidedly
incorrect to restrict the contents of [Amo
9:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md) to the kingdom of the ten
tribes. And if this be the case, we cannot possibly understand by
hammizbēăch in [Amo 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md) the altar of
Bethel, especially seeing that not only does Amos foretel the visitation
or destruction of the altars of Bethel in [Amo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#014.md), and therefore recognises not one
altar only in Bethel, but a plurality of altars, but that he also speaks
in [Amo 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#009.md) of the desolation of the
high places and sanctuaries in Israel, and in [Amo
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014.md) places the sanctuary at Daniel on
a par with that at Bethel; so that there was not any one altar in the
kingdom of the ten tribes, which could be called hammizbēăch, the altar
par excellence, inasmuch as it possessed from the very beginning two
sanctuaries of equal dignity (viz., at Bethel and Dan). Hammizbēăch,
therefore, both here and at [Eze 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md),
is the altar of burnt-offering in the temple, at Jerusalem, the
sanctuary of the whole of the covenant nation, to which even the ten
bribes still belonged, in spite of their having fallen away from the
house of David. So long as the Lord still continued to send prophets to
the ten tribes, so long did they pass as still forming part of the
people of God, and so long also was the temple at Jerusalem the divinely
appointed sanctuary and the throne of Jehovah, from which both blessings
and punishment issued from the. The Lord roars from Zion, and from Zion
He utters His voice ([Amo 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002).md), not
only upon the nations who have shown hostility to Judah or Israel, but
also upon Judah and Israel, on account of their departure from His law
([Amo 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004.md) and [Amo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006)..md).

The vision in this verse is founded upon the idea that the whole nation
is assembled before the Lord at the threshold of the temple, so that it
is buried under the ruins of the falling building, in consequence of the
blow upon the top, which shatters the temple to its very foundations.
The Lord appears at the altar, because here at the sacrificial place of
the nation the sins of Israel are heaped up, that He may execute
judgment upon the nation there. נצּב על, standing at (not upon) the
altar, as in [Kg1 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md). He gives
commandment to smite the top. The person who is to do this is not
mentioned; but it was no doubt an angel, probably the המּלאך המּשׁחית,
who brought the pestilence as a punishment at the numbering of the
people in the time of David ([Sa2
24:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#015).md), who smote the army of the
Assyrian king Sennacherib before Jerusalem ([Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md), and who also slew the
first-born of Egypt ([Exo 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#013.md), [Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023).md); whereas in [Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md), [Eze
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#007.md), He is represented as
accomplishing the judgment of destruction by means of six angels.
Hakkaphtōr, the knob or top; in [Exo
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md), [Exo
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#033.md), ff., an ornament upon the shaft
and branches of the golden candlestick. Here it is an ornament at the
top of the columns, and not "the lintel of the door," or "the pinnacle
of the temple with its ornaments." For the latter explanation of
kaphtōr, which cannot be philologically sustained, by no means follows
from the fact that the antithesis to the kaphtōr is formed by the
sippı̄m, or thresholds of the door. The knob and threshold simply express
the contrast between the loftiest summit and the lowest base, without at
all warranting the conclusion that the saph denotes the base of the
pillar which culminated in a knob, or kaphtōr, the top of the door which
rested upon a threshold. The description is not architectural, but
rhetorical, the separate portions of the whole being individualized, for
the purpose of expressing the thought that the building was to be
shattered to pieces in summo usque ad imum, a capite ad calcem. Would we
bring out more clearly the idea which lies at the foundation of the
rhetorical mode of expression, we have only to think of the capital of
the pillars Jachin and Boaz, and that with special reference to their
significance, as symbolizing the stability of the temple. The smiting of
these pillars, so that they fall to the ground, individualizes the
destruction of the temple, without there being any necessity in
consequence to think of these pillars as supporting the roof of the
temple hall. The rhetorical character of the expression comes out
clearly again in what follows, "and smash them to pieces, i.e., lay them
in ruins upon the head of all,"

(Note: Luther's rendering, "for their avarice shall come upon the head
of all of them," in which he follows the Vulgate, arose from בּצעם being
confounded with בּצעם.)

where the plural suffix attached to בּצעם (with the toneless suffix for
בּצעם; see Ewald, 253, a) cannot possibly be taken as referring to the
singular hakkaphtōr, nor even to hassippı̄m alone, but must refer to the
two nouns hakkaphtōr and hassippı̄m. the reference to hassippı̄m could no
doubt be grammatically sustained; but so far as the sense is concerned,
it is inadmissible, inasmuch as when a building falls to the ground in
consequence of its having been laid in ruins by a blow from above, the
thresholds of the entrance could not possibly fall upon the heads of the
men who were standing in front of it. The command has throughout a
symbolical meaning, ad has no literal reference to the destruction of
the temple. The temple symbolizes the kingdom of God, which the Lord had
founded in Israel; and as being the centre of that kingdom, it stands
here for the kingdom itself. In the temple, as the dwelling-place of the
name of Jehovah, i.e., of the gracious presence of God, the idolatrous
nation beheld an indestructible pledge of the lasting continuance of the
kingdom. But this support to their false trust is taken away from it by
the announcement that the Lord will lay the temple in ruins. The
destruction of the temple represents the destruction of the kingdom of
God embodied in the temple, with which indeed the earthly temple would
of necessity fall to the ground. No one will escape this judgment. This
is affirmed in the words which follow: And their last, their remnant
('achărı̄th, as in [Amo 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002).md), I will
slay with the sword; as to the meaning of which Cocceius has correctly
observed, that the magnitude of the slaughter is increased exclusione
fugientium et eorum, qui videbantur effugisse. The apparent discrepancy
in the statement, that they will all be crushed to pieces by the ruins,
and yet there will be fugitives and persons who have escaped, is removed
at once if we bear in mind that the intention of the prophet is to cut
off every loophole for carnal security, and that the meaning of the
words is simply this: "And even if any should succeed in fleeing and
escaping, God will pursue them with the sword, and slay them" (see
Hengstenberg, Christology, on this passage).

[Amos 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 9:2</span></span>

The thought is still further expanded in [Amo
9:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md). [Amo
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md). "If they break through into hell,
my hand will take them thence; and if they climb up to heaven, thence
will I fetch them down. [Amo 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003.md). And
if they hide themselves upon the top of Carmel, I will trace them, and
fetch them thence; and if they conceal themselves from before mine eyes
in the bottom of the sea, thence do I command the serpent, and it biteth
them. [Amo 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#004.md). And if they go into
captivity before their enemies, I will command the sword thence, and it
slayeth them; and I direct my eye upon them for evil, and not for good."
The imperfects, with אם, are to be taken as futures. They do not assume
what is impossible as merely hypothetical, in the sense of "if they
should hide themselves;" but set forth what was no doubt in actual fact
an impossible case, as though it were possible, in order to cut off
every escape. For the cases mentioned in [Amo
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003.md) and [Amo
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#004.md) might really occur. Hiding upon
Carmel and going into captivity belong to the sphere of possibility and
of actual occurrence. In order to individualize the thought, that escape
from the punishing arm of the Almighty is impossible, the prophet
opposes the most extreme spaces of the world to one another, starting
from heaven and hell, as the loftiest height and deepest depth of the
universe, in doing which he has in all probability [Psa
139:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007.md) floating before his mind. He
commences with the height, which a man cannot possibly climb, and the
depth, to which he cannot descend, to show that escape is impossible.
חתר, to break through, with ב, to make a hole into anything ([Eze
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#008.md); [Eze
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#005.md), [Eze
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#007).md). According to the Hebrew view,
Sheol was deep in the interior of the earth. The head of Carmel is
mentioned (see at [Jos 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026).md). The
reference is not to the many caves in this promontory, which afford
shelter to fugitives; for they are not found upon the head of Carmel,
but for the most part on the western side (see v. Raumer, Pal. p. 44).
The emphasis lies rather upon the head, as a height overgrown with
trees, which, even if not very high (about 1800 feet; see at [Kg1
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019).md), yet, in comparison with the
sea over which it rises, might appear to be of a very considerable
height; in addition to which, the situation of Carmel, on the extreme
western border of the kingdom of Israel, might also be taken into
consideration. "Whoever hides himself there, must assuredly know of no
other place of security in the whole of the land besides. And if there
is no longer any security there, there is nothing left but the sea." But
even the deep sea-bottom will not shelter from the vengeance of God. God
commands the serpent, or summons the serpent to bite him. Nâchâsh, here
the water-serpent, called elsewhere livyāthān or tannı̄n ([Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md), a sea-monster, which was
popularly supposed to be extremely dangerous, but which cannot be more
exactly defined. Even by going into captivity, they will not be
protected from the sword. בּשּׁבי, not into captivity, but in statu
captivitatis: even if they should be among those who were wandering into
captivity, where men are generally sure of their lives (see [Lam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#005).md). For God has fixed His eye upon
them, i.e., has taken them under His special superintendence (cf. [Jer
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#012).md); not, however, to shelter, to
protect, and to bless, but לרעה, for evil, i.e., to punish them. "The
people of the Lord remain, under all circumstances, the object of
special attention. They are more richly blessed than the world, but they
are also more severely punished" (Hengstenberg).

[Amos 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 9:5</span></span>

To strengthen this threat, Amos proceeds, in [Amo
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005.md), [Amo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006.md), to describe Jehovah as the Lord
of heaven and earth, who sends judgments upon the earth with omnipotent
power. [Amo 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005.md). "And the Lord Jehovah
of hosts, who toucheth the earth, and it melteth, and all the
inhabitants of thereupon mourn; and the whole of it riseth like the
Nile, and sinketh like the Nile of Egypt. [Amo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006.md). Who buildeth His stories in
heaven, and His vault, over the earth hath He founded it; who calleth to
the waters of the sea, and poureth them out over the earth: Jehovah is
His name." This description of God, who rules with omnipotence, is
appended, as in [Amo 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013.md) and [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md), without any link of connection
whatever. We must not render it, "The Lord Jehovah of hosts is He who
toucheth the earth;" but we must supply the connecting thought, "And He
who thus directeth His eye upon you is the Lord Jehovah of hosts, who
toucheth the earth, and it melteth." The melting or dissolving of the
earth is, according to [Psa 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007.md), an
effect produced by the Lord, who makes His voice heard in judgments, or
"the destructive effect of the judgments of God, whose instruments the
conquerors are" (Hengstenberg), when nations reel and kingdoms totter.
The Lord therefore touches the earth, so that it melts, when He
dissolves the stability of the earth by great judgments (cf. [Psa
75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004).md). "Israel could not fail to test
the truth of these words by painful experience, when the wild hordes of
Assyria poured themselves over the western parts of Asia"
(Hengstenberg). The following words, depicting the dissolution of the
earth, are repeated, with very inconsiderable alterations, from [Amo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md); we have merely the omission of
ונגרשׁה, and the kal שׁקעה substituted for the niphal נשׁקה. In [Amo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006.md) there is evidently an allusion to
the flood. God, who is enthroned in heaven, in the cloud-towers built
above the circle of the earth, possesses the power to pour the waves of
the sea over the earth by His simple word. Ma‛ălōth is synonymous with
עליּות in [Psa 104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md) : upper rooms,
lit., places to which one has to ascend. 'Aguddâh, an arch or vault:
that which is called râqı̄ă‛, the firmament, in other places. The heaven,
in which God builds His stories, is the heaven of clouds; and the vault,
according to [Gen 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007.md), is the
firmament of heaven, which divided the water above the firmament from
the water beneath it. Consequently the upper rooms of God are the waters
above the firmament, in or out of which God builds His stories ([Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003).md), i.e., the cloud-tower above
the horizon of the earth, which is raised above it like a vault. Out of
this cloud-castle the rain pours down ([Psa
104:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013).md); and out of its open windows
the waters of the flood poured down, and overflowed the earth ([Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011).md). When God calls to the waters of
the sea, they pour themselves over the surface of the earth. The waves
of the sea are a figurative representation of the agitated multitude of
nations, or of the powers of the world, which pour their waves over the
kingdom of God (see at [Amo 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004).md).

[Amos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 9:7</span></span>

The Lord will pour out these floods upon sinful Israel, because it
stands nearer to Him than the heathen do. [Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007.md). "Are ye not like the sons of the
Cushites to me, ye sons of Israel? is the saying of Jehovah. Have I not
brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines out of
Caphtor, and Aram out of Kir?" With these words the prophet tears away
from the sinful nation the last support of its carnal security, namely,
reliance upon its election as the nation of God, which the Lord has
practically confirmed by leading Israel up out of Egypt. Their election
as the people of Jehovah was unquestionably a pledge that the Lord would
not cast off His people, or suffer them to be destroyed by the heathen.
But what the apostle says of circumcision in [Rom
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025.md) applied to this election also,
namely, that it was of benefit to none but those who kept the law. It
afforded a certainty of divine protection simply to those who proved
themselves to be the children of Israel by their walk and conduct, and
who faithfully adhered to the Lord. To the rebellious it was of no
avail. Idolaters had become like the heathen. The Cushites are
mentioned, not so much as being descendants of the accursed Ham, as on
account of the blackness of their skin, which was regarded as a symbol
of spiritual blackness (cf. [Jer
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023).md). The expression "sons
(children) of the Cushites" is used with reference to the title "sons
(children) of Israel," the honourable name of the covenant nation. For
degenerate Israel, the leading up out of Egypt had no higher
signification than the leading up of the Philistines and Syrians out of
their former dwelling-places into the lands which they at present
inhabited. These two peoples are mentioned by way of example: the
Philistines, because they were despised by the Israelites, as being
uncircumcised; the Syrians, with an allusion to the threat in [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md), that they should wander into
exile to Kir. On the fact that the Philistines sprang from Caphtor, see
the comm. on [Gen 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#014.md).

[Amos 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 9:8</span></span>

Election, therefore, will not save sinful Israel from destruction. After
Amos has thus cut off all hope of deliverance from the ungodly, he
repeats, in his own words in [Amo
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md)., the threat already exhibited
symbolically in [Amo 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md). [Amo
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md). "Behold, the eyes of the Lord
Jehovah are against the sinful kingdom, and I destroy it from off the
face of the earth; except that I shall not utterly destroy the house of
Jacob: is the saying of Jehovah. [Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009.md). For, behold, I command, and shake
the house of Israel among all nations, as (corn) is shaken in a sieve,
and not even a little grain falls to the ground. [Amo
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#010.md). All the sinners of my people
will die by the sword, who say, The evil will not overtake or come to
us." The sinful kingdom is Israel; not merely the kingdom of the ten
tribes however, but all Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes along with
Judah, the house of Jacob or Israel, which is identical with the sons of
Israel, who had become like the Cushites, although Amos had chiefly the
people and kingdom of the ten tribes in his mind. Bammamlâkhâh, not upon
the kingdom, but against the kingdom. The directing of the eye upon an
object is expressed by על ([Amo 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#004).md)
or אל (cf. [Psa 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016).md); whereas ב is
used in relation to the object upon which anger rests ([Psa
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#017).md). Because the Lord had turned
His eye towards the sinful kingdom, He must exterminate it, - a fate
with which Moses had already threatened the nation in [Deu
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#015.md). Nevertheless (אפס כּי, "only
that," introducing the limitation, as in [Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028.md); [Deu
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#004).md) the house of Jacob, the covenant
nation, shall not be utterly destroyed. The "house of Jacob" is opposed
to the "sinful nation;" not, however, so that the antithesis simply lies
in the kingdom and people (regnum delebo, non populum), or that the
"house of Jacob" signifies the kingdom of Judah as distinguished from
the kingdom of the ten tribes, for the "house of Jacob" is perfectly
equivalent to the "house of Israel" ([Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009).md). The house of Jacob is not to be
utterly destroyed, but simply to be shaken, as it were, in a sieve. The
antithesis lies in the predicate החטּא, the sinful kingdom. So far as
Israel, as a kingdom and people, is sinful, it is to be destroyed from
off the face of the earth. But there is always a divine kernel in the
nation, by virtue of its divine election, a holy seed out of which the
Lord will form a new and holy people and kingdom of God. Consequently
the destruction will not be a total one, a השׁמיד אשׁמיד. The reason for
this is introduced by kı̄ (for) in [Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009.md). The Lord will shake Israel among
the nations, as corn is shaken in a sieve; so that the chaff flies away,
and the dust and dirt fall to the ground, and only the good grains are
left in the sieve. Such a sieve are the nations of the world, through
which Israel is purified from its chaff, i.e., from its ungodly members.
Tserōr, generally a bundle; here, according to its etymology, that which
is compact or firm, i.e., solid grain as distinguished from loose chaff.
In [Sa2 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#013.md) it is used in a similar
sense to denote a hard piece of clay or a stone in a building. Not a
single grain fill fall to the ground, that is to say, not a good man
will be lost (cf. [Sa1 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#020).md). The
self-secure sinners, however, who rely upon their outward connection
with the nation of God (compare [Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007.md) and [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002).md), or upon their zeal in the
outward forms of worship ([Amo 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021)..md),
and fancy that the judgment cannot touch them (הקדּים בּעד, to come to
meet a person round about him, i.e., to come upon him from every side),
will all perish by the sword. This threat is repeated at the close,
without any formal link of connection with [Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009.md), not only to prevent any abuse of
the foregoing modification of the judgment, but also to remove this
apparent discrepancy, that whereas in [Amo
9:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md) it is stated that not one will
escape the judgment, according to [Amo
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md), the nation of Israel is not to be
utterly destroyed. In order to anticipate the frivolity of the ungodly,
who always flatter themselves with the hope of escaping when there is a
threatening of any general calamity, the prophet first of all cuts off
all possibilities whatever in [Amo
9:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md), without mentioning the
exceptions; and it is not till afterwards that the promise is introduced
that the house of Israel shall not be utterly annihilated, whereby the
general threat is limited to sinners, and the prospect of deliverance
and preservation through the mercy of God is opened to the righteous.
The historical realization or fulfilment of this threat took place, so
far as Israel of the ten tribes was concerned, when their kingdom was
destroyed by the Assyrians, and in the case of Judah, at the overthrow
of the kingdom and temple by the Chaldeans; and the shaking of Israel in
the sieve is still being fulfilled upon the Jews who are dispersed among
all nations.

[Amos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 9:11</span></span>

The Kingdom of God Set Up. - Since God, as the unchangeable One, cannot
utterly destroy His chosen people, and abolish or reverse His purpose of
salvation, after destroying the sinful kingdom, He will set up the new
and genuine kingdom of God. [Amo 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md).
"On that day will I set up the fallen hut of David, and wall up their
rents; and what is destroyed thereof I will set up, and build it as in
the days of eternity. [Amo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md). That
they may taken possession of the remnant of Edom, and all the nations
upon which my name shall be called, is the saying of Jehovah, who doeth
such things." "In that day," i.e., when the judgment has fallen upon the
sinful kingdom, and all the sinners of the people of Jehovah are
destroyed. Sukkâh, a hut, indicates, by way of contrast to bayith, the
house or palace which David built for himself upon Zion ([Sa2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011).md), a degenerate condition of the
royal house of David. This is placed beyond all doubt by the predicate
nōpheleth, fallen down. As the stately palace supplies a figurative
representation of the greatness and might of the kingdom, so does the
fallen hut, which is full of rents and near to destruction, symbolize
the utter ruin of the kingdom. If the family of David no longer dwells
in a palace, but in a miserable fallen hut, its regal sway must have
come to an end. The figure of the stem of Jesse that is hewn down, in
[Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), is related to this; except
that the former denotes the decline of the Davidic dynasty, whereas the
fallen hut represents the fall of the kingdom. There is no need to
prove, however, that this does not apply to the decay of the Davidic
house by the side of the great power of Jeroboam (Hitzig, Hofmann),
least of all under Uzziah, in whose reign the kingdom of Judah reached
the summit of its earthly power and glory. The kingdom of David first
became a hut when the kingdom of Judah was overcome by the Chaldeans, -
an event which is included in the prediction contained in [Amo
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md)., and hinted at even in [Amo
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#005.md). But this hut the Lord will raise
up again from its fallen condition. This raising up is still further
defined in the three following clauses: "I wall up their rents"
(pirtsēhen). The plural suffix can only be explained from the fact that
sukkâh actually refers to the kingdom of God, which was divided into two
kingdoms ("these kingdoms," [Amo 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002).md),
and that the house of Israel, which was not to be utterly destroyed
([Amo 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008).md), consisted of the remnant
of the people of the two kingdoms, or the ἐκλογή of the twelve tribes;
so that in the expression גדרתי פרציהן there is an allusion to the fact
that the now divided nation would one day be united again under the one
king David, as Hosea ([Hos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002.md); [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).md) and Ezekiel (ch. [Eze
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022).md) distinctly prophesy. The
correctness of this explanation of the plural suffix is confirmed by
הרסתיו in the second clause, the suffix of which refers to David, under
whom the destroyed kingdom would rise into new power. And whilst these
two clauses depict the restoration of the kingdom from its fallen
condition, in the third clause its further preservation is foretold.

בּנה does not mean to "build" here, but to finish building, to carry on,
enlarge, and beautify the building. The words כּימי עולם (an abbreviated
comparison for "as it was in the days of the olden time") point back to
the promise in [Sa2 7:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011.md), [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md), that God would build a house for
David, would raise up his seed after him, and firmly establish his
throne for ever, that his house and his kingdom should endure for ever
before Him, upon which the whole of the promise before us is founded.
The days of the rule of David and of his son Solomon are called "days of
eternity," i.e., of the remotest past (compare [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014).md), to show that a long period
would intervene between that time and the predicted restoration. The
rule of David had already received a considerable blow through the
falling away of the ten tribes. And it would fall still deeper in the
future; but, according tot he promise in 2 Samuel 7, it would not
utterly perish, but would be raised up again from its fallen condition.
It is not expressly stated that this will take place through a shoot
from its own stem; but that is implied in the fact itself. The kingdom
of David could only be raised up again through an offshoot from David's
family. And that this can be no other than the Messiah, was unanimously
acknowledged by the earlier Jews, who even formed a name for the Messiah
out of this passage, viz., בר נפלין, filius cadentium, He who had sprung
from a fallen hut (see the proofs in Hengstenberg's Christology, vol. i.
p. 386 transl.). The kingdom of David is set up in order that they (the
sons of Israel, who have been proved to be corn by the sifting, [Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009).md) may take possession of the
remnant of Edom and all the nations, etc. The Edomites had been brought
into subjection by David, who had taken possession of their land. At a
late period, when the hut of David was beginning to fall, they had
recovered their freedom again. This does not suffice, however, to
explain the allusion to Edom here; for David had also brought the
Philistines, the Moabites, the Ammonites, and the Aramaeans into
subjection to his sceptre, - all of them nations who had afterwards
recovered their freedom, and to whom Amos foretels the coming judgment
in [Amo 1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md). The reason why Edom
alone is mentioned by name must be sought for, therefore, in the
peculiar attitude which Edom assumed towards the people of God, namely,
in the fact "that whilst they were related to the Judaeans, they were of
all nations the most hostile to them" (Rosenmller). On this very ground
Obadiah predicted that judgment would come upon the Edomites, and that
the remnant of Esau would be captured by the house of Jacob. Amos speaks
here of the "remnant of Edom," not because Amaziah recovered only a
portion of Edom to the kingdom ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007).md), as Hitzig supposes, but with an
allusion to the threat in [Amo 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md),
that Edom would be destroyed with the exception of a remnant. The
"remnant of Edom" consists of those who are saved in the judgments that
fall upon Edom. This also applies to כּל־הגּוים. Even of these nations,
only those are taken by Israel, i.e., incorporated into the restored
kingdom of David, the Messianic kingdom, upon whom the name of Jehovah
is called; that is to say, not those who were first brought under the
dominion of the nation in the time of David (Hitzig, Baur, and Hofmann),
but those to whom He shall have revealed His divine nature, and
manifested Himself as a God and Saviour (compare [Isa
63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md); [Jer
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009.md), and the remarks on [Deu
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#010).md), so that this expression is
practically the same as אשׁר יהוה קרא (whom Jehovah shall call) in [Joe
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#005.md). The perfect נקרא acquires the
sense of the futurum exactum from the leading sentence, as in [Deu
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#010) (see Ewald, 346, c.md). יירשׁוּ, to
take possession of, is chosen with reference to the prophecy of Balaam
([Num 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#018).md), that Edom should be the
possession of Israel (see the comm. on this passage). Consequently the
taking possession referred to here will be of a very different character
from the subjugation of Edom and other nations to David. It will make
the nations into citizens of the kingdom of God, to whom the Lord
manifests Himself as their God, pouring upon them all the blessings of
His covenant of grace (see [Isa
56:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006).md). To strengthen this promise,
נאם יי וגו ("saith Jehovah, that doeth this") is appended. He who says
this is the Lord, who will also accomplish it (see [Jer
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002).md).

The explanation given above is also in harmony with the use made by
James of our prophecy in [Act
15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016.md), where he derives from [Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md) and [Amo
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md) a prophetic testimony to the fact
that Gentiles who became believers were to be received into the kingdom
of God without circumcision. It is true that at first sight James
appears to quote the words of the prophet simply as a prophetic
declaration in support of the fact related by Peter, namely, that by
giving His Holy Spirit to believers from among the Gentiles as well as
to believers from among the Jews, without making any distinction between
Jews and Gentiles, God had taken out of the Gentiles a people ἐπὶ τῶ
ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ, "upon His name" (compare [Act
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014.md) with [Act
15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008).md). But as both James and Peter
recognise in this fact a practical declaration on the part of God that
circumcision was not a necessary prerequisite to the reception of the
Gentiles into the kingdom of Christ, while James follows up the allusion
to this fact with the prophecy of Amos, introducing it with the words,
"and to this agree the words of the prophets," there can be no doubt
that James also quotes the words of the prophet with the intention of
adducing evidence out of the Old Testament in support of the reception
of the Gentiles into the kingdom of God without circumcision. But this
proof is not furnished by the statement of the prophet, "through its
silence as to the condition required by those who were pharisaically
disposed" (Hengstenberg); and still less by the fact that it declares in
the most striking way "what significance there was in the typical
kingdom of David, as a prophecy of the relation in which the human race,
outside the limits of Israel, would stand to the kingdom of Christ"
(Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, ii. 2, pp. 84, 85). For the passage would
contain nothing extraordinary concerning the typical significance
possessed by the kingdom of David in relation to the kingdom of Christ,
if, as Hofmann says (p. 84), the prophet, instead of enumerating all the
nations which once belonged to the kingdom of David, simply mentions
Edom by name, and describes all the others as the nations which have
been subject like Edom to the name of Jehovah. The demonstrative force
of the prophet's statement is to be found, no doubt, as Hofmann admits,
in the words כּל־הגּוים אשׁר נקרא שׁמי עליהם. But if these words
affirmed nothing more than what Hofmann finds in them - namely, that all
the nations subdued by David were subjected to the name of Jehovah; or,
as he says at p. 83, "made up, in connection with Israel, the kingdom of
Jehovah and His anointed, without being circumcised, or being obliged to
obey the law of Israel" - their demonstrative force would simply lie in
what they do not affirm, - namely, in the fact that they say nothing
whatever about circumcision being a condition of the reception of the
Gentiles. The circumstance that the heathen nations which David brought
into subjection to his kingdom were made tributary to himself and
subject to the name of Jehovah, might indeed by typical of the fact that
the kingdom of the second David would also spread over the Gentiles;
but, according to this explanation, it would affirm nothing at all as to
the internal relation of the Gentiles to Israel in the new kingdom of
God. The Apostle James, however, quotes the words of Amos as decisive on
the point in dispute, which the apostles were considering, because in
the words, "all the nations upon whom my name is called," he finds a
prediction of what Peter has just related, - namely, that the Lord has
taken out of the heathen a people "upon His name," that is to say,
because he understands by the calling of the name of the Lord upon the
Gentiles the communication of the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles.

(Note: Moreover, James (or Luke) quotes the words of Amos according to
the lxx, even in their deviations from the Hebrew text, in the words
ὅπως ἂν ἐκζητήσωσιν οἱ κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀνθρώπων με (for which Luke has
τὸν κύριον, according to Cod. Al.), which rest upon an interchange of
למען יירשׁוּ את־שׁארית אדום with למען ידרשׁוּ שׁארית אדם; because the
thought upon which it turned was not thereby altered, inasmuch as the
possession of the Gentiles, of which the prophet is speaking, is the
spiritual sway of the people of the Lord, which can only extend over
those who seek the Lord and His kingdom. The other deviations from the
original text and from the lxx (compare [Act
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016.md) with [Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md) may be explained on the ground
that the apostle is quoting from memory, and that he alters ἐν τῆ ἡμερᾶ
ἐκείνη ἀναστήσω into μετὰ ταῦτα ἀναστρέψω καὶ ἀνοικοδομήσω, to give
greater clearness to the allusion contained in the prnophecy to the
Messianic times.)

[Amos 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 9:13</span></span>

To the setting up of the kingdom and its outward extension the prophet
appends its inward glorification, foretelling the richest blessing of
the land ([Amo 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013).md) and of the nation
([Amo 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014).md), and lastly, the eternal
duration of the kingdom ([Amo 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015).md).
[Amo 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md). "Behold, days come, is the
saying of Jehovah, that the ploughman reaches to the reaper, and the
treader of grapes to the sower of seed; and the mountains drip new wine,
and all the hills melt away. [Amo
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014.md). And I reverse the captivity of
my people Israel, and they build the waste cities, and dwell, and plant
vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; and make gardens, and eat the
fruit thereof. [Amo 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015.md). And I plant
them in their land, and they shall no more be torn up out of their land
which I have given them, saith Jehovah thy God." In the new kingdom of
God the people of the Lord will enjoy the blessing, which Moses promised
to Israel when faithful to the covenant. This blessing will be poured
upon the land in which the kingdom is set up. [Amo
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md) is formed after the promise in
[Lev 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005.md), "Your threshing shall reach
unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing-time;" but
Amos transfers the action to the persons employed, and says, "The
ploughman will reach to the reaper." Even while the one is engaged in
ploughing the land for the sowing, the other will already be able to cut
ripe corn; so quickly will the corn grow and ripen. And the treading of
the grapes will last to the sowing-time, so abundant will the vintage
be. The second half of the verse is taken from [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md); and according to this passage,
the melting of the hills is to be understood as dissolving into streams
of milk, new wine, and honey, in which the prophet had the description
of the promised land as a land flowing with milk and honey ([Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008), etc..md) floating before his mind.
In the land so blessed will Israel enjoy unbroken peace, and delight
itself in the fruits of its inheritance. On שׁוּב את־שׁבוּת, see the
exposition of [Hos 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md). That this
phrase is not used here to denote the return of the people from
captivity, but the turning of misfortune and misery into prosperity and
salvation, is evident from the context; for Israel cannot be brought
back out of captivity after it has already taken possession of the
Gentiles ([Amo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012).md). The thought of
[Amo 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014.md), as attached to [Amo
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md), is the following: As the land of
Israel, i.e., the territory of the re-erected kingdom of David, will no
more be smitten with the curse of drought and failing crops with which
the rebellious are threatened, but will receive the blessing of the
greatest fertility, so will the people, i.e., the citizens of this
kingdom, be no more visited with calamity and judgment, but enjoy the
rich beneficent fruits of their labour in blessed and unbroken peace.
This thought is individualized with a retrospective glance at the
punishment with which the sinners are threatened in [Amo
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md), - namely, as building waste
cities, and dwelling therein, and as drinking the wine of the vineyards
that have been planted; not building houses for others any more, as was
threatened in [Amo 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md), after [Deu
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030.md), [Deu
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#039.md); and lastly, as laying out
gardens, and eating the fruit thereof, without its being consumed by
strangers ([Deu 28:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033).md). This blessing
will endure for ever ([Amo 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015).md).
Their being planted in their land denotes, not the settling of the
people in their land once more, but their firm and lasting establishment
and fortification therein. The Lord will make Israel, i.e., His rescued
people, into a plantation that will never be torn up again, but strikes
firm roots, sends forth blossom, and produces fruit. The words point
back to [Sa2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010.md), and declare that
the firm planting of Israel which was begun by David will be completed
with the raising up of the fallen hut of David, inasmuch as no further
driving away of the nation into captivity will occur, but the people of
the Lord will dwell for ever in the land which their God has given them.
Compare [Jer 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006.md). This promise is
sealed by אמר יי אל.

We have not to seek for the realization of this promise in the return of
Israel from its captivity to Palestine under Zerubbabel and Ezra; for
this was no planting of Israel to dwell for ever in the land, nor was it
a setting up of the fallen hut of David. Nor have we to transfer the
fulfilment to the future, and think of a time when the Jews, who have
been converted to their God and Saviour Jesus Christ, will one day be
led back to Palestine. For, as we have already observed at [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md), Canaan and Israel are types of
the kingdom of God and of the church of the Lord. The raising up of the
fallen hut of David commenced with the coming of Christ and the founding
of the Christian church by the apostles; and the possession of Edom and
all the other nations upon whom the Lord reveals His name, took its rise
in the reception of the Gentiles into the kingdom of heaven set up by
Christ. The founding and building of this kingdom continue through all
the ages of the Christian church, and will be completed when the fulness
of the Gentiles shall one day enter into the kingdom of God, and the
still unbelieving Israel shall have been converted to Christ. The land
which will flow with streams of divine blessing is not Palestine, but
the domain of the Christian church, or the earth, so far as it has
received the blessings of Christianity. The people which cultivates this
land is the Christian church, so far as it stands in living faith, and
produces fruits of the Holy Ghost. The blessing foretold by the prophet
is indeed visible at present in only a very small measure, because
Christendom is not yet so pervaded by the Spirit of the Lord, as that it
forms a holy people of God. In many respects it still resembles Israel,
which the Lord will have to sift by means of judgments. This sifting
will be first brought to an end through the judgment upon all nations,
which will attend the second coming of Christ. Then will the earth
become a Canaan, where the Lord will dwell in His glorified kingdom in
the midst of His sanctified people.
