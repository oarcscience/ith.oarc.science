Blessing of the Land of Canaan, and Distribution of It Among the Tribes
of Israel - Ezekiel 47-48

After Ezekiel had seen the entrance of the glory of the Lord into the
new temple, which was measured before his eyes, and had received the new
thorah to be announced to the people concerning the service which Israel
was to render to its God in the new sanctuary, a stream of living water
was shown to him, proceeding from the threshold of the temple, flowing
to the Arabah, and emptying itself into the Dead Sea, to fertilize the
barren soil, and fill the salt water of the Dead Sea with vital power
([Eze 47:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001).md); and finally, the
command of the Lord is communicated to him concerning the boundaries of
the holy land, its distribution among the twelve tribes of Israel, and
the building of the holy city (Ezekiel 47:13-48:35).

The River of Water of Life

When Jehovah shall have judged all the heathen in the valley of
Jehoshaphat, and shall dwell as King of His people upon Zion His holy
mountain, then will the mountains trickle with new wine, and the hills
run with milk, and all the brooks of Judah flow with water; and a spring
will proceed from the house of Jehovah, and water the Acacia valley.
With these figures Joel (Joel 4:18) has already described the river of
salvation, which the Lord would cause to flow to His congregation in the
time when the kingdom of God shall be perfected. This picture of the
Messianic salvation shapes itself in the case of our prophet into the
magnificent vision contained in the section before us.

(Note: Compare W. Neumann, Die Wasser des Lebens. An exegetical study on
[Eze 47:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001). Berlin, 1848..md)

[Eze 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md). And he led me back to the
door of the house, and, behold, water flowed out from under the
threshold of the house toward the east, for the front side of the house
was toward the east; and the water flowed down from below, from the
right shoulder of the house on the south of the altar. [Eze
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#002.md). And he led me out by the way of
the north gate, and caused me to go round about on the outside, to the
outer gate of the way to the (gate), looking toward the east; and,
behold, waters rippled for the right shoulder of the gate. [Eze
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#003.md). When the man went out toward the
east, he had a measuring line in his hand, and he measured a thousand
cubits, and caused me to go through the water-water to the ankles. [Eze
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#004.md). And he measured a thousand, and
caused me to go through the water-water to the knees; and he measured a
thousand, and caused me to go through-water to the hips. [Eze
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#005.md). And he measured a thousand-a
river through which I could not walk, for the water was high, water to
swim in, a river which could not be forded. [Eze
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#006.md). And he said to me, Hast thou
seen it, son of man? and he led me back again by the bank of the river.
[Eze 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#007.md). When I returned, behold,
there stood on the bank of the river very many trees on this side and on
that. [Eze 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008.md). And he said to me,
This water flows out into the eastern circle, and runs down into the
plain, and reaches the sea; into the sea is it carried out, that the
waters may become wholesome. [Eze
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#009.md). And it will come to pass, every
living thing with which it swarms everywhere, whither the double river
comes, will live, and there will be very many fishes; for when this
water comes thither they will become wholesome, and everything will live
whither the river comes. [Eze 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010.md).
And fishermen will stand by it, from Engedi to Eneglaim they will spread
out nets; after their kind will there be fishes therein, like the fishes
of the great sea, very many. [Eze
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#011.md). Its marshes and its swamps,
they will not become wholesome, they will be given up to salt. [Eze
47:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012.md). And by the river will all kinds
of trees of edible fruit grow on its bank, on this side and on that;
their leaves will not wither, and their fruits will not fail; every moon
they will bear ripe fruit, for its water flows out of its sanctuary. And
their fruits will serve as food, and their leaves as medicine.

From the outer court, where Ezekiel had been shown the sacrificial
kitchens for the people ([Eze 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#021)..md),
he is taken back to the front of the door of the temple house, to be
shown a spring of water, flowing out from under the threshold of the
temple, which has swollen in the short course of four thousand cubits
from its source into a deep river in which men can swim, and which flows
down to the Jordan valley, to empty itself into the Dead Sea. In [Eze
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md) and [Eze
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#002.md), the origin and course of this
water are described; in [Eze 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#003.md) and
[Eze 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#005.md), its marvellous increase; in
[Eze 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#006.md), the growth of trees on its
banks; in [Eze 47:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#007.md), its emptying
itself into the Arabah and into the Dead Sea, with the life-giving power
of its water. - [Eze 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md). The door of
the house is the entrance into the holy place of the temple, and מפתּן
הבּית the threshold of this door. קדימה, not "in the east" (Hitzig), for
the following sentence explaining the reason does not require this
meaning; but "toward the east" of the threshold, which lay toward the
east, for the front of the temple was in the east. מתּחת is not to be
connected with מכּתף, but to be taken by itself, only not in the sense
of downwards (Hitzig), but from beneath, namely, down from the right
shoulder of the house. ירד, to flow down, because the temple stood on
higher ground than the inner court. The right shoulder is the part of
the eastern wall of the holy place between the door and the pillars, the
breadth of which was five cubits ([Eze
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001).md). The water therefore issued from
the corner formed by the southern wall of the porch and the eastern wall
of the holy place (see the sketch on Plate I), and flowed past the altar
of burnt-offering on the south side, and crossed the court in an
easterly direction, passing under its surrounding wall. It then flowed
across the outer court and under the pavement and the eastern wall into
the open country, where the prophet, on the outside in front of the
gate, saw it rippling forth from the right shoulder of that gate. That
he might do this, he was led out through the north gate, because the
east gate was shut ([Eze 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001).md), and
round by the outside wall to the eastern outer gate. דּרך חוּץ is more
minutely defined by אל־שׁער החוּץ, and this, again, by דּרך הפּונה קדים,
"by the way to the (gate) looking eastwards." The ἁπ. λεγ. ּרך̓̀ינבל;,
Piel of פּכה, related to בּכה, most probably signifies to ripple, not to
trickle. מים has no article, because it is evident from the context that
the water was the same as that which Ezekiel had seen in the inner
court, issuing from the threshold of the temple. The right shoulder is
that portion of the eastern wall which joined the south side of the
gate. - [Eze 47:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#003.md). The miraculous
increase in the depth of the water. A thousand cubits from the wall, as
one walked through, it reached to the ankles; a thousand cubits further,
to the knees; a thousand cubits further, to the hips; and after going
another thousand cubits it was impossible to wade through, one could
only swim therein. The words מי אפסים are a brief expression for "there
was water which reached to the ankles." אפס is equivalent to פּס, an
ankle, not the sole of the foot. In [Ch1
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#013.md), on the other hand, we have פּס
דּמּים for אפס דּמּים . The striking expression מים בּרכים for מי ברכים
may possibly have been chosen because מי ברכים had the same meaning as
מימי רגלים in [Isa 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#012) (Keri.md). The
measuring man directed the prophet's attention ([Eze
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#006).md) to this extraordinary increase
in the stream of water, because the miraculous nature of the stream was
exhibited therein. A natural river could not increase to such an extent
within such short distances, unless, indeed, other streams emptied
themselves into it on all sides, which was not he case here. He then
directed him to go back again על שׂפת, along the bank, not "to the
bank," as he had never left it. The purpose for which he had been led
along the bank was accomplished after he had gone four thousand cubits.
From the increase in the water, as measured up to this point, he could
infer what depth it would reach in its further course. He is therefore
now to return along the bank to see how it is covered with trees.
בּשׁוּבני cannot be explained in any other way than as an incorrect form
for בּשׁוּבי, though there are no corresponding analogies to be found.

In [Eze 47:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008.md) he gives him a still
further explanation of the course of the river and the effect of its
waters. The river flows out into הגּלילה הקּדמונה, the eastern circle,
which is identical with גּלילות היּרדּן htiw lacitne, the circle of the
Jordan ([Jos 22:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#010).md), the region
above the Dead Sea, where the Jordan valley (Ghor) widens out into a
broad, deep basin. הערבה is the deep valley of the Jordan, now called
the Ghor (see the comm. on [Deu 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001).md),
of which Robinson says that the greater part remains a desolate
wilderness. It was so described in ancient times (see Joseph. Bell. Jud.
iii. 10. 7, iv. 8. 2), and we find it so to-day (compare v. Raumer, Pal.
p. 58). היּמּה is the Dead Sea, called היּם הקּדמוני in [Eze
47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md), and the sea of the Arabah in
[Deu 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017.md); [Deu
4:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#049.md). We agree with Hengstenberg in
taking the words אל־היּמּה המּוּצאים as an emphatic summing up of the
previous statement concerning the outflow of the water, to which the
explanation concerning its effect upon the Dead Sea is attached, and
supply בּאוּ from the clause immediately preceding: "the waters of the
river that have been brought out (come) to the sea, and the waters of
the Dead Sea are healed." There is no need, therefore, for the
emendation proposed by Hitzig, namely, אל היּם הם מוּצאים. So much,
however, is beyond all doubt, that היּמּה is no other than the Dead Sea
already mentioned. The supposition that it is the Mediterranean Sea
(Chald., Ros., Ewald, and others) cannot be reconciled with the words,
and has only been transferred to this passage from [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md). נרפּא signifies, as in [Kg2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#022.md), the healing or rendering
wholesome of water that is injurious or destructive to life. The
character of the Dead Sea, with which the ancients were also well
acquainted, and of which Tacitus writes as follows: Lacus immenso
ambitu, specie maris sapore corruptior, gravitate odoris accolis
pestifer, neque vento impellitur neque pisces aut suetas aquis volucres
patitur (Hist. v. c. 6), - a statement confirmed by all modern
travellers (cf. v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 61ff., and Robinson, Physical
Geography of the Holy Land), - is regarded as a disease of the water,
which is healed or turned into wholesome water in which fishes can live,
by the water of the river proceeding from the sanctuary. The healing and
life-giving effect of this river upon the Dead Sea is described in [Eze
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#009.md) and [Eze
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010.md). Whithersoever the waters of the
river come, all animated beings will come to life and flourish.

In [Eze 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#009.md) the dual נחלים occasions
some difficulty. It is not likely that the dual should have been used
merely for the sake of its resemblance to מים, as Maurer imagines; and
still less probable is it that there is any allusion to a junction of
the river proceeding from the temple at some point in its course with
the Kedron, which also flows into the Dead Sea (Hvernick), as the Kedron
is not mentioned either before or afterwards. According to Kliefoth, the
dual is intended to indicate a division which takes place in the waters
of the river, that have hitherto flowed on together, as soon as they
enter the sea. But this would certainly have been expressed more
clearly. Hengstenberg takes the expression "double river" to mean a
river with a strong current, and refers to [Jer
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021.md) in support of this. This is
probably the best explanation; for nothing is gained by altering the
text into נחלם (Ewald) or נחלים (Hitzig), as נחל does not require
definition by means of a suffix, nor doe the plural answer to the
context. is to be taken in connection with אשׁר ישׁרץ: "wherewith it
swarms whithersoever the river comes;" though אל does not stand for על
after [Gen 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#021.md), as Hitzig supposes,
but is to be explained from a species of attraction, as in [Gen
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#013.md). יחיה is a pregnant expression,
to revive, to come to life. The words are not to be understood, however,
as meaning that there were living creatures in the Dead Sea before the
health-giving water flowed into it; the thought is simply, that
whithersoever the waters of the river come, there come into existence
living creatures in the Dead Sea, so that it swarms with them. In
addition to the שׁרץ, the quantity of fish is specially mentioned; and
in the second hemistich the reason is assigned for the number of living
creatures that come into existence by a second allusion to the
health-giving power of the water of the river. The subject to וירפאוּ,
viz., the waters of the Dead Sea, is to be supplied from the context.
The great abundance of fish in the Dead Sea produced by the river is
still further depicted in [Eze 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010.md).
Fishermen will spread their nets along its coast from Engedi to
Eneglaim; and as for their kind, there will be as many kinds of fish
there as are to be found in the great or Mediterranean Sea. עין גּדי,
i.e., Goat's spring, now Ain-Jidi, a spring in the middle of the west
coast of the Dead Sea, with ruins of several ancient buildings (see the
comm. on [Jos 15:62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062.md), and v. Raumer,
Pal. p. 188). עין עגלים has not yet been discovered, though, from the
statement of Jerome, "Engallim is at the beginning of the Dead Sea,
where the Jordan enters it," it has been conjectured that it is to be
found in Ain el-Feshkhah, a spring at the northern end of the west
coast, where there are also ruins of a small square tower and other
buildings to be seen (vid., Robinson's Palestine, II pp. 491, 492), as
none of the other springs on the west coast, of which there are but few,
answer so well as this. למינה is pointed without Mappik, probably
because the Masoretes did not regard the ה as a suffix, as the noun to
which it alludes does not follow till afterwards. - [Eze
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#011.md) introduces an exception, namely,
that notwithstanding this the Dead Sea will still retain marshes or
pools and swamps, which will not be made wholesome (בּצּאת for בּצּות,
pools). An allusion to the natural character of the Dead Sea underlies
the words. "In the rainy season, when the sea is full, its waters
overspread many low tracts of marsh land, which remain after the
receding of the water in the form of moist pools or basins; and as the
water in these pools evaporates rapidly, the ground becomes covered with
a thick crust of salt" (Robinson's Physical Geography, p. 215). למלח
נתּנוּ, they are given up to salt, i.e., destined to remain salt,
because the waters of the river do not reach them. The light in which
the salt is regarded here is not that of its seasoning properties, but,
in the words of Hengstenberg, "as the foe to all fruitfulness, all life
and prosperity, as Pliny has said (Hist. Nat. xxxi. c. 7: Omnis locus,
in quo reperitur sal, sterilis est nihilque gignit") (cf. [Deu
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022.md); [Jer
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md); [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009.md); [Psa
107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034).md). - In [Eze
47:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012.md) the effect of the water of the
river upon the vegetation of the ground, already mentioned in [Eze
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#007.md), is still further described. On
its coast grow all kinds of trees with edible fruits (עץ מאכל, as in
[Lev 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023).md), whose leaves do not
wither, and whose fruits do not fail, but ripen every month (בּכּר, or
produce first-fruits, i.e., fresh fruits; and לחדשׁים distributive, as
in [Isa 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#013).md), because the waters
which moisten the soil proceed from the sanctuary, i.e., "directly and
immediately from the dwelling-place of Him who is the author of all
vital power and fruitfulness" (Hitzig). The leaves and fruits of these
trees therefore possess supernatural powers. The fruits serve as food,
i.e., for the maintenance of the life produced by the river of water;
the leaves as medicine (תּרוּפה from רוּף = רפא, healing), i.e., for the
healing of the sick and corrupt (εἰς θεραπείαν, [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002).md).

In the effect of the water proceeding from the sanctuary upon the Dead
Sea and the land on its shores, as described in [Eze
47:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008.md), the significance of this
stream of water in relation to the new kingdom of God is implied. If,
then, the question be asked, what we are to understand by this water,
whether we are to take it in a literal sense as the temple spring, or in
a spiritual and symbolical sense, the complete answer can only be given
in connection with the interpretation of the whole of the temple vision
(Ezekiel 40-48). Even if we assume for the moment, however, that the
description of the new temple, with the worship appointed for it, and
the fresh division of Canaan, is to be understood literally, and
therefore that the building of an earthly temple upon a high mountain in
the most holy terumah of the land set apart for Jehovah, and a renewal
of the bleeding sacrifices in this temple by the twelve tribes of
Israel, when restored to Palestine from the heathen lands, are to be
taken for granted, it would be difficult to combine with this a literal
interpretation of what is said concerning the effect of the temple
spring. It is true that in Volck's opinion "we are to think of a
glorification of nature;" but even this does not remove the difficulties
which stand in the way of a literal interpretation of the temple spring.
According to [Eze 47:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012.md), its waters
posses the life-giving and healing power ascribed to them because they
issue from the sanctuary. But how does the possession by the water of
the power to effect the glorification of nature harmonize with its
issuing from a temple in which bullocks, rams, calves, and goats are
slaughtered and sacrificed? - Volck is still further of opinion that,
with the spiritual interpretation of the temple spring, "nothing at all
could be made of the fishermen;" because, for example, he cannot
conceive of the spiritual interpretation in any other way than as an
allegorical translation of all the separate features of the prophetic
picture into spiritual things. But he has failed to consider that the
fishermen with their nets on the shore of the sea, once dead, but now
swarming with fish, are irreconcilably opposed to the assumption of a
glorification of nature in the holy land, just because the inhabitants
of the globe or holy land, in its paradisaically glorified state, will
no more eat fish or other flesh, according to the teaching of Scripture,
than the first men in Paradise. When once the wolf shall feed with the
lamb, the leopard with the kid, the cow with the bear, and the lion
shall eat straw like the ox, under the sceptre of the sprout from the
stem of Jesse, then will men also cease their fishing, and no longer
slaughter and eat either oxen or goats. To this the Israelites will form
no exception in their glorified land of Canaan. - And if even these
features in the vision before us decidedly favour the figurative or
spiritual view of the temple spring, the necessity for this explanation
is placed beyond the reach of doubt by a comparison of our picture with
the parallel passages. According to Joel 4:18, at the time when a spring
issues from the house of Jehovah and the vale of Shittim is watered, the
mountains trickle with new wine, and the hills run with milk. If, then,
in this case we understand what is affirmed of the temple spring
literally, the trickling of the mountains with new wine and the flowing
of the hills with milk must be taken literally as well. But we are
unable to attain to the belief that in the glorified land of Israel the
mountains will be turned into springs of new wine, and the hills into
fountains of milk, and in the words of the whole verse we can discern
nothing but a figurative description of the abundant streams of blessing
which will then pour over the entire land. And just as in Joel the
context points indisputably to a non-literal or figurative explanation,
so also does the free manner in which Zechariah uses this prophecy of
his predecessors, speaking only of living waters which issue from
Jerusalem, and flow half into the eastern (i.e., the Dead) sea, and half
into the western (i.e., the Mediterranean) sea ([Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008).md), show that he was not thinking
of an actual spring with earthly water. And here we are still
provisionally passing by the application made of this feature in the
prophetic descriptions of the glory of the new kingdom of God in the
picture of the heavenly Jerusalem ([Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md) and [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002).md).

The figurative interpretation, or spiritual explanation, is moreover
favoured by the analogy of the Scriptures. "Water," which renders the
unfruitful land fertile, and supplies refreshing drink to the thirsty,
is used in Scripture as a figure denoting blessing and salvation, which
had been represented even in Paradise in the form of watering (cf. [Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010).md). In [Isa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003.md), "and with joy ye draw water from
the wells of salvation," the figure is expressly interpreted. And so
also in [Isa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md), "I will pour water
upon the thirsty one, and streams upon the desert; I will pour my Spirit
upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:" where the blessing
answers to the water, the Spirit is named as the principal form in which
the blessing is manifested, "the foundation of all other salvation for
the people of God" (Hengstenberg). This salvation, which Joel had
already described as a spring issuing from the house of Jehovah and
watering the dry acacia valley, Ezekiel saw in a visionary embodiment as
water, which sprang from under the threshold of the temple into which
the glory of the Lord entered, and had swollen at a short distance off
into so mighty a river that it was no longer possible to wade through.
In this way the thought is symbolized, that the salvation which the Lord
causes to flow down to His people from His throne will pour down from
small beginnings in marvellously increasing fulness. The river flows on
into the barren, desolate waste of the Ghor, and finally into the Dead
Sea, and makes the waters thereof sound, so that it swarms with fishes.
The waste is a figure denoting the spiritual drought and desolation, and
the Dead Sea a symbol of the death caused by sin. The healing and
quickening of the salt waters of that sea, so fatal to all life, set
forth the power of that divine salvation which conquers death, and the
calling to life of the world sunk in spiritual death. From this comes
life in its creative fulness and manifold variety, as shown both by the
figure of the fishermen who spread their nets along the shore, and by
the reference to the kinds of fish, which are as manifold in their
variety as those in the great sea. But life extends no further than the
water of salvation flows. Wherever it cannot reach, the world continues
to life in death. The pools and swamps of the Dead Sea are still given
up to salt. And lastly, the water of salvation also possesses the power
to produce trees with leaves and fruits, by which the life called forth
from death can be sustained and cured of all diseases. This is the
meaning, according to the express statement of the text, of the trees
with their never withering leaves, upon the banks of the river, and
their fruits ripening every month.

[Ezekiel 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 47:13</span></span>

Boundaries of the Land to be Divided among the Tribes of Israel.

[Eze 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md). Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, This is the boundary according to which ye shall divide the
land among you for an inheritance, for Joseph portions. [Eze
47:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#014.md). And ye shall receive it for an
inheritance, one as well as another, because I lifted up my hand to give
it to your fathers; and thus shall this land fall to you for an
inheritance. [Eze 47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md). And this is
the boundary of the land: toward the north side, from the great sea
onwards by the way to Chetlon, in the direction of Zedad; [Eze
47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md). Hamath, Berotah, Sibraim, which
is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Hamath, the
central Hazer, which is on the boundary of Haruan. [Eze
47:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#017.md). And the boundary from the sea
shall be Hazar-Enon, the boundary town of Damascus; and as for the north
northwards, Hamath is the boundary. This, the north side. [Eze
47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md). And the east side between
Hauran and Damascus and Gilead and the land of Israel, shall be the
Jordan; from the boundary to the eastern sea ye shall measure. This, the
east side. [Eze 47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019.md). And the south
side toward the south; from Tamar to the water of strife, Kadesh, along
the brook to the great sea. This, the south side toward the south. [Eze
47:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#020.md). And the west side; the great
sea from the boundary to Hamath. This, the west side. [Eze
47:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#021.md). This land shall ye divide among
you according to the tribes of Israel. [Eze
47:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#022.md). And it shall come to pass, ye
shall divide it by lot among yourselves for an inheritance, and among
the foreigners who dwell in the midst of you, who have begotten sons in
the midst of you; they shall be to you like natives born among the sons
of Israel; they shall cast lots with you for an inheritance among the
tribes of Israel. [Eze 47:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#023.md). And it
shall come to pass, in the tribe in which the foreigner dwells, there
shall ye give him his inheritance, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.

The fixing of the boundary of the land which Israel was to divide in
future according to its twelve tribes is commenced ([Eze
47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md) and [Eze
47:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#014).md) and concluded ([Eze
47:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#022.md) and [Eze
47:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#023).md) with certain general statements
concerning the distribution. The introductory statements are attached to
the heading "this is the boundary," which is therefore repeated in [Eze
47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md). גּה is evidently a copyist's
error for זה, which is adopted by all the older translators, contained
in some Codd., and demanded by וזה in [Eze
47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md). גּבוּל stands here for the
whole of the boundary of the land to be distributed; and אשׁר which
follows is an accusative, "according to which." - "According to the
twelve tribes," - for all Israel is to return and dwell as one people of
God under one prince in its own land ([Eze
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#024.md)., [Eze
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021)..md). But the division among the
twelve tribes is more precisely defined immediately afterwards by the
clause abruptly appended, "Joseph portions," i.e., two portions for
Joseph. There can be no doubt that this is the meaning of the words in
accordance with [Gen 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022.md) and [Jos
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014.md), [Jos
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#017.md). Hence the notice-like form of
the expression, which should not be obliterated by pointing חבלים as a
dual, חבלים. If the land was to be divided by lot according to twelve
tribes, and the tribe of Levi was to receive its portion from the
terumah which was set apart, Joseph must necessarily receive two
hereditary portions for his sons Ephraim and Manasseh, in accordance
with the appointment of the patriarch in [Gen
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022.md). The commencement of [Eze
47:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#014.md) is not at variance with this, as
Hitzig imagines; for the words, "ye shall receive it for an inheritance,
one as another," simply affirm, that of the twelve tribes reckoned by
Israel in relation to the נחלה, all were to receive equal shares, the
one as much as the other. As the reason for this command to divide the
land, allusion is made to the oath with which God promised to give this
land to the fathers (cf. [Eze 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#028).md).

The definition of the boundaries commences with [Eze
47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md). In form it differs in many
points from [Num 34:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001.md), but in actual
fact it is in harmony with the Mosaic definition. In Num 34 the
description commences with the southern boundary, then proceeds to the
western and northern boundaries, and closes with the eastern. In Ezekiel
it commences with the northern boundary and proceeds to the east, the
south, and the west. This difference may be explained in a very simple
manner, from the fact that the Israelites in the time of Moses came from
Egypt i.e., marching from the south, and stood by the south-eastern
boundary of the land, whereas at this time they were carried away into
the northern lands Assyria and Babylon, and were regarded as returning
thence. Again, in Ezekiel the boundaries are described much more briefly
than in Num 34, the northern boundary alone being somewhat more
circumstantially described. The course which it takes is represented in
a general manner in [Eze 47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md) as
running from the great sea, i.e., the Mediterranean, by the way to
Chetlon, in the direction toward Zedad. In [Eze
47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md) and [Eze
47:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#017.md) there follow the places which
formed the boundary. The starting-point on the Mediterranean Sea can
only be approximately determined, as the places mentioned, Chetlon and
Zedad, are still unknown. Not only Chetlon, but Zedad also, has not yet
been discovered. The city of Sadad (Sudud), to the east of the road
leading from Damascus to Hums (Emesa), which Robinson and Wetzstein
suppose to be the same, lies much too far toward the east to be used in
defining the boundary either here or in [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008.md) (see the comm. on [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008).md). Among the names enumerated in
[Eze 47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md), חמת is not the city of
Hamah on the Orontes, which lay much too far to the north, but the
kingdom of Hamath, the southern boundary of which formed the northern
boundary of Canaan, though it cannot be given with exactness. Berothah
is probably identical with Berothai in [Sa2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008.md), a city of the king of Zobah; but
the situation of it is still unknown. Sibraim may perhaps be identical
with Ziphron in [Num 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#009.md), which has
also not yet been discovered, and is not to be sought for in the ruins
of Zifran, to the north-east of Damascus, near the road to Palmyra; for
that place could not form the boundary of Damascus and Hamath. The
situation of the "central Hazer" has also not yet been determined.
Hauran, on the boundary of which it stood, is used here in a more
comprehensive sense that ̓Αυρανῖτις in Josephus and other Greek authors,
and includes the later Auranitis, together with Gaulanitis (Golan) and
Batanaea (Bashan), and probably also Ituraea, as only Damascus and
Gilead are named in [Eze 47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md) in
addition to Hauran, on the east side of the Jordan; so that the whole
tract of land between the territory of Damascus and the country of
Gilead is embraced by the name Hauran. חורן, Arab. Hawrân, is derived
from the number of caves (חור, חוּר) in that district, to which
Wetzstein (Reiseber. p. 92) indeed raises the objection that with the
exception of the eastern and south-eastern Hauran, where no doubt most
of the volcanic hills have been perforated by troglodytes, the dwellings
in caves are by no means common in that region. But the name may have
originated in this eastern district, and possibly have included even
that portion of Gilead which was situated to the north of the Jabbok,
namely, Erbed and Sut, the true cave-country. For further remarks
concerning these districts, see the comm. on [Deu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004.md) and [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md). The statement in [Eze
47:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#017.md), "the boundary from the sea
shall be Hazar-Enon, the boundary of Damascus," cannot have any other
meaning than that the northern boundary, which started from the
Mediterranean Sea, stretched as far as Hazar-Enon, the frontier city of
Damascus, or that Hazar-Enon formed the terminal point on the east,
toward the boundary of Damascus, for the northern boundary proceeding
from the sea. חצר עינון or חצר עינן ([Num
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#009).md), i.e., spring-court, we have
endeavoured to identify in the comm. on [Num
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md) with the spring Lebweh, which
lies in the Beka at the watershed between the Orontes and the Leontes;
and the designation "the boundary of Damascus" suits the situation very
well. [Eze 47:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#017.md) has been aptly
explained by Hitzig thus, in accordance with the literal meaning of the
words, "and as for the north north-wards, Hamath is the boundary," which
he further elucidates by observing that צפונה is intended as a
supplementary note to the boundary line from west to east, which is
indicated just before. ואת פּאת צפון is a concluding formula: "this, the
north side." But ואת (here and [Eze
47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md) and [Eze
47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019).md) is not to be altered into זאת
after [Eze 47:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#020.md) and the Syriac
version, as Hitzig supposes, but to be explained, as [Eze
47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md) clearly shows, on the
supposition that Ezekiel had תּמודּוּ, "ye shall measure," floating
before his mind, to which 'ואת פ, "and that the northern boundary,"
would form a correct logical sequel.

The eastern boundary is defined in v. 18 in the same manner as in [Num
34:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010.md), except that in the latter it
is more minutely described above the Lake of Gennesaret by the mention
of several localities, whereas Ezekiel only names the Jordan as the
boundary. - פּאת , with supplementary remarks, is not to be taken as the
predicate to the subject היּרדּן, as Hitzig has correctly observed; for
the meaning of פּאה does not allow of this. The explanation is rather
this: as for the east side, between Hauran, etc. and the land of Israel,
is the Jordan. Hauran, Damascus, and Gilead lie on the east side of the
Jordan, the land of Israel on the west side. The striking circumstance
that Ezekiel commences with Hauran, which lay in the middle between
Damascus and Gilead, - Hauran, Damascus, and Gilead, instead of
Damascus, Hauran, and Gilead, - may probably be explained from the fact
that the Jordan, which he names as the boundary, for the sake of
brevity, did not extend so far upwards as to the territory of Damascus,
but simply formed the boundary of the land of Israel between Hauran and
Gilead. מגּבוּל points back to the northern boundary already mentioned.
From this boundary, the eastern terminal point of which was Hazar-Enon,
they are to measure to the eastern sea, i.e., to the Dead Sea.

[Eze 47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019.md). The southern boundary
toward the south is to proceed from Tamar to the water of strife,
Kadesh, (and thence) along the brook to the great (i.e., Mediterranean)
sea. Tamar, a different place from Hazazon-tamar, called Engedi in [Eze
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010.md) (cf. [Ch2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002).md), is supposed to be the Thamara
(Θαμαρά),

(Note: The statement runs thus: λέγεται δέ τις Θαμαρά κώμη διεστώσα
Μάψις ἡμέρας ὁδόν, ἀπιόντων ἀπὸ Χεβρὼν εἰς Αἰλάμ, ἥτις νῦν φρούριόν ἐστι
τῶν στρατιωτῶν. In Jerome: est et aliud castellum, unius diei itinere a
Mampsis oppido separatum, pergentibus Ailiam de Chebron, ubi nunc
romanum praesidium positum est. But on account of the Μάψις (Mampsis),
which is evidently a corruption, the passage is obscure. Robinson's
conjecture concerning Thamara is founded upon the assumption that the
reading should be Μάλις, and that this is the Malatha mentioned by later
writers as the station of a Roman cohort.)

which was a day's journey on the road from Hebron to Aelam (Aelath, [Deu
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#008.md); [Kg1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026).md), according to Eusebius in the
Onomast. ed. Lars. p. 68, and had a Roman garrison; and Robinson (Pal.
III pp. 178 and 186ff.) accordingly conjectures that it is to be found
in the ruins of Kurnub, which lie six hours' journey to the south of
Milh, toward the pass of es-Sufh. But this conjecture is bound up with
various assumptions of a very questionable character, and the situation
of Hurnub hardly suits the Tamar of our passage, which should be sought,
not to the west of the southern point of the Dead Sea, but, according to
the southern boundary of Canaan as drawn in [Num
34:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md), to the south of the Dead Sea.
The waters of strife of Kadesh ([Num
20:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001).md), in the desert of Zin, were
near Kadesh-barnea, which was in the neighbourhood of the spring Ain
Kades, discovered by Rowland to the south of Bir-Seba and Khalasa by the
fore-courts of Jebel Helal, i.e., at the north-west corner of the
mountain land of the Azazimeh (see the comm. on [Num
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012.md); [Num
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016.md), and [Num
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#016).md). Instead of מריבות we have the
singular מריבת in [Eze 48:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#028.md), as in
[Num 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md) and [Deu
32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051.md). נחלה is to be pointed נחלה,
from נחל with ה loc.; and the reference is to the brook of Egypt; the
great wady el-Arish ( ̔Ρινοκορουρα), along which the southern boundary
of Canaan ran from Kadesh to the Mediterranean Sea (see the comm. on
[Eze 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005).md). - [Eze
47:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#020.md). The Mediterranean Sea formed
the western boundary. מגּבוּל, i.e., from the southern boundary
mentioned in [Eze 47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019.md) till opposite
(עד) to the coming to Hamath, i.e., till opposite to the point at which
one enters the territory of Hamath (Hitzig), i.e., the spot mentioned in
[Eze 47:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#020) (? 17.md) as the commencement
of the northern boundary in the neighbourhood of the promontory of
esh-Shkah between Byblus (Gebal) and Tripolis. - [Eze
47:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#021.md). This land they are to divide
among them according to their tribes. With this remark, which points
back to [Eze 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md), the definition of
the boundaries is brought to a close. There is simply added in [Eze
47:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#022.md) and [Eze
47:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#023.md) a further regulation concerning
the foreigners living in Israel. The law of Moses had already repeatedly
urged upon the Israelites affectionate treatment of them, and in [Lev
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#034.md) the command is given to treat
them like natives in this respect, and to love them. But the full right
of citizenship was not thereby conceded to them, so that they could also
acquire property in land. The land was given to the Israelites alone for
an hereditary possession. Foreigners could only be incorporated into the
congregation of Israel under the limitations laid down in [Deu
23:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002.md), by the reception of
circumcision. But in the future distribution of the land, on the
contrary, the גּרים were to receive hereditary property like native-born
Israelites; and in this respect no difference was to exist between the
members of the people of God born of Abraham's seed and those born of
the heathen. At the same time, this right was not to be conferred upon
every foreigner who might be only temporarily living in Israel, but to
those alone who should beget sons in the midst of Israel, i.e., settle
permanently in the holy land. The Kal יפּלוּ is not to be altered into
the Hiphil תּפּילוּ, as Hitzig proposes, but is used in the sense of
receiving by lot, derived from the Hiphil signification, "to apportion
by lot."
