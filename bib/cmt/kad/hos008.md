### [Hosea Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 8:0</span></span>

The Judgment Consequent Upon Apostasy - Hosea 8-9:9

The coming judgment, viz., the destruction of the kingdom of the ten
tribes, is predicted in three strophes, containing a fresh enumeration
of the sins of Israel (1-7), a reference to the fall of the kingdom,
which is already about to commence ([Hos
8:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#008).md), and a warning against false
security ([Hos 9:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001).md).

[Hosea 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 8:1</span></span>

The prophecy rises with a vigorous swing, as in [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md), to the prediction of judgment.
[Hos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md). "The trumpet to thy mouth!
Like an eagle upon the house of Jehovah! Because they transgressed my
covenant, and trespassed against my law. [Hos
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002.md). To me will they cry: My God, we
know Thee, we Israel!" The first sentence of [Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md) is an exclamation, and therefore
has no verb. The summons issues from Jehovah, as the suffixes in the
last sentences show, and is addressed to the prophet, who is to blow the
trumpet, as the herald of Jehovah, and give the people tidings of the
approaching judgment (see at [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008).md). The second sentence gives the
alarming message to be delivered: like an eagle comes the foe, or the
judgment upon the house of Jehovah. The simile of the eagle, that shoots
down upon its prey with the rapidity of lightning, points back to the
threat of Moses in [Deu 28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md). The
"house of Jehovah" is neither the temple at Jerusalem (Jerome, Theod.,
Cyr.), the introduction of which here would be at variance with the
context; nor the principal temple of Samaria, with the fall of which the
whole kingdom would be ruined (Ewald, Sim.), since the temples erected
for the calf-worship at Daniel and Bethel are called Bēth bâmōth, not
Bēth Yehōvâh; nor even the land of Jehovah, either here or at [Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015) (Hitzig.md), for a land is not a
house; but Israel was the house of Jehovah, as being a portion of the
congregation of the Lord, as in [Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md); [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007.md); [Jer
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007.md); [Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md); cf. οἶκος Θεοῦ in [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md) and [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md). The occasion of the judgment was
the transgression of the covenant and law of the Lord, which is more
particularly described in [Ti1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md). In
this distress they will call for help to Jehovah: "My God (i.e., each
individual will utter this cry), we know Thee?" Israel is in apposition
to the subject implied in the verb. They know Jehovah, so far as He has
revealed Himself to the whole nation of Israel; and the name Israel is
in itself a proof that they belong to the people of God.

[Hosea 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 8:3</span></span>

But this knowledge of God, regarded simply as a historical acquaintance
with Him, cannot possibly bring salvation. [Hos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#003.md). "Israel dislikes good; let the
enemy pursue it." This is the answer that God will give to those who cry
to Him. טוב denotes neither "Jehovah as the highest good" (Jerome) or as
"the good One" (Sims.), nor "the good law of God" (Schmieder), but the
good or salvation which Jehovah has guaranteed to the nation through His
covenant of grace, and which He bestowed upon those who kept His
covenant. Because Israel has despised this good, let the enemy pursue
it.

[Hosea 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 8:4</span></span>

The proof of Israel's renunciation of its God is to be found in the
facts mentioned in [Hos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md). "They
have set up kings, but not from me, have set up princes, and I know it
not: their silver and their gold they have made into idols, that it may
be cut off." The setting up of kings and princes, not from Jehovah, and
without His knowledge, i.e., without His having been asked, refers
chiefly to the founding of the kingdom by Jeroboam I. It is not to be
restricted to this, however, but includes at the same time the obstinate
persistence of Israel in this ungodly attitude on all future occasions,
when there was either a change or usurpation of the government. And the
fact that not only did the prophet Ahijah foretel to Jeroboam I that he
would rule over the ten tribes ([Kg1
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#030)..md), but Jehu was anointed king
over Israel by Elisha's command (2 Kings 9), and therefore both of them
received the kingdom by the express will of Jehovah, is not at variance
with this, so as to require the solution that we have a different view
here from that which prevails in the books of Kings, - namely, one which
sprang out of the repeated changes of government and anarchies in this
kingdom (Simson). For neither the divine promise of the throne, nor the
anointing performed by the command of God, warranted their forcibly
seizing upon the government, - a crime of which both Jeroboam and Jehu
rendered themselves guilty. The way in which both of them paved the way
to the throne was not in accordance with the will of God, but was most
ungodly (see at [Kg1 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#040).md). Jeroboam
was already planning a revolt against Solomon ([Kg1
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#027).md), and led the gathering of the
ten tribes when they fell away from the house of David 91 Kings [Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002)..md). Of Jehu, again, it is
expressly stated in [Kg2 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#014.md), that he
conspired against Joram. And the other usurpers, just like the two
already named, opened the way to the throne by means of conspiracies,
whilst the people not only rebelled against the rightful heir to the
throne at Solomon's death, from pure dislike to the royal house of
David, which had been appointed by God, and made Jeroboam king, but
expressed their approval of all subsequent conspiracies as soon as they
have been successful. This did not come from Jehovah, but was a
rebellion against Him - a transgression of His covenant. To this must be
added the further sin, viz., the setting up of the idolatrous
calf-worship on the part of Jeroboam, to which all the kings of Israel
adhered. It was in connection with this, that the application of the
silver and gold to idols, by which Israel completely renounced the law
of Jehovah, had taken place. It is true that silver was not used in the
construction of the golden calves; but it was employed in the
maintenance of their worship. למען יכּרת: that it (the gold and silver)
may be destroyed, as more fully stated in [Hos
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md). למען describes the consequence of
this conduct, which, though not designed, was nevertheless inevitable,
as if it had been distinctly intended.

[Hosea 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 8:5</span></span>

"Thy calf disgusts, O Samaria; my wrath is kindled against them: how
long are they incapable of purity. [Hos
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md). For this also is from Israel: a
workman made it, and it is not God; but the calf of Samaria will become
splinters." Zânach (disgusts) points back to [Hos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#003.md). As Israel felt disgust at what
was good, so did Jehovah at the golden calf of Samaria. It is true that
zânach is used here intransitively in the sense of smelling badly, or
being loathsome; but this does not alter the meaning, which is obvious
enough from the context, namely, that it is Jehovah whom the calf
disgusts. The calf of Samaria is not a golden calf set up in the city of
Samaria; as there is no allusion in history to any such calf as this.
Samaria is simply mentioned in the place of the kingdom, and the calf is
the one that was set up at Bethel, the most celebrated place of worship
in the kingdom, which is also the only one mentioned in [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md), [Hos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015.md). On account of this calf the
wrath of Jehovah is kindled against the Israelites, who worship this
calf, and cannot desist. This is the thought of the question expressing
disgust at these abominations. How long are they incapable of נקּין,
i.e., purity of walk before the Lord, instead of the abominations of
idolatry (cf. [Jer 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004).md); not "freedom
from punishment," as Hitzig supposes. To לע יוּכלוּ, "they are unable,"
we may easily supply "to bear," as in [Isa
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014.md) and [Psa
101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005.md). "For" (kı̄, [Hos
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006).md) follows as an explanation of the
main clause in [Hos 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005.md), "Thy calf
disgusts." The calf of Samaria is an abomination to the Lord, for it is
also out of Israel (Israel's God out of Israel itself!); a workman made
it, - what folly! והוּא is a predicate, brought out with greater
emphasis by ו, et quidem, in the sense of iste. Therefore will it be
destroyed like the golden calf at Sinai, which was burnt and ground to
powder ([Exo 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020.md); [Deu
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021).md). The ἅπ. λεγ. שׁבבים, from Arab.
sabb, to cut, signifies ruins or splinters.

[Hosea 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 8:7</span></span>

This will Israel reap from its ungodly conduct. [Hos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md). "For they sow wind, and reap
tempest: it has no stalks; shoot brings no fruit; and even if it brought
it, foreigners would devour it." With this figure, which is so
frequently and so variously used (cf. [Hos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md); [Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md); [Job
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008.md); [Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008).md), the threat is accounted for by
a general thought taken from life. The harvest answers to the sowing
(cf. [Gal 6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).md). Out of the wind
comes tempest. Wind is a figurative representation of human exertions;
the tempest, of destruction. Instead of rūăch we have און, עמל, עולה
(nothingness, weariness, wickedness) in [Hos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md); [Job
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008.md), and [Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008.md). In the second hemistich the
figure is carried out still further. קמה, "seed standing upon the
stalk," is not to it (viz., that which has been sowed). Tsemach brings
no qemach, - a play upon the words, answering to our shoot and fruit.
Qemach: generally meal, here probably the grain-bearing ear, from which
the meal is obtained. But even if the shoot, when grown, should yield
some meal, strangers, i.e., foreigners, would consume it. In these words
not only are the people threatened with failure of the crop; but the
failure and worthlessness of all that they do are here predicted. Not
only the corn of Israel, but Israel itself, will be swallowed up.

[Hosea 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 8:8</span></span>

With this thought the still further threatening of judgment in the next
strophe is introduced. [Hos 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#008.md).
"Israel is swallowed up; now are they among the nations like a vessel,
with which there is no satisfaction." The advance in the threat of
punishment lies less in the extension of the thought, that not only the
fruit of the field, but the whole nation, will be swallowed up by foes,
than in the perfect נבלע, which indicates that the time of the ripening
of the evil seeds has already begun (Jerome, Simson). עתּה היוּ, now
already have they become among the nations like a despised vessel, which
men cast away as useless (cf. [Jer
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028.md); [Jer
48:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#038).md). This lot have they prepared
for themselves.

[Hosea 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 8:9</span></span>

"For they went up to Asshur; wild ass goes alone by itself; Ephraim sued
for loves. [Hos 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010.md). Yea, though they
sue among the nations, now will I gather them, and they will begin to
diminish on account of the burden of the king of the princes." Going to
Assyria is defined still further in the third clause as suing for loves,
i.e., for the favour and help of the Assyrians. The folly of this suing
is shown in the clause, "wild ass goes by itself alone," the meaning and
object of which have been quite mistaken by those who supply a כ simil.
For neither by connecting it with the preceding words thus, "Israel went
to Asshur, like a stubborn ass going by itself" (Ewald), nor by
attaching to it those which follow, "like a wild ass going alone,
Ephraim sued for loves," do we get any suitable point of comparison. The
thought is rather this: whilst even a wild ass, that stupid animal,
keeps by itself to maintain its independence, Ephraim tries to form
unnatural alliances with the nations of the world, that is to say,
alliances that are quite incompatible with its vocation. Hithnâh, from
tânâh, probably a denom. of 'ethnâh (see at [Hos
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014).md), to give the reward of
prostitution, here in the sense of bargaining for amours, or
endeavouring to secure them by presents. The kal yithnū has the same
meaning in [Hos 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010.md). The word אקבּצם,
to which different renderings have been given, can only have a
threatening or punitive sense here; and the suffix cannot refer to
בּגּוים, but only to the subject contained in yithnu, viz., the
Ephraimites. The Lord will bring them together, sc. among the nations,
i.e., bring them all thither. קבּץ is used in a similar sense in [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md). The more precise definition is
added in the next clause, in the difficult expression ויּחלּוּ מעט, in
which ויּחלּוּ may be taken most safely in the sense of "beginning," as
in [Jdg 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#031.md); [Ch2
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017.md), and [Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md), in all of which this form occurs,
and מעט as an adject. verb., connected with החל like the adjective כּהות
in [Sa1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002.md) : "They begin to be, or
become, less (i.e., fewer), on account of the burden of the king of
princes," i.e., under the oppression which they will suffer from the
king of Assyria, not by war taxes or deportation, but when carried away
into exile. מלך שׂרים = מלך מלכים is a term applied to the great
Assyrian king, who boasted, according to [Isa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008.md), that his princes were all kings.

[Hosea 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 8:11</span></span>

This threat is accounted for in [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md)., by an allusion to the sins of
Israel. [Hos 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md). "For Ephraim has
multiplied altars for sinning, the altars have become to him for
sinning. [Hos 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012.md). I wrote to him the
fulnesses of my law; they were counted as a strange thing." Israel was
to have only one altar, and that in the place where the Lord would
reveal His name ([Deu 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005)..md). But
instead of that, Ephraim had built a number of altars in different
places, to multiply the sin of idolatry, and thereby heap more and more
guilt upon itself. לחטא is used, in the first clause, for the act of
sin; and in the second, for the consequences of that act. And this was
not done from ignorance of the divine will, but from neglect of the
divine commandments. אכתּוב is a historical present, indicating that
what had occurred was continuing still. These words refer unquestionably
to the great number of the laws written in the Mosaic thorah. רבו,
according to the chethib רבּו, with ת dropped, equivalent to רבבה, as in
[Ch1 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#007.md), ten thousand, myriads. The
Masoretes, who supposed the number to be used in an arithmetical sense,
altered it, as conjecturally unsuitable, into רבּי, multitudes, although
רב does not occur anywhere else in the plural. The expression "the
myriads of my law" is hyperbolical, to indicate the almost innumerable
multitude of the different commandments contained in the law. It was
also in a misapprehension of the nature of the hyperbole that the
supposition originated, that אכתּוב was a hypothetical future (Jerome).
כּמו זר, like something foreign, which does not concern them at all.

[Hosea 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 8:13</span></span>

"Slain-offerings for gifts they sacrifice; flesh, and eat: Jehovah has
no pleasure in them: now will He remember their transgression, and visit
their sins: they will return to Egypt. [Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md). And Israel forgot its Creator,
and built palaces: and Judah multiplied fortified cities: and I shall
send fire into its cities, and it will devour its castles." With the
multiplication of the altars they increased the number of the
sacrifices. הבהבי is a noun in the plural with the suffix, and is formed
from יהב by reduplication. The slain-offerings of my sacrificial gifts,
equivalent to the gifts of slain-offerings presented to me continually,
they sacrifice as flesh, and eat it; that is to say, they are nothing
more than flesh, which they slay and eat, and not sacrifices in which
Jehovah takes delight, or which could expiate their sins. Therefore the
Lord will punish their sins; they will return to Egypt, i.e., be driven
away into the land of bondage, out of which God once redeemed His
people. These words are simply a special application of the threat, held
out by Moses in [Deu 28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068.md), to the
degenerate ten tribes. Egypt is merely a type of the land of bondage, as
in [Hos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md), [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md). In [Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md) the sin of Israel is traced back
to its root. This is forgetfulness of God, and deification of their own
power, and manifests itself in the erection of היכלות, palaces, not
idolatrous temples. Judah also makes itself partaker of this sin, by
multiplying the fortified cities, and placing its confidence in
fortifications. These castles of false security the Lord will destroy.
The 'armânōth answer to the hēkhâloth. The suffixes attached to בּעריו
and ארמנתיה refer to both kingdoms: the masculine suffix to Israel and
Judah, as a people; the feminine to the two as a land, as in [Lam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005.md).
