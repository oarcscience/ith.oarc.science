### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 20:1</span></span>

Sheba's Rebellion. - [Sa2 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md). There
happened to be a worthless man there, named Sheba, a Benjaminite. He
blew the trumpet, and said, "We have no part in David, nor inheritance
in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, O Israel!" "To his tents,"
i.e., to his home, as in [Sa2 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009.md),
etc.

[Sa2 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#002.md)

All the men of Israel responded to this call, and went up (to the
mountains) away from David and after Sheba; but the men of Judah adhered
to their king from the Jordan to Jerusalem. The construction of דּבק
with ועד ... מן is a pregnant one: they adhered to and followed him. The
expression "from Jordan" does not prove that Sheba's rebellion broke out
at the Jordan itself, and before David's arrival in Gilgal, but may be
accounted for from the fact that the men of Judah had already fetched
the king back across the Jordan.

[Sa2 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#003.md)

As soon as David returned to his palace at Jerusalem, he brought the ten
concubines whom he had left behind, and with whom Absalom had lain, into
a place of safety, and took care of them, without going in unto them any
more. The masculine suffixes attached to יתּגם, יכלכּלם, and אליהם are
used, as they frequently are, as being the more general and indefinite,
instead of the feminine, which is the more definite form. Thus were they
shut up in lifelong widowhood until the day of their death. אלמנוּת is
an adverbial accusative, and חיּוּת signifies "condition in life;"
literally, in widowhood of life.

[Sa2 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004.md)

David then ordered Amasa to call the men of Judah to pursue Sheba the
rebel, and attack him within three days, and then to present himself to
him again. This commission was intended as the commencement of the
fulfilment of the promise which David had given to Amasa ([Sa2
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#014).md). It was no doubt his intention
to give him the command over the army that marched against Sheba, and
after the defeat of the rebel to make him commander-in-chief. But this
first step towards the fulfilment of the promise was a very imprudent
act, like the promise itself, since Joab, who had been commander of the
army for so many years, was grievously offended by it; and moreover,
being a well-tried general, he had incomparably more distinction in the
tribe of Judah than Amasa, who had taken part in Absalom's rebellion and
even led the rebel army, could possibly have.

[Sa2 20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#005.md)

But when Amasa stayed out beyond the time fixed for the execution of the
royal commission (the Chethib וייחר is the Piel וייחר, whilst the Keri
is either the Hiphil ויּוחר, or the imperfect Kal of יחר = אחר, cf.
תּחז, [Sa2 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#009.md), and is quite
unnecessary), probably because the men of Judah distrusted him, and were
not very ready to respond to his summons, David said to Abishai, "Now
will Sheba the son of Bichri be more injurious (more dangerous) to us
than Absalom. Take thou the servants (soldiers) of thy lord and pursue
after him, lest he reach fortified cities, and tear out our eye," i.e.,
do us a serious injury. This is the correct explanation given by
Bttcher, who refers to [Deu 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md) and
[Zac 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012.md), where the apple of the eye
is the figure used to signify the most valuable possession; for the
general explanation, "and withdraw from our eye," cannot be
grammatically sustained.

[Sa2 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#007.md)

Thus there went after him (Abishai) Joab's men (the corps commanded by
Joab), and the Crethi and Plethi (see at [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018).md), out of Jerusalem, to pursue
Sheba.

[Sa2 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008.md)

"When they were by the great stone at Gibeon, and Amasa came to meet
them (there), Joab was girded with his armour-coat as his clothing, and
the girdle of the sword was bound over it upon his loins in its sheath,
which came out, and it fell (i.e., the sheath came out of the sword-belt
in which it was fastened, and the sword fell to the ground), Joab said
to Amasa," etc. The eighth verse contains only circumstantial clauses,
the latter of which (from ויואב onwards) are subordinate to the earlier
ones, so that ויּאמר ([Sa2 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#009).md) is
attached to the first clause, which describes the meeting between the
advancing army and Amasa.

There is something striking, however, in the fact that Joab appears
among them, and indeed, as we see from what follows, as the commander of
the forces; for according to [Sa2
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#006.md), David had commissioned Abishai,
Joab's brother, to pursue Sheba, and even in [Sa2
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#007.md) Joab's men only are mentioned.
This difficulty can hardly be solved in any other manner than by the
simple assumption that David had told Abishai to go out with Joab, and
that this circumstance is passed over in the brief account in [Sa2
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#006.md), in which the principal facts
alone are given, and consequently the name of Joab does not occur there.
Clericus adopts the following explanation. "Mention," he says, "has
hitherto been made simply of the command given to Abishai, but this
included an order to Joab to go as well; and there is nothing to
preclude the supposition that Joab's name was mentioned by the king,
although this is not distinctly stated in the brief account before us."

(Note: This difficulty cannot be removed by emendations of the text,
inasmuch as all the early translators, with the exception of the Syriac,
had our Hebrew text before them. Thenius does indeed propose to alter
Abishai into Joab in [Sa2 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#006.md), after
the example of Josephus and the Syriac; but, as Bttcher observes, if
Joab had originally formed part of the text, it could not have been
altered into Abishai either accidentally or intentionally, and the
Syriac translators and Josephus have inserted Joab merely from
conjecture, because they inferred from what follows that Joab's name
ought to be found here. But whilst this is perfectly true, there is no
ground for Bttcher's own conjecture, that in the original text [Sa2
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#006.md) read as follows: "Then David said
to Joab, Behold, the three days are gone: shall we wait for Amasa?" and
through the copyist's carelessness a whole line was left out. For this
conjecture has no tenable support in the senseless reading of the Cod.
Vat., πρὸς Ἀμεσσαΐ́ for Ἀβισαΐ́.)

[Sa2 20:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#009.md)

Joab asked Amasa how he was, and laid hold of his bear with his right
hand to kiss him. And as Amasa took no heed of the sword in Joab's hand,
he smote him with it in the paunch (abdomen), and shed out his bowels
upon the ground, "and repeated not (the stroke) to him" (cf. [Sa1
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008).md). Laying hold of the beard to
kiss is still customary among Arabs and Turks as a sign of friendly
welcome (vid., Arvieux, Merkwrdige Nachrichten, iv. p. 182, and Harmar,
Beobachtungen, ii. p. 61). The reason for this assassination was Joab's
jealousy of Amasa. Joab and Abishai then followed Sheba.

[Sa2 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#011.md)

One of Joab's attendants remained standing by him (Amasa), no doubt at
Joab's command, and said to the people who came thither, i.e., to the
men of Judah who were collected together by Amasa (vid., [Sa2
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004).md), "He that favoureth Joab, and he
that (is) for David, let him (go) after Joab," i.e., follow him to
battle against Sheba.

[Sa2 20:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#012.md)

Amasa lay wallowing in blood in the midst of the road; and when the man
(the attendant) saw that all the people stood still (by the corpse), he
turned (pushed) Amasa from the road to the field, and threw a cloth over
him, whereupon they all passed by and went after Joab.

[Sa2 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#014.md)

But Joab "went through all the tribes of Israel to Abela, and
Beth-maacah, and all Berim." Abela ([Sa2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015).md), or Abel ([Sa2
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#018).md), has been preserved in the
large Christian village of Abil, a place with ruins, and called
Abil-el-Kamh on account of its excellent wheat (Kamh), which lies to the
north-west of Lake Huleh, upon a Tell on the eastern side of the river
Derdra; not in Ibl-el-Hawa, a place to the north of this, upon the ridge
between Merj Ayun and Wady et Teim (vid., Ritter, Erdk. xv. pp. 240,
241; Robinson, Bibl. Researches, pp. 372-3; and v. de Velde, Mem. p.
280). Beth-maacah was quite close to Abela; so that the names of the two
places are connected together in [Sa2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015.md), and afterwards, as
Abel-beth-maacah (vid., [Kg1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020.md),
and [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md), also called Abel-maim
in [Ch2 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#004.md). Berim is the name of a
district which is unknown to us; and even the early translators did not
know how to render it. There is nothing, however, either in the πάντες
ἐν χαῤῥί is the lxx or the omnes viri electi of the Vulgate, to warrant
an alteration of the text. The latter, in fact, rests upon a mere
conjecture, which is altogether unsuitable; for the subject to ויּקּהלוּ
cannot be כּל־הבּרים on account of the vav consec., but must be obtained
from ישׂראל בּכל־שׁבטי. The Chethib ויקלהו is evidently a slip of the
pen for ויּקּהלוּ.

[Sa2 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015.md)

They besieged him (Sheba) in Abel-beth-maacah, and piled up a rampart
against the city, so that it rose up by the town-moat (חל, the moat with
the low wall belonging to it); and all the people with Joab destroyed to
throw down the wall.

[Sa2 20:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#016.md)

Then a wise woman of the city desired to speak to Joab, and said (from
the wall) to him ([Sa2 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#018).md), "They
were formerly accustomed to say, ask Abel; and so they brought (a thing)
to pass." These words show that Abel had formerly been celebrated for
the wisdom of its inhabitants.

[Sa2 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#019.md)

"I am of the peaceable, faithful in Israel: thou seekest to slay a city
and mother in Israel; wherefore wilt thou destroy the inheritance of
Jehovah?" The construing of אנכי with a predicate in the plural may be
explained on the simple ground that the woman spoke in the name of the
city as well as in its favour, and therefore had the citizens in her
mind at the time, as is very evident from the figurative expression אם
(mother) for mother-city or capital.

(Note: The correctness of the text is not to be called in question, as
Thenius and Bttcher suppose, for the simple reason that all the older
translators have followed the Hebrew text, including even the lxx with
their ἐγώ εἰμι εἰρηνικὰ τῶν στηριγμάτων ἐν Ἰσραήλ; whereas the words ἅ
ἔθεντο οἱ πιστοὶ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, which some of the MSS contain at the close
of [Sa2 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#018.md) after ει ̓ ἐξέλιπον, and
upon which Thenius and Bttcher have founded their conjectures, are
evidently a gloss or paraphrase of התמּוּ וכן, and of so little value on
critical grounds, that Tischendorf did not even think the reading worth
mentioning in his edition of the Septuagint.)

The woman gave Joab to understand, in the first place, that he ought to
have asked the inhabitants of Abela whether they intended to fight for
Sheba before commencing the siege and destruction of the town, according
to the law laid down in [Deu 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010.md).
with reference to the siege of foreign towns; and secondly, that he
ought to have taken into consideration the peaceableness and fidelity of
the citizens of Abela, and not to destroy the peace-loving citizens and
members of the nation of God.

[Sa2 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#020.md)

The woman's words made an impression upon Joab. He felt the truthfulness
of her reproaches, and replied, "Far be it, far be it from me, to
swallow up or destroy." אם, as in the case of oaths: "truly not."

[Sa2 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#021.md)

"It is not so (sc., as thou sayest), but a man of the mountains of
Ephraim (which extended into the tribe of Benjamin: see at [Sa1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001).md), Sheba the son of Bichri, hath
lifted up his hand against the king David. Only give him up, and I will
draw away from the city." The woman promised him this: "Behold, his head
shall be thrown out to thee over the wall."

[Sa2 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#022.md)

She then came to all the people (i.e., the citizens of the town) "with
her wisdom," i.e., with the wise counsel which she had given to Joab,
and which he had accepted; whereupon the citizens cut off Sheba's head,
and threw it out to Joab. Then Joab had a trumpet blown for a retreat,
and the men disbanded, whilst he himself returned to Jerusalem to the
king.

David's Ministers of State. - The second section of the history of
David's reign closes, like the first ([Sa2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016)..md), with a list of the leading
ministers of state. The author evidently found the two lists in his
sources, and included them both in his work, for the simple reason that
they belonged to different periods, as the difference in the names of
some of the officers clearly shows, and that they supplemented on
another. The list before us belongs to a later period of David's reign
than the one in [Sa2 8:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016.md). In
addition to the office-bearers mentioned in 2 Samuel 8, we find here
Adoram over the tribute, and Ira the Kairite a confidential counsellor
(cohen: see at [Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018).md), in the
place of the sons of David noticed in [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018.md). The others are the same in both
lists. The Chethib הכרי is to be read הכּרי (cf. [Kg2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004.md), [Kg2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019).md), from כוּר, perfodit, and is
synonymous with הכּרתי (see at [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018).md). Adoram is the same person as
Adoniram, who is mentioned in [Kg1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006.md)
and [Kg1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#014.md) as overseer over the
tributary service in the time of Solomon; as we may see from the fact,
that the latter is also called Adoram in [Kg1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#018.md), and Hadoram in [Ch2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#018.md). Hadoram is apparently only a
contracted form of the name, and not merely a copyist's mistake for
Adoniram. But when we find that, according to the passage cited, the
same man filled this office under three kings, we must bear in mind that
he did not enter upon it till the close of David's reign, as he is not
mentioned in [Sa2 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016.md)., and that his
name only occurs in connection with Rehoboam's ascent of the throne; so
that there is no ground for assuming that he filled the office for any
length of time under that monarch. המּס does not mean vectigal, i.e.,
tribute or tributary service, but tributary labourers. The derivation of
the word is uncertain, and has been disputed. The appointment of a
special prefect over the tributary labourers can hardly have taken place
before the closing years of David's reign, when the king organized the
internal administration of the kingdom more firmly than before. On the
tributary labourers, see at [Kg1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013.md).
Ira the Jairite is never mentioned again. There is no ground for
altering Jairi (the Jairite) into Jithri (the Jithrite), as Thenius
proposes, since the rendering given in the Syriac ("from Jathir") is
merely an inference from [Sa2 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#038.md);
and the assumption upon which this conclusion is founded, viz., that
Ira, the hero mentioned in [Sa2 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#038.md),
is the same person as Ira the royal cohen, is altogether unfounded.
