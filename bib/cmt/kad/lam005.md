A Prayer to the Lord by the Church, Languishing in Misery, for the
Restoration of Her Former State of Grace

1 Remember, O Jahveh, what hath happened to us; consider, and behold our
reproach.

2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to foreigners.

3 We are orphans, without a father; our mothers are as widows.

4 Our own water we drink for money, our own wood cometh to us in return
for payment.

5 On our necks are we persecuted; we are jaded, - there is no rest for
us.

6 \[Towards\] Egypt we reach our hand, - \[towards\] Assyria, to satisfy
ourselves \[with\] bread.

7 Our fathers sinned, they are not; we bear their iniquities.

8 Servants rule us; there is none to deliver us out of their hand.

9 At the risk of our life we bring in our bread, because of the sword of
the wilderness.

10 Our skin gloweth with heat like a furnace, because of the fever-heat
of hunger.

11 They have forced women in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah.

12 Princes are hung up by their hand; the face of the elders is not
honoured.

13 Young men carry millstones, and lads stagger under \[loads of\] wood.

14 Elders cease from the gate, young men from their instrumental music.

15 The joy of our heart hath ceased, our dancing has turned into
mourning.

16 The crown of our head is fallen; woe unto us, that we have sinned!

17 Because of this our heart became sick; because of these \[things\]
our eyes became dark.

18 Upon Mount Zion, which is laid waste, jackals roam through it.

19 Thou, O Jahveh, dost sit \[enthroned\] for ever; They throne is for
generation and generation.

20 Why dost thou forget us for ever, - forsake us for a length of days?

21 Lead us back, O Jahveh, to thyself, that we may return; renew our
days, as of old.

22 Or, hast Thou indeed utterly rejected us? art thou very wroth against
us?

This poem begins ([Lam 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001).md) with the
request addressed to the Lord, that He would be pleased to think of the
disgrace that has befallen Judah, and concludes ([Lam
5:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019).md) with the request that the
Lord may not forsake His people for ever, but once more receive them
into favour. The main portion of this petition is formed by the
description of the disgrace and misery under which the suppliants groan,
together with the acknowledgment ([Lam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md) and [Lam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#016).md) that they are compelled to bear
the sins of their fathers and their own sins. By this confession, the
description given of their misery is divided into two strophes ([Lam
5:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#002.md) and [Lam
5:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#008).md), which are followed by the
request for deliverance ([Lam
5:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019).md), introduced by [Lam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#017.md) and [Lam
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#018.md). The author of this prayer speaks
throughout in the name of the people, or, to speak more correctly, in
the name of the congregation, laying their distress and their
supplication before the Lord. The view of Thenius, - that this poem
originated among a small company of Jews who had been dispersed, and
who, in the mist of constant persecution, sought a place of refuge from
the oppression of the Chaldeans, - has been forced upon the text through
the arbitrary interpretation of detached figurative expressions.

[Lamentations 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 5:1</span></span>

Supplication and statement regarding the distress. The quest made in
[Lam 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001.md) refers to the oppression
depicted in what follows. The words, "Remember, O Lord, what hath
happened (i.e., befallen) us," are more fully explained in the second
member, "Look and behold our disgrace." It is quite arbitrary in Thenius
to refer the first member to the past, the second to the present,
described in what follows, [Lam
5:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012.md). The Qeri הבּיטה is an
unnecessary alteration, after [Lam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011.md); [Lam
3:63](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#063.md). - With [Lam
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#002.md) begins the description of the
disgrace that has befallen them. This consists, first of all, in the
fact that their inheritance has become the possession of strangers.
Rosenm׬ller rightly explains נחלה to mean, terra quae tuo nobis dono
quandam est concessa. נחפך is used of the transference of the property
to others, as in [Isa 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md). Many
expositors would refer בּתּינוּ to the houses in Jerusalem which the
Chaldeans had not destroyed, on the ground that it is stated, in [Kg2
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009.md) and [Jer
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013.md), that the Chaldeans destroyed
none but large houses. There is no foundation, however, for this
restriction; moreover, it is opposed by the parallel נחלתנוּ. Just as by
נחלה we are to understand, not merely the possession of Jerusalem, but
of the whole country, so also בּתּינוּ are the dwelling-houses of the
country in towns and villages; in this case, the question whether any
houses still remained standing in Jerusalem does not demand
consideration at all. Ngelsbach is wrong in his remark that נחלה and
בּתּים respectively mean immovable and portable property, for houses are
certainly not moveable property.

[Lam 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#003.md)

[Lam 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#003.md) is very variously interpreted
by modern expositors. Ewald and Vaihinger understand "father" as meaning
the king, while Thenius refers it specially to Zedekiah; the "mothers,"
according to Ewald and Vaihinger, are the cities of Judah, while Thenius
thinks they are the women of Zedekiah's harem. But to call the women of
the royal harem "mothers" of the nation, would be as unexampled as the
attribution of the title to the cities of Judah. The second clause, "our
mothers are like widows," contains a simile: they are not really widows,
but like widows, because they have lost the protection which the mother
of a family has in her husband. In like manner, the first clause also is
to be understood as a comparison. "We are fatherless orphans," i.e., we
are like such, as the Chaldee has paraphrased it. Accordingly, C. B.
Michaelis, Pareau, Rosenmller, Kalkschmidt, and Gerlach have rightly
explained the words as referring to the custom of the Hebrews: hominies
omni modo derelictos omnibusque praesidiis destitutos, pupillos et
viduas dicere; cf. [Psa 94:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#006.md); [Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017.md); [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md).

[Lam 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#004.md)

And not merely are the inhabitants of Judah without land and property,
and deprived of all protection, like orphans and widows; they are also
living in penury and want, and ([Lam
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#005).md) under severe oppression and
persecution. Water and wood are mentioned in [Lam
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#004.md) as the greatest necessities of
life, without which it is impossible to exist. Both of these they must
buy for themselves, because the country, with its waters and forests, is
in the possession of the enemy. The emphasis lies on "our water...our
wood." What they formerly had, as their own property, for nothing, they
must now purchase. We must reject the historical interpretations of the
words, and their application to the distress of the besieged
(Michaelis); or to the exiles who complained of the dearness of water
and wood in Egypt (Ewald); or to those who fled before the Chaldeans,
and lived in waste places (Thenius); or to the multitudes of those taken
prisoner after the capture of Jerusalem, who were so closely watched
that they could not go where they liked to get water and wood, but were
obliged to go to their keepers for permission, and pay dearly for their
services (Ngelsbach). The purchase of water and wood can scarcely be
taken literally, but must be understood as signifying that the people
had to pay heavy duties for the use of the water and the wood which the
country afforded.

[Lam 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#005.md)

"On our necks we are persecuted," i.e., our persecutors are at our
necks, - are always close behind us, to drive or hunt us on. It is
inadmissible to supply any specific mention of the yoke (imposito collo
gravi servitutis jugo, Raschi, Rosenmller, Vaihinger, etc.); and we must
utterly reject the proposal to connect "our neck" with [Lam
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#004) (lxx, Syriac, J. D. Michaelis.md),
inasmuch as the symmetry of the verses is thereby destroyed, nor is any
suitable meaning obtained. "We are jaded: no rest is granted us." הוּנח
is Hophal of הניח, to give rest to. The Qeri ולא instead of לא is quite
as unnecessary as in the case of אין, [Lam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#003.md), and אינם and אנחנוּ in [Lam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md). The meaning of the verse is not,
"we are driven over neck and head," according to which the subject
treated of would be the merciless treatment of the prisoners, through
their being driven on (Ngelsbach); still less is it meant to be stated
that the company to which the writer of the poem belonged was always
tracked out, and hunted about in the waste places where they wished to
hide themselves (Thenius). Neither of these interpretations suits the
preceding and succeeding context. Nor does the mention of being
"persecuted on the neck" necessarily involve a pursuit of fugitives: it
merely indicates incessant oppression on the side of the enemy, partly
through continually being goaded on to hard labour, partly through
annoyances of different kinds, by which the victors made their supremacy
and their pride felt by the vanquished nation. In רדף there is contained
neither the notion of tracking fugitives nor that of driving on
prisoners.

[Lam 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006.md)

The meaning of נתן is more exactly defined by the superadded לשׂבּע לחם,
which belongs to both members of the verse. "In order to satisfy
ourselves with bread (so as to prolong our lives), we give the hand to
Egypt, to Assyria." מצרים and אשּׁוּר are local accusatives. To give the
hand is a sign of submission or subjection; see on [Jer
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015.md). Pareau has correctly given the
meaning thus: si victum nobis comparare velimus, vel Judaea nobis
relinquenda est atque Aegyptii sunt agnoscendi domini, vel si hic
manemus, Chaldaeis victoribus nos subjiciamus necesse est; quocunque nos
vertamus, nihil superest nisi tristissima servitus. This complaint
shows, moreover, that it is those in Judea who are speaking. נתנּוּ, "we
give the hand," shows that the assumption of Thenius, - that the writer
here brings to remembrance the fate of two other companies of his
fellow-countrymen who were not carried away into exile, - -is an
arbitrary insertion. Asshur, as the name of the great Asiatic empire,
stands for Babylon, as in [Ezr 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022.md),
cf. [Jer 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018.md).

[Lam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md)

"We suffer more than we are guilty of; we are compelled to bear the
iniquities of our fathers," i.e., to atone for their guilt. There is a
great truth contained in the words, "Our fathers have sinned; they are
no more; we bear their iniquities (or guilt)." For the fall of the
kingdom had not been brought about by the guilt of that generation
merely, and of none before; it was due also to the sins of their fathers
before them, in previous generations. The same truth is likewise
expressed in [Jer 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011.md); [Jer
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018.md); and in [Kg2
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026.md) it is stated that God did not
cease from His great wrath because of the sins of Manasseh. But this
truth would be perverted into error, if we were to understand the words
as intimating that the speakers had considered themselves innocent. This
false view, however, they themselves opposed with the confession in [Lam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#016.md), "for we have sinned;" thereby
they point out their own sins as the cause of their misfortune. If we
compare this confession with the verse now before us, this can only mean
the following: "The misfortune we suffer has not been incurred by
ourselves alone, but we are compelled to atone for the sins of our
fathers also." In the same way, too, Jeremiah ([Jer
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011).md) threatens the infliction of a
penal judgment, not merely "because your fathers have forsaken me (the
Lord)," but he also adds, "and ye do still worse than your fathers." God
does not punish the sins of the fathers in innocent children, but in
children who continue the sins of the fathers; cf. [Isa
65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007.md), and the explanation given of
[Jer 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029.md) and [Eze
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md). The design with which the
suffering for the sins of the fathers is brought forward so prominently,
and with such feeling, is merely to excite the divine compassion for
those who are thus chastised.

[Lamentations 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 5:8</span></span>

Further description of the miserable condition under which the
congregation languishes. [Lam 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#008.md).
"Servants rule over us," etc. עבדים are not the Chaldean soldiers, who
are in [Kg2 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010.md) designated the
servants of Nebuchadnezzar (Pareau, Rosenmller, Maurer); still less the
Chaldeans, in so far as they, till shortly before, had been the subjects
of the Assyrians (Kalkschmidt); nor the Chaldean satraps, as servants of
the king of Babylon (Thenius, Ewald); nor even "slaves who had been
employed as overseers and taskmasters of the captives while on the
march" (Ngelsbach); but the Chaldeans. These are called servants, partly
because of the despotic rule under which they were placed, partly in the
sense already indicated by C. B. Michaelis, as being those qui nobis
potius, si pii fuissemus, servire debuissent, in accordance with the
analogous designation of Jerusalem as a princess among the countries of
the world, [Lam 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md).

[Lam 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#009.md)

And in addition to this humiliation under dishonourable servitude, we
can get our daily bread only at the risk of our life. Thus there is
fulfilled to them the threatening in [Deu
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#028.md), "Ye shall be servants among
your enemies, in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and want of
everything." בּנפשׁנוּ, "for the price of our soul," i.e., with our life
at stake, we bring in our bread. The danger is more exactly described by
what is added: "before the sword of the wilderness." By this expression
are meant the predatory Bedouins of the desert, who, falling upon those
that were bringing in the bread, plundered, and probably even killed
them. The bringing of the bread is not, however, to be referred (with
Rosenmller, Maurer, and Kalkschmidt) to the attempts made to procure
bread from the neighbouring countries; still less is it to be referred
(with Thenius, Ewald, and Ngelsbach) to the need for "wringing the bread
from the desert and its plunderers;" but it refers to the ingathering of
the scanty harvest in the country devastated by war and by the
visitations of predatory Bedouins: הביא is the word constantly employed
in this connection; cf. [Sa2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#010.md);
[Hag 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md).

[Lam 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#010.md)

The bread which we are thus obliged to struggle for, at the risk of our
life, is not even sufficient to allay hunger, which consumes our bodies.
נכמר does not mean to be blackened (Chaldee, Kimchi, C. B. Michaelis,
Maurer), but in [Gen 43:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#030.md); [Kg1
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#026.md), and [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md), to be stirred up (of the bowels,
compassion), hence to kindle, glow. This last meaning is required by the
comparison with תּנּוּר, oven, furnace. This comparison does not mean
cutis nostra tanquam fornace adusta est (Gesenius in Thes.,
Kalkschmidt), still less "black as an oven" (Dietrich in Ges. Lex.),
because תּנּוּר does not mean the oven viewed in respect of its
blackness, but (from נוּר) in respect of the fire burning in it. The
meaning is, "our skin glows like a baker's oven" (Vaihinger, Thenius,
Ngelsbach, Gerlach), - a strong expression for the fever-heat produced
by hunger. As to זלעפות, glowing heat, see on [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md).

[Lam 5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#011.md)

With this must further be considered the maltreatment which persons of
every station, sex, and age have to endure. [Lam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#011.md). Women and virgins are
dishonoured in Jerusalem, and in the other cities of the land. [Lam
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012.md). Princes are suspended by the
hand of the enemy (Ewald, contrary to the use of language, renders
"along with" them). To hang those who had been put to death was
something superadded to the simple punishment by death ([Deu
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#022)..md), and so far as a shameful kind
of execution. "The old men are not honoured," i.e., dishonoured; cf.
[Lam 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016.md); [Lev
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032.md). The words are not to be
restricted to the events mentioned in [Jer
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006.md), but also apply to the present
condition of those who are complaining,

[Lam 5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#013.md)

Youths and boys are forced to engage in heavy servile work. טחון נשׂאוּ
does not mean "they take them for the mill," ad molendum sumpserunt
(Ewald, Rosenmller). Apart from the consideration that there is no
ground for it in the language employed, such a view of the words does
not accord with the parallelism. נשׂא, construed with a simple
infinitive or accusative (without ל), does not mean "to take for
something." טחון is a substantive, "the mill." "To bear (carry) the
mill" signifies to work at and with the mill. We must think of the
hand-mill, which was found in every household, and which could thus be
carried from one place to another. Grinding was the work of salves; see
on [Jdg 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021.md). The carrying of the
mill (not merely of the upper millstone) is mentioned as the heaviest
portion of the work in grinding. "Boys stagger (fall down) on the wood
laid on them to be carried," i.e., under the burden of it. כּשׁל with בּ
means to stumble on something; here בּ denotes the cause of the
stumbling; cf. [Jer 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#021.md); [Lev
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#037.md). It is arbitrary to understand
עץ as meaning the wooden handle of the mill (Aben Ezra, and Bochart in
Hieroz. i. 157, ed. Rosenmller); the same must also be said regarding
the opinion of Thenius and Ngelsbach, who refer the words to the
dragging of the hand-mills, and of the wood necessary for baking bread
for the comfort of the soldiers, on the march of the captives to
Babylon.

[Lam 5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#015.md)

Under the pressure of such circumstances, all public meetings and
amusements have ceased. "The elders cease from the fate." The gate was
the place of assembly for the people, not merely for deliberating upon
public affairs ([Rut 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#015.md); [Jos
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004).md), but also "for social
entertainment (since there were no refreshment-rooms, coffeehouses, and
public baths, such as are now to be found in the East), or even for
quiet enjoyment in looking at the motley multitude of passers-by; [Gen
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md); [Sa1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#018.md); [Sa1
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#018.md); [Job
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007.md)" (Winer's Bibl. R.W.B. s.v.
Thor). That the gate is here to be regarded as a place of entertainment
and amusement, is shown by the parallel member, "young men cease from
their instrumental music;" cf. [Lam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md). On [Lam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#015.md), cf. [Jer
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md); [Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009.md), and [Jer
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#013.md); [Psa
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#012.md). Lastly, in [Lam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#016.md), the writer sums up the whole of
the misery in the complaint, "The crown of our head is fallen! woe unto
us, for we have sinned," i.e., we suffer the punishment for our sins.
"The fallen crown can only be a figurative expression for the honourable
position of the people in its entirety, but which is now lost." Such is
the view which Ewald rightly takes; on the other hand, the
interpretation of Thenius, that "the 'crown of our head' is nothing else
than Zion, together with its palaces, placed on Jerusalem, as it were on
the head \[of the country\], and adorning it," deserves mention simply
as a curious specimen of exegetical fancy. Ngelsbach has gone too far in
restricting the figurative expression to the crown of Jerusalem, which
consists in her being mistress among the nations, a princess among the
regions of the earth ([Lam 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001).md), the
perfection of beauty, and the joy of the whole earth ([Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015).md); for "our crown" is not
equivalent to Jerusalem, or a crown on the head of Jerusalem.

[Lamentations 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 5:17</span></span>

The request that the judgment of wrath may be averted, and that the
former gracious condition may be restored. [Lam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#017.md) and [Lam
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#018.md) form the transition to the
request in [Lam 5:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019.md). "Because of
this" and "because of these \[things\]" refer mainly to what precedes,
yet not in such a way as that the former must be referred to the fact
that sin has been committed, and the latter to the suffering. The two
halves of the verse are unmistakeably parallel; the sickening of the
heart is essentially similar to the dimness coming on the eyes, the
former indicating the sorrow of the soul, while the latter is the
expression of this sorrow in tears. "Because of this (viz., because of
the misery hitherto complained of) the heart has become sick," and the
grief of the heart finds vent in tears, in consequence of which the eyes
have become dim; cf. [Lam 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md). But
this sorrow culminates in the view taken of the desolation of Mount
Zion, which receives consideration, not because of its splendid palaces
(Thenius), but as the holy mountain on which the house of God stood, for
"Zion" comprehended Moriah; see on [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); [Psa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md); [Psa
76:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#003.md). The glory formerly attaching to
Mount Zion ([Psa 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md); [Psa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002).md) is departed; the mountain has
been so much laid waste, that jackals roam on it. שׁוּעלים are not
properly foxes, but jackals (as in [Psa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#011).md), which lodge among the ruins.
הלּך is an intensive form, meaning to rove or roam about.

[Lamentations 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 5:19</span></span>

The glory of Zion, the earthly habitation of the Lord, is at an end, but
the throne of the Lord endures eternally. Through this thought, the
lamentation rises to the prayer that the Lord may not forsake His people
for ever, but re-establish His kingdom on the earth. "Thou, O Jahveh,
art enthroned eternally." This thought is expressed as the ground of
hope, in nearly the same words as are found in [Psa
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md). Jahveh is the God of
salvation. Since His throne endures eternally in heaven, He cannot let
His kingdom perish on the earth. On this is founded the request, "Why
wilt Thou forget us for ever, forsake us for a length of days (i.e.,
through life, always, [Psa 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006).md)?"
This the Lord cannot do, because of His grace. From this is developed
the further request ([Lam 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021).md), "Lead
us back to Thyself, that we may return." We must not restrict השׁיב and
שׁוּב to conversion to the Lord (Kalkschmidt, Ewald, Vaihinger,
Gerlach); they signify the re-establishment of the gracious relation,
which is, of course, impossible without repentance and conversion on the
part of Israel. It is wrong to refer the words to the restoration of the
people to their native land, or to the re-establishment of the theocracy
(Dathe, Thenius), because it is not the exiles who address this petition
to the Lord. The mode in which we are to understand the "bringing back
to Jahveh" is shown in the second hemistich, "renew our days, as they
were in former times," i.e., vouchsafe to us again the life (or state of
grace) which we enjoyed in former times. In [Lam
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#022.md) this request is based on an
argument introduced in a negative form. כּי אם, after a negative clause,
signifies nisi, but (Ger. sondern). This meaning developed into that of
a strong limitation (cf. Ewald, 356), unless = provided that. Thus
literally here: "unless Thou hast utterly rejected us, - art very wroth
against us." This case, however, is merely stated as a possibility, the
actual occurrence of which is out of the question. The idea is the same
as that expressed by Jeremiah ([Jer
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019).md) in the form of a question, in
order to give greater emphasis to his intercession for his nation. The
Lord cannot have utterly rejected His people Israel, because He would
thereby make His name to be despised in the eyes of the nations ([Jer
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021).md). Thus terminates this
lamentation, with a request for whose fulfilment faith can hope with
confidence.

[Lamentations 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 5:21</span></span>

In many Hebrew MSS [Lam 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021.md) is found
repeated after [Lam 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#022.md), to make the
whole more suitable for public reading in the synagogue, that the poem
may not end with the mention of the wrath of God, as is the case also at
the close of Isaiah, Malachi, and Ecclesiastes: the intention is, to
conclude with words of comfort. But v. 22, rightly understood, did not
require this repetition: for, as Rhabanas has already remarked in
Ghisleri commentar. on v. 22: non haec quasi desperando de salute populi
sui locutus est, sed ut dolorem suum nimium de contritione et objectione
diutina gentis suae manifestaret. This conclusion entirely agrees with
the character of the Lamentations, in which complaint and supplication
should continue to the end, - not, however, without an element of hope,
although the latter may not rise to the heights of joyful victory, but,
as Gerlach expresses himself, "merely glimmers from afar, like the
morning star through the clouds, which does not indeed itself dispel the
shadows of the night, though it announces that the rising of the sun is
near, and that it shall obtain the victory."
