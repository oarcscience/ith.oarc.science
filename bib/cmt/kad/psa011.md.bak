### [Psalms Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 11:0</span></span>

Refusal to Flee When in a Perilous Situation.

[Psa 11:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md), which likewise
confidently sets the all-seeing eye of Jahve before the ungodly who
carry out their murderous designs under cover of the darkness, is placed
after Ps 10. The life of David (to whom even Hitzig and Ewald ascribe
this Psalm) is threatened, the pillars of the state are shaken, they
counsel the king to flee to the mountains. These are indications of the
time when the rebellion of Absolom was secretly preparing, but still
clearly discernible. Although hurrying on with a swift measure and clear
in the principal thoughts, still this Psalm is not free from difficult
points, just as it is with all the Psalms which contain similar dark
passages from the internal condition of Israel. The gloomy condition of
the nation seems to be reflected in the very language. The strophic plan
is not easily discernible; nevertheless we cannot go far wrong in
dividing the Psalm into two seven line strophes with a two line
epiphonema.

[Psalms 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 11:1</span></span>

David rejects the advice of his friends to save his life by flight.
Hidden in Jahve ([Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md); [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008).md) he needs no other refuge.
However well-meant and well-grounded the advice, he considers it too
full of fear and is himself too confident in God, to follow it. David
also introduces his friends as speaking in other passages in the Psalms
belonging to the period of the Absolom persecution, [Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md); [Psa
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007.md). Their want of courage, which he
afterwards had to reprove and endeavour to restore, showed itself even
before the storm had burst, as we see here. With the words "how can you
say" he rejects their proposal as unreasonable, and turns it as a
reproach against them. If the Chethb, נוּדוּ, is adopted, then those who
are well-disposed, say to David, including with him his nearest subjects
who are faithful to him: retreat to your mountain, (ye) birds (צפּור
collective as in [Psa 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#009.md); [Psa
148:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#010).md); or, since this address sounds
too derisive to be appropriate to the lips of those who are supposed to
be speaking here: like birds (comparatio decurtata as in [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md); [Psa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md); [Psa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005.md); [Psa
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008).md). הרכס which seems more natural
in connection with the vocative rendering of צפור (cf. [Isa
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#006.md) with [Eze
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#004).md) may also be explained, with the
comparative rendering, without any need for the conjecture הר כמו צפור
(cf. [Deu 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019).md), as a retrospective
glance at the time of the persecution under Saul: to the mountains,
which formerly so effectually protected you (cf. [Sa1
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#020.md); [Sa1
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014).md). But the Ker, which is followed
by the ancient versions, exchanges נודו for גוּדי, cf שׁחי [Isa
51:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#023.md). Even reading it thus we should
not take צפור, which certainly is epicoene, as vocative: flee to your
mountain, O bird (Hitz.); and for this reason, that this form of address
is not appropriate to the idea of those who profer their counsel. But we
should take it as an equation instead of a comparison: fly to your
mountain (which gave you shelter formerly), a bird, i.e., after the
manner of a bird that flies away to its mountain home when it is chased
in the plain. But this Ker appears to be a needless correction, which
removes the difficulty of נודו coming after לנפשׁי, by putting another
in the place of this synallage numeri.

(Note: According to the above rendering: "Flee ye to your mountain, a
bird" it would require to be accented נודו הרכם צפוז (as a
transformation from נודו הרכם צפור vid., Baer's Accentssystem XVIII. 2).
The interpunction as we have it, נודו הרכם צפור, harmonises with the
interpretation of Varenius as of Lb Spira (Pentateuch-Comm. 1815):
Fugite (o socii Davidis), mons vester (h. e. praesidium vestrum, [Psa
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#008), cui innitimini.md) est avis
errans.)

In [Psa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002.md) the faint-hearted ones
give as the ground of their advice, the fearful peril which threatens
from the side of crafty and malicious foes. As הנּה implies, this danger
is imminent. The perfect overrides the future: they are not only already
in the act of bending the bow, they have made ready their arrow, i.e.,
their deadly weapon, upon the string (יתר = מיתר, [Psa
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013.md), Arab. watar, from יתר, wata ra,
to stretch tight, extend, so that the thing is continued in one straight
line) and even taken aim, in order to discharge it (ירה with ל of the
aim, as in [Psa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005.md), with acc. of the
object) in the dark (i.e., secretly, like an assassin) at the upright
(those who by their character are opposed to them). In [Psa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003.md) the faint-hearted still further
support their advice from the present total subversion of justice.
השּׁתות are either the highest ranks, who support the edifice of the
state, according to [Isa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#010.md), or,
according to [Psa 82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005.md), [Eze
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004.md), the foundations of the state,
upon whom the existence and well-being of the land depends. We prefer
the latter, since the king and those who are loyal to him, who are
associated in thought with צדּיק, are compared to the שׁתות. The
construction of the clause beginning with כּי is like [Job
38:41](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#041.md). The fut. has a present
signification. The perf. in the principal clause, as it frequently does
elsewhere (e.g., [Psa 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#008.md); [Psa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#011.md); [Gen
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007.md); [Num
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010.md); [Job
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009.md); [Kg2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#009).md) in interrogative sentences,
corresponds to the Latin conjunctive (here quid fecerit), and is to be
expressed in English by the auxiliary verbs: when the bases of the state
are shattered, what can the righteous do? he can do nothing. And all
counter-effort is so useless that it is well to be as far from danger as
possible.

[Psalms 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 11:4</span></span>

The words of David's counsellors who fear for him are now ended. And
David justifies his confidence in God with which he began his song.
Jahve sits enthroned above all that takes place on earth that
disheartens those of little faith. At an infinite distance above the
earth, and also above Jerusalem, now in rebellion, is a קדשׁ היכל קד,
[Psa 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md); [Psa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md), and in this holy temple is
Jahve, the Holy One. Above the earth are the heavens, and in heaven is
the throne of Jahve, the King of kings. And this temple, this palace in
the heavens, is the place whence issues the final decision of all
earthly matters, [Hab 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md); [Mic
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002.md). For His throne above is also the
super-terrestrial judgment-seat, [Psa
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008.md); [Psa
103:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019.md). Jahve who sits thereon is the
all-seeing and omniscient One. חזה prop. to split, cf. cernere, is used
here according to its radical meaning, of a sharp piercing glance. בּחן
prop. to try metals by fire, of a fixed and penetrating look that sees
into a thing to the foundation of its inmost nature. The mention of the
eyelids is intentional. When we observe a thing closely or ponder over
it, we draw the eyelids together, in order that our vision may be more
concentrated and direct, and become, as it were, one ray piercing
through the object. Thus are men open to the all-seeing eyes, the
all-searching looks of Jahve: the just and the unjust alike. He tries
the righteous, i.e., He knows that in the depth of his soul there is an
upright nature that will abide all testing ([Psa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md); [Job
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010).md), so that He lovingly protects
him, just as the righteous lovingly depends upon Him. And His soul hates
(i.e., He hates him with all the energy of His perfectly and essentially
holy nature) the evil-doer and him that delights in the violence of the
strong towards the weak. And the more intense this hatred, the more
fearful will be the judgments in which it bursts forth.

[Psalms 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 11:7</span></span>

[Psa 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007.md), which assumes a declaration
of something that is near at hand, is opposed to our rendering the
voluntative form of the fut., ימטר, as expressive of a wish. The shorter
form of the future is frequently indicative in the sense of the future,
e.g., [Psa 72:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#013.md), or of the present,
e.g., [Psa 58:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#005.md), or of the past, [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md). Thus it here affirms a fact of
the future which follows as a necessity from [Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004.md), [Psa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#005.md). Assuming that פּהים might be
equivalent to פּחמים, even then the Hebrew פּחם, according to the
general usage of the language, in distinction from גּחלת, does not
denote burning, but black coals. It ought therefore to have been אשׁ
פּחמי. Hitzig reads פּהים from פּיח ashes; but a rain of ashes is no
medium of punishment. Bצttcher translates it "lumps" according to [Exo
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#003.md); [Num
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#003.md); but in these passages the word
means thin plates. We adhere to the signification snares, [Job
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#010.md), cf. [Job
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017.md), [Pro
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#005.md); and following the accentuation,
we understand it to be a means of punishment by itself. First of all
descends a whole discharge of missiles which render all attempt at
flight impossible, viz., lightnings; for the lightning striking out its
course and travelling from one point in the distance, bending itself
like a serpent, may really be compared to a snare, or noose, thrown down
from above. In addition to fire and brimstone ([Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024).md) we have also רוּח זלעפות. The
lxx renders it πνεῦμα καταιγίδος, and the Targum זעפא עלעוּלא, procella
turbinea. The root is not לעף, which cannot be sustained as a cognate
form of להב, לאב to burn, but זעף, which (as [Sa1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#010) shows.md) exactly corresponds to the
Latin aestuare which combines in itself the characteristics of heat and
violent motion, therefore perhaps: a wind of flames, i.e., the deadly
simoom, which, according to the present division of the verse is
represented in connection with אשׁ וגפרית, as the breath of the divine
wrath pouring itself forth like a stream of brimstone, [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md). It thus also becomes clear how
this can be called the portion of their cup, i.e., what is adjudged to
them as the contents of their cup which they must drain off. מנת (only
found in the Davidic Psalms, with the exception of [Ch2
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004).md) is both absolutivus and
constructivus according to Olshausen (108, c, 165, i), and is derived
from manajath, or manawath, which the original feminine termination ath,
the final weak radical being blended with it. According to Hupfeld it is
constr., springing from מנית, like קצת (in Dan. and Neh.) form קצות. But
probably it is best to regard it as = מנות or מנית, like גּלות = גּלות.

Thus then Jahve is in covenant with David. Even though he cannot defend
himself against his enemies, still, when Jahve gives free course to His
hatred in judgment, they will then have to do with the powers of wrath
and death, which they will not be able to escape. When the closing
distich bases this different relation of God towards the righteous and
the unrighteous and this judgment of the latter on the righteousness of
God, we at once perceive what a totally different and blessed end awaits
the righteous. As Jahve Himself is righteous, so also on His part ([Sa1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#007.md); [Mic
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005), and frequently.md) and on the part
of man ([Isa 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015).md) He loves צדקות,
the works of righteousness. The object of אהב (= אהב) stands at the head
of the sentence, as in [Psa 99:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#004.md), cf.
[Psa 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014.md). In [Psa
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007.md) ישׂר designates the upright as a
class, hence it is the more natural for the predicate to follow in the
plur. (cf. [Psa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007.md); [Job
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019).md) than to precede as elsewhere
([Pro 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001.md); [Isa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004).md). The rendering: "His countenance
looks upon the upright man" (Hengst. and others) is not a probable one,
just because one expects to find something respecting the end of the
upright in contrast to that of the ungodly. This rendering is also
contrary to the general usage of the language, according to which פנים
is always used only as that which is to be seen, not as that which
itself sees. It ought to have been עינימו, [Psa
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#018.md); [Psa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016.md); [Job
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007.md). It must therefore be translated
according to [Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md); [Psa
140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md) : the upright (quisquis probus
est) shall behold His countenance. The pathetic form פנימו instead of
פּניו was specially admissible here, where God is spoken of (as in [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md), cf. [Isa
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015).md). It ought not to be denied any
longer that mo is sometimes (e.g., [Job
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023.md), cf. [Job
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002.md); [Job
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023).md) a dignified singular suffix. To
behold the face of God is in itself impossible to mortals without dying.
But when God reveals Himself in love, then He makes His countenance
bearable to the creature. And to enjoy this vision of God softened by
love is the highest honour God in His mercy can confer on a man; it is
the blessedness itself that is reserved for the upright, 140:14. It is
not possible to say that what is intended is a future vision of God; but
it is just as little possible to say that it is exclusively a vision in
this world. To the Old Testament conception the future עולם is certainly
lost in the night of Shel. But faith broke through this night, and
consoled itself with a future beholding of God, [Job
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026.md). The redemption of the New
Testament has realised this aspiration of faith, since the Redeemer has
broken through the night of the realm of the dead, has borne on high
with Him the Old Testament saints, and translated them into the sphere
of the divine love revealed in heaven.
