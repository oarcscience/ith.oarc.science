<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 3:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>With this verse the doctrine begins; &#1488;&#1500; (not &#1500;&#1488;) shows the 3a does not continue the promise of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002">Pro 3:2</A>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (R. &#1495;&#1501;, stringere, afficere) is, according to the prevailing usage of the language, well-affectedness, it may be of God toward men, or of men toward God, or of men toward one another - a loving disposition, of the same meaning as the N.T. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; (vid., e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006">Hos 6:6</A>). &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; (from &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;), continuance, a standing to one's promises, and not falsifying just expectations; thus fidelity, &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, in the interrelated sense of fides and fidelitas. These two states of mind and of conduct are here contemplated as moral powers (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008">Psa 61:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003">Psa 43:3</A>), which are of excellent service, and bring precious gain; and 4b shows that their ramification on the side of God and of men, the religious and the moral, remains radically inseparable. The suffix  &#1501; does not refer to the doctrine and the precepts, but to these two cardinal virtues. If the disciple is admonished to bind them about his neck (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009">Pro 1:9</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022">Pro 3:22</A>), so here reference is made, not to ornament, nor yet to protection against evil influences by means of them, as by an amulet
<p>(Note: Fleischer is here reminded of the giraffe in the Jardin des Plantes, the head of which was adorned by its Arabic keeper with strings and jewels, the object of which was to turn aside the &#8219;ain [the bad, mischievous look] from the precious beast.)
<p>(for which proofs are wanting), but to the signet which was wont to be constantly carried (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#018">Gen 38:18</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006">Sol 8:6</A>) on a string around the neck. The parallel member 3c confirms this; 3b and 3c together put us in mind of the Tephillim (phylacteries), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#016">Exo 13:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008">Deu 6:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018">Deu 11:18</A>, in which what is here a figure is presented in external form, but as the real figure of that which is required in the inward parts. &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, Arab. l'ah, to begin to shine, e.g., of a shooting star, gleaming sword; vid., Wetzstein, Deutsch. morgenl. Zeitschr. xxii. 151f.) signifies the tablet prepared for writing by means of polish; to write love and fidelity on the tablet of the heart, is to impress deeply on the heart the duty of both virtues, so that one will be impelled to them from within outward (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033">Jer 31:33</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004">Proverbs 3:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 3:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>To the admonitory imper. there follows here a second, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#004">Pro 4:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#013">Pro 20:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004">Amo 5:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020">Ch2 20:20</A>, instead of which also the perf. consec. might stand; the counsellor wishes, with the good to which he advises, at the same time to present its good results. &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; is (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#003">Sa1 25:3</A>) the appearance, for the Arab. shakl means forma, as uniting or binding the lineaments or contours into one figure, &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, according to which &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; may be interpreted of the pleasing and advantageous impression which the well-built external appearance of a man makes, as an image of that which his internal excellence produces; thus, favourable view, friendly judgment, good reputation (Ewald, Hitzig, Zckler). But everywhere else (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015">Pro 13:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010">Psa 111:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022">Ch2 30:22</A>) this phrase means good, i.e., fine, well-becoming insight, or prudence; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; has in the language of the Mishle no other meaning than intellectus, which proceeds from the inwardly forming activity of the mind. He obtains favour in the eyes of God and man, to whom favour on both sides is shown; he obtains refined prudence, to whom it is on both sides adjudicated. It is unnecessary, with Ewald and Hitzig, to assign the two objects to God and men. In the eyes of both at the same time, he who carries love and faithfulness in his heart appears as one to whom &#1495;&#1503; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; must be adjudicated. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#005">Proverbs 3:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 3:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Were "kindness and truth" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003">Pro 3:3</A>) understood only in relation to men, then the following admonition would not be interposed, since it proceeds from that going before, if there the quality of kindness and truth, not only towards man, but also towards God, is commended:
<p>5 Trust in Jahve with thy whole heart,
<p>   And lean not on thine own understanding.
<p>6 In all thy ways acknowledge Him,
<p>   And He will make plain thy paths.
<p>7 Be not wise in thine own eyes;
<p>   Fear Jahve, and depart from evil.
<p>8 Health will then come to thy navel,
<p>   And refreshing to thy bones.
<p>From God alone comes true prosperity, true help. He knows the right way to the right ends. He knows what benefits us. He is able to free us from that which does us harm: therefore it is our duty and our safety to place our confidence wholly in Him, and to trust not to our own judgment. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, Arab. bat&#803;h&#803;, has the root-meaning expandere, whence perhaps, by a more direct way than that noted under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006">Psa 4:6</A>, it acquires the meaning confidere, to lean with the whole body on something, in order to rest upon it, strengthened by &#1506;&#1500;, if one lean wholly - Fr. se reposer sur quelqu'un; Ital. riposarsi sopra alcuno, - like &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; with &#1488;&#1500;, to lean on anything, so as to be supported by it; with &#1506;&#1500;, to support oneself on anything (Fl.). &#1491;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (the same in form as &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012">Num 11:12</A>) is not fully represented by "acknowledge Him;" as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009">Ch1 28:9</A> it is not a mere theoretic acknowledgment that is meant, but earnest penetrating cognizance, engaging the whole man. The practico-mystical &#1491;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, in and of itself full of significance, according to O. and N.T. usage, is yet strengthened by toto corde. The heart is the central seat of all spiritual soul-strength; to love God with the whole heart is to concentrate the whole inner life on the active contemplation of God, and the ready observance of His will. God requites such as show regard to Him, by making plain their path before them, i.e., by leading them directly to the right end, removing all hindrances out of their way. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; has Cholem in the first syllable (vid., Kimchi's Lex.).
<p>(Note: In the st. constr. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#019">Pro 2:19</A>, and with the grave suff. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015">Pro 2:15</A>, o&#780; instead of o&#772; is in order; but Ben-Asher's &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#027">Job 13:27</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#011">Job 33:11</A>, is an inconsistency.)
<p>"Be not wise in thine own eyes" is equivalent to ne tibi sapiens videare; for, as J. H. Michaelis remarks, confidere Deo est sapere, sibi vero ac suae sapientiae, desipere. "Fear God and depart from evil" is the twofold representation of the &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, or practical piety, in the Chokma writings: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#006">Pro 16:6</A>, the Mashal <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010">Psa 34:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015">Psa 34:15</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028">Job 28:28</A> cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002">Pro 1:2</A>. For &#1505;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, the post-biblical expression is &#1497;&#1512;&#1488; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008">Pro 3:8</A>
<p>The subject to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;; (it shall be) is just this religious-moral conduct. The conjectural reading &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1498; (Clericus), &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1498; = &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; (Ewald, Hitzig), to thy flesh or body, is unnecessary; the lxx and Syr. so translating, generalize the expression, which is not according to their taste. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;, Arab. sarr, to be fast, to bind fast, properly, the umbilical cord (which the Arabs call surr, whence the denom. sarra, to cut off the umbilical cord of the newborn); thus the navel, the origin of which coincides with the independent individual existence of the new-born, and is as the firm centre (cf. Arab. saryr, foundation, basis, Job, p. 487) of the existence of the body. The system of punctuation does not, as a rule, permit the doubling of &#1512;, probably on account of the prevailing half guttural, i.e., the uvular utterance of this sound by the men of Tiberias.
<p>(Note: See my work, Physiologie u. Musik in ihrer Bedeutung fr Grammatik besonders die hebrische, pp. 11-13.)
<p>&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1468;&#1498; here, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1468;&#1498; at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004">Eze 16:4</A>, belong to the exceptions; cf. the expanded duplication in &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1498;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003">Sol 7:3</A>, to which a chief form &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512; is as little to be assumed as is a &#1492;&#1512;&#1512; to &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;. &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, healing, has here, as &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#022">Pro 4:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024">Pro 16:24</A>, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012">Eze 47:12</A>, not the meaning of restoration from sickness, but the raising up of enfeebled strength, or the confirming of that which exists; the navel comes into view as the middle point of the vis vitalis. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; is a Piel formation, corresponding to the abstract Kal formation &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; the Arab. saqa&#770;, used transit. (to give to drink), also saqqa&#770; (cf. Pu. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#024">Job 21:24</A>) and asqa&#770;, like the Hebr. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; (Hiph. of &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492;, to drink); the infin. (Arab.) saqy means, to the obliterating of the proper signification, distribution, benefaction, showing friendship, but in the passage before us is to be explained after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#024">Job 21:24</A> (the marrow of his bones is well watered; Arnheim - full of sap) and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030">Pro 15:30</A>. Bertheau and Hitzig erroneously regard <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008">Pro 3:8</A> as the conclusion to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007">Pro 3:7</A>, for they interpret &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; as the subject; but had the poet wished to be so understood, he should have written &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;. Much rather the subject is devotion withdrawn from the evil one and turned to God, which externally proves itself by the dedication to Him of earthly possessions. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009">Proverbs 3:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">pro 3:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>9 Honour Jahve with thy wealth,
<p>   And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:
<p>10 Then shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
<p>   And thy vats overflow with must.
<p>It may surprise us that the Chokma, being separated from the ceremonial law, here commends the giving of tithes. But in the first place, the consciousness of the duty of giving tithes is older than the Mosaic law, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022">Gen 28:22</A>; in this case, the giving of tithes is here a general ethical expression. &#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; do not occur in the Book of Proverbs; in the post-biblical phraseology the tithes are called &#1495;&#1500;&#1511; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, the portion of the Most High. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, as the Arab. wak&#803;k&#803;ra, to make heavy, then to regard and deal with as weighty and solemn (opp. &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, to regard and treat as light, from &#1511;&#1500;&#1500; = Arab. ha&#770;n, to be light). &#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, properly lightness in the sense of aisance, opulency, forms with &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491; an oxymoron (fac Jovam gravem de levitate tua), but one aimed at by the author neither at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#013">Pro 1:13</A> nor here. &#1502;&#1503; (in &#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498; and '&#1502;&#1512;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009">Pro 3:9</A>) is in both cases partitive, as in the law of the Levitical tenths, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030">Lev 27:30</A>, and of the Challa (heave-offering of dough), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#021">Num 15:21</A>, where also &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; (in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004">Heb 7:4</A>, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;) occurs in a similar sense, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012">Num 18:12</A> (in the law of the Theruma or wave-offering of the priests), as also &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; in the law of the second tenths, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022">Deu 14:22</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#030">Num 18:30</A> (in the law of the tenths of the priests).
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010">Pro 3:10</A>
<p>With &#1493; apodosis imperativi the conclusion begins. &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;, satisfaction, is equivalent to fulness, making satisfied, and that, too, richly satisfied; &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; ;deif also is such an accusative, as verbs of filling govern it, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, to break through especially to overflow, signifies to be or become overflowingly full (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#010">Job 1:10</A>). &#1488;&#1505;&#1501; (from &#1488;&#1505;&#1501;, Chald. &#1488;&#1505;&#1503;, Syr. a&#770;san, to lay up in granaries) is the granary, of the same meaning as the Arab. a&#770;khzan (from khazan = &#1495;&#1505;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018">Isa 23:18</A>, recondere), whence the Spanish magazen, the French and German magazin. &#1497;&#1511;&#1489; (from &#1497;&#1511;&#1489;, Arab. wakab, to be hollow) is the vat or tub into which the must flows from the wine-press (&#1490;&#1468;&#1514; or &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;), &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; or &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. Cf. the same admonition and promise in the prophetic statement of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010">Mal 3:10-12</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011">Proverbs 3:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">pro 3:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The contrast here follows. As God should not be forgotten in days of prosperity, so one should not suffer himself to be estranged from Him by days of adversity.
<p>11 The school of Jahve, my son, despise thou not,
<p>     Nor loathe thou His correction;
<p>12 For Jahve correcteth him whom He loveth,
<p>     And that as a father his son whom he loveth
<p>Vid., the original passage <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017">Job 5:17</A>. There is not for the Book of Job a more suitable motto than this tetrastich, which expresses its fundamental thought, that there is a being chastened and tried by suffering which has as its motive the love of God, and which does not exclude sonship.
<p>(Note: Here Procop. rightly distinguishes between &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; and &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;.)
<p>One may say that <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011">Pro 3:11</A> expresses the problem of the Book of Job, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012">Pro 3:12</A> its solution. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, we have translated "school," for &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, means in reality to take one into school. Ahndung [punishment] or Rge [reproof] is the German word which most corresponds to the Hebr. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492; or &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514;. &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; &#1489; (whence here the prohibitive &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1509; with &#1488;&#1500;) means to experience loathing (disgust) at anything, or aversion (vexation) toward anything. The lxx (cited <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005">Heb 12:5</A>.), &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, nor be faint-hearted, which joins in to the general thought, that we should not be frightened away from God, or let ourselves be estranged from Him by the attitude of anger in which He appears in His determination to inflict suffering. In 12a the accentuation leaves it undefined whether &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; as subject belongs to the relative or to the principal clause; the traditional succession of accents, certified also by Ben Bileam, is &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, for this passage belongs to the few in which more than three servants (viz., Mahpach, Mercha, and three Munachs) go before the Athnach.
<p>(Note: Vid., Torath Emeth, p. 19; Accentuationssystem, vi. 6; the differences between Ben-Asher and Ben-Naphtali in the Appendixes to Biblia Rabbinica; Dachselt's Biblia Accentuata, and Pinner's Prospectus, p. 91 (Odessa, 1845).)
<p>The further peculiarity is here to be observed, that &#1488;&#1514;, although without the Makkeph, retains its Segol, besides here only in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005">Psa 47:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002">Psa 60:2</A>. 12b is to be interpreted thus (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005">Pro 9:5</A>): "and (that) as a father the son, whom he loves." The &#1493; is explanatory, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#003">Sa1 28:3</A> (Gesenius, 155, 1a), and &#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; (which one may supplement by &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;) is a defining clause having the force of a clause with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. The translation et ut pater qui filio bene cupit, is syntactically (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011">Isa 40:11</A>) and accentually (vid., 13b) not less admissible, but translating "and as a father he holds his son dear," or with Hitzig (after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#010">Jer 31:10</A>, a passage not quite syntactically the same), "and holds him dear, as a father his son" (which Zckler without syntactical authority prefers on account of the 2nd modus, cf. e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018">Psa 51:18</A>), does not seem a right parallel clause, since the giving of correction is the chief point, and the love only the accompanying consideration (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024">Pro 13:24</A>). According to our interpretation, &#1497;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495; is to be carried forward in the mind from 12a. The lxx find the parallel word in &#1497;&#1499;&#1488;&#1489;, for they translate &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and thus have read &#1497;&#1499;&#1488;&#1489; or &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1488;&#1489;.

<p>Such submission to God, the All-wise, the All-directing, who loves us with fatherly affection, is wisdom, and such wisdom is above all treasures.
<p>13 Blessed is the man who has found wisdom,
<p>     And the man who has gained understanding;
<p>14 For better is her acquisition than the acquisition of silver,
<p>     And her gain than fine gold.
<p>15 More precious is she than corals;
<p>     And all thy jewels do not equal her value.
<p>The imperfect &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;, which as the Hiph. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, exire, has the general meaning educere, interchanges with the perfect &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;. This bringing forth is either a delivering up, i.e., giving out or presenting, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010">Isa 58:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009">Psa 140:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013">Psa 144:13</A> (cf. &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;, Arab. nafak&#803;, to give out, to pay out), or a fetching out, getting out, receiving, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035">Pro 8:35</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002">Pro 12:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022">Pro 18:22</A>. Thus 13a reminds one of the parable of the treasure in the field, and 13b of that of the goodly pearl for which the &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; who sought the pearl parted with all that he had. Here also is declared the promise of him who trades with a merchant for the possession of wisdom; for &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; and &#1505;&#1495;&#1512; (both, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003">Isa 23:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018">Isa 23:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015">Isa 45:15</A>, from &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, the latter after the forms &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, &#1504;&#1496;&#1506;, without our needing to assume a second primary form, &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;) go back to the root-word &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, to trade, go about as a trader, with the fundamental meaning &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (lxx); and also the mention of the pearls is not wanting here, for at all events the meaning "pearls" has blended itself with &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which is a favourite word in the Mashal poetry, though it be not the original meaning of the word. In 14b &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; is surpassed by &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (besides in the Proverbs, found only in this meaning in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014">Psa 68:14</A>), which properly means ore found in a mine, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1509;, to cut in, to dig up, and hence the poetic name of gold, perhaps of gold dug out as distinguished from molten gold. Hitzig regards &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; as identical with it; but this word (Sanskr. without the ending hir, Zench. zar) is derived from ghar, to glitter (vid., Curtius). &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; we have translated "gain," for it does not mean the profit which wisdom brings, the tribute which it yields, but the gain, the possession of wisdom herself.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015">Pro 3:15</A>
<p>As regards &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, for which the Kethb has &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the following things are in favour of the fundamental meaning "corals," viz.: (1.) The name itself, which corresponds with the Arab. fann; this word, proceeding from the root-idea of shooting forth, particularly after the manner of plants, means the branch and all that raises or multiplies itself branch-like or twig-like (Fleischer). (2.) The redness attributed to the &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007">Lam 4:7</A>, in contradistinction to the pure whiteness attributed to snow and milk (vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#018">Job 28:18</A>). The meaning of the word may, however, have become generalized in practice (lxx in loc. &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, Graec. Venet. &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;); the meaning "pearls," given to it in the Job-Targum by Rashi, and particularly by Bochart, lay so much the nearer as one may have wrought also corals and precious stones, such as the carbuncle, sardius, and sapphire, into the form of pearls. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, in consequence of the retrogression of the tone, has Munach on the penult., and that as an exception, as has been remarked by the Masora, since in substantives and proper names terminating in  &#1492; the &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, i.e., the receding of the tone, does not elsewhere appear, e.g., &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#014">Gen 12:14</A>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009">Sol 6:9</A>, &#1510;&#1512;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007">Jer 30:7</A>. &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; is first abstr., a being inclined to something, lust, will, pleasure in anything, then also concr., anything in which one has pleasure, what is beautiful, precious; cf. Arab. nf&#305;&#770;s, _hyy, hence hja&#770;rt nf&#305;&#770;st, precious stones" (Fleischer). &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492; with &#1489; means to be an equivalent (purchase-price, exchange) for anything; the most natural construction in Arab. as well as in Hebr. is that with &#1500;, to be the equivalent of a thing (vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027">Job 33:27</A>); the &#1489; is the Beth pretii, as if one said in Arab.: biabi anta thou art in the estimate of my father, I give it for thee. One distinctly perceives in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014">Pro 3:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015">Pro 3:15</A>, the echo of Job 28. This tetrastich occurs again with a slight variation at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#010">Pro 8:10-11</A>. The Talmud and the Midrash accent it so, that in the former the expression is &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, and in the latter &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1498;, and they explain the latter of precious stones and pearls (&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;).

<p>That wisdom is of such incomparable value is here confirmed:
<p>16 Length of days is in her right hand;
<p>     In her left, riches and honour.
<p>17 Her ways are pleasant ways,
<p>     And all her paths are peace.
<p>18 A tree of life is she to those that lay hold upon her,
<p>     And he who always holdeth her fast is blessed.
<p>As in the right hand of Jahve, according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011">Psa 16:11</A>, are pleasures for evermore, so Wisdom holds in her right hand "length of days," viz., of the days of life, thus life, the blessing of blessings; in her left, riches and honour (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018">Pro 8:18</A>), the two good things which, it is true, do not condition life, but, received from Wisdom, and thus wisely, elevate the happiness of life-in the right hand is the chief good, in the left the &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033">Mat 6:33</A>.

<p>&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1506;&#1501; are ways on which one obtains what is agreeable to the inner and the outer man, and which it does good to enjoy. The parallel &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is not a genitive to &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; to be supplied; that paths of Wisdom are themselves &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, for she brings well-being on all sides and deep inwards satisfaction (peace). In regard to &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, via eminens, elata, Schultens is right (vid., under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015">Pro 1:15</A>);

The figure of the tree of life the fruit of which brings immortality, is, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030">Pro 11:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004">Pro 15:4</A> (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012">Pro 13:12</A>), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007">Rev 2:7</A>, taken from the history of paradise in the Book of Genesis. The old ecclesiastical saying, Lignum vitae crux Christi, accommodates itself in a certain measure, through <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019">Mat 11:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049">Luk 11:49</A>, with this passage of the Book of Proverbs. &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511; &#1489; means to fasten upon anything, more fully expressed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#018">Gen 21:18</A>, to bind the hand firm with anything, to seize it firmly. They who give themselves to Wisdom, come to experience that she is a tree of life whose fruit contains and communicates strength of life, and whoever always keeps fast hold of Wisdom is blessed, i.e., to be pronounced happy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003">Psa 41:3</A>, vid., under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008">Psa 137:8</A>).

It is the so-called distributive singular of the predicate, which is freely used particularly in those cases where the plur. of the subject is a participle (vid., under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035">Pro 3:35</A>).

<p>This place of a mediatrix - the speaker here now continues - she had from the beginning. God's world-creating work was mediated by her:
<p>19 Jahve hath by wisdom founded the earth,
<p>     Established the heavens by understanding.
<p>20 By His knowledge the water-floods broke forth,
<p>     And the sky dropped down dew.
<p>That wisdom is meant by which God planned the world-idea, and now also wrought it out; the wisdom in which God conceived the world ere it was framed, and by which also He gave external realization to His thoughts; the wisdom which is indeed an attribute of God and a characteristic of His actions, since she is a property of His nature, and His nature attests itself in her, but not less, as appears, not from this group of tetrastichs, but from all that has hitherto been said, and form the personal testimony, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022">Pro 8:22</A>., of which it is the praeludium, she goes forth as a divine power to which God has given to have life in herself. Considered apart from the connection of these discourses, this group of verses, as little as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#002">Jer 10:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024">Psa 104:24</A>, determines regarding the attributive interpretation; the Jerusalem Targum, I, when it translates, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001">Gen 1:1</A>, &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; by &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1502;&#1488; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1502;&#1514;&#1488;), combines <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022">Pro 8:22</A> with such passages as this before us. &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; (here with the tone thrown back) properly signifies, like the Arab. wasad, to lay fast, to found, for one gives to a fact the firm basis of its existence. The parallel Pil. of &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (Arab. ka&#770;n, cogn. &#1499;&#1492;&#1503;, see on Isaiah, p. 691) signifies to set up, to restore; here equivalent to, to give existence.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#020">Pro 3:20</A>
<p>It is incorrect to understand 20a, with the Targ., of division, i.e., separating the water under the firmament from the water above the firmament; &#1504;&#1489;&#1511;&#1506; is spoken of water, especially of its breaking forth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011">Gen 7:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021">Exo 14:21</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015">Psa 74:15</A>, properly dividing itself out, i.e., welling forth from the bowels of the earth; it means, without distinguishing the primordial waters and the later water-floods confined within their banks (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008">Job 38:8</A>., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006">Psa 104:6-8</A>), the overflowing of the earth for the purpose of its processes of cultivation and the irrigation of the land. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; = &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, to groan, to roar) are chiefly the internal water stores of the earth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025">Gen 49:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007">Psa 33:7</A>. But while 20a is to be understood of the waters under the firmament, 20b is to be interpreted of those above. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, Arab. sh&#803;ak&#803;, comminuere, attenuare) properly designates the uppermost stratum of air thinly and finely stretching itself far and wide, and then poetically the clouds of heaven (vid., under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018">Psa 77:18</A>). Another name, &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, comes from &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;, which is transposed from &#1512;&#1506;&#1507; (here used in 20b), Arab. r'af, to drop, to run. The &#1496;&#1500; added on the object accusative represents synecdochically all the waters coming down from heaven and fructifying the earth. This watering proceeds from above (&#1493;&#1512;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;); on the contrary, the endowing of the surface of the earth with great and small rivers is a fundamental fact in creation (&#1504;&#1489;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;).

<p>From this eminence, in which the work of creation presents wisdom, exhortations are now deduced, since the writer always expresses himself only with an ethical intention regarding the nature of wisdom:
<p>21 My son, may they not depart from thine eyes - 
<p>     Preserve thoughtfulness and consideration,
<p>22 And they will be life to thy soul
<p>     And grace to thy neck.

Regarding &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, obliquari, deflectere, see under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015">Pro 2:15</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#021">Pro 4:21</A>; regarding &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (here defective after the Masora, as rightly in Vened. 1515, 1521, and Nissel, 1662), see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007">Pro 2:7</A>; &#1497;&#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1494;&#1504;&#1492;, see at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002">Pro 3:2</A>.

In 22a the synallage generis is continued: &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">pro 3:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>But more than this, wisdom makes its possessor in all situations of life confident in God:
<p>23 Then shalt thou go thy way with confidence,
<p>     And thy foot shall not stumble.
<p>24 When thou liest down, thou are not afraid,
<p>     But thou layest thyself down and hast sweet sleep.
<p>25 Thou needest not be afraid of sudden alarm,
<p>     Nor for the storm of the wicked when it breaketh forth.
<p>26 For Jahve will be thy confidence
<p>     And keep thy foot from the snare.
<p>The &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; (cf. our "bei guter Laune" = in good cheer), with &#1500; of the condition, is of the same meaning as the conditional adverbial accusative &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009">Pro 10:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#033">Pro 1:33</A>. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#023">Pro 3:23</A> the lxx translate &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#837;, while, on the contrary, at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012">Psa 91:12</A> they make the person the subject (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;.); here also we retain more surely the subject from 23a, especially since for the intrans. of &#1504;&#1490;&#1507; (to smite, to push) a Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1507; is used <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016">Jer 13:16</A>. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#024">Pro 3:24</A> there is the echo of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018">Job 11:18</A>, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025">Pro 3:25</A> of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#021">Job 5:21</A>. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#024">Pro 3:24</A> is altogether the same as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#024">Job 5:24</A> : et decumbes et suavis erit somnus tuus = si decubueris, suavis erit. The hypothetic perf., according to the sense, is both there and at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018">Job 11:18</A> (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009">Jer 20:9</A>) oxytoned as perf. consec. Similar examples are <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022">Pro 6:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#013">Gen 33:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#031">Sa1 25:31</A>, cf. Ewald, 357a. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (of sleep as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#026">Jer 31:26</A>) is from &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, which in Hebr. is used of pleasing impressions, as the Arab. &#8219;ariba of a lively, free disposition. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, somnus (nom. actionis from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, with the ground-form sina preserved in the Arab. lidat, vid., Job, p. 284, note), agrees in inflexion with &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, annus. &#1488;&#1500;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025">Pro 3:25</A>, denies, like <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003">Psa 121:3</A>, with emphasis: be afraid only not = thou hast altogether nothing to fear. Schultens rightly says: Subest species prohibitionis et tanquam abominationis, ne tale quicquam vel in suspicionem veniat in mentemve cogitando admittatur. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; here means terror, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026">Pro 1:26</A>., the terrific object; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1501; (with the accus. om) is the virtual genitive, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002">Pro 26:2</A> &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; (with accus. am). Regarding &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, see under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027">Pro 1:27</A>. The genitive &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; may be, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#018">Psa 37:18</A>, the genit. subjecti, but still it lies nearer to say that he who chooses the wisdom of God as his guiding star has no ground to fear punishment as transgressors have reason to fear it; the &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; is meant which wisdom threatens against transgressors, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027">Pro 1:27</A>. He needs have no fear of it, for wisdom is a gift of God, and binds him who receives it to the giver: Jahve becomes and is henceforth his confidence. Regarding &#1489; essentiae, which expresses the closest connection of the subject with the predicate which it introduces, see under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002">Psa 35:2</A>. As here, so also at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#004">Exo 18:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007">Psa 118:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006">Psa 146:6</A>, the predicate is a noun with a pronominal suffix. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; is, as at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#007">Psa 78:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024">Job 31:24</A>, cognate to &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492;,
<p>(Note: According to Malbim, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; is the expectation of good, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, confidence in the presence of evil.)
<p>the object and ground of confidence. That the word in other connections may mean also fool-hardiness, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014">Psa 49:14</A>, and folly, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025">Ecc 7:25</A> (cf. regarding &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, which in Arab. as bel&#305;&#770;d denotes the dull, in Hebr. fools, see under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022">Pro 1:22</A>), it follows that it proceeds from the fundamental conception of fulness of flesh and of fat, whence arise the conceptions of dulness and slothfulness, as well as of confidence, whether confidence in self or in God (see Schultens l.c., and Wnsche's Hosea, p. 207f.). &#1500;&#1499;&#1491; is taking, catching, as in a net or trap or pit, from &#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, to catch (cf. Arab. lakida, to fasten, III, IV to hold fast); another root-meaning, in which Arab. lak connects itself with nak, nk, to strike, to assail (whence al-lakdat, the assault against the enemy, Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitsch. xxii. 140), is foreign to the Hebr. Regarding the &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, Fleischer remarks: "The &#1502;&#1503; after the verbs of guarding, preserving, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; and &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;, properly expresses that one by those means holds or seeks to hold a person or thing back from something, like the Lat. defendere, tueri aliquem ab hostibus, a perculo."
<p>(Note: Hitzig rejects <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022">Pro 3:22-26</A> as a later interpolation. And why? Because chap. 3, which he regards as a complete discourse, consists of twice ten verses beginning with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. In addition to this symmetry other reasons easily reveal themselves to his penetration. But the discourses contained in chap. 1-9 do not all begin with &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020">Pro 1:20</A>); and when it stands in the beginning of the discourse, it is not always the first word (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008">Pro 1:8</A>); and when it occurs as the first word or in the first line, it does not always commence a new discourse (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015">Pro 1:15</A> in the middle of the first, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011">Pro 3:11</A> in the middle of the fourth); and, moreover, the Hebr. poetry and oratory does not reckon according to verses terminated by Soph Pasuk, which are always accented distichs, but they in reality frequently consist of three or more lines. The rejected verses are in nothing unlike those that remain, and which are undisputed; they show the same structure of stichs, consisting for the most part of three, but sometimes also only of two words (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022">Pro 3:22</A> with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009">Pro 1:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010">Pro 1:10</A>), the same breadth in the course of the thoughts, and the same accord with Job and Deuteronomy.)

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">pro 3:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The first illustration of neighbourly love which is recommended, is readiness to serve:
<p>27 Refuse no manner of good to him to whom it is due
<p>     When it is in thy power to do it.
<p>28 Say not to thy neighbour, "Go, and come again,
<p>     To-morrow I will give it," whilst yet thou hast it.
<p>Regarding the intensive plur. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; with a sing. meaning, see under <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019">Pro 1:19</A>. The form of expression without the suffix is not &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; but &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;; and this denotes here, not him who does good (&#1489;&#1506;&#1500; as Arab. dhw or s&#803;ah&#803;ab), but him to whom the good deed is done (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008">Pro 17:8</A>), i.e., as here, him who is worthy of it (&#1489;&#1506;&#1500; as Arab. a&#770;hl), him who is the man for it (Jewish interp.: &#1502;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;). We must refuse nothing good (nothing either legally or morally good) to him who has a right to it (&#1502;&#1504;&#1506; &#1502;&#1503; as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#007">Job 22:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016">Job 31:16</A>),
<p>(Note: Accentuate &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1506; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, not &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1506;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;. The doubling of the Makkeph is purposeless, and, on the contrary, the separating of &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; from &#1502;&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; by the Dechi (the separating accent subordinate to Athnach) is proper. It is thus in the best MSS.)
<p>if we are in a condition to do him this good. The phrase &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029">Gen 31:29</A>, and frequently, signifies: it is belonging to (practicable) the power of my hand, i.e., I have the power and the means of doing it. As &#1494;&#1491; signifies the haughty, insolent, but may be also used in the neuter of insolent conduct (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014">Psa 19:14</A>), so &#1488;&#1500; signifies the strong, but also (although only in this phrase) strength. The Keri rejects the plur. &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;, because elsewhere the hand always follows &#1500;&#1488;&#1500; in the singular. But it rejects the plur. &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#028">Pro 3:28</A>) because the address following is directed to one person. Neither of these emendations was necessary. The usage of the language permits exceptions, notwithstanding the usus tyrannus, and the plur. &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; may be interpreted distributively: to thy fellows, it may be this one or that one. Hitzig also regards &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; as a singular; but the masc. of &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1492;, the ground-form of which is certainly ra&#8219;j, is &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, or shorter, &#1512;&#1506;. &#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; does not mean: forth! go home again! but: go, and come again. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, to come again, to return to something, to seek it once more.
<p>(Note: Thus also (Arab.) raj' is used in Thaalebi's Confidential Companion, p. 24, line 3, of Flgel's ed. Admission was prevented to one Haschmid, then angry he sought it once more; he was again rejected, then he sought it not again (Arab. flm yraj'), but says, etc. Flgel has misunderstood the passage. Fleischer explains raj', with reference to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#028">Pro 3:28</A>, by revenir  la charge.)
<p>The &#1493; of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; is, as 29b, the conditional: quum sit penes te, sc. quod ei des. "To-morrow shall I give" is less a promise than a delay and putting off, because it is difficult for him to alienate himself from him who makes the request. This holding fast by one's own is unamiable selfishness; this putting off in the fulfilment of one's duty is a sin of omission - &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, as the lxx adds, &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">pro 3:29</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A second illustration of neighbourly love is harmlessness:
<p>Devise not evil against thy neighbour,
<p>While he dwelleth securely by thee.
<p>The verb &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, signifies to cut into, and is used of the faber ferrarius as well as of the &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; (Isaiah, p. 463), who with a cutting instrument (&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#022">Gen 4:22</A>) works with metal or wood, and from his profession is called &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;. But the word means as commonly to plough, i.e., to cut with the plough, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is used also of a ploughman, and, without any addition to it, it always has this meaning. It is then a question whether the metaphorical phrase &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to fabricate evil, cf. dolorum faber, mendacia procudere, &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, and the Homeric &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (Fleischer and most others), or to plough evil (Rashi, Ewald, etc.). The Targ., Syriac, and Jerome translate &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, without deciding the point, by moliri; but the lxx and Graecus Venet. by &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. The correctness of these renderings is not supported by Ezek. 21:36, where &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; are not such as fabricate destruction, but smiths who cause destruction; also &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009">Sa1 23:9</A>, proves nothing, and probably does not at all appertain to &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; incidere (Keil), but to &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; silere, in the sense of dolose moliri. On the one hand, it is to be observed from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008">Job 4:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013">Hos 10:13</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003">Psa 129:3</A>, that the meaning arare malum might connect itself with &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;; and the proverb of Sirach 7:12, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, places this beyond a doubt. Therefore in this phrase, if one keeps before him a clear perception of the figure, at one time the idea of fabricating, at another that of ploughing, is presented before us. The usage of the language in the case before us is more in favour of the latter than of the former. Whether &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1488;&#1514; means to dwell together with, or as Bttcher, to sit together with, after <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001">Psa 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004">Psa 26:4</A>., need not be a matter of dispute. It means in general a continued being together, whether as sitting, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013">Job 2:13</A>, or as dwelling, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#011">Jdg 17:11</A>.
<p>(Note: Accentuate &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;. It is thus in correct texts. The Rebia Mugrash is transformed, according to the Accentuationssystem, xviii. 2.)
<p>To take advantage of the regardlessness of him who imparts to us his confidence is unamiable. Love is doubly owing to him who resigns himself to it because he believes in it.

<p>A third illustration of the same principle is peaceableness:
<p>Contend not with a man without a cause,
<p>When he has inflicted no evil upon thee.
<p>Instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, or as the Ker&#305;&#770; has amended it &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, the abbreviated form &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; or &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; would be more correct after &#1488;&#1500;; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; or &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; (from &#1512;&#1489;, to be compact) means to fall upon one another, to come to hand-blows, to contend. Contending and quarrelling with a man, whoever he may be, without sufficient reason, ought to be abandoned; but there exists no such reason if he has done me no harm which I have to reproach him with. &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; with the accus. or dat. of the person signifies to bring evil upon any one, malum inferre, or also referre (Schultens), for &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; (cogn. &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;) signifies to execute, to complete, accomplish - both of the initiative and of the requital, both of the anticipative and of the recompensing action; here in the former of these senses. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031">Proverbs 3:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">pro 3:31</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>These exhortations to neighbourly love in the form of warning against whatever is opposed to it, are followed by the warning against fellowship with the loveless:
<p>31 Be not envious toward the man of violence,
<p>     And have no pleasure in all his ways.
<p>32 For an abhorrence to Jahve is the perverse,
<p>     But with the upight is His secret.
<p>The conceptions of jealousy and envy lie in &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; (derived by Schultens from &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;, Arab. k&#803;ana&#770;, intensius rubere) inseparable from each other. The lxx, which for &#1514;&#1511;&#1504;&#1488; reads &#1514;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; (&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;), brings the envy into 31b, as if the words here were &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1512;, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001">Psa 37:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007">Psa 37:7</A> (there the lxx has &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, here &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c2;). There is no reason for correcting our text in accordance with this (substituting &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1512; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; as Hitzig does), because &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; would be too vague an expression for the object of the envy, while &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; altogether agrees with it; and the contrary remark, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is fundamentally no &#1489;&#1495;&#1512;, fails since (1) &#1489;&#1495;&#1512; frequently expresses pleasure in anything without the idea of choice, and (2) "have not pleasure in all his ways" is in the Hebrew style equivalent to "in any one of his ways;" Ewald, 323b. He who does "violence to the law" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004">Zep 3:4</A>) becomes thereby, according to the common course of the world, a person who is feared, whose authority, power, and resources are increased, but one must not therefore envy him, nor on any side take pleasure in his conduct, which in all respects is to be reprobated; for the &#1504;&#1500;&#1493;&#1494;, inflexus, tortuosus (vid., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015">Pro 2:15</A>), who swerves from the right way and goes in a crooked false way, is an object of Jahve's abhorrence, while, on the contrary, the just, who with a right mind walks in the right way, is Jahve's &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; - an echo of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014">Psa 25:14</A>. &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; (R. &#1505;&#1491;, to be firm, compressed) means properly the being pressed together, or sitting together (cf. the Arab. wisa&#770;d, wisa&#770;dt, a cushion, divan, corresponding in form to the Hebr. &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;) for the purpose of private communication and conversation (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1491;), and then partly the confidential intercourse, as here (cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#004">Job 29:4</A>), partly the private communication, the secret (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007">Amo 3:7</A>). lxx, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; [&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;] &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;. Those who are out of the way, who prefer to the simplicity of right-doing all manner of crooked ways, are contrary to God, and He may have nothing to do with them; but the right-minded He makes partakers of His most intimate intercourse, He deals with them as His friends. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#033">Proverbs 3:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">pro 3:33</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The prosperity of the godless, far from being worthy of envy, has as its reverse side the curse:
<p>The curse of Jahve is in the house of the godless,
<p>And the dwelling of the just He blesseth.
<p>&#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1492; (a curse), like &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (a highway, from &#1505;&#1500;&#1500;), is formed from &#1488;&#1512;&#1512; (cf. Arab. harr, detestari, abhorrere, a word-imitation of an interjection used in disagreeable experiences). The curse is not merely a deprivation of external goods which render life happy, and the blessing is not merely the fulness of external possessions; the central-point of the curse lies in continuous disquiet of conscience, and that of the blessing in the happy consciousness that God is with us, in soul-rest and peace which is certain of the grace and goodness of God. The poetic &#1504;&#1493;&#1492; (from &#1504;&#1493;&#1492; = Arab. nwy, tetendit aliquo) signifies the place of settlement, and may be a word borrowed from a nomad life, since it denotes specially the pasture-ground; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#015">Pro 24:15</A> (Fleischer). While the curse of God rests in the house of the wicked (vid., Khler on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004">Zac 5:4</A>), He blesses, on the contrary, the dwelling-place of the righteous. The lxx and Jerome read &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;, but &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; is more agreeable, since God continues to be the subject. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034">Proverbs 3:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">pro 3:34</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>His relation to men is determined by their relation to Him.
<p>As for the scorners, He scorneth them,
<p>But to the lowly He giveth grace.
<p>Most interpreters render the verse thus: "If the scorner He (even He, in return) scorneth, so He (on the other hand) giveth grace to the lowly." For the sequence of the words in the consequence, in which the precedence of the verb is usual, e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005">Lev 12:5</A>, we are referred to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018">Pro 23:18</A>, cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#014">Pro 24:14</A>; but why had the poet placed the two facts in the relation of condition and consequence? The one fact is not the consequence but the reverse of the other, and accordingly they are opposed to each other in coordinated passages, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026">Psa 18:26</A>. The Vav in such antitheses has generally the meaning of "and on the other hand," e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#020">Job 8:20</A>, while the lxx, Targ., Syriac, and Jerome altogether pass over the &#1488;&#1501; as if it did not exist. Ziegler translates: "Truly! the scorner He scorneth;" but an affirmative &#1488;&#1501; does not exist, the asseveration after the manner of an oath is negative. Bertheau's expedient would be more acceptable, by which he makes the whole of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034">Pro 3:34</A> the protasis to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035">Pro 3:35</A>; but if this were intended, another subject would not enter into <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035">Pro 3:35</A>. Thus 34a and 34b are two independent parallel passages; &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; is the protasis: if as regards the scorners, i.e., if His conduct is directed to the scorners, so He scorneth. The &#1500; denotes relation, and in this elliptical usage is like the &#1500; of superscription, e.g., <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009">Jer 23:9</A>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is the emphatic &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;: He on the contrary, and in a decisive way (Ewald, 314ab). Instead of &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; fo  there might have been used &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1501; (for &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509;, where it occurs as a governing word, has the accusative, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028">Pro 19:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#051">Psa 119:51</A>), but we do not miss the object: if it relates to scorners (thus also Lwenstein translates), so it is He in return who scorneth. The lxx renders it: &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; cf. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006">Jam 4:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005">Pe1 5:5</A>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is used as a name of God (Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr. xvi. 400), on which account it is rendered like &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; by &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. A &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (appearing above others, i.e., overbearing) is the &#1500;&#1509;, according to the definition <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024">Pro 21:24</A>. the expression of the talio is generalized in &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (resists them). For &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; the Ker&#305;&#770; has &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;: &#1506;&#1504;&#1493; (from &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, the ground-form &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;, Arab. 'anaw) is the lowly (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), or he who bends himself, i.e., the gentle and humble, the patient, and the passive &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, he who is bowed down, the suffering; but the limits of the conception are moveable, since in &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; is presupposed the possession of fruit-virtues gained in the school of affliction. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035">Proverbs 3:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">pro 3:35</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This group of the proverbs of wisdom now suitably closes with the fundamental contrast between the wise and fools:
<p>The wise shall inherit honour,
<p>But fools carry away shame.
<p>If we take &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; as the object, then we can scarcely interpret the clause: shame sweeps fools away (Umbreit, Zckler, Bertheau), for &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; [Hiph. of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;] signifies (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014">Isa 57:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#031">Eze 21:31</A>) "to raise up anything high and far," not "to sweep away." Preferable is the rendering: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (Graec. Venet., and similarly Jerome), i.e., only to it do they owe their celebrity as warning examples (Ewald), to which Oetinger compares "whose glory is in their shame," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019">Phi 3:19</A>;
<p>(Note: Jona Gerundi renders it otherwise: "But shame raises the fools high;" i.e., only the infamous, he who has no sense of honour, makes much advancement out of fools.)
<p>but &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; is the contrary of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; (glory, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016">Hab 2:16</A>), and therefore is as much an object conception as is the latter, 35a. If it is the object, then if we take &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1502;&#1512; after the form of &#1500;&#1503;, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#021">Neh 13:21</A> = &#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007">Hos 4:7</A>), it might be rendered: Yet fools exchange shame (Lwenstein). But &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, like the Arab. mrr, transire, means properly to pass over or to wander over; it is intransitive, and only in Hiph. signifies actively to exchange. &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; thus will be the participle of &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; the plur. taken distributively (fools = whoever is only always a fool) is connected with the singular of the predicate. This change in the number is here, however, more difficult than at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018">Pro 3:18</A>, and in other places, where the plur. of the part. permits the resolution into a relative clause with quicunque, and more difficult than at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001">Pro 28:1</A>, where the sing. of the predicate is introduced by attraction; wherefore &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; may be an error in transcribing for &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; (Bttcher). J. H. Michaelis (after the Targ. and Syr.) has properly rendered the clause: "stulti tollunt ignominiam tanquam portionem suam," adding "quae derivato nomine &#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492; dicitur." &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; signifies, in the language of the sacrificial worship and of worship generally, to lift off from anything the best portion, the legitimate portion due to God and the priesthood (vid., at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009">Pro 3:9</A>); for which reason Rashi glosses &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; by &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1493;, and Ralbag by &#1502;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1493;. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029">Pro 14:29</A>. Honour is that which the wise inherit, it falls to them unsought as a possession, but fools receive shame as the offal (viz., of their foolish conduct). The fut. and part. are significantly interchanged. The life of the wise ends in glory, but fools inherit shame; the fruit of their conduct is shame and evermore shame.
