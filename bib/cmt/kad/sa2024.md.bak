Numbering of the People, and Pestilence - 2 Samuel 24

For the purpose of ascertaining the number of the people, and their
fitness for war, David ordered Joab, his commander-in-chief, to take a
census of Israel and Judah. Joab dissuaded him from such a step; but
inasmuch as the king paid no attention to his dissuasion, he carried out
the command with the help of the military captains ([Sa2
24:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001).md). David very speedily saw,
however, that he had sinned; whereupon the prophet Gad went to him by
the command of Jehovah to announce the coming punishment, and give him
the choice of three different judgments which he placed before him ([Sa2
24:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#010).md). As David chose rather to
fall into the hand of the Lord than into the hand of men, God sent a
pestilence, which carried off seventy thousand men in one day throughout
the whole land, and had reached Jerusalem, when the Lord stopped the
destroying angel in consequence of the penitential prayer of David ([Sa2
24:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#014).md), and sent Gad to the king to
direct him to build an altar to the Lord on the spot where the
destroying angel had appeared to him ([Sa2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#018).md). Accordingly David bought the
threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite, built an altar upon it, and
sacrificed burnt-offerings and thank-offerings, after which the plague
was stayed ([Sa2 24:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#019).md).

This occurrence, which is introduced in the parallel history in 1 Chron
21 between David's wars and his arrangements for a more complete
organization of the affairs of the nation, belongs undoubtedly to the
closing years of David's reign. The mere taking of a census, as a
measure that would facilitate the general organization of the kingdom,
could not in itself be a sinful act, by which David brought guilt upon
himself, or upon the nation, before God. Nevertheless it is not only
represented in [Sa2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001.md) as a
manifestation of the wrath of God against Israel, but in [Sa2
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#003.md) Joab seeks to dissuade the king
from it as being a wrong thing; and in [Sa2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#010.md) David himself admits that it was
a grievous sin against God, and as a sin it is punished by the Lord
([Sa2 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#012)..md). In what, then, did
David's sin consist? Certainly not in the fact that, when taking the
census, "he neglected to demand the atonement money, which was to be
raised, according to [Exo 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012.md)., from
all who were numbered, because the numbering of the people was regarded
in itself as an undertaking by which the anger of God might easily be
excited," as Josephus and Bertheau maintain; for the Mosaic instructions
concerning the atonement money had reference to the incorporation of the
people into the army of Jehovah (see at [Exo
30:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013).md), and therefore did not come
into consideration at all in connection with the census appointed by
David as a purely political measure. Nor can we imagine that David's sin
consisted merely in the fact that he "entered upon the whole affair from
pride and vain boasting," or that "he commanded the census from vanity,
inasmuch as he wanted to have it distinctly set before his own eyes how
strong and mighty he was" (Buddeus, Hengstenberg, and others); for
although pride and vanity had something to do with it, as the words of
Joab especially seem to indicate, David was far too great a man to allow
us to attribute to him a childish delight in the mere number of souls in
his kingdom. The census had certainly a higher purpose than this. It is
very evident from [Ch1 27:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#023.md), where
it is mentioned again that it was connected with the military
organization of the people, and probably was to be the completion of it.
David wanted to know the number of his subjects, not that he might be
able to boast of their multitude, nor that he might be able to impose
all kinds of taxes upon every town and village according to their houses
and inhabitants, as Ewald maintains; but that he might be fully
acquainted with its defensive power, though we can neither attribute to
him the definite purpose "of transforming the theocratic sacred state
into a conquering world-state" (Kurtz), nor assume that through this
numbering the whole nation was to be enrolled for military service, and
that thirst for conquest was the motive for the undertaking. The true
kernel of David's sin was to be found, no doubt, in self-exaltation,
inasmuch as he sought for the strength and glory of his kingdom in the
number of the people and their readiness for war. This sin was punished.
"Because David was about to boast proudly and to glory in the number of
his people, God determined to punish him by reducing their number either
by famine, war, or pestilence" (Seb. Schmidt). At the same time, the
people themselves had sinned grievously against God and their king,
through the two rebellions headed by Absalom and Sheba.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 24:1</span></span>

"Again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; and He moved
David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah." לחרות ...
ויּסף points back to the manifestation of the wrath of God, which Israel
had experienced in the three years' famine (2 Samuel 21). Just as that
plague had burst upon the land on account of the guilt which rested upon
the people, so the kindling of the wrath of God against Israel a second
time also presupposes guilt on the part of the nation; and as this is
not expressly pointed out, we may seek for it generally in the
rebellions of Absalom and Sheba against the divinely established
government of David. The subject to "moved" is Jehovah, and the words
"against them" point back to Israel. Jehovah instigated David against
Israel to the performance of an act which brought down a severe judgment
upon the nation. With regard to the idea that God instigates to sin, see
the remarks on [Sa1 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019.md). In the
parallel text of the Chronicles, Satan is mentioned as the tempter to
evil, through whom Jehovah had David to number the people.

[Sa2 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#002.md)

David entrusted the task to his commander-in-chief Joab. אתּו אשׁר, "who
was with him:" the meaning is, "when he was with him" (David). We are
not warranted in attempting any emendations of the text, either by the
expression אתּו אשׁר, or by the reading in the Chronicles, העם ועל־שׂרי
("and to the rulers of the people"); for whilst the latter reading may
easily be seen to be a simplification founded upon [Sa2
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#004.md), it is impossible to show how
אתּו אשׁר שׂר־החיל, which is supported by all the ancient versions (with
the sole exception of the Arabic), could have originated in העם
ואל־שׂרי. "Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to
Beersheba (see at [Jdg 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001).md), and
muster the people." פּקד, to muster or number, as in [Num
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#044.md). The change from the singular
שׁוּט to the plural פּקדוּ may be explained very simply, from the fact
that, as a matter of course, Joab was not expected to take the census by
himself, but with the help of several assistants.

[Sa2 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#003.md)

Joab discountenanced the thing: "Jehovah thy God add to the nation, as
it is, a hundredfold as many, and may the eyes of my lord the king see
it. But why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?" The ו before
יוסף stands at the commencement, when what is said contains a sequel to
something that has gone before (vid., Ges. 255, 1, a.). The thought to
which Joab's words are appended as a sequel, is implied in what David
said, "that I may know the number of the people;" and if expressed
fully, his words would read somewhat as follows: "If thou hast delight
in the greatness of the number of the people, may Jehovah," etc. Joab
evidently saw through the king's intention, and perceived that the
numbering of the people could not be of any essential advantage to
David's government, and might produce dissatisfaction among the people,
and therefore endeavoured to dissuade the king from his purpose. וכהם
כּהם, "as they (the Israelites) just are," i.e., in this connection,
"just as many as there are of them." From a grammatical point of view,
כּהם is to be taken as the object to יוסף, as in the parallel passages,
[Deu 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#011.md); [Sa2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008.md). Not only did he desire that God
would multiply the nation a hundredfold, but that He would do it during
the lifetime of David, so that his eyes might be delighted with the
immense numbers.

[Sa2 24:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#004.md)

But as the king's word prevailed against Joab and against the captains
of the army, they (Joab and the other captains) went out to number
Israel. יחנוּ, they encamped, i.e., they fixed their headquarters in the
open field, because great crowds assembled together. This is only
mentioned here in connection with the place where the numbering
commenced; but it is to be understood as applying to the other places as
well (Thenius). In order to distinguish Aroer from the place of the same
name in the Arnon, in the tribe of Reuben ([Jos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002.md); [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034), etc..md), it is defined more
precisely as "the town in the brook-valley of Gad," i.e., Aroer of Gad
before Rabbah ([Jos 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025.md); [Jdg
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033).md), in the Wady Nahr Ammn, to the
north-east of Ammn (see at [Jos
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025)). ועל־יעזר (and to Jazer.md): this
is a second place of encampment, and the preposition אל is to be
explained on the supposition that יבאוּ (they came), which follows, was
already in the writer's thoughts. Jazer is probably to be found in the
ruins of es Szir, at the source of the Nahr Szir (see at [Num
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#032).md).

[Sa2 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#006.md)

"And they came to Gilead," i.e., the mountainous district on the two
sides of the Jabbok (see at [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010).md). The words which follow, viz.,
"into the land חדשׁי תּחתּים" are quite obscure, and were unintelligible
even to the earlier translators. The Septuagint has γῆν Ἐθαὼν Ἀδασαί, or
γῆν Θαβασών (also γῆν χεττιείμ) ἥ ἐστιν Ἀδασαί. Symmachus has τὴν
κατωτέραν ὁδόν; Jonathan לחדשׁי דרומא לארעא ("into the southland
Chodshi"); and the Vulgate in terram inferiorem. The singular form
תּחתּים, and the fact that we never read of a land called Chodshi,
render the conjecture a very probable one that the text is corrupt. But
it is no longer possible to discover the correct reading. Ewald imagines
that we should read Hermon instead of the unintelligible Chodshi; but
this is not very probable. Bttcher supposes תחתים to be a mistake in
writing for ים תּחת, "below the lake," namely the lake of Gennesareth,
which might have been called Chodshi (the new-moon-like), since it had
very much the appearance of a crescent when seen from the northern
heights. This is ingenious, but incredible. The order of the places
named points to the eastern side of the sea of Galilee; for they went
thence to Dan-jaan, i.e., the Dan in northern Peraea, mentioned in [Gen
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014.md), to the south-west of Damascus,
at that time probably the extreme north-eastern boundary of the kingdom
of David, in the direction towards Syria (see at [Gen
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014).md): "and round to Sidon," the
extreme north-western boundary of the kingdom.

[Sa2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#007.md)

Thence southwards to the fortress of Zor, i.e., Tyre (see at [Jos
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029).md), and "into all the towns of the
Hivites and Canaanites," i.e., the towns in the tribes of Naphtali,
Zebulun, and Issachar, or the (subsequent) province of Galilee, in which
the Canaanites had not been exterminated by the Israelites, but had only
been made tributary.

[Sa2 24:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#008.md)

When they had traversed the whole land, they came back to Jerusalem, at
the end of nine months and twenty days, and handed over to the king the
number of the people mustered: viz., 800,000 men of Israel fit for
military service, drawing the sword, and 500,000 men of Judah. According
to the Chronicles ([Ch1 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#005).md), there
were 1,100,000 Israelites and 470,000 Judaeans. The numbers are not
given by thousands, and therefore are only approximative statements in
round numbers; and the difference in the two texts arose chiefly from
the fact, that the statements were merely founded upon oral tradition,
since, according to [Ch1 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#004.md), the
result of the census was not inserted in the annals of the kingdom.
There is no ground, however, for regarding the numbers as exaggerated,
if we only bear in mind that the entire population of a land amounts to
about four times the number of those who are fit for military service,
and therefore 1,300,000, or even a million and a half, would only
represent a total population of five or six millions, - a number which
could undoubtedly have been sustained in Palestine, according to
thoroughly reliable testimony as to its unusual fertility (see the
discussion of this subject at Num 1-4, Pentateuch, pp. 651-57). Still
less can we adduce as a proof of exaggeration the fact, that according
to [Ch1 27:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001.md), David had only an
army of 288,000; for it is a well-known fact, that in all lands the
army, or number of men in actual service, is, as a rule, much smaller
than the total number of those who are capable of bearing arms.
According to [Ch1 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#006.md), the tribes of
Levi and Benjamin were not numbered, because, as the chronicler adds,
giving his own subjective view, "the word of the king was an abomination
to Joab," or, as it is affirmed in [Ch1
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#004.md), according to the objective
facts, "because the numbering was not completed." It is evident from
this, that in consequence of Joab's repugnance to the numbering of the
people, he had not hurried with the fulfilment of the kings' command; so
that when David saw his own error, he revoked the command before the
census was complete, and so the tribe of Benjamin was not numbered at
all, the tribe of Levi being of course eo ipso exempt from a census that
was taken for the sake of ascertaining the number of men who were
capable of bearing arms.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 24:10</span></span>

David's heart, i.e., his conscience, smote him, after he had numbered
the people, or had given orders for the census to be taken. Having now
come to a knowledge of his sin, he prayed to the Lord for forgiveness,
because he had acted foolishly. The sin consisted chiefly in the
self-exaltation which had led to this step (see the introductory
remarks).

[Sa2 24:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#011.md)

When he rose up in the morning, after he had calmly reflected upon the
matter during the night upon his bed, and had been brought to see the
folly of his determination, the prophet Gad came to him by the command
of God, pointed out to him his fault, and foretold the punishment that
would come from God. "Shall seven years of famine come upon thy land, or
three months of flight before thine oppressors that they may pursue
thee, or shall there be three days of pestilence in thy land? Now mark
and see what answer I shall bring to Him that sendeth me." These three
verses form one period, in which גד ויּבא ([Sa2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#013).md) answers as the consequent to
וגו דּוד ויּקם in [Sa2 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#011.md), and the
words from יהוה וּדבר ([Sa2 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#011).md) to
ואעשׂה־לּך) ([Sa2 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#012).md) form a
circumstantial clause inserted between. וגו יהוה וּדבר י: "and the word
of the Lord had taken place (gone forth) to Gad, David's seer, saying,
Go ... thus saith Jehovah, I lay upon thee three (things or evils);
choose thee one of them that I may do it to thee." Instead of על נטל, to
lay upon, we find נטה in the Chronicles, "to turn upon thee." The three
things are mentioned first of all in connection with the execution of
Gad's commission to the king. Instead of seven years of famine, we find
three years in the Chronicles; the Septuagint has also the number three
in the passage before us, and apparently it is more in harmony with the
connection, viz., three evils to choose from, and each lasting through
three divisions of time. But this agreement favours the seven rather
than the three, which is open to the suspicion of being intentionally
made to conform to the rest. נסך is an infinitive: "thy fleeing," for
that thou fliest before thine enemies. In the Chronicles the last two
evils are described more fully, but the thought is not altered in
consequence.

[Sa2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#014.md)

David replied, "I am in great trouble. Let us fall into the hand of the
Lord, for His mercy is great; but let me not fall into the hand of men."
Thus David chose the third judgment, since pestilence comes directly
from God. On the other hand, in flight from the enemy, he would have
fallen into the hands of men. It is not easy to see, however, how far
this could apply to famine; probably inasmuch as it tends more or less
to create dependence upon those who are still in possession of the means
of life.

[Sa2 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#015.md)

God then gave (sent) a pestilence into (upon) Israel, "from the morning
till the time of the assembly;" and there died of the people in the
whole land (from Dan to Beersheba) seventy thousand men. "From the
morning:" on which Gad had foretold the punishment. The meaning of מועד
ועד־עת is doubtful. The rendering "to the time appointed," i.e., "till
the expiration of the three days," in support of which the Vulgate (ad
tempus constitutum) is wrongly appealed to, is precluded not only by the
circumstance that, according to [Sa2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md), the plague was stayed earlier
because God repented Him of the evil, so that it did not last so long as
was at first appointed, but also by the grammatical difficulty that מועד
עת has no article, and can only be rendered "for an (not for the)
appointed time." We meet with two different explanations in the ancient
versions: one in the Septuagint, ἕως ὥρας ἀρίστου, "till the hour of
breakfast," i.e., till the sixth hour of the day, which is the rendering
also adopted by the Syriac and Arabic as well as by Kimchi and several
of the Rabbins; the other in the Chaldee (Jonathan), "from the time at
which the sacrifice is commonly slain until it is consumed." Accordingly
Bochart explains מועד את as signifying "the time at which the people
came together for evening prayers, about the ninth hour of the day,
i.e., the third hour in the afternoon" (vid., [Act
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001).md). The same view also lies at the
foundation of the Vulgate rendering, according to the express statement
of Jerome (traditt. Hebr. in 2 libr. Regum): "He calls that the time
appointed, in which the evening sacrifice was offered." It is true that
this meaning of מועד cannot be established by precisely analogous
passages, but it may be very easily deduced from the frequent employment
of the word to denote the meetings and festivals connected with the
worship of God, when it generally stands without an article, as for
example in the perfectly analogous מועד יום ([Hos
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005.md); [Lam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md), [Lam
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022).md); whereas it is always written
with the article when it is sued in the general sense of a fixed time,
and some definite period is referred to.

(Note: The objections brought against this have no force in them, viz.,
that, according to this view, the section must have been written a long
time after the captivity (Clericus and Thenius), and that "the perfectly
general expression 'the time of meeting' could not stand for the time of
the afternoon or evening meeting" (Thenius): for the former rests upon
the assumption that the daily sacrifice was introduced after the
captivity, - an assumption quite at variance with the historical facts;
and the latter is overthrown by the simple remark, that the indefinite
expression derived its more precise meaning from the legal appointment
of the morning and evening sacrifice as times of meeting for the worship
of God, inasmuch as the evening meeting was the only one that could be
placed in contrast with the morning.)

We must therefore decide in favour of the latter. But if the pestilence
did not last a whole day, the number of persons carried off by it
(70,000 men) exceeded very considerably the number destroyed by the most
violent pestilential epidemics on record, although they have not
unfrequently swept off hundreds of thousands in a very brief space of
time. But the pestilence burst upon the people in this instance with
supernatural strength and violence, that it might be seen at once to be
a direct judgment from God.

[Sa2 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md)

The general statement as to the divine judgment and its terrible effects
is followed by a more minute description of the judgment itself, and the
arrest of the plague. "When the destroying angel ('the angel' is defined
immediately afterwards as 'the angel that destroyed the people')
stretched out his hand towards Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented
of the evil (for this expression, see [Exo
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014.md); [Jer
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#013.md), [Jer
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019.md), etc.; and for the repentance of
God, the remarks on [Gen 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006).md), and He
commanded the angel, Enough! stay now thine hand." This implies that the
progress of the pestilence was stayed before Jerusalem, and therefore
that Jerusalem itself was spared. "And the angel of Jehovah was at the
threshing-floor of Aravnah the Jebusite." These words affirm most
distinctly that the destroying angel was visible. According to [Sa2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017.md), David saw him there. The
visible appearance of the angel was to exclude every thought of a
natural land plague. The appearance of the angel is described more
minutely in the Chronicles: David saw him standing by the
threshing-floor of Aravnah between heaven and earth with a drawn sword
in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. The drawn sword was a
symbolical representation of the purpose of his coming (see at [Num
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#023.md) and [Jos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013).md). The threshing-floor of Aravnah
was situated, like all other threshing-floors, outside the city, and
upon an eminence, or, according to the more precise statement which
follows, to the north-east of Zion, upon Mount Moriah (see at [Sa2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#025).md). According to the Chethib of
[Sa2 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md), the name of the owner of
the floor was האורנה, of [Sa2 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#018.md)
ארניה, and of [Sa2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#020) (twice.md)
ארונה. This last form also occurs in [Sa2
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#022.md), [Sa2
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#023.md), and [Sa2
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#024.md), and has been substituted by the
Masoretes as the Keri in [Sa2 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md)
and [Sa2 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#018.md). In the Chronicles, on
the other hand, the name is always written ארנן (Ornan), and hence in
the Septuagint we find Ὄρνα in both texts. "The form ארונה (Aravnah) has
not a Hebrew stamp, whereas Orna and Ornan are true Hebrew formations.
But for this very reason Aravnah appears to be derived from an ancient
tradition" (Bertheau).

[Sa2 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017.md)

When David saw the angel, he prayed to the Lord (he and the elders being
clothed in mourning costume: Chron.): "Behold, I have sinned, and I have
acted perversely; but these, the flock, what have they done? Let Thy
hand come upon me and my house." The meaning is: I the shepherd of Thy
people have sinned and transgressed, but the nation is innocent; i.e.,
not indeed free from every kind of blame, but only from the sin which
God was punishing by the pestilence. It belongs to the very nature of
truly penitential prayer, that the person praying takes all the blame
upon himself, acknowledges before God that he alone is deserving of
punishment, and does not dwell upon the complicity of others for the
sake of palliating his own sin in the sight of God. We must not infer,
therefore, from this confession on the part of David, that the people,
whilst innocent themselves, had had to atone only for an act of
transgression on the part of their king.

[Sa2 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#018.md)

David's prayer was heard. The prophet Gad came and said to him by
command of Jehovah, "Go up, and erect an altar to the Lord upon the
floor of Aravnah the Jebusite." This is all that is communicated here of
the word of Jehovah which Gad was to convey to the king; the rest is
given afterwards, as is frequently the case, in the course of the
subsequent account of the fulfilment of the divine command ([Sa2
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#021).md). David was to build the altar
and offer burnt-offerings and supplicatory-offerings upon it, to appease
the wrath of Jehovah. The plague would then be averted from Israel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 24:19</span></span>

David went up to Aravnah according to the command of God.

[Sa2 24:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#020.md)

When Aravnah saw the king coming up to him with his servants (ויּשׁקף,
"he looked out," viz., from the enclosure of the threshing-floor), he
came out, bowed low even to the earth, and asked the king what was the
occasion of his coming; whereupon David replied, "To buy the floor from
thee, to build an altar to the Lord, that the plague may be turned away
from the people."

[Sa2 24:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#022.md)

Aravnah replied, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth
good unto him: behold (i.e., there thou hast) the ox for the
burnt-offering, and the threshing-machine, and the harness of the ox for
wood" (i.e., for fuel). הבּקר, the pair of oxen yoked together in front
of the threshing-machine. הבּקר כּלי, the wooden yokes. "All this giveth
Aravnah, O king, to the king." המּלך is a vocative, and is simply
omitted by the lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, because the translators
regarded it as a nominative, which is quite unsuitable, as Aravnah was
not a king. When Thenius, on the other hand, objects to this, for the
purpose of throwing suspicion upon the passage, that the sentence is
thus stamped as part of Aravnah's address to the king, and that in that
case the words that follow, "and Aravnah said," would be altogether
superfluous; the former remark is correct enough, for the words "all
this giveth Aravnah ... to the king" must form part of what Aravnah
said, inasmuch as the remark, "all this gave Aravnah to the king," if
taken as the historian's own words, would be in most glaring
contradiction to what follows, where the king is said to have bought the
floor and the oxen from Aravnah. And the words that follow ("and Aravnah
said") are not superfluous on that account, but simply indicate that
Aravnah did not proceed to say the rest in the same breath, but added it
after a short pause, as a word which did not directly bear upon the
question put by the king. ויּאמר (and he said) is often repeated, where
the same person continues speaking (see for example [Sa2
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#004.md), [Sa2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#025.md), [Sa2
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#027).md). "Jehovah thy God accept thee
graciously," i.e., fulfil the request thou presentest to Him with
sacrifice and prayer.

[Sa2 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#024.md)

The king did not accept the offer, however, but said, "No; but I will
buy it of thee at a price, and will not offer burnt-offerings to the
Lord my God without paying for them." Thus David bought the
threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. Instead of
this, the Chronicles give "shekels of gold, in weight six hundred." This
difference cannot be reconciled by assuming that David paid his fifty
shekels in gold coin, which would have been worth as much as six hundred
shekels of silver, since gold was worth twelve times as much as silver.
For there is nothing about gold shekels in our text; and the words of
the Chronicles cannot be interpreted as meaning that the shekels of gold
were worth six hundred shekels of silver. No other course is left,
therefore, than to assume that the number must be corrupt in one of the
texts. Apparently the statement in the Chronicles is the more correct of
the two: for if we consider that Abraham paid four hundred shekels of
silver for the site of a family burial-place, at a time when the land
was very thinly populated, and therefore land must certainly have been
much cheaper than it was in David's time, the small sum of fifty shekels
of silver (about 6) appears much too low a price; and David would
certainly pay at least fifty shekels of gold. But we are not warranted
in any case in speaking of the statement in the Chronicles, as Thenius
does, as "intentionally exaggerated." This style of criticism, which
carries two kinds of weights and measure in its bag, explaining the high
numbers in the books of Samuel and Kings as corruptions of the text, and
those in the Chronicles as intentional exaggerations on the part of the
chronicler, is sufficiently dealt with by the remark of Bertheau, that
"this (i.e., the charge of exaggeration) could only be sustained if it
were perfectly certain that the chronicler had our present text of the
books of Samuel before him at the time."

[Sa2 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#025.md)

After acquiring the threshing-floor by purchase, David built an altar to
the Lord there, and offered burnt-offerings and supplicatory-offerings
(shelamim: as in [Jdg 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md); [Jdg
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#004.md); [Sa1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009).md) upon it to the Lord. "So Jehovah
was entreated, and the plague was turned away from Israel."

This remark brings to a close not only the account of this particular
occurrence, but also the book itself; whereas in the Chronicles it is
still further stated that Jehovah answered David with fire from heaven,
which fell upon the burnt-offering; and that after his prayer had been
answered thus, David not only continued to offer sacrifice upon the
floor of Aravnah, but also fixed upon it as the site for the temple
which was afterwards to be built ([Ch1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#027.md); [Ch1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001).md); and to this there is appended,
in [Sa2 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#002.md)., an account of the
preparations which David made for the building of the temple. It is not
affirmed in the Chronicles, however, that David fixed upon this place as
the site for the future temple in consequence of a revelation from God,
but simply that he did this, because he saw that the Lord had answered
him there, and because he could not go to Gibeon, where the tabernacle
was standing, to seek the Lord there, on account of the sword of the
angel, i.e., on account of the pestilence. The command of God build an
altar upon the threshing-floor of Aravnah, and offer expiatory
sacrifices upon it, when connected with His answering his prayer by
turning away the plague, could not fail to be taken as a distinct
intimation to David, that the site of this altar was the place where the
Lord would henceforth make known His gracious presence to His people;
and this hint was quite sufficient to determine the site for the temple
which his son Solomon was to build.
