### [1 Chronicles Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 18:1</span></span>

The events recorded in these three chapters are all narrated in the
second book of Samuel also, and in the same order. First, there are
grouped together in our 18th chapter, and in 2 Sam 8, in such a manner
as to afford a general view of the whole, all the wars which David
carried on victoriously against all his enemies round about in the
establishment of the Israelitish rule, with a short statement of the
results, followed by a catalogue of David's chief public officials. In 1
Chron 19 and in 2 Sam 10 we have a more detailed account of the arduous
war against the Ammonites and Syrians, and in [Ch1
20:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001) and [Sa2
12:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026) the conclusion of the war
with the capture of Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites; and finally,
in [Ch1 20:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#004), we have a few short
accounts of the victories of the Israelitish heroes over giants from the
land of the Philistines, which are inserted in [Sa2
21:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#018) as a supplement to the last
section of David's history. Apart from this last section, which is to be
regarded even in the Chronicle as an appendix, we find the arrangement
and succession of the events to be the same in both books, since the
sections which in [Sa2 9:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001) and [Sa2
11:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001), [Sa2
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#025), stand between the histories of
the wars, contain sketches of David's family life, which the author of
the Chronicle has, in accordance with his plan, omitted. Even as to
individual details the two narratives are perfectly agreed, the
divergences being inconsiderable; and even these, in so far as they are
original, and are not results of careless copying, - as, for instance,
the omission of the word נציבים, [Ch1
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#006), as compared with [Ch1
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#013) and [Sa2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006), and the difference in the numbers
and names in [Ch1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004), [Ch1
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008), as compared with [Sa2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004), [Sa2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008), are, - partly mere explanations
of obscure expressions, partly small additions or abridgments. For the
commentary, therefore, we may refer to the remarks on 2nd Samuel, where
the divergences of the Chronicle from the record in Samuel are also
dealt with. With [Ch1 18:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001) cf. [Sa2
8:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001); and with the register of
public officials, [Sa2 18:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#014), cf.
[Sa2 8:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015).

Examples of paraphrastic explanation are found in [Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001), where the figurative expression,
David took the bridle of the mother out of the hands of the Philistines,
i.e., deprived them of the hegemony, is explained by the phrase, David
took Gath and her cities out of the hands of the Philistines, i.e., took
from the Philistines the capital with her daughter cities; and in [Ch1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017), כּהנים is rendered by, the
first at the king's hand. Among the abridgments, the omission of David's
harsh treatment of the Moabites who were taken prisoners is surprising,
no reason for it being discoverable; for the assertion that the
chronicler has purposely omitted it in order to free David from the
charge of such barbarous conduct, is disposed of by the fact that he
does not pass over in silence the similar treatment of the conquered
inhabitants of Rabbah in [Ch1 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#003).
Instead of this, the chronicler has several historical notes peculiar to
himself, which are wanting in the text of Samuel, and which prove that
the author of the Chronicle has not derived his account from the second
book of Samuel. Such, e.g., is the statement in [Ch1
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008), that Solomon caused the brazen
sea and the pillars and vessels of the court of the temple to be made of
the brass taken as booty in the war against Hadadezer; in [Ch1
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#011), the word מאדום, which is
wanting in Samuel, as מארם, which in [Ch1
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#011) of that book is used in place of
it, probably stood originally in the Chronicle also. Such also are the
more accurate statements in [Ch1 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012)
as to the victory over the Edomites in the Valley of Salt (see on [Sa2
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#013)).
