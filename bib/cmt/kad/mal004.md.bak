### [Malachi Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md)

[Malachi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 4:1</span></span>

This admonition to the ungodly is explained in [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md). by a picture of the separation
which will be effected by the day of judgment. [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md). "For behold the day cometh
burning like a furnace, and all the proud and every doer of wickedness
become stubble, and the coming day will burn them, saith Jehovah of
hosts, so that it will not leave them root or branch. [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md). But to you who fear my name, the
sun of righteousness will rise and healing in its wings, and ye will go
out and skip like stalled calves, [Mal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003.md). And will tread down the ungodly,
for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I
create, saith Jehovah of hosts." The day of judgment will be to the
ungodly like a burning furnace. "A fire burns more fiercely in a furnace
than in the open air" (Hengstenberg). The ungodly will then resemble the
stubble which the fire consumes (cf. [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md); [Zep
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#018.md); [Oba
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018), etc..md). זדים and עשׂה רשׁעה point
back to [Mal 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015.md). Those who are
called blessed by the murmuring nation will be consumed by the fire, as
stubble is burned up, and indeed all who do wickedness, and therefore
the murmurers themselves. אשׁר before לא יעזב is a conjunction, quod;
and the subject is not Jehovah, but the coming day. The figure "root and
branch" is borrowed from a tree - the tree is the ungodly mass of the
people (cf. [Amo 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009).md) - and denotes
total destruction, so that nothing will be left of them. To the
righteous, on the other hand, the sun of righteousness will arise.
Tsedâqâh is an epexegetical genitive of apposition. By the sun of
righteousness the fathers, from Justin downwards, and nearly all the
earlier commentators understand Christ, who is supposed to be described
as the rising sun, like Jehovah in [Psa
84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012.md) and [Isa
60:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019.md); and this view is founded upon a
truth, viz., that the coming of Christ brings justice and salvation. But
in the verse before us the context does not sustain the personal view,
but simply the idea that righteousness itself is regarded as a sun.
Tsedâqâh, again, is not justification or the forgiveness of sins, as
Luther and others suppose, for there will be no forgiving of sins on the
day of judgment, but God will then give to every man reward or
punishment according to his works. Tsedâqâh is here, what it frequently
is in Isaiah (e.g., [Isa 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008.md); [Isa
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013.md); [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005), etc..md), righteousness in its
consequences and effects, the sum and substance of salvation. Malachi
uses tsedâqâh, righteousness, instead of ישׁע, salvation, with an
allusion to the fact, that the ungodly complained of the absence of the
judgment and righteousness of God, that is to say, the righteousness
which not only punishes the ungodly, but also rewards the good with
happiness and salvation. The sun of righteousness has מרפּא, healing, in
its wings. The wings of the sun are the rays by which it is surrounded,
and not a figure denoting swiftness. As the rays of the sun spread light
and warmth over the earth for the growth and maturity of the plants and
living creatures, so will the sun of righteousness bring the healing of
all hurts and wounds which the power of darkness has inflicted upon the
righteous. Then will they go forth, sc. from the holes and caves, into
which they had withdrawn during the night of suffering and where they
had kept themselves concealed, and skip like stalled calves (cf. [Sa1
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#024).md), which are driven from the
stall to the pasture. On pūsh, see at [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md). And not only will those who fear
God be liberated from all oppression, but they will also acquire power
over the ungodly. They will tread down the wicked, who will then have
become ashes, and lie like ashes upon the ground, having been completely
destroyed by the fire of the judgment (cf. [Isa
26:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005).md).

[Malachi 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 4:4</span></span>

Concluding Admonition. - [Mal 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md).
"Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded him upon
Horeb for all Israel, statutes and rights.

(Note: The lxx have put [Mal 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md) at
the end of the book, not to call attention to its great importance, but
probably for the very same reason for which the Masora observes, at the
close of our book, that in the יתקק, i.e., in the books of Isaiah, the
twelve prophets, the Lamentations, and Ecclesiastes, the last verse but
one of these books was to be repeated when they were read in the
synagogue, namely, because the last verse had too harsh a sound. The
transposition is unsuitable, inasmuch as the promise in [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md) and [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md) does not fit on to the idea
expressed in [Mal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md) and [Mal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003.md), but only to that in [Mal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md). According to the Masora, the ז in
זכרוּ should be written as litera majusc., although in many codd. it has
the usual form; and this also is not to show the great importance of the
verse, since these Masoretic indications have generally a different
meaning, but in all probability it is simply to indicate that this is
the only passage in the book of the twelve prophets in which the word is
pronounced זכרוּ (cf. זכרו in [Hos
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006.md); [Hos
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008).md), whereas in the other books,
with the exception of [Job 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#017.md), this
is the only pronunciation that is met with.)

[Mal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md). Behold, I send you Elijah
the prophet before the day of Jehovah comes, the great and terrible one.
[Mal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md). And he will turn the heart
of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers,
that I may not come and smite the land with the curse" (mit dem Banne,
with the ban). The admonition, "Remember ye the law of Moses," forms the
conclusion not only of the last section (Malachi 3:13-4:3), but of the
whole of the book of Malachi, and cannot be connected with [Mal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003.md) in the sense of "Remember what
Moses has written in the law concerning Christ, or concerning the
judgment," as Theod. Mops. and others maintain; nor must it be
restricted to the time previous to the coming of the Messiah by the
interpolation of interim (v. Til and Mich.). It is rather a perfectly
general admonition to lay to heart and observe the law. For this is
referred to here, "not according to its casual and transient form, but
according to its real essence as expressing the holiness of God, just as
in [Mat 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017)" (Hengstenberg.md). Malachi
thus closes by showing to the people what it is their duty to do, if on
the day of judgment they would escape the curse with which transgressors
are threatened in the law, and participate in the salvation so generally
desired, and promised to those who fear God. By the expression "my
servant," the law is traced back to God as its author. At the giving of
the law, Moses as only the servant of Jehovah. אשׁר צוּיתי אותו is not
to be rendered "whom (אשׁר אותו) I charged with statutes and rights to
all Israel" (Ewald, Bunsen), for we do not expect any further
explanation of the relation in which Moses stood to the law, but "which
I commanded him upon (to) all Israel." Tsivvâh is construed with a
double accusative, and also with על governing the person to whom the
command refers, as in [Ezr 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#017.md); [Sa2
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#008.md); [Est
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#005.md). The words chuqqı̄ı̄m ūmishpâtı̄m are
an epexegetical definition belonging to אשׁר: "which I commanded as
statutes and rights," i.e., consisting of these; and they recall to mind
[Deu 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md) and [Deu
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#014.md), where Moses urges upon the
people the observance of the law, and also mentions Horeb as the place
where the law was given. The whole of the admonition forms an antithesis
to the rebuke in [Mal 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md), that from
the days of their fathers they went away from the ordinances of Jehovah.
These they are to be mindful to observe, that the Lord when He comes may
not smite the land with the ban.

In order to avert this curse from Israel, the Lord would send the
prophet Elijah before His coming, for the purpose of promoting a change
of heart in the nation. The identity of the prophet Elijah with the
messenger mentioned in [Mal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md), whom
the Lord would send before Him, is universally acknowledged. But there
is a difference of opinion as to the question, who is the Elijah
mentioned here? The notion was a very ancient one, and one very widely
spread among the rabbins and fathers, that the prophet Elijah, who was
caught up to heaven, would reappear (compare the history of the
exposition of our verse in Hengstenberg's Christology, vol. iv. p. 217
translation). The lxx thought of him, and rendered אליּה הנּביא by Ἠλίαν
τὸν Θεσβίτην; so also did Sirach (48:10) and the Jews in the time of
Christ ([Joh 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021.md); [Mat
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010).md); and so have Hitzig, Maurer,
and Ewald in the most recent times. But this view is proved to be
erroneous by such passages as [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md); [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md); [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md), and [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md), where the sending of David the
king as the true shepherd of Israel is promised. Just as in these
passages we cannot think of the return or resurrection of the David who
had long been dead; but a king is meant who will reign over the nation
of God in the mind and spirit of David; so the Elijah to be sent can
only be a prophet with the spirit or power of Elijah the Tishbite. The
second David was indeed to spring from the family of David, because to
the seed of David there had been promised the eternal possession of the
throne. The prophetic calling, on the other hand, was not hereditary in
the prophet's house, but rested solely upon divine choice and endowment
with the Spirit of God; and consequently by Elijah we are not to
understand a lineal descendant of the Tishbite, but simply a prophet in
whom the spirit and power of Elijah are revived, as Ephr. Syr., Luther,
Calvin, and most of the Protestant commentators have maintained. But the
reason why this prophet Elijah is named is to be sought for, not merely
in the fact that Elijah was called to his work as a reformer in Israel
at a period which was destitute of faith and of the true fear of
Jehovah, and which immediately preceded a terrible judgment (Koehler),
but also and more especially in the power and energy with which Elijah
rose up to lead back the ungodly generation of his own time to the God
of the fathers. The one does not exclude but rather includes the other.
The greater the apostasy, the greater must be the power which is to stem
it, so as to rescue those who suffer themselves to be rescued, before
the judgment bursts over such as are hardened. For [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md), compare [Joe
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004.md). This Elijah, according to [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md), is to lead back the heart of the
fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers. The
meaning of this is not that he will settle disputes in families, or
restore peace between parents and children; for the leading sin of the
nation at the time of our prophet was not family quarrels, but
estrangement from God. The fathers are rather the ancestors of the
Israelitish nation, the patriarchs, and generally the pious forefathers,
such as David and the godly men of his time. The sons or children are
the degenerate descendants of Malachi's own time and the succeeding
ages. "The hearts of the godly fathers and the ungodly sons are
estranged from one another. The bond of union, viz., common love to God,
is wanting. The fathers are ashamed of their children, the children of
their fathers" (Hengstenberg). This chasm between them Elijah is to fill
up. Turning the heart of the fathers to the sons does not mean merely
directing the love of the fathers to the sons once more, but also
restoring the heart of the fathers, in the sons, or giving to the sons
the fathers' disposition and affections. Then will the heart of the sons
also return to their fathers, turn itself towards them, so that they
will be like-minded with the pious fathers. Elijah will thereby prepare
the way of the Lord to His people, that at His coming He may not smite
the land with the ban. The ban involves extermination. Whoever and
whatever was laid under the ban was destroyed (cf. [Lev
27:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028.md); [Deu
13:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#016); and my Bibl. Archol. i. 70.md).
This threat recals to mind the fate of the Canaanites who were smitten
with the ban ([Deu 20:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#017).md). If
Israel resembles the Canaanites in character, it will also necessarily
share the fate of that people (cf. [Deu
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029).md).

The New Testament gives us a sufficient explanation of the historical
allusion or fulfilment of our prophecy. The prophet Elijah, whom the
Lord would send before His own coming, was sent in the person of John
the Baptist. Even before his birth he was announced to his father by the
angel Gabriel as the promised Elijah, by the declaration that he would
turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and go before
Him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers
to the children, and the unbelieving to the wisdom of the just ([Luk
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#016).md). This address of the angel
gives at the same time an authentic explanation of [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md) and [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md) of our prophecy: the words "and
the heart of the children to their fathers" being omitted, as implied in
the turning of the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the explanatory
words "and the unbelieving to the wisdom of the just" being introduced
in their place; and the whole of the work of John, who was to go before
the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, being described as "making
ready a prepared people for the Lord." The appearance and ministry of
John the Baptist answered to this announcement of the angel, and is so
described in [Mat 3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md), [Mar
1:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002.md); Luke 3:2-18, that the allusion
to our prophecy and the original passage ([Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).md) is obvious at once. Even by his
outward appearance and his dress John announced himself as the promised
prophet Elijah, who by the preaching of repentance and baptism was
preparing the way for the Lord, who would come after him with the
winnowing shovel to winnow His floor, and gather the wheat into His
granary, but who would burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. Christ
Himself also not only assured the people (in [Mat
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010.md)., [Luk
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#027)..md) that John was the messenger
announced by Malachi and the Elijah who was to come, but also told His
disciples ([Mat 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md).; [Mar
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001)..md) that Elijah, who was to come
first and restore all things, had already come, though the people had
not acknowledged him. And even [Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021.md) is not at variance with these
statements. When the messengers of the Sanhedrim came to John the
Baptist to ask whether he was Elias, and he answered, "I am not," he
simply gave a negative reply to their question, interpreted in the sense
of a personal reappearance of Elijah the Tishbite, which was the sense
in which they meant it, but he also declared himself to be the promised
forerunner of the Lord by applying to his own labours the prophecy
contained in [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md).

And as the prophet Elijah predicted by Malachi appeared in John the
Baptist, so did the Lord come to His temple in the appearing of Jesus
Christ. The opinion, which was very widely spread among the fathers and
Catholic commentators, and which has also been adopted by many of the
more modern Protestant theologians (e.g., Menken and H. Olshausen),
viz., that our prophecy was only provisionally fulfilled in the coming
of John the Baptist and the incarnation of the Son of God in Jesus
Christ, and that its true fulfilment will only take place at the second
coming of Christ to judge the world, in the actual appearance of the
risen Elijah by which it will be preceded, is not only at variance with
the statements of the Lord concerning John the Baptist, which have been
already quoted, but as no tenable foundation in our prophecy itself. The
prophets of the Old Testament throughout make no allusion to any second
coming of the Lord to His people. The day of the Lord, which they
announce as the day of judgment, commenced with the appearance on earth
of Christ, the incarnate Logos; and Christ Himself declared that He had
come into the world for judgment ([Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039.md), cf. [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md) and [Joh
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#040).md), viz., for the judgment of
separating the believing from the ungodly, to give eternal life to those
who believe on His name, and to bring death and condemnation to
unbelievers. This judgment burst upon the Jewish nation not long after
the ascension of Christ. Israel rejected its Saviour, and was smitten
with the ban at the destruction of Jerusalem in the Roman war; and both
people and land lie under this ban to the present day. And just as the
judgment commenced at that time so far as Israel was concerned, so does
it also begin in relation to all peoples and kingdoms of this earth with
the first preaching of Christ among them, and will continue throughout
all the centuries during which the kingdom spreads upon earth, until it
shall be ultimately completed in the universal judgment at the visible
second coming of the Lord at the last day.

With this calling to remembrance of the law of Moses, and this
prediction that the prophet Elijah will be sent before the coming of the
Lord Himself, the prophecy of the Old Testament is brought to a close.
After Malachi, no other prophet arose in Israel until the time was
fulfilled when the Elijah predicted by him appeared in John the Baptist,
and immediately afterwards the Lord came to His temple, that is to say,
the incarnate Son of God to His own possession, to make all who received
Him children of God, the segullâh of the Lord. Law and prophets bore
witness of Christ, and Christ came not to destroy the law or the
prophets, but to fulfil them. Upon the Mount of Christ's
Transfiguration, therefore, there appeared both Moses, the founder of
the law and mediator of the old covenant, and Elijah the prophet, as the
restorer of the law in Israel, to talk with Jesus of His decease which
He was to accomplish in Jerusalem ([Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md).; [Mar
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001.md).; [Luk
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028)..md), for a practical testimony to
the apostles and to us all, that Jesus Christ, who laid down His life
for us, to bear our sin and redeem us from the curse of the law, was the
beloved Son of the Father, whom we are to hear, that by believing in His
name we may become children of God and heirs of everlasting life.
