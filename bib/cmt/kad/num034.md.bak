### [Numbers Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 34:1</span></span>

Boundaries of the Land of Canaan. - [Num
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#002.md). "When ye come into the land of
Canaan, this shall be the land which will fall to you as an inheritance,
the land of Canaan according to its boundaries:" i.e., ye shall receive
the land of Canaan for an inheritance, within the following limits.

[Numbers 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 34:3</span></span>

The southern boundary is the same as that given in [Jos
15:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#002.md) as the boundary of the
territory of the tribe of Judah. We have first the general description,
"The south side shall be to you from the desert of Zin on the sides of
Edom onwards," i.e., the land was to extend towards the south as far as
the desert of Zin on the sides of Edom. על־ידי, "on the sides," differs
in this respect from על־יד, "on the side" ([Exo
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005.md); [Jos
15:46](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#046.md); [Sa2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002).md), that the latter is used to
designate contact at a single point or along a short line; the former,
contact for a long distance or throughout the whole extent (= כּל־יד,
[Deu 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#037).md). "On the sides of Edom"
signifies, therefore, that the desert of Zin stretched along the side of
Edom, and Canaan was separated from Edom by the desert of Zin. From this
it follows still further, that Edom in this passage is not the mountains
of Edom, which had their western boundary on the Arabah, but the country
to the south of the desert of Zin or Wady Murreh, viz., the mountain
land of the Azazimeh, which still bears the name of Seir or Serr among
the Arabs (see Seetzen and Rowland in Ritter's Erdk. xiv. pp. 840 and
1087). The statement in [Jos 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md) also
agrees with this, viz., that Judah's inheritance was "to the territory
of Edom, the desert of Zin towards the south," according to which the
desert of Zin was also to divide the territory of Edom from that of the
tribe of Judah (see the remarks on [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045).md). With [Num
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md) the more minute description of
the southern boundary line commences: "The south border shall be from
the end of the Salt Sea eastward," i.e., start from "the tongue which
turns to the south" ([Jos 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#002).md), from
the southern point of the Dead Sea, where there is now a salt marsh with
the salt mountain at the south-west border of the lake. "And turn to the
south side (מנּגב) of the ascent of Akrabbim" (ascensus scorpionum),
i.e., hardly "the steep pass of es Sufah, 1434 feet in height, which
leads in a south-westerly direction from the Dead Sea along the northern
side of Wady Fikreh, a wady three-quarters of an hour's journey in
breadth, and over which the road from Petra to Heshbon passes,"

(Note: See Robinson, vol. ii. pp. 587, 591; and v. Schubert, ii. pp.
443, 447ff.)

as Knobel maintains; for the expression נסב (turn), in [Num
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#004.md), according to which the southern
border turned at the height of Akrabbim, that is to say, did not go any
farther in the direction from N.E. to S.W. than from the southern
extremity of the Salt Sea to this point, and was then continued in a
straight line from east to west, is not at all applicable to the
position of this pass, since there would be no bend whatever in the
boundary line at the pass of es Sufah, if it ran from the Arabah through
Wady Fikreh, and so across to Kadesh. The "height of Akrabbim," from
which the country round was afterwards called Akrabattine, Akrabatene (1
Macc. 5:4; Josephus, Ant. 12:8, 1),

(Note: It must be distinguished, however, from the Akrabatta mentioned
by Josephus in his Wars of the Jews (iii. 3, 5), the modern Akrabeh in
central Palestine (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 296), and from the toparchy
Akrabattene mentioned in Josephus (Wars of the Jews, ii. 12, 4; 20, 4;
22, 2), which was named after this place.)

is most probably the lofty row of "white cliffs" of sixty or eighty feet
in height, which run obliquely across the Arabah at a distance of about
eight miles below the Dead Sea and, as seen from the south-west point of
the Dead Sea, appear to shut in the Ghor, and which form the dividing
line between the two sides of the great valley, which is called el Ghor
on one side, and el Araba on the other (Robinson, ii. 489, 494, 502).
Consequently it was not the Wady Fikreh, but a wady which opened into
the Arabah somewhat farther to the south, possibly the southern branch
of the Wady Murreh itself, which formed the actual boundary.

"And shall pass over to Zin" (i.e., the desert of Zin, the great Wady
Murreh, see at [Num 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021).md), "and its
going forth shall be to the south of Kadesh-barnea," at the western
extremity of the desert of Zin (see at [Num
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#016).md). From this point the boundary
went farther out (יצא) "to Hazar-Addar, and over (עבר) to Azmon."
According to [Jos 15:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#003.md), it went to
the south of Kadesh-barnea over (עבר) to Hezron, and ascended (עלה) to
Addar, and then turned to Karkaa, and went over to Azmon. Consequently
Hazar-Addar corresponds to Hezron and Addar (in Joshua); probably the
two places were so close to each other that they could be joined
together. Neither of them has been discovered yet. This also applies to
Karkaa and Azmon. The latter name reminds us of the Bedouin tribe
Azazimeh, inhabiting the mountains in the southern part of the desert of
Zin (Robinson, i. pp. 274, 283, 287; Seetzen, iii. pp. 45, 47). Azmon is
probably to be sought for near the Wady el Ain, to the west of the
Hebron road, and not far from its entrance into the Wady el Arish; for
this is "the river (brook) of Egypt," to which the boundary turned from
Azmon, and through which it had "its outgoings at the sea," i.e.,
terminated at the Mediterranean Sea. The "brook of Egypt," therefore, is
frequently spoken of as the southern boundary of the land of Israel
([Kg1 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md); [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md); [Ch2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008.md), and [Isa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012.md), where the lxx express the name
by Ῥινοκοροῦρα). Hence the southern boundary ran, throughout its whole
length, from the Arabah on the east to the Mediterranean on the west,
along valleys which form a natural division, and constitute more or less
the boundary line between the desert and the cultivated land.

(Note: On the lofty mountains of Madara, where the Wady Murreh is
divided into two wadys (Fikreh and Murreh) which run to the Arabah, v.
Schubert observed "some mimosen-trees," with which, as he expresses it,
"the vegetation of Arabia took leave of us, as it were, as they were the
last that we saw on our road." And Dieterici (Reisebilder, ii. pp.
156-7) describes the mountain ridge at Nakb es Sufah as "the boundary
line between the yellow desert and green steppes," and observes still
further, that on the other side of the mountain (i.e., northwards) the
plain spread out before him in its fresh green dress. "The desert
journey was over, the empire of death now lay behind us, and a new life
blew towards us from fields covered with green." - In the same way the
country between Kadesh and the Hebron road, which has become better
known to us through the descriptions of travellers, is described as a
natural boundary. Seetzen, in his account of his journey from Hebron to
Sinai (iii. p. 47), observes that the mountains of Tih commence at the
Wady el Ain (fountain-valley), which takes its name from a fountain that
waters thirty date-palms and a few small corn-fields (i.e., Ain el
Kuderat, in Robinson, i. p. 280), and describes the country to the south
of the small flat Wady el Kdeis (el Kideise), in which many tamarisks
grew (i.e., no doubt a wady that comes from Kadesh, from which it
derives its name), as a "most dreadful wilderness, which spreads out to
an immeasurable extent in all directions, without trees, shrubs, or a
single spot of green" (p. 50), although the next day he "found as an
unexpected rarity another small field of barley, which might have been
an acre in extent" (pp. 52, 53). Robinson (i. pp. 280ff.) also found,
upon the route from Sinai to Hebron, more vegetation in the desert
between the Wady el Kusaimeh and el Ain than anywhere else before
throughout his entire journey; and after passing the Wady el Ain to the
west of Kadesh, he "came upon a broad tract of tolerably fertile soil,
capable of tillage, and apparently once tilled." Across the whole of
this tract of land there were long ranges of low stone walls visible
(called "el Muzeirit," "little plantations," by the Arabs), which had
probably served at some former time as boundary walls between the
cultivated fields. A little farther to the north the Wady es Serm opens
into an extended plain, which looked almost like a meadow with its
bushes, grass, and small patches of wheat and barley. A few Azazimeh
Arabs fed their camels and flocks here. The land all round became more
open, and showed broad valleys that were capable of cultivation, and
were separated by low and gradually sloping hills. The grass become more
frequent in the valleys, and herbs were found upon the hills. "We heard
(he says at p. 283) this morning for the first time the songs of many
birds, and among them the lark.")

[Numbers 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 34:6</span></span>

The western boundary was to be "the great sea and its territory," i.e.,
the Mediterranean Sea with its territory or coast (cf. [Deu
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016.md); [Jos
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#023.md), [Jos
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027.md); [Jos
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#047).md).

[Numbers 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 34:7</span></span>

The northern boundary cannot be determined with certainty. "From the
great sea, mark out to you (תּתאוּ, from תּאה = תּוה, to mark or point
out), i.e., fix, Mount Hor as the boundary" - from thence "to come to
Hamath; and let the goings forth of the boundary be to Zedad. And the
boundary shall go out to Ziphron, and its goings out be at Hazar-enan."
Of all these places, Hamath, the modern Hamah, or the Epiphania of the
Greeks and Romans on the Orontes (see at [Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md), and [Gen
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018).md), is the only one whose
situation is well known; but the geographical description of the
northern boundary of the land of Israel חמת לבא ([Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md); [Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005.md); [Jdg
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md); [Kg1
8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md); [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md); [Ch1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005.md); [Ch2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008.md); [Amo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014.md); [Eze
47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md), [Eze
47:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#020.md); [Eze
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001).md) is so indefinite, that the
boundary line cannot be determined with exactness. For no proof can be
needed in the present day that חמת לבא cannot mean "to Hamath" (Ges.
thes. i. p. 185; Studer on [Jdg 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md),
and Baur on [Amo 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002).md), in such a sense
as would make the town of Hamath the border town, and בּא a perfectly
superfluous pleonasm. In all the passages mentioned, Hamath refers, not
to the town of that name (Epiphania on the Orontes), but to the kingdom
of Hamath, which was named after its capital, as is proved beyond all
doubt by [Ch2 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004.md), where Solomon is
said to have built store cities "in Hamath." The city of Hamath never
belonged to the kingdom of Israel, not even under David and Solomon, and
was not reconquered by Jeroboam II, as Baur supposes (see my Commentary
on the Books of Kings, and Thenius on [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md). How far the territory of the
kingdom of Hamath extended towards the south in the time of Moses, and
how much of it was conquered by Solomon ([Ch2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004).md), we are nowhere informed. We
simply learn from [Kg2 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021.md), that
Riblah (whether the same Riblah as is mentioned in [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011.md) as a town upon the eastern
boundary, is very doubtful) was situated in the land of Hamath in the
time of the Chaldeans. Now if this Riblah has been preserved in the
modern Ribleh, a miserable village on the Orontes, in the northern part
of the Bekaa, ten or twelve hours' journey to the south-west of Hums,
and fourteen hours to the north of Baalbek (Robinson, iii. p. 461, App.
176, and Bibl. Researches, p. 544), the land of Canaan would have
reached a little farther northwards, and almost to Hums (Emesa). Knobel
moves the boundary still farther to the north. He supposes Mount Hor to
be Mons Casius, to the south-west of Antioch, on the Orontes, and agrees
with Robinson (iii. 461) in identifying Zedad, in the large village of
Zadad (Sudud in Rob.), which is inhabited exclusively by Syriac
Christians, who still speak Syriac according to Seetzen (i. 32 and 279),
a town containing about 3000 inhabitants (Wetstein, Reiseber. p. 88), to
the south-east of Hums, on the east of the road from Damascus to Hunes,
a short day's journey to the north of Nebk, and four (or, according to
Van de Velde's memoir, from ten to twelve) hours' journey to the south
of Hasya (Robinson, iii. p. 461; Ritter, Erdk. xvii. pp. 1443-4).

Ziphron, which was situated upon the border of the territory of Hamath
and Damascus, if it is the same as the one mentioned in [Eze
47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md), is supposed by Knobel and
Wetstein (p. 88) to be preserved in the ruins of Zifran, which in all
probability have never been visited by any European, fourteen hours to
the north-east of Damascus, near to the road from Palmyra. Lastly,
Hazar-enan (equivalent to fountain-court) is supposed to be the station
called Centum Putea (Πούτεα in Ptol. v. 15, 24), mentioned in the Tabul.
Peuting. x. 3, on the road from Apamia to Palmyra, twenty-seven miles,
or about eleven hours, to the north-west of Palmyra. - But we may say
with certainty that all these conclusions are incorrect, because they
are irreconcilable with the eastern boundary described in [Num
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010.md), [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011.md). For example, according to [Num
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010.md), [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011.md), the Israelites were to draw
(fix) the eastern boundary "from Hazar-enan to Shepham," which, as
Knobel observes, "cannot be determined with exactness, but was farther
south than Hazar-enan, as it was a point on the eastern boundary which
is traced here from north to south, and also farther west, as we may
infer from the allusion to Riblah, probably at the northern end of
Antilibanus". From Shepham the boundary was "to go down to Riblah,"
which Knobel finds in the Ribleh mentioned above. Now, if we endeavour
to fix the situation of these places according to the latest and most
trustworthy maps, the incorrectness of the conclusions referred to
becomes at once apparent. From Zadad (Sudad) to Zifran, the line of the
northern boundary would not have gone from west to east, but from north
to south, or rather towards the south-west, and from Zifran to Centum
Putea still more decidedly in a south-westerly direction. Consequently
the northern boundary would have described a complete semicircle,
commencing in the north-west and terminating in the south-east. But if
even in itself this appears very incredible, it becomes perfectly
impossible when we take the eastern boundary into consideration. For if
this went down to the south-west from Hazar-enan to Shepham according to
Knobel's conclusions, instead of going down ([Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011).md) from Shepham to Riblah, it
would have gone up six or seven geographical miles from south to north,
and then have gone down again from north to south along the eastern
coast of the Lake of Gennesareth. Now it is impossible that Moses should
have fixed such a boundary to the land of Israel on the north-east, and
equally impossible that a later Hebrew, acquainted with the geography of
his country, should have described it in this way.

If, in order to obtain a more accurate view of the extent of the land
towards the north and north-east, we compare the statements of the book
of Joshua concerning the conquered land with the districts which still
remained to be taken at the time of the distribution; Joshua had taken
the land "from the bald mountain which ascends towards Seir," i.e.,
probably the northern ridge of the Azazimeh mountains, with its white
masses of chalk (Fries, ut sup. p. 76; see also at [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017).md), "to Baal-Gad, in the valley of
Lebanon, below Mount Hermon" ([Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017.md); cf. [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007).md). But Baal-Gad in the valley
(בּקעה) of Lebanon is not Heliopolis (now Baalbek in the Bekaa, or
Coelesyria), as many, from Iken and J. D. Michaelis down to Knobel,
suppose; for "the Bekaa is not under the Hermon," and "there is no
proof, or even probability, that Joshua's conquests reached so far, or
that Baalbek was ever regarded as the northern boundary of Palestine,
nor even that the adjoining portion of Anti-Lebanon was ever called
Hermon" (Robinson, Biblical Researches, p. 409). Baal-Gad, which is
called Baal-Hermon in [Jdg 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md) and
[Ch1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023.md), was the later Paneas or
Caesarea Philippi, the modern Banias, at the foot of the Hermon (cf. v.
Raumer, Pal. p. 245; Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 408-9, Pal. iii. pp. 347ff.).
This is placed beyond all doubt by [Ch1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023.md), according to which the
Manassites, who were increasing in numbers, dwelt "from Bashan to
Baal-hermon, and Senir, and the mountains of Hermon," since this
statement proves that Baal-hermon was between Bashan and the mountains
of Hermon. In harmony with this, the following places in the north of
Canaan are mentioned in [Jos 13:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004.md),
and [Jdg 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md), as being left
unconquered by Joshua: - (1.) "All the land of the Canaanites (i.e., of
the Phoenicians who dwelt on the coast), and the cave of the Sidonians
to Aphek;" מערה, probably the spelunca inexpugnabilis in territorio
Sidoniensi, quae vulgo dicitur cavea de Tyrum (Wilh. Tyr. xix. 11), the
present Mughr Jezzin, i.e., caves of Jezzin, to the east of Sidon upon
Lebanon (Ritter, Erdk. xvii. pp. 99, 100); and Aphek, probably the
modern Afka, to the north-east of Beirut (Robinson, Bibl. Res.). (2.)
"The land of the Giblites," i.e., the territory of Byblos, and "all
Lebanon towards the east, from Baal-Gad below Hermon, till you come to
Hamath," i.e., not Antilibanus, but Lebanon, which lies to the east of
the land of the Giblites. The land of the Giblites, or territory of
Gebal, which is cited here as the northernmost district of the
unconquered land, so that its northern boundary must have coincided with
the northern boundary of Canaan, can hardly have extended to the
latitude of Tripoli, but probably only reached to the cedar grove at
Bjerreh, in the neighbourhood of which the highest peaks of the Lebanon
are found. The territory of the tribes of Asher and Naphtali (Josh
19:24-39) did not reach farther up than this. From all these accounts,
we must not push the northern boundary of Canaan as far as the
Eleutherus, Nahr el Kebir, but must draw it farther to the south, across
the northern portion of the Lebanon; so that we may look for Hazar-enan
(fountain-court), which is mentioned as the end of the northern
boundary, and the starting-point of the eastern, near the fountain of
Lebweh. This fountain forms the water-shed in the Bekaa, between the
Orontes, which flows to the north, and the Leontes, which flows to the
south (cf. Robinson, Bibl. Res. p. 531), and is not only a very large
fountain of the finest clear water, springing at different points from
underneath a broad piece of coarse gravel, which lies to the west of a
vein of limestone, but the whole of the soil is of such a character,
that "you have only to dig in the gravel, to get as many springs as you
please." The quantity of water which is found here is probably even
greater than that at the Anjar. In addition to the four principal
streams, there are three or four smaller ones (Robinson, Bibl. Res. p.
532), so that this place might be called, with perfect justice, by the
name of fountain-court. The probability of this conjecture is also
considerably increased by the fact, that the Ain, mentioned in [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011.md) as a point upon the eastern
boundary, can also be identified without any difficulty (see at [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011).md).

[Numbers 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 34:10</span></span>

The Eastern Boundary. - If we endeavour to trace the upper line of the
eastern boundary from the fountain-place just mentioned, it ran from
Hazar-enan to Shepham, the site of which is unknown, and "from Shepham
it was to go down to Riblah, on the east of Ain" (the fountain). The
article הרבלה, and still more the precise description, "to the east of
Ain, the fountain, or fountain locality" (Knobel), show plainly that
this Riblah is to be distinguished from the Riblah in the land of Hamath
([Kg2 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033.md); [Kg2
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021.md); [Jer
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009.md); [Jer
52:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#027).md), with which it is mostly
identified. Ain is supposed to be "the great fountain of Neba Anjar, at
the foot of Antilibanus, which is often called Birket Anjar, on account
of its taking its rise in a small reservoir or pool" (Robinson, Bibl.
Res. p. 498), and near to which Mej-del-Anjar is to be seen, consisting
of "the ruins of the walls and towers of a fortified town, or rather of
a large citadel" (Robinson, p. 496; cf. Ritter, xvii. pp. 181ff.).

(Note: Knobel regards Ain as the source of the Orontes, i.e., Neba
Lebweh, and yet, notwithstanding this, identifies Riblah with the
village of Ribleh mentioned above. But can this Ribleh, which is at
least eight hours to the north of Neba Lebweh, be described as on the
east of Ain, i.e., Neba Lebweh?)

From this point the boundary went farther down, and pressed (מחה) "upon
the shoulder of the lake of Chinnereth towards the east," i.e., upon the
north-east shore of the Sea of Galilee (see [Jos
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035).md). Hence it ran down along the
Jordan to the Salt Sea (Dead Sea). According to these statements,
therefore, the eastern boundary went from Bekaa along the western slopes
of Antilibanus, over or past Rasbeya and Banyas, at the foot of Hermon,
along the edge of the mountains which bound the Huleh basin towards the
east, down to the north-east corner of the Sea of Galilee; so that
Hermon itself (Jebel es Sheikh) did not belong to the land of Israel.

[Numbers 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 34:13</span></span>

This land, according to the boundaries thus described, the Israelites
were to distribute by lot ([Num
26:56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#056).md), to give it to the nine tribes
and a half, as the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh had already
received their inheritance on the other side of the Jordan ([Num
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033)..md).

List of the Men Appointed to Distribute the Land. - In addition to
Eleazar and Joshua, the former of whom was to stand at the head as high
priest, in accordance with the divine appointment in [Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md), and the latter to occupy the
second place as commander of the army, a prince was selected from each
of the ten tribes who were interested in the distribution, as Reuben and
Gad had nothing to do with it. Of these princes, namely heads of
fathers' houses of the tribes ([Jos
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001).md), not heads of tribes (see at
[Num 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#002).md), Caleb, who is well known
from Num 13, is the only one whose name if known. The others are not
mentioned anywhere else. The list of tribes, in the enumeration of their
princes, corresponds, with some exceptions, to the situation of the
territory which the tribes received in Canaan, reckoning from south to
north, and deviates considerably from the order in which the lots came
out for the different tribes, as described in Josh 15-19. נחל in the
Kal, in [Num 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#017.md) and [Num
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#018.md), signifies to give for an
inheritance, just as in [Exo 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#008.md), to
put into possession. There is not sufficient ground for altering the Kal
into Piel, especially as the Piel in [Num
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#029.md) is construed with the accusative
of the person, and with the thing governed by ב; whereas in [Num
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#017.md) the Kal is construed with the
person governed by ל, and the accusative of the thing.
