### [Genesis Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 41:1</span></span>

Pharaoh's Dreams and Their Interpretation. - Two full years afterwards
(ימים accus. "in days," as in [Gen
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014).md) Pharaoh had a dream. He was
standing by the Nile, and saw seven fine fat cows ascend from the Nile
and feed in the Nile-grass (אחוּ an Egyptian word); and behind them
seven others, ugly (according to [Gen
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#019.md), unparalleled in their
ugliness), lean (בּשׂר דּקּות "thin in flesh," for which we find in [Gen
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#019.md) דּלּות "fallen away," and בּשׂר
רקּות withered in flesh, fleshless), which placed themselves beside
those fat ones on the brink of the Nile and devoured them, without there
being any effect to show that they had eaten them. He then awoke, but
fell asleep again and had a second, similar dream: seven fat ([Gen
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#022), full.md) and fine ears grew upon
one blade, and were swallowed up by seven thin ([Gen
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#023), "and hardened".md) ones, which
were blasted by the east wind (קדים i.e., the S.E. wind, Chamsin, from
the desert of Arabia).

[Genesis 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 41:7</span></span>

"Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold it was a dream." The dream was so like
reality, that in was only when he woke that he perceived it was a dream.

[Genesis 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 41:8</span></span>

Being troubled about this double dream, Pharaoh sent the next morning
for all the scribes and wise men of Egypt, to have it interpreted.
חרטתּים, from חרט a stylus (pencil), and the ίερογραμματεῖς, men of the
priestly caste, who occupied themselves with the sacred arts and
sciences of the Egyptians, the hieroglyphic writings, astrology, the
interpretation of dreams, the foretelling of events, magic, and
conjuring, and who were regarded as the possessors of secret arts (vid.,
[Exo 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011).md) and the wise men of the
nation. But not one of these could interpret it, although the clue to
the interpretation was to be found in the religious symbols of Egypt.
For the cow was the symbol of Isis, the goddess of the all-sustaining
earth, and in the hieroglyphics it represented the earth, agriculture,
and food; and the Nile, by its overflowing, was the source of the
fertility of the land. But however simple the explanation of the fat and
lean cows ascending out of the Nile appears to be, it is "the fate of
the wisdom of this world, that where it suffices it is compelled to be
silent. For it belongs to the government of God to close the lips of the
eloquent, and take away the understanding of the aged ([Job
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#020).md)." Baumgarten.

[Genesis 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 41:9</span></span>

In this dilemma the head cup-bearer thought of Joseph; and calling to
mind his offence against the king ([Gen
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#001).md), and his ingratitude to Joseph
([Gen 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#023).md), he related to the king
how Joseph had explained their dreams to him and the chief baker in the
prison, and how entirely the interpretation had come true.

[Genesis 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 41:14</span></span>

Pharaoh immediately sent for Joseph. As quickly as possible he was
fetched from the prison; and after shaving the hair of his head and
beard, and changing his clothes, as the customs of Egypt required (see
Hengst. Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 30), he went in to the king. On
the king's saying to him, "I have heard of thee (עליך de te), thou
hearest a dream to interpret it," - i.e., thou only needest to hear a
dream, and thou canst at once interpret it - Joseph replied, "Not I
(בּלעדי, lit., "not so far as me," this is not in my power, vid., [Gen
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024).md), God will answer Pharaoh's
good," i.e., what shall profit Pharaoh; just as in [Gen
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#008.md) he had pointed the two prisoners
away from himself to God. Pharaoh then related his double dream ([Gen
41:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#017).md), and Joseph gave the
interpretation ([Gen 41:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#025).md): "The
dream of Pharaoh is one (i.e., the two dreams have the same meaning);
God hath showed Pharaoh what He is about to do." The seven cows and
seven ears of corn were seven years, the fat ones very fertile years of
superabundance, the lean ones very barren years of famine; the latter
would follow the former over the whole land of Egypt, so that the years
of famine would leave no trace of the seven fruitful years; and, "for
that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice" (i.e., so far as this
fact is concerned, it signifies) "that the thing is firmly resolved by
God, and God will quickly carry it out." In the confidence of this
interpretation which looked forward over fourteen years, the divinely
enlightened seer's glance was clearly manifested, and could not fail to
make an impression upon the king, when contrasted with the perplexity of
the Egyptian augurs and wise men. Joseph followed up his interpretation
by the advice ([Gen 41:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#033).md), that
Pharaoh should "look out (ירא) a man discreet and wise, and set him over
the land of Egypt;" and cause יעשׂה) that in the seven years of
superabundance he should raise fifths (חמּשׁ), i.e., the fifth part of
the harvest, through overseers, and have the corn, or the stores of food
(אכל), laid up in the cities "under the hand of the king," i.e., by
royal authority and direction, as food for the land for the seven years
of famine, that it might not perish through famine.

[Genesis 41:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">gen 41:37</span></span>

Joseph's Promotion. - This counsel pleased Pharaoh and all his servants,
so that he said to them, "Shall we find a man like this one, in whom the
Spirit of God is?" "The Spirit of Elohim," i.e., the spirit of
supernatural insight and wisdom. He then placed Joseph over his house,
and over all Egypt; in other words, he chose him as hid grand vizier,
saying to him, "After God hath showed thee all this, there is none
discreet and wise as thou." ישּׁק על־פּיך, "according to thy mouth
(i.e., command, [Gen 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#021).md) shall my
whole people arrange itself." נשׁק does not mean to kiss (Rabb., Ges.,
etc.), for על נשׁק is not Hebrew, and kissing the mouth was not
customary as an act of homage, but "to dispose, arrange one's self"
(ordine disposuit). "Only in the throne will I be greater than thou."

[Genesis 41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">gen 41:42</span></span>

As an installation in this post of honour, the king handed him his
signet-ring, the seal which the grand vizier or prime minister wore, to
give authority to the royal edicts ([Est
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#010).md), clothed him in a byssus dress
(שׁשׁ, fine muslin or white cotton fabric),

(Note: See my Bibl. Antiquities, 17, 5. The reference, no doubt, is to
the ἐσθῆτα λινέην, worn by the Egyptian priests, which was not made of
linen, but of the frutex quem aliqui gossipion vocant, plures xylon et
ideo LINA inde facta xylina. Nec ulla sunt eis candore mollitiave
praeferenda. - Vestes inde sacerdotibus Aegypti gratissimae. Plin. h.n.
xix. 1.)

and put upon his neck the golden chain, which was usually worn in Egypt
as a mark of distinction, as the Egyptian monuments show (Hgst. pp. 30,
31).

[Genesis 41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">gen 41:43</span></span>

He then had him driven in the second chariot, the chariot which followed
immediately upon the king's state-carriage; that is to say, he directed
a solemn procession to be made through the city, in which they (heralds)
cried before him אברך (i.e., bow down), - an Egyptian word, which has
been pointed by the Masorites according to the Hiphil or Aphel of בּרך.
In Coptic it is abork, projicere, with the signs of the imperative and
the second person. Thus he placed him over all Egypt. ונתון inf. absol.
as a continuation of the finite verb (vid., [Exo
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#011.md); [Lev
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#014), etc..md).

[Genesis 41:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">gen 41:44</span></span>

"I am Pharaoh," he said to him, "and without thee shall no man lift his
hand or foot in all the land of Egypt;" i.e., I am the actual king, and
thou, the next to me, shalt rule over all my people.

[Genesis 41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">gen 41:45</span></span>

But in order that Joseph might be perfectly naturalized, the king gave
him an Egyptian name, Zaphnath-Paaneah, and married him to Asenath, the
daughter of Potipherah, the priest at On. The name Zaphnath-Paaneah (a
form adapted to the Hebrew, for Ψονθομφανήχ lxx; according to a Greek
scholium, σωτὴρ κόσμον, "salvator mundi" (Jerome), answers to the Coptic
P-sote-m-ph-eneh, - P the article, sote salvation, m the sign of the
genitive, ph the article, and eneh the world (lit., aetas, seculum); or
perhaps more correctly, according to Rosellini and more recent
Egyptologists, to the Coptic P-sont-em-ph-anh, i.e., sustentator vitae,
support or sustainer of life, with reference to the call entrusted to
him by God.

(Note: Luther in his version, "privy councillor," follows the rabbinical
explanation, which was already to be found in Josephus (Ant. ii. 6, 1):
κρυπτῶν εὑρετής, from צפנת = צפנות occulta, and פענח revelator.)

Asenath, Ἀσενέθ (lxx), possibly connected with the name Neith, the
Egyptian Pallas. Poti-Phera, Πετεφρῆ (lxx), a Coptic name signifying
ille qui solis est, consecrated to the sun (φρη with the aspirated
article signifies the sun in Memphitic). On was the popular name for
Heliopolis (Ἡλιούπολις, lxx), and according to Cyrill. Alex. and [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md) signifies the sun; whilst the name
upon the monuments is ta-R or pa-R, house of the sun (Brugsch,
Reisebericht, p. 50). From a very early date there was a celebrated
temple of the sun here, with a learned priesthood, which held the first
place among the priests' colleges of Egypt (Herod. 2, 3; Hengst. pp.
32ff.). This promotion of Joseph, from the position of a Hebrew slave
pining in prison to the highest post of honour in the Egyptian kingdom,
is perfectly conceivable, on the one hand, from the great importance
attached in ancient times to the interpretation of dreams and to all
occult science, especially among the Egyptians, and on the other hand,
from the despotic form of government in the East; but the miraculous
power of God is to be seen in the fact, that God endowed Joseph with the
gift of infallible interpretation, and so ordered the circumstances that
this gift opened the way for him to occupy that position in which he
became the preserver, not of Egypt alone, but of his own family also.
And the same hand of God, by which he had been so highly exalted after
deep degradation, preserved him in his lofty post of honour from sinking
into the heathenism of Egypt; although, by his alliance with the
daughter of a priest of the sun, the most distinguished caste in the
land, he had fully entered into the national associations and customs of
the land.

[Genesis 41:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">gen 41:46</span></span>

Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, and went out from
him and passed through all the land of Egypt, i.e., when he took
possession of his office; consequently he had been in Egypt for 13 years
as a slave, and at least three years in prison.

[Genesis 41:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">gen 41:47</span></span>

For the seven years of superabundance the land bore לקמצים, in full
hands or bundles; and Joseph gathered all the provisional store of these
years (i.e., the fifth part of the produce, which was levied) into the
cities. "The food of the field of the city, which was round about it, he
brought into the midst of it;" i.e., he provided granaries in the towns,
in which the corn of the whole surrounding country was stored. In this
manner he collected as much corn "as the sand of the sea," until he left
off reckoning the quantity, or calculating the number of bushels, which
the monuments prove to have been the usual mode adopted (vid., Hengst.
p. 36).

[Genesis 41:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">gen 41:50</span></span>

During the fruitful years two sons were born to Joseph. The first-born
he named Manasseh, i.e., causing to forget; "for, he said, God hath made
me forget all my toil and all my father's house (נשּׁני, an Aram. Piel
form, for נשּׁני, on account of the resemblance in sound to מנשּׁה)."
Haec pia est, ac sancta gratiarum actio, quod Deus oblivisci eum fecit
pristinas omnes areumnas: sed nullus honor tanti esse debuit, ut
desiderium et memoriam paternae domus ex animo deponeret (Calvin). But
the true answer to that question, whether it was a Christian boast for
him to make, that he had forgotten father and mother, is given by
Luther: "I see that God would take away the reliance which I placed upon
my father; for God is a jealous God, and will not suffer the heart to
have any other foundation to rely upon, but Him alone." This also meets
the objection raised by Theodoret, why Joseph did not inform his father
of his life and promotion, but allowed so may years to pass away, until
he was led to do so at last in consequence of the arrival of his
brothers. The reason of this forgetfulness and silence can only be found
in the fact, that through the wondrous alteration in his condition he
had been led to see, that he was brought to Egypt according to the
counsel of God, and was redeemed by God from slavery and prison, and had
been exalted by Him to be lord over Egypt; so that, knowing he was in
the hand of God, the firmness of his faith led him to renounce all
wilful interference with the purposes of God, which pointed to a still
broader and more glorious goal (Baumgarten, Delitzsch).

[Genesis 41:52](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">gen 41:52</span></span>

The second son he named Ephraim, i.e., double-fruitfulness; "for God
hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction." Even after his
elevation Egypt still continued the land of affliction, so that in this
word we may see one trace of a longing for the promised land.

[Genesis 41:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">gen 41:53</span></span>

When the years of scarcity commenced, at the close of the years of
plenty, the famine spread over all (the neighbouring) lands; only in
Egypt was there bread. As the famine increased in the land, and the
people cried to Pharaoh for bread, he directed them to Joseph, who
"opened all in which was" (bread), i.e., all the granaries, and sold
corn (שׁבר, denom. from שׁבר, signifies to trade in corn, to buy and
sell corn) to the Egyptians, and (as the writer adds, with a view to
what follows) to all the world (כּל־הארץ, [Gen
41:57](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#057).md), that came thither to buy corn,
because the famine was great on every hand. - Years of famine have
frequently fallen, like this one, upon Egypt, and the neighbouring
countries to the north. The cause of this is to be seen in the fact,
that the overflowing of the Nile, to which Egypt is indebted for its
fertility, is produced by torrents of rain falling in the alpine regions
of Abyssinia, which proceed from clouds formed in the Mediterranean and
carried thither by the wind; consequently it has a common origin with
the rains of Palestine (see the proofs in Hengst. pp. 37ff.).
