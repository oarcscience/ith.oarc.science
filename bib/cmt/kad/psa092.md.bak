Sabbath Thoughts

This Song-Psalm for the Sabbath-day was the Sabbath-Psalm among the
week's Psalms of the post-exilic service (cf. pp. 18, 211); and was sung
in the morning at the drink-offering of the first Tamd lamb, just as at
the accompanying Sabbath-musaph-offering ([Num
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009)..md) a part of the song Deut. 32
(divided into six parts) was sung, and at the service connected with the
Mincha or evening sacrifice one of the three pieces, [Exo
15:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md), [Exo
15:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md), [Num
21:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017) (B. Rosh ha-Shana 31a.md). 1
Macc. 9:23 is a reminiscence from [Psa
92:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md) deviating but little from the
lxx version, just as 1 Macc. 7:17 is a quotation taken from Ps 89. With
respect to the sabbatical character of the Psalm, it is a disputed
question even in the Talmud whether it relates to the Sabbath of the
Creation (R. Nehemiah, as it is taken by the Targum) or to the final
Sabbath of the world's history (R. Akiba: the day that is altogether
Sabbath; cf. Athanasius: αἰνεῖ ἐκείνην τὴν γενησομένην ἀνάπαυσιν). The
latter is relatively more correct. It praises God, the Creator of the
world, as the Ruler of the world, whose rule is pure loving-kindness and
faithfulness, and calms itself, in the face of the flourishing condition
of the evil-doers, with the prospect of the final issue, which will
brilliantly vindicate the righteousness of God, that was at that time
imperceptible to superficial observation, and will change the
congregation of the righteous into a flourishing grove of palms and
cedars upon holy ground. In this prospect [Psa
92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md) and [Psa
91:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008.md) coincide, just as God is also
called "the Most High" at the beginning of these two Psalms. But that
the tetragrammaton occurs seven times in both Psalms, as Hengstenberg
says, does not turn out to be correct. Only the Sabbath-Psalm (and not
Ps 91) repeats the most sacred Name seven times. And certainly the
unmistakeable strophe-schema too, 6. 6. 7. 6. 6, is not without
significance. The middle of the Psalm bears the stamp of the sabbatic
number. It is also worthy of remark that the poet gains the number seven
by means of an anadiplosis in [Psa
92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010.md). Such an emphatic climax by
means of repetition is common to our Psalm with [Psa
93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003.md); [Psa
94:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003.md); [Psa
96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 92:1</span></span>

The Sabbath is the day that God has hallowed, and that is to be
consecrated to God by our turning away from the business pursuits of the
working days ([Isa 58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013)..md) and
applying ourselves to the praise and adoration of God, which is the most
proper, blessed Sabbath employment. It is good, i.e., not merely good in
the eyes of God, but also good for man, beneficial to the heart,
pleasant and blessed. Loving-kindness is designedly connected with the
dawn of the morning, for it is morning light itself, which breaks
through the night ([Psa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006.md); [Psa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017).md), and faithfulness with the
nights, for in the perils of the loneliness of the night it is the best
companion, and nights of affliction are the "foil of its verification."
עשׂור beside נבל (נבל) is equivalent to נבל עשׂור in [Psa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#002.md); [Psa
144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md) : the ten-stringed harp or lyre.
הגּיון is the music of stringed instruments (vid., on [Psa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017).md), and that, since הגה in itself
is not a suitable word for the rustling (strepitus) of the strings, the
impromptu or phantasia playing (in [Amo
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005), scornfully, פּרט.md), which suits
both [Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md) (where it is appended
to the forte of the interlude) and the construction with Beth
instrumenti.

[Psalms 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 92:4</span></span>

Statement of the ground of this commendation of the praise of God.
Whilst פּעל is the usual word for God's historical rule ([Psa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md); [Psa
64:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#010.md); [Psa
90:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#016), etc..md), מעשׂי ידיך denotes the
works of the Creator of the world, although not to the exclusion of
those of the Ruler of the world ([Psa
143:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#005).md). To be able to rejoice over the
revelation of God in creation and the revelation of God in general is a
gift from above, which the poet thankfully confesses that he has
received. The Vulgate begins [Psa 92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md)
Quia delectasti me, and Dante in his Purgatorio, xxviii. 80, accordingly
calls the Psalm il Salmo Delectasti; a smiling female form, which
represents the life of Paradise, says, as she gathers flowers, she is so
happy because, with the Psalm Delectasti, she takes a delight in the
glory of God's works. The works of God are transcendently great; very
deep are His thoughts, which mould human history and themselves gain
from in it (cf. [Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); [Psa
139:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017.md)., where infinite fulness is
ascribed to them, and [Isa 55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md), where
infinite height is ascribed to them). Man can neither measure the
greatness of the divine works nor fathom the depth of the divine
thoughts; he who is enlightened, however, perceives the immeasurableness
of the one and the unfathomableness of the other, whilst a אישׁ־בּער, a
man of animal nature, homo brutus (vid., [Psa
73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022).md), does not come to the knowledge
(לא ידע, used absolutely as in [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004).md), and כּסיל, a blockhead, or one
dull in mind, whose carnal nature outweighs his intellectual and
spiritual nature, does not discern את־זאת (cf. [Sa2
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#017).md), id ipsum, viz., how
unsearchable are God's judgments and untrackable His ways ([Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033).md).

[Psalms 92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 92:7</span></span>

Upon closer examination the prosperity of the ungodly is only a
semblance that lasts for a time. The infinitive construction in [Psa
92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008.md) is continued in the historic
tense, and it may also be rendered as historical. זאת היתה (Saadia:
Arab. fânnh) is to be supplied in thought before להשּׁמדם, as in [Job
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#014.md). What is spoken of is an
historical occurrence which, in its beginning, course, and end, has been
frequently repeated even down to the present day, and ever confirmed
afresh. And thus, too, in time to come and once finally shall the
ungodly succumb to a peremptory, decisive (עדי־עד) judgment of
destruction. Jahve is מרום לעלם, by His nature and by His rule He is "a
height for ever;" i.e., in relation to the creature and all that goes on
here below He has a nature beyond and above all this (Jenseitigkeit),
ever the same and absolute; He is absolutely inaccessible to the
God-opposed one here below who vaunts himself in stupid pride and
rebelliously exalts himself as a titan, and only suffers it to last
until the term of his barren blossoming is run out. Thus the present
course of history will and must in fact end in a final victory of good
over evil: for lo Thine enemies, Jahve - for lo Thine enemies.... הנּה
points as it were with the finger to the inevitable end; and the
emotional anadiplosis breathes forth a zealous love for the cause of God
as if it were his own. God's enemies shall perish, all the workers of
evil shall be disjointed, scattered, יתפּרדוּ (cf. [Job
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#011).md). Now they form a compact mass,
which shall however fall to pieces, when one day the intermingling of
good and evil has an end.

[Psalms 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 92:10</span></span>

The hitherto oppressed church then stands forth vindicated and glorious.
The futt. consec. as preterites of the ideal past, pass over further on
into the pure expression of future time. The lxx renders: καὶ ὑψωθήσεται
(ותּרם) ὡς μονοκέρωτος τὸ κέρας μου. By ראים (incorrect for ראם, primary
form ראם), μονόκερως, is surely to be understood the oryx, one-horned
according to Aristotle and the Talmud (vid., on [Psa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006.md); [Job
39:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#009).md). This animal is called in
Talmudic קרשׂ (perhaps abbreviated from μονόκερως); the Talmud also
makes use of ארזילא (the gazelle) as synonymous with ראם (Aramaic
definitive or emphatic state רימא).

(Note: Vid., Lewysohn, Zoologie des Talmud, 146 and 174.)

The primary passages for figures taken from animal life are [Num
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022.md); [Deu
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md). The horn is an emblem of
defensive power and at the same time of stately grace; and the fresh,
green oil an emblem of the pleasant feeling and enthusiasm, joyous in
the prospect of victory, by which the church is then pervaded ([Act
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019).md). The lxx erroneously takes
בּלּותי as infin. Piel, τὸ γῆράς μου, my being grown old, a
signification which the Piel cannot have. It is 1st praet. Kal from
בּלל, perfusus sum (cf. Arabic balla, to be moist, ballah and bullah,
moistness, good health, the freshness of youth), and the
ultima-accentuation, which also occurs in this form of double Ajin verbs
without Waw convers. (vid., on [Job
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#017).md), ought not to mislead. In the
expression שׁמן רענן, the adjective used in other instances only of the
olive-tree itself is transferred to the oil, which contains the strength
of its succulent verdure as an essence. The ecclesia pressa is then
triumphans. The eye, which was wont to look timidly and tearfully upon
the persecutors, the ears, upon which even their name and the tidings of
their approach were wont to produce terror, now see their desire upon
them as they are blotted out. שׁמע בּ (found only here) follows the
sense of ראה בּ, cf. Arab. nḍr fı̂, to lose one's self in the
contemplation of anything. שׁוּרי is either a substantive after the form
בּוּז, גּוּר, or a participle in the signification "those who regarded
me with hostility, those who lay in wait for me," like נוּס, fled, [Num
35:32](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#032.md), סוּר, having removed themselves
to a distance, [Jer 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md), שׁוּב,
turned back, [Mic 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md); for this
participial form has not only a passive signification (like מוּל,
circumcised), but sometimes too, a deponent perfect signification; and
חוּשׁ in [Num 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#017.md), if it belongs
here, may signify hurried = in haste. In שׁוּרי, however, no such
passive colouring of the meaning is conceivable; it is therefore:
insidiati (Luzatto, Grammatica, 518: coloro che mi guatavano). There is
no need for regarding the word, with Bttcher and Olshausen, as distorted
from שׁררי (the apocopated participle Pilel of the same verb); one might
more readily regard it as a softening of that word as to the sound
(Ewald, Hitzig). In [Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md) it is
not to be rendered: upon the wicked doers (villains) who rise up against
me. The placing of the adjective thus before its substantive must (with
the exception of רב when used after the manner of a numeral) be
accounted impossible in Hebrew, even in the face of the passages brought
forward by Hitzig, viz., [Ch1 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#005.md);
[Sa1 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003.md);

(Note: In the former passage כהן ראשׁ is taken as one notion (chief
priest), and in the latter אנשׁים בקשׁת (men with the bow) is, with
Keil, to be regarded as an apposition.)

it is therefore: upon those who as villains rise up against. The
circumstance that the poet now in [Psa
92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md) passes from himself to speak of
the righteous, is brought about by the fact that it is the congregation
of the righteous in general, i.e., of those who regulate their life
according to the divine order of salvation, into whose future he here
takes a glance. When the prosperity lit. the blossoming of the ungodly
comes to an end, the springing up and growth of the righteous only then
rightly has its beginning. The richness of the inflorescence of
date-palm (תּמר) is clear from the fact, that when it has attained its
full size, it bears from three to four, and in some instances even as
many as six, hundred pounds of fruit. And there is no more charming and
majestic sight than the palm of the oasis, this prince among the trees
of the plain, with its proudly raised diadem of leaves, its attitude
peering forth into the distance and gazing full into the face of the
sun, its perennial verdure, and its vital force, which constantly renews
itself from the root - a picture of life in the midst of the world of
death. The likening of the righteous to the palm, to the "blessed tree,"
to this "sister of man," as the Arabs call it, offers points of
comparison in abundance. Side by side with the palm is the cedar, the
prince of the trees of the mountain, and in particular of Mount Lebanon.
The most natural point of comparison, as ישׂגּה (cf. [Job
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011).md) states, is its graceful lofty
growth, then in general τὸ δασὺ καὶ θερμὸν καὶ θρέψιμον (Theodoret),
i.e., the intensity of its vegetative strength, but also the perpetual
verdure of its foliage and the perfume ([Hos
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007).md) which it exhales.

[Psalms 92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 92:13</span></span>

The soil in which the righteous are planted or (if it is not rendered
with the lxx πεφυτευμένοι, but with the other Greek versions
μεταφυτευθέντες) into which they are transplanted, and where they take
root, a planting of the Lord, for His praise, is His holy Temple, the
centre of a family fellowship with God that is brought about from that
point as its starting-point and is unlimited by time and space. There
they stand as in sacred ground and air, which impart to them ever new
powers of life; they put forth buds (הפריח as in [Job
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#009).md) and preserve a verdant freshness
and marrowy vitality (like the olive, 52:10, [Jdg
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#009).md) even into their old age (נוּב of
a productive force for putting out shoots; vid., with reference to the
root נב, Genesis, S. 635f.), cf. [Isa
65:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#022.md) : like the duration of the trees
is the duration of my people; they live long in unbroken strength, in
order, in looking back upon a life rich in experiences of divine acts of
righteousness and loving-kindness, to confirm the confession which
Moses, in [Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md), places at the
head of his great song. There the expression is אין עול, here it is אין
עלתה בּו. This ‛ôlātha, softened from ‛awlātha - So the Ker - with a
transition from the aw, au into ô, is also found in [Job
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#016.md) (cf. עלה = עולה [Psa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003.md); [Psa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md); [Isa
61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008).md), and is certainly original in
this Psalm, which also has many other points of coincidence with the
Book of Job (like Ps 107, which, however, in [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042) transposes עלתה into עולה.md).
