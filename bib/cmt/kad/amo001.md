### [Amos Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

I. The Approaching Judgment - [Amo
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md) and 2

Starting from the saying of Joel ([Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016).md), "Jehovah will roar out of Zion,
and utter His voice from Jerusalem," Amos announces the wrath of the
Lord, which will discharge itself upon Damascus ([Amo
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003).md), Philistia ([Amo
1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006).md), Tyre ([Amo
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#009).md), Edom ([Amo
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011).md), Ammon ([Amo
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013).md), Moab ([Amo
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001).md), Judah ([Amo
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004).md), and Israel ([Amo
2:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006).md). The announcement of this
judgment maintains a certain uniformity throughout; every one of these
nations being threatened with the destruction of the kingdom, or with
ruin and exile, "for three or four transgressions;" and the threat, as
Rckert has well expressed it, "rolling like a storm, in strophe after
strophe, over all the surrounding kingdoms," touching Judah as it passes
along, and eventually resting over Israel. The six heathen nations
mentioned, three of which are related to the covenant nation, represent
all the Gentile nations, which rise up in hostility to the people or
kingdom of God. For the sins on account of which they are to be
punished, are not certain general breaches of morality, but crimes which
they have committed against the people of God; and in the case of Judah,
contempt of the commandments of the Lord, and idolatry. The whole
section, not merely Amos 1:2-2:5, but also [Amo
2:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006.md), has an introductory character.
Whilst, on the one hand, the extension of the prediction of judgment to
the Gentile nations indicates the necessity and universality of the
judgment, which is sent to promote the interests of the kingdom of God,
and preaches the truth that every one will be judged according to his
attitude towards the living God; on the other hand, the place assigned
to the Gentile nations, viz., before the covenant nation, not only
sharpened the conscience, but taught this lesson, that if even the
nations which had only sinned indirectly against the living God were
visited with severe punishment, those to whom God had so gloriously
revealed Himself ([Amo 2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009.md); [Amo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001).md) would be punished still more
surely for their apostasy ([Amo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002).md).
It is with this design that Judah is also mentioned along with Israel,
and in fact before it. "The intention was to impress this truth most
strongly upon the people of the ten tribes, that not even the possession
of such glorious prerogatives as the temple and the throne of David
could avert the merited punishment. If this be the energy of the justice
of God, what have we to look for?" (Hengstenberg).

[Amos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 1:1</span></span>

[Amo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md) contains the heading, which
has already been discussed in the Introduction; and אשׁר חזה ("which he
saw") refers to דּברי עמוס (the words of Amos). [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md) forms the Introduction, which is
attached to the heading by ויּאמר, and announces a revelation of the
wrath of God upon Israel, or a theocratic judgment. [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md). "Jehovah roars out of Zion, and
He utters His voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds
mourn, and the head of Carmel withers." The voice of Jehovah is the
thunder, the earthly substratum in which the Lord manifests His coming
to judgment (see at [Joe 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016).md). By the
adoption of the first half of the verse word for word from Joel, Amos
connects his prophecy with that of his predecessor, not so much with the
intention of confirming the latter, as for the purpose of alarming the
sinners who were at east in their security, and overthrowing the
delusive notion that the judgment of God would only fall upon the
heathen world. This delusion he meets with the declaration, that at the
threatening of the wrath of God the pastures of the shepherds, i.e., the
pasture-ground of the land of Israel (cf. [Joe
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#019).md), and the head of the
forest-crowned Carmel, will fade and wither. Carmel is the oft-recurring
promontory at the mouth of the Kishon on the Mediterranean (see the
comm. on [Jos 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026.md) and [Kg1
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019).md), and not the place called
Carmel on the mountains of Judah ([Jos
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055)), to which the term ראשׁ (head.md)
is inapplicable (vid., [Amo 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003.md) and
[Mic 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014).md). Shepherds' pastures and
Carmel individualized the land of Israel in a manner that was very
natural to Amos the shepherd. With this introduction, Amos announces the
theme of his prophecies. And if, instead of proceeding at once to
describe still further the judgment that threatens the kingdom of
Israel, he first of all enumerates the surrounding nations, including
Judah, as objects of the manifestation of the wrath of God, this
enumeration cannot have any other object than the one described in our
survey of the contents of the book. The enumeration opens with the
kingdoms of Aram, Philistia, and Tyre (Phoenicia), which were not
related to Israel by any ties of kinship whatever.

[Amos 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 1:3</span></span>

Aram-Damascus. - [Amo 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003.md). "Thus saith
Jehovah, For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I shall not
reverse it, because they have threshed Gilead with iron rollers, [Amo
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md). I send fire into the house of
Hazael, and it will eat the palaces of Ben-hadad, [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md). And break in pieces the bolt of
Damascus, and root out the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and the
sceptre-holder out of Beth-eden: and the people of Aram will wander into
captivity to Kir, saith Jehovah." In the formula, which is repeated in
the case of every people, "for three transgressions, and for four," the
numbers merely serve to denote the multiplicity of the sins, the exact
number of which has no bearing upon the matter. "The number four is
added to the number three, to characterize the latter as simply set down
at pleasure; in other words, it is as much as to say that the number is
not exactly three or four, but probably a still larger number" (Hitzig).
The expression, therefore, denotes not a small but a large number of
crimes, or "ungodliness in its worst form" (Luther; see at [Hos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002).md)

(Note: J. Marck has correctly explained it thus: "When this perfect
number (three) is followed by four, by way of gradation, God not only
declares that the measure of iniquity is full, but that it is filled to
overflowing and beyond all measure.").

That these numbers are to be understood in this way, and not to be taken
in a literal sense, is unquestionably evident from the fact, that nit he
more precise account of the sins which follows, as a rule, only one
especially grievous crime is mentioned by way of example. לא אשׁיבנּוּ
(I will not reverse it) is inserted before the more minute description
of the crimes, to show that the threat is irrevocable. השׁיב signifies
to turn, i.e., to make a thing go back, to withdraw it, as in [Num
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#020.md); [Isa
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013.md). The suffix attached to
אשׁיבנּוּ refers neither to qōlō (his voice), nor "to the idea of דּבר
which is implied in כּה אמר (thus saith), or the substance of the
threatening thunder-voice" (Baur); for hēshı̄bh dâbhâr signifies to give
an answer, and never to make a word ineffectual. The reference is to the
punishment threatened afterwards, where the masculine stands in the
place of the neuter. Consequently the close of the verse contains the
epexegesis of the first clause, and [Amo
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md) and [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md) follow with the explanation of לא
אשׁיבנו (I will not turn it). The threshing of the Gileadites with iron
threshing-machines is mentioned as the principal transgression of the
Syrian kingdom, which is here named after the capital Damascus (see at
[Sa2 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006).md). This took place at the
conquest of the Israelitish land to the east of the Jordan by Hazael
during the reign of Jehu ([Kg2
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md), cf. [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007).md), when the conquerors acted so
cruelly towards the Gileadites, that they even crushed the prisoners to
pieces with iron threshing-machines, according to a barbarous war-custom
that is met with elsewhere (see at [Sa2
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031).md). Chârūts (= chârı̄ts, [Sa2
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031).md), lit., sharpened, is a poetical
term applied to the threshing-roller, or threshing-cart (mōrag chârūts,
[Isa 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015).md). According to Jerome, it
was "a kind of cart with toothed iron wheels underneath, which was
driven about to crush the straw in the threshing-floors after the grain
had been beaten out." The threat is individualized historically thus: in
the case of the capital, the burning of the palaces is predicted; and in
that of two other places, the destruction of the people and their
rulers; so that both of them apply to both, or rather to the whole
kingdom. The palaces of Hazael and Benhadad are to be sought for in
Damascus, the capital of the kingdom ([Jer
49:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#027).md). Hazael was the murderer of
Benhadad I, to whom the prophet Elisha foretold that he would reign over
Syria, and predicted the cruelties that he would practise towards Israel
([Kg2 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#007)..md). Benhadad is generally
regarded as his son; but the plural "palaces" leads us rather to think
of both the first and second Benhadad, and this is favoured by the
circumstance that it was only during his father's reign that Benhadad II
oppressed Israel, whereas after his death, and when he himself ascended
the throne, the conquered provinces were wrested from him by Joash king
of Israel ([Kg2 13:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022).md). The
breaking of the bar (the bolt of the gate) denotes the conquest of the
capital; and the cutting off of the inhabitants of Biq‛ath-Aven
indicates the slaughter connected with the capture of the towns, and not
their deportation; for hikhrı̄th means to exterminate, so that gâlâh
(captivity) in the last clause applies to the remainder of the
population that had not been slain in war. In the parallel clause תּומך
שׁבם, the sceptre-holder, i.e., the ruler (either the king or his
deputy), corresponds to yōshēbh (the inhabitant); and the thought
expressed is, that both prince and people, both high and low, shall
perish.

The two places, Valley-Aven and Beth-Eden, cannot be discovered with any
certainty; but at any rate they were capitals, and possibly they may
have been the seat of royal palaces as well as Damascus, which was the
first capital of the kingdom. בּקעת און, valley of nothingness, or of
idols, is supposed by Ewald and Hitzig to be a name given to Heliopolis
or Baalbek, after the analogy of Beth-aven = Bethel (see at [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008).md). They base their opinion upon the
Alex. rendering ἐκ πεδίου Ὦν, taken in connection with the Alex.
interpretation of the Egyptian On ([Gen
41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045).md) as Heliopolis. But as the lxx
have interpreted אן by Heliopolis in the book of Genesis, whereas here
they have merely reproduced the Hebrew letters און by Ὦν, as they have
in other places as well (e.g., [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md); [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md), [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008).md), where Heliopolis cannot for a
moment be thought of, the πέδιον Ὦν of the lxx furnishes no evidence in
favour of Heliopolis, still less does it warrant an alteration of the
Hebrew pointing (into און). Even the Chaldee and Syriac have taken בּקעת
און as a proper name, and Ephraem Syrus speaks of it as "a place in the
neighbourhood of Damascus, distinguished for idol-chapels." The
supposition that it is a city is also favoured by the analogy of the
other threatenings, in which, for the most part, cities only are
mentioned. Others understand by it the valley near Damascus, or the
present Bekaa between Lebanon and Antilibanus, in which Heliopolis was
always the most distinguished city, and Robinson has pronounced in
favour of this (Bibl. Res. p. 677). Bēth-‛Eden, i.e., house of delight,
is not to be sought for in the present village of Eden, on the eastern
slope of Lebanon, near to the cedar forest of Bshirrai, as the Arabic
name of this village 'hdn has nothing in common with the Hebrew עדן (see
at [Kg2 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#012).md); but it is the
Παράδεισος of the Greeks, which Ptolemy places ten degrees south and
five degrees east of Laodicea, and which Robinson imagines that he has
found in Old Jusieh, not far from Ribleh, a place belonging to the times
before the Saracens, with very extensive ruins (see Bibl. Researches,
pp. 542-6, and 556). The rest of the population of Aram would be carried
away to Kir, i.e., to the country on the banks of the river Kur, from
which, according to [Amo 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007.md), the
Syrians originally emigrated. This prediction was fulfilled when the
Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser conquered Damascus in the time of Ahaz,
and broke up the kingdom of Syria ([Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009).md). The closing words, 'âmar
Yehōvâh (saith the Lord), serve to add strength to the threat, and
therefore recur in [Amo 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008.md), [Amo
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md), and [Amo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#003.md).

[Amos 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 1:6</span></span>

Philistia. - [Amo 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md). "Thus saith
Jehovah, For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I shall not
reverse it, because they carried away captives in full number to deliver
them up to Edom, [Amo 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#007.md). I send fire
into the wall of Gaza, and it will eat their palaces; [Amo
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008.md). And I exterminate the inhabitant
from Ashdod, and the sceptre-holder from Askelon, and turn my hand
against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, saith the
Lord Jehovah." Instead of the Philistines generally, the prophet
mentions Gaza in [Amo 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md). This is
still a considerable town, bearing the old name Guzzeh (see the comm. on
[Jos 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003).md), and was the one of the
five capitals of the Philistines which had taken the most active part as
a great commercial town in handing over the Israelitish prisoners to the
Edomites. For it is evident that Gaza is simply regarded as a
representative of Philistia, from the fact that in the announcement of
the punishment, the other capitals of Philistia are also mentioned.
Gâlūth shelēmâh is correctly explained by Jerome thus: "a captivity so
perfect and complete, that not a single captive remained who was not
delivered to the Idumaeans." The reference is to captive Israelites, who
were carried off by the Philistines, and disposed of by them to the
Edomites, the arch-enemies of Israel. Amos no doubt had in his mind the
invasion of Judah by the Philistines and tribes of Arabia Petraea in the
time of Joram, which is mentioned in [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md), and to which Joel had already
alluded in [Joe 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003.md)., where the
Phoenicians and Philistines are threatened with divine retribution for
having plundered the land, and sold the captive Judaeans to the
Javanites (Ionians). But it by no means follows from this, that the
"sons of Javan" mentioned in [Joe 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006.md)
are not Greeks, but the inhabitants of the Arabian Javan noticed in [Eze
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#019.md). The fact was simply this: the
Philistines sold one portion of the many prisoners, taken at that time,
to the Edomites, and the rest to the Phoenicians, who disposed of them
again to the Greeks. Joel simply mentions the latter circumstance,
because, in accordance with the object of his prophecy, his design was
to show the wide dispersion of the Jews, and their future gathering out
of all the lands of their banishment. Amos, on the other hand, simply
condemns the delivering of the captives to Edom, the arch-foe of Israel,
to indicate the greatness of the sin involved in this treatment of the
covenant nation, or the hatred which the Philistines had displayed
thereby. As a punishment for this, the cities of Philistia would be
burned by their enemies, the inhabitants would be exterminated, and the
remnant perish. Here again, as in [Amo
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md), [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md), the threat is rhetorically
individualized, so that in the case of one city the burning of the city
itself is predicted, and in that of another the destruction of its
inhabitants. (On Ashdod, Askelon, and Ekron, see the comm. on [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003)..md) השׁיב יד, to return the hand,
i.e., to turn or stretch it out again (see comm. on [Sa2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003).md). The use of this expression may
be explained on the ground, that the destruction of the inhabitants of
Ashdod and Askelon has already been thought of as a stretching out of
the hand. The fifth of the Philistian capitals, Gath, is not mentioned,
though not for the reason assigned by Kimchi, viz., that it belonged to
the kings of Judah, or had been conquered by Uzziah, for Uzziah had not
only conquered Gath and Jabneh, but had taken Ashdod as well, and thrown
down the walls ([Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006).md), and yet
Amos mentions Ashdod; nor because Gath had been taken by the Syrians
([Kg2 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018).md), for this Syrian conquest
was not a lasting one, and in the prophet's time (cf. [Amo
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002).md), and even later (cf. [Mic
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010).md), it still maintained its
independence, and was a very distinguished city; but for the simple
reason that the individualizing description given by the prophet did not
require the complete enumeration of all the capitals, and the idea of
been named, but all that was still in existence, and had escaped
destruction" ([Amo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md) and [Jer
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009).md), it nevertheless includes not
merely the four states just named, but every part of Philistia that had
hitherto escaped destruction, so that Gath must be included.

[Amos 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 1:9</span></span>

Tyre or Phoenicia. - [Amo 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#009.md). "Thus
saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I shall
not reverse it, because they have delivered up prisoners in full number
to Edom, and have not remembered the brotherly covenant, [Amo
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#010.md). I send fire into the wall of
Tyrus, and it will devour their palaces." In the case of Phoenicia, the
capital only (Tzōr, i.e., Tyrus; see at [Jos
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029).md) is mentioned. The crime with
which it is charged is similar to the one for which the Philistines were
blamed, with this exception, that instead of על־הגלותם להסגּיר ([Amo
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006).md) we have simply על־הסגּירם. If,
therefore, Tyre is only charged with delivering up the captives to Edom,
and not with having carried them away, it must have bought the prisoners
from an enemy of Israel, and then disposed of them to Edom. From what
enemy they were purchased, it is impossible to determine with certainty.
Probably from the Syrians, in the wars of Hazael and Benhadad with
Israel; for there is nothing at variance with this in the fact that,
when they purchased Israelitish captives in the time of Joram, they sold
them to Javan. For a commercial nation, carrying on so extensive a trade
as the Phoenicians did, would have purchased prisoners in more than one
war, and would also have disposed of them as slaves to more nations than
one. Tyre had contracted all the more guilt through this trade in
Israelitish salves, from the fact that it had thereby been ummindful of
the brotherly covenant, i.e., of the friendly relation existing between
Israel and itself-for example, the friendly alliance into which David
and Solomon had entered with the king of Tyre ([Sa2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md); [Kg1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015)..md) - and also from the fact that
no king of Israel or Judah had ever made war upon Phoenicia.

[Amos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 1:11</span></span>

Edom. - [Amo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md). "Thus saith
Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I shall not
reverse it, because it pursues its brother with the sword, and stifles
its compassion, and its anger tears in pieces for ever, and it keeps its
wrath for ever, [Amo 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md). I send fire
into Teman, and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah." Edom and the two
following nations were related to Israel by lineal descent. In the case
of Edom, Amos does not condemn any particular sins, but simply its
implacable, mortal hatred towards its brother nation Israel, which broke
out into acts of cruelty at every possible opportunity. ושׁחת רחמיו, he
annihilates, i.e., suppresses, stifles his sympathy or his compassionate
love; this is still dependent upon על רדפו, the preposition על
continuing in force as a conjunction before the infinitive (i.e., as
equivalent to על אשׁר), and the infinitive passing into the finite verb
(cf. [Amo 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004).md). In the next clause
אפּו is the subject: its wrath tears in pieces, i.e., rages
destructively (compare [Job 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md),
where târaph is applied to the wrath of God). In the last clause, on the
other hand, Edom is again the subject; but it is now regarded as a
kingdom, and construed as a feminine, and consequently עברתו is the
object, and placed at the head as an absolute noun. שׁמרה, with the tone
upon the penult. (milel) on account of netsach, which follows with the
tone upon the first syllable, stands for שׁמרהּ (it preserves it), the
mappik being omitted in the toneless syllable (compare Ewald, 249, b).
If עברתו were the subject, the verb would have to be pointed שׁמרה.
Again, the rendering proposed by Ewald, "his fury lies in wait for
ever," is precluded by the fact that שׁמר, when applied to wrath in [Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005.md), signifies to keep, or preserve,
and also by the fact that lying in wait is generally inapplicable to an
emotion. Teman, according to Jerome (ad h. l.), is Idumaeorum regio quae
vergit ad australem partem, so that here, just as in [Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002.md) and [Amo
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#005.md), the land is mentioned first, and
then the capital.

(Note: It is true that, according to Eusebius, Jerome does also mention
in the Onom. a villa (κώμη) named Teman, which was five Roman miles from
Petra, and in which there was a Roman garrison; and also that there is a
Teman in Eastern Hauran (see Wetzstein in Delitzsch's Comm. on Job, i.
73); but in the Old Testament Teman is never to be understood as
referring to a city.)

Bozrah, an important city, supposed to be the capital of Idumaea (see
comm. on [Gen 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#033).md). It was to the
south of the Dead Sea, and has been preserved in el-Buseireh, a village
with ruins in Jebl (see Robinson, Pal. ii. p. 570), and must not be
confounded with Bossra in Hauran (Burckhardt, Syr. p. 364).

Ammon. - [Amo 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md). "Thus saith
Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, and for four, I
shall not reverse it, because they have ripped up the pregnant women of
Gilead, to widen their border, [Amo
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014.md). I kindle fire in the wall of
Rabbah, and it will devour its palaces, with the war-cry on the day of
slaughter, in the storm on the day of the tempest. [Amo
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md). And their king shall go into
captivity, he and his princes all at once, saith Jehovah." The occasion
on which the Ammonites were guilty of such cruelty towards the
Israelites as is here condemned, is not recorded in the historical books
of the Old Testament; possibly during the wars of Hazael with Israel,
when they availed themselves of the opportunity to widen their territory
by conquering back the land which had been wrested from them by Sihon
king of the Amorites, and was then taken possession of by the
Israelites, when he was overcome by them, - a thing which they had
attempted once before in the time of Jephthah the judge ([Jdg
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012)..md). We may see from [Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md). that they had taken possession
of the territory of the tribe of Gad, which lay nearest to them, though
probably not till after the carrying away of the tribes beyond Jordan by
the Assyrians ([Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md). The
ripping up of the women with child (see at [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012).md) is singled out as the climax of
the cruelties which the Ammonites inflicted upon the Israelites during
the war. As a punishment for this, their capital was to be burned, and
the king, with the princes, to wander into exile, and consequently their
kingdom was to be destroyed. Rabbâh, i.e., the great one, is the
abbreviated name of the capital; Rabbah of the children of Ammon, which
has been preserved in the ruins of Aurân (see at [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011).md). The threat is sharpened by the
clause בּתרוּעה וגו, at the war-cry on the field of battle, i.e., an
actual fact, when the enemy shall take the city by storm. בּסער וגו is a
figurative expression applied to the storming of a city carried by
assault, like בּסוּפה in [Num 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014.md).
The reading מלכּם, "their (the Ammonites') king," is confirmed by the
lxx and the Chaldee, and required by ושׂריו (cf. [Amo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#003).md), whereas Μαλχόμ, Melchom, which
is found in Aq., Symm., Jerome, and the Syriac, rests upon a false
interpretation.
