### [Zechariah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 7:1</span></span>

[Zac 7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md) describe the occasion for
this instructive and consolatory "word of God," which was addressed to
Zechariah in the fourth year of Darius, i.e., two years after the
building of the temple was resumed, and two years before its completion,
and therefore at a time when the building must have been far advanced,
and the temple itself was possibly already finished in the rough. [Zac
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md). "It came to pass in the fourth
year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, on the
fourth (day) of the ninth month, in Kislev." In this definition of the
time we are surprised first of all at the circumstance, that, according
to the Masoretic accentuation, and the division of the verses, the
statement of the time is torn into two halves, and the notice of the
year is placed after ויהי, whilst that of the month does not follow till
after התה דבר יי; and secondly, at the fact that the introduction of the
occurrence which led to this word of God is appended with the imperfect
c. Vav rel. (vayyishlach), which would then stand in the sense of the
pluperfect in opposition to the rule. On these grounds we must give up
the Masoretic division of the verses, and connect the notice of the
month and day in [Zac 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md) with [Zac
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002.md), so that [Zac
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md) contains merely the general
statement that in the fourth year of king Darius the word of the Lord
came to Zechariah. What follows will then be appended thus: On the
fourth day of the ninth month, in Kislev, Bethel sent, etc. Thus the
more precise definition of the time is only given in connection with the
following occurrence, because it was self-evident that the word of God
which was addressed to the prophet in consequence of that event, could
not have been addressed to him before it occurred. The rendering of the
words in [Zac 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002.md) is also a disputed
point. We adopt the following: [Zac
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002.md). "Then Bethel sent Sharezer and
Regem-melech, and his people, to entreat the face of Jehovah, ([Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003).md) to speak to the priests who were
at the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, thus: Shall I
weep, abstaining in the fifth month as I have now done so many years?"
As Bēth-ēl may either signify the house of God, or be the name of the
town of Bethel, it may be taken either as accus. loci, or as the subject
of the sentence. Against the first explanation, which is very widely
spread, viz., "it sent to the house of God, or to Bethel, Sharezer,"
etc., or "they sent to the house of God Sharezer," etc., it may be
argued not only that the prophet, in order to make himself intelligible,
ought either to have written 'el Bēth-'ēl, or to have placed Bēth-'ēl
after the object, but also that beeth-'eel cannot be shown to have been
ever applied to the temple of Jehovah, and that it would have been
altogether out of place to speak of sending to Bethel, because Jehovah
could not be prayed to in Bethel after the captivity. We must therefore
take bēth-'ēl as the subject, and understand it as denoting the
population of Bethel, and not as a name given to the church of the Lord,
since there are no conclusive passages to support any such use, as bēth
Yehōvâh only is used for the church of God (see at [Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001).md), and here there could be no
inducement to employ so unusual an epithet to denote the nation. A
considerable number of the earlier inhabitants of Bethel had already
returned with Zerubbabel, according to [Ezr
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#028.md) and [Neh
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#032.md); and, according to [Neh
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#031.md), the little town appears to have
been soon rebuilt. The inhabitants of this city sent an embassy to
Jerusalem, namely Sharezer and Rechem-Melech, and his men. The omission
of the nota accus. את has indeed been adduced as an objection to this
interpretation of the names as the object, and the names have been
therefore taken as the subject, and regarded as in apposition to
Bēth-ēl: "Bethel, namely Sharezer and Rechem, etc., sent;" that is to
say, two men are mentioned in connection with Bethel, who are supposed
to have acted as leaders of the embassy. But there is something so harsh
and inflexible in the assumption of such an apposition as this, that in
spite of the omission of the את we prefer to regard the names as
accusatives. The name Sharezer is evidently Assyrian (cf. [Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038.md); [Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md), [Jer
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013).md), so that the man was probably
born in Babylonia.

The object of sending these men is given first of all in general terms:
viz., להלּות את־פּני יי, lit., to stroke the face of Jehovah, - an
anthropomorphic expression for affectionate entreaty (see at [Psa
119:58](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#058).md), and then defined more
precisely in [Zac 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003.md), where it is
stated that they were to inquire of the priests and prophets, i.e.,
through their mediation, to entreat an answer from the Lord, whether the
mourning and fasting were to be still kept up in the fifth month.
Through the clause אשׁר לבית יי the priests are described as belonging
to the house of Jehovah, though not in the sense supposed by Kliefoth,
namely, "because they were appointed to serve in His house along with
the Levites, in the place of the first-born, who were the possession of
Jehovah" ([Num 3:41](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#041.md); [Deu
10:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008).md). There is no such allusion
here; but the meaning is simply, "as the persons in the temple, who by
virtue of their mediatorial service were able to obtain an answer from
Jehovah to a question addressed to Him in prayer." The connection with
the prophets points to this. The question האבכּה is defined by the inf.
absol. הנּזר, as consisting in weeping or lamentation connected with
abstinence from food and drink, i.e., with fasting. On this use of the
inf. abs., see Ewald, 280, a; הנּזר, to abstain (in this connection from
meat and drink), is synonymous with צוּם in [Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md). זה כּ מּה שׁנים: "these how many
years," for which we should say, "so many years." Kammeh suggests the
idea of an incalculably long duration. זה, in this and other similar
combinations with numerical data, has acquired the force of an adverb:
now, already (cf. [Zac 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md), and
Ewald, 302, b). The subject to אבכּה is the population of Bethel, by
which the men had been delegated. The question, however, had reference
to a subject in which the whole community was interested, and hence the
answer from God is addressed to all the people ([Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005).md). So far as the circumstances
themselves are concerned, we can see from [Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md) and [Zac
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019.md), that during the captivity the
Israelites had adopted the custom of commemorating the leading incidents
in the Chaldaean catastrophe by keeping fast-days in the fifth, seventh,
fourth, and tenth months. In the fifth month (Ab), on the tent day,
because, according to [Jer 52:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md),
that was the day on which the temple and the city of Jerusalem were
destroyed by fire in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, though the
seventh day of that month is the date given in [Kg2
25:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008) (see the comm. in loc..md). In the
seventh month, according to Jewish tradition, they fasted on the third
day, on account of the murder of the governor Gedaliah, and the Judaeans
who had been left in the land ([Kg2
25:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025.md); [Jer
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001).). In the fourth month Tammuz.md)
they fasted on the ninth day, on account of the conquest of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar in the eleventh year of Zedekiah ([Jer
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002.md); [Jer
52:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006).md). And lastly, in the tenth
month, a fast was kept on the tenth day on account of the commencement
of the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar on that day, in the ninth
year of Zedekiah ([Kg2 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md) and [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001).md).

(Note: The later Jews kept the 9th Ab as the day when both the first and
second temples were destroyed by fire; and in Mishna Taanit iv. 6, five
disasters are enumerated, which had fallen upon Israel on that day:
viz., (1) the determination of God not to suffer the fathers to enter
the promised land; (2 and 3) the destruction of the first and second
temples; (4) the conquest of the city of Bether in the time of
Bar-Cochba; (5) the destruction of the holy city, which Rashi explains
from [Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md) and [Jer
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018.md), but which others refer to the
fact that Turnus Rufus (either Turannius Rufus or T. Annius Rufus: cf.
Schttgen, Horae hebr. et talm. ii. 953ff., and Jost, Gesch. des
Judenthums, ii. 77) ploughed over the foundation of the temple. Also, on
the seventeenth of the fourth month (Tammuz), according to Mishna Taan.
iv. 6, five disasters are said to have befallen Israel: (1) the breaking
of the tables of the law (Exodus 32); (2) the cessation of the daily
sacrifice in the first temple from the want of sacrificial lambs (cf.
[Jer 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006)); (3.md) the breach made in the
city walls; (4) the burning of the law by Apostemus; and (5) the setting
up of the abomination, i.e., of an idol, in the temple ([Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md); [Dan
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013).md). Vid., Lundius, Codex talm. de
jejunio, Traf. ad Rhen. 1694, p. 55ff.; also in abstract in Mishna ed.
Surenhus. ii. pp. 382-3.)

The question put by the delegates referred simply to the fasting in the
fifth month, in commemoration of the destruction of the temple. And now
that the rebuilding of the temple was rapidly approaching completion, it
appeared no longer in character to continue to keep this day, especially
as the prophets had proclaimed on the part of God, that the restoration
of the temple would be a sign that Jehovah had once more restored His
favour to the remnant of His people. If this fast-day were given up, the
others would probably be also relinquished. The question actually
involved the prayer that the Lord would continue permanently to bestow
upon His people the favour which He had restored to them, and not only
bring to completion the restoration of the holy place, which was already
begun, but accomplish generally the glorification of Israel predicted by
the earlier prophets. The answer given by the Lord through Zechariah to
the people refers to this, since the priests and prophets could give no
information in the matter of their own accord.

The answer from the Lord divides itself into two parts, [Zac
7:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#004.md) and ch. 8. In the first part He
explains what it is that He requires of the people, and why He has been
obliged to punish them with exile: in the second He promises them the
restoration of His favour and the promised salvation. Each of these
parts is divisible again into two sections, [Zac
7:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#004.md) and [Zac
7:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#008.md); Zechariah 8:1-17 and [Zac
8:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#018.md); and each of these sections
opens with the formula, "The word of Jehovah (of hosts) came to me
(Zechariah), saying."

[Zechariah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 7:4</span></span>

The first of these four words of God contains an exposure of what might
be unwarrantable in the question and its motives, and open to
disapproval. [Zac 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#004.md). "And the word
of Jehovah of hosts came to me thus, [Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md). Speak to all the people of the
land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the
fifth and in the seventh (month), and that for seventy years, did ye,
when fasting, fast to me? [Zac 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#006.md).
And when ye eat, and when ye drink, is it not ye who eat, and ye who
drink? [Zac 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007.md). Does it not concern
the words, which Jehovah has preached through the former prophets, when
Jerusalem was inhabited and satisfied, and her towns round about her,
and the south country and the low land were inhabited?" The thought of
[Zac 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#006.md) and [Zac
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007.md) is the following: It is a matter
of indifference to God whether the people fast or not. The true fasting,
which is well pleasing to God, consists not in a pharisaical abstinence
from eating and drinking, but in the fact that men observe the word of
God and live thereby, as the prophets before the captivity had already
preached to the people. This overthrew the notion that men could acquire
the favour of God by fasting, and left it to the people to decide
whether they would any longer observe the previous fast-days; it also
showed what God would require of them if they wished to obtain the
promised blessings. For the inf. absol. see at [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md). The fasting in the seventh month
was not the fast on the day of atonement which was prescribed in the law
(Leviticus 23), but, as has been already observed, the fast in
commemoration of the murder of Gedaliah. In the form צמתּני the suffix
is not a substitute for the dative (Ges. 121, 4), but is to be taken as
an accusative, expressive of the fact that the fasting related to God
(Ewald, 315, b). The suffix is strengthened by אני for the sake of
emphasis (Ges. 121, 3). In [Zac 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007.md)
the form of the sentence is elliptical. The verb is omitted in the
clause הלוא את־הדּברים, but not the subject, say זה, which many
commentators supply, after the lxx, the Peshito, and the Vulgate ("Are
these not the words which Jehovah announced?"), in which case את would
have to be taken as nota nominativi. The sentence contains an
aposiopesis, and is to be completed by supplying a verb, either "should
ye not do or give heed to the words which," etc.? or "do ye not know the
words?" ישׁבת, as in [Zac 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011.md), in the
sense of sitting or dwelling; not in a passive sense, "to be inhabited,"
although it might be so expressed. שׁלוה is synonymous with שׁקטת in
[Zac 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011.md). ישׁב, in the sense
indicated at the close of the verse, is construed in the singular
masculine, although it refers to a plurality of previous nouns (cf. Ges.
148, 2). In addition to Jerusalem, the following are mentioned as a
periphrasis for the land of Judah: (1) her towns round about; these are
the towns belonging to Jerusalem as the capital, towns of the mountains
of Judah which were more or less dependent upon her: (2) the two rural
districts, which also belonged to the kingdom of Judah, viz., the negeb,
the south country (which Koehler erroneously identifies with the
mountains of Judah; compare [Jos 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md)
with [Jos 15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048).md), and the shephēlâh,
or lowland along the coast of the Mediterranean (see at [Jos
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).md).

[Zechariah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 7:8</span></span>

The second word of the Lord recals to the recollection of the people the
disobedience of the fathers, and its consequences, viz., the judgment of
exile, as a warning example. The introduction of the prophet's name in
the heading in [Zac 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#008.md) does not
warrant the strange opinion held by Schmieder and Schlier - namely, that
our prophet is here reproducing the words of an earlier Zechariah who
lived before the captivity - but is merely to be attributed to a
variation in the form of expression. This divine word was as follows:
[Zac 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009.md). "Thus hath Jehovah of hosts
spoken, saying, Execute judgment of truth, and show love and compassion
one to another. [Zac 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#010.md). And widows
and orphans, strangers and destitute ones, oppress not; and meditate not
in your heart the injury of every brother. [Zac
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011.md). But they refused to attend, and
offered a rebellious shoulder, and hardened their ears that they might
not hear. [Zac 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012.md). And they made
their heart diamond, that they might not hear the law and the words
which Jehovah of hosts sent through His Spirit by means of the former
prophet, so that great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts." כּה אמר is to
be taken as a preterite here, referring to what Jehovah had caused to be
proclaimed to the people before the captivity. The kernel of this
announcement consisted in the appeal to the people, to keep the moral
precepts of the law, to practise the true love of the neighbour in
public life and private intercourse. Mishpat 'ĕmeth, judgment of truth
(cf. [Eze 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008).md), is such an
administration of justice as simply fixes the eye upon the real
circumstances of any dispute, without any personal considerations
whatever, and decides them in accordance with truth. For the fact
itself, compare [Exo 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020.md), [Exo
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021.md); [Exo
23:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006.md); [Lev
19:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015.md); [Deu
10:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018.md); [Deu
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014.md); [Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017.md); [Jer
7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#005.md); [Jer
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003.md); [Eze
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008.md); [Hos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md), etc. רעת אישׁ אחיו, the injury
of a man who is his brother (as in [Gen
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005).md); not "injury one towards
another," which would suppose a transposition of the אישׁ = אישׁ רעת
אחיו. In [Zac 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011.md), [Zac
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012.md) the attitude of the people
towards these admonitions of God is described. Nâthan kâthēph sōrereth:
to give or offer a rebellious shoulder, as in [Neh
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029.md). The figure is borrowed from an
ox, which will not allow a yoke to be placed upon its neck (cf. [Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016).md). To make the ears heavy
(hikhbı̄d), away from hearing, i.e., so that they do not hear (cf. [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010).md). To make the heart diamond
(shâmı̄r), i.e., as hard as diamond. A stony heart is a heart not
susceptible to impressions (cf. [Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019).md). The relative אשׁר before
shâlach refers to the two nouns named before, viz., tōrâh and debhârı̄m,
though we need not on that account take tōrâh in the general sense of
instruction. God also sent the law to the people through the prophets,
i.e., caused them to preach it and impress it upon their hearts. The
consequence of this obduracy of the people was, that "there arose great
wrath from Jehovah" (cf. [Zac 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#002.md);
[Kg2 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027).md).

[Zechariah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 7:13</span></span>

This wrath is described in [Zac 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#013.md),
[Zac 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md). [Zac
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#013.md). "It came to pass: as he cried
and they did not hear, so will they cry and I shall not hear, said
Jehovah of hosts. [Zac 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md). And I
will scatter them with a whirlwind over all nations, who did not know
them, and the land is laid waste behind them, so that no one passes to
and fro. And thus they made the choice land a desert." The form of the
address changes in [Zac 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#013.md). Whereas
in the protasis the prophet is still speaking of Jehovah in the third
person, in the apodosis he introduces Jehovah as speaking (so will they
cry, and I, etc.) and announcing the punishment, which He will inflict
upon the rebellious and has already inflicted in their captivity. This
address of God is continued in [Zac
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md) as far as וּמשּׁב. The opinion,
that the address terminates with לא ידעוּם, and that והארץ commences the
account of the accomplishment of the purpose to punish, is not so much
at variance with the circumstance, that in that case the last two
clauses of [Zac 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md) would say
essentially the same thing, as with the fact that והארץ וגו cannot, from
its very form, be taken as an account of the accomplishment of the
divine purpose. The perfect nâshammâh in this clause does not preclude
our connecting it with the preceding one, but is used to set forth the
devastation as a completed fact: the land will be (not become) waste.
The infliction of the punishment is expressed in [Zac
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#013.md) in the form of a divine talio. As
they have not hearkened to the word of God, so will God, when they call
upon Him, namely in distress (cf. [Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015).md), also not hear (cf. [Jer
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011).md), but whirl them like a tempest
over the nations. The form אסערם is the first pers. imperf. piel for
אסערם or אסערם, and Aramaic (cf. Ges. 52, 2, Anm. 2). On the nations
whom they do not know, and who will therefore have no pity and
compassion upon them, compare [Jer
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028.md); [Jer
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013.md). מעבר וּמשּׁב (cf. [Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008).md), that not one goes to and fro in
the desolate land; lit., goes away from a place and returns again (cf.
[Exo 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027).md). In the clause ויּשׂימוּ
וגו the result of the stiff-necked obstinacy of the fathers is briefly
stated: They have made the choice land a desert ('erets chemdâh, as in
[Jer 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019.md) and [Psa
106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024).md), so that they have brought
upon the land all the calamity which is now bewailed upon the fast-days.
