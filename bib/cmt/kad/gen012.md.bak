### [Genesis Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 12:1</span></span>

The life of Abraham, from his call to his death, consists of four
stages, the commencement of each of which is marked by a divine
revelation of sufficient importance to constitute a distinct epoch. The
first stage (Gen 12-14) commences with his call and removal to Canaan;
the second (Gen 15-16), with the promise of a lineal heir and the
conclusion of a covenant; the third (Gen 17-21), with the establishment
of the covenant, accompanied by a change in his name, and the
appointment of the covenant sign of circumcision; the fourth (Gen
22-25:11), with the temptation of Abraham to attest and perfect his life
of faith. All the revelations made to him proceed from Jehovah; and the
name Jehovah is employed throughout the whole life of the father of the
faithful, Elohim being used only where Jehovah, from its meaning, would
be either entirely inapplicable, or at any rate less appropriate.

(Note: The hypothesis, that the history is compounded of Jehovistic and
Elohistic documents, can only be maintained by those who misunderstand
that distinctive meaning of these two names, and arbitrarily set aside
the Jehovah in [Gen 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md), on account
of an erroneous determination of the relation in which שׁדּי אל stands
to יהוה.)

[Gen 12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

The Call. - The word of Jehovah, by which Abram was called, contained a
command and a promise. Abram was to leave all - his country, his kindred
(see [Gen 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#007).md), and his father's
house - and to follow the Lord into the land which He would show him.
Thus he was to trust entirely to the guidance of God, and to follow
wherever He might lead him. But as he went in consequence of this divine
summons into the land of Canaan ([Gen
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005).md), we must assume that God gave
him at the very first a distinct intimation, if not of the land itself,
at least of the direction he was to take. That Canaan was to be his
destination, was no doubt made known as a matter of certainty in the
revelation which he received after his arrival there ([Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007).md). - For thus renouncing and
denying all natural ties, the Lord gave him the inconceivably great
promise, "I will make of thee a great nation; and I will bless thee, and
make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing." The four members of
this promise are not to be divided into two parallel members, in which
case the athnach would stand in the wrong place; but are to be regarded
as an ascending climax, expressing four elements of the salvation
promised to Abram, the last of which is still further expanded in [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md). By placing the athnach under
שׁמך the fourth member is marked as a new and independent feature added
to the other three. The four distinct elements are - 1. increase into a
numerous people; 2. a blessing, that is to say, material and spiritual
prosperity; 3. the exaltation of his name, i.e., the elevation of Abram
to honour and glory; 4. his appointment to be the possessor and
dispenser of the blessing. Abram was not only to receive blessing, but
to be a blessing; not only to be blessed by God, but to become a
blessing, or the medium of blessing, to others. The blessing, as the
more minute definition of the expression "be a blessing" in [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md) clearly shows, was henceforth to
keep pace as it were with Abram himself, so that (1) the blessing and
cursing of men were to depend entirely upon their attitude towards him,
and (2) all the families of the earth were to be blessed in him. קלּל,
lit., to treat as light or little, to despise, denotes "blasphemous
cursing on the part of a man;" ארר "judicial cursing on the part of
God." It appears significant, however, "that the plural is used in
relation to the blessing, and the singular only in relation to the
cursing; grace expects that there will be many to bless, and that only
an individual here and there will render not blessing for blessing, but
curse for curse." - In [Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md) b,
Abram, the one, is made a blessing for all. In the word בּך the primary
meaning of ב, in, is not to be given up, though the instrumental sense,
through, is not to be excluded. Abram was not merely to become a
mediator, but the source of blessing for all. The expression "all the
families of the ground" points to the division of the one family into
many ([Gen 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005.md), [Gen
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#020.md), [Gen
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#031).md), and the word האדמה to the
curse pronounced upon the ground ([Gen
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017).md). The blessing of Abraham was
once more to unite the divided families, and change the curse,
pronounced upon the ground on account of sin, into a blessing for the
whole human race. This concluding word comprehends all nations and
times, and condenses, as Baumgarten has said, the whole fulness of the
divine counsel for the salvation of men into the call of Abram. All
further promises, therefore, not only to the patriarchs, but also to
Israel, were merely expansions and closer definitions of the salvation
held out to the whole human race in the first promise. Even the
assurance, which Abram received after his entrance into Canaan ([Gen
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006).md), was implicitly contained in
this first promise; since a great nation could not be conceived of,
without a country of its own.

This promise was renewed to Abram on several occasions: first after his
separation from Lot ([Gen 13:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#014).md),
on which occasion, however, the "blessing" was not mentioned, because
not required by the connection, and the two elements only, viz., the
numerous increase of his seed, and the possession of the land of Canaan,
were assured to him and to his seed, and that "for ever;" secondly, in
[Gen 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#018.md) somewhat more casually, as
a reason for the confidential manner in which Jehovah explained to him
the secret of His government; and lastly, at the two principal turning
points of his life, where the whole promise was confirmed with the
greatest solemnity, viz., in Gen 17 at the commencement of the
establishment of the covenant made with him, where "I will make of thee
a great nation" was heightened into "I will make nations of thee, and
kings shall come out of thee," and his being a blessing was more fully
defined as the establishment of a covenant, inasmuch as Jehovah would be
God to him and to his posterity ([Gen
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#003)..md), and in Gen 22 after the
attestation of his faith and obedience, even to the sacrifice of his
only son, where the innumerable increase of his seed and the blessing to
pass from him to all nations were guaranteed by an oath. The same
promise was afterwards renewed to Isaac, with a distinct allusion to the
oath ([Gen 26:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#003).md), and again to
Jacob, both on his flight from Canaan for fear of Esau ([Gen
28:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013).md), and on his return thither
([Gen 35:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#011).md). In the case of these
renewals, it is only in [Gen 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014.md)
that the last expression, "all the families of the Adamah," is repeated
verbatim, though with the additional clause "and in thy seed;" in the
other passages "all the nations of the earth" are mentioned, the family
connection being left out of sight, and the national character of the
blessing being brought into especial prominence. In two instances also,
instead of the Niphal נרכוּ we find the Hithpael התבּרכוּ. This change
of conjugation by no means proves that the Niphal is to be taken in its
original reflective sense. The Hithpael has no doubt the meaning "to
wish one's self blessed" ([Deu 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#019).md),
with ב of the person from whom the blessing is sought ([Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016.md); [Jer
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002).md), or whose blessing is desired
([Gen 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020).md). But the Niphal נברך has
only the passive signification "to be blessed." And the promise not only
meant that all families of the earth would wish for the blessing which
Abram possessed, but that they would really receive this blessing in
Abram and his seed. By the explanation "wish themselves blessed" the
point of the promise is broken off; and not only is its connection with
the prophecy of Noah respecting Japhet's dwelling in the tents of Shem
overlooked, and the parallel between the blessing on all the families of
the earth, and the curse pronounced upon the earth after the flood,
destroyed, but the actual participation of all the nations of the earth
in this blessing is rendered doubtful, and the application of this
promise by Peter ([Act 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025).md) and Paul
([Gal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008).md) to all nations, is left
without any firm scriptural basis. At the same time, we must not
attribute a passive signification on that account to the Hithpael in
[Gen 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md) and [Gen
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#004.md). In these passages prominence is
given to the subjective attitude of the nations towards the blessing of
Abraham-in other words, to the fact that the nations would desire the
blessing promised to them in Abraham and his seed.

[Genesis 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 12:4</span></span>

Removal to Canaan. - Abram cheerfully followed the call of the Lord, and
"departed as the Lord had spoken to him." He was then 75 years old. His
age is given, because a new period in the history of mankind commenced
with his exodus. After this brief notice there follows a more
circumstantial account, in [Gen 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005.md),
of the fact that he left Haran with his wife, with Lot, and with all
that they possessed of servants and cattle, whereas Terah remained in
Haran (cf. [Gen 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031).md). עשׂוּ אשׁר
הנּפשׁ are not the souls which they had begotten, but the male and
female slaves that Abram and Lot had acquired.

[Genesis 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 12:6</span></span>

On his arrival in Canaan, "Abram passed through the land to the place of
Sichem:" i.e., the place where Sichem, the present Nablus, afterwards
stood, between Ebal and Gerizim, in the heart of the land. "To the
terebinth (or, according to [Deu
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#030), the terebinths.md) of Moreh:" אלון
איל ([Gen 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006).md) and אילה are the
terebinth, אלּון and אלּה the oak; though in many MSS and editions אלּון
and אלון are interchanged in [Jos
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033.md) and [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md), either because the pointing in
one of these passages is inaccurate, or because the word itself was
uncertain, as the ever-green oaks and terebinths resemble one another in
the colour of their foliage and their fissured bark of sombre grey. -
The notice that "the Canaanites were then in the land" does not point to
a post-Mosaic date, when the Canaanites were extinct. For it does not
mean that the Canaanites were then still in the land, but refers to the
promise which follows, that God would give this land to the seed of
Abram ([Gen 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007).md), and merely states
that the land into which Abram had come was not uninhabited and without
a possessor; so that Abram could not regard it at once as his own and
proceed to take possession of it, but could only wander in it in faith
as in a foreign land ([Heb 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009).md).

[Genesis 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 12:7</span></span>

Here in Sichem Jehovah appeared to him, and assured him of the
possession of the land of Canaan for his descendants. The assurance was
made by means of an appearance of Jehovah, as a sign that this land was
henceforth to be the scene of the manifestation of Jehovah. Abram
understood this, "and there builded he an altar to Jehovah, who appeared
to him," to make the soil which was hallowed by the appearance of God a
place for the worship of the God who appeared to him.

[Genesis 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 12:8</span></span>

He did this also in the mountains, to which he probably removed to
secure the necessary pasture for his flocks, after he had pitched his
tent there. "Bethel westwards and Ai eastwards," i.e., in a spot with Ai
to the east and Bethel to the west. The name Bethel occurs here
proleptically: at the time referred to, it was still called Luz ([Gen
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019).md); its present name if Beitin
(Robinson's Palestine). At a distance of about five miles to the east
was Ai, ruins of which are still to be seen, bearing the name of Medinet
Gai (Ritter's Erdkunde). On the words "called upon the name of the
Lord," see [Gen 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026.md). From this point
Abram proceeded slowly to the Negeb, i.e., to the southern district of
Canaan towards the Arabian desert (vid., [Gen
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001).md).

[Genesis 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 12:10</span></span>

Abram in Egypt. - Abram had scarcely passed through the land promised to
his seed, when a famine compelled him to leave it, and take refuge in
Egypt, which abounded in corn; just as the Bedouins in the neighbourhood
are accustomed to do now. Whilst the famine in Canaan was to teach
Abram, that even in the promised land food and clothing come from the
Lord and His blessing, he was to discover in Egypt that earthly craft is
soon put to shame when dealing with the possessor of the power of this
world, and that help and deliverance are to be found with the Lord
alone, who can so smite the mightiest kings, that they cannot touch His
chosen or do them harm ([Psa
105:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014).md). - When trembling for his
life in Egypt on account of the beauty of Sarai his wife, he arranged
with her, as he approached that land, that she should give herself out
as his sister, since she really was his half-sister ([Gen
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#029).md). He had already made an
arrangement with her, that she should do this in certain possible
contingencies, when they first removed to Canaan ([Gen
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#013).md). The conduct of the Sodomites
(Gen 19) was a proof that he had reason for his anxiety; and it was not
without cause even so far as Egypt was concerned. But his precaution did
not spring from faith. He might possibly hope, that by means of the plan
concerted, he should escape the danger of being put to death on account
of his wife, if any one should wish to take her; but how he expected to
save the honour and retain possession of his wife, we cannot understand,
though we must assume, that he thought he should be able to protect and
keep her as his sister more easily, than if he acknowledged her as his
wife. But the very thing he feared and hoped to avoid actually occurred.

[Genesis 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 12:15</span></span>

The princes of Pharaoh finding her very beautiful, extolled her beauty
to the king, and she was taken to Pharaoh's house. As Sarah was then 65
years old (cf. [Gen 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md) and [Gen
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004).md), her beauty at such an age has
been made a difficulty by some. But as she lived to the age of 127 ([Gen
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001).md), she was then middle-aged; and
as her vigour and bloom had not been tried by bearing children, she
might easily appear very beautiful in the eyes of the Egyptians, whose
wives, according to both ancient and modern testimony, were generally
ugly, and faded early. Pharaoh (the Egyptian ouro, king, with the
article Pi) is the Hebrew name for all the Egyptian kings in the Old
Testament; their proper names being only occasionally mentioned, as, for
example, Necho in [Kg2 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md), or
Hophra in [Jer 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md). For Sarai's sake
Pharaoh treated Abram well, presenting him with cattle and slaves,
possessions which constitute the wealth of nomads. These presents Abram
could not refuse, though by accepting them he increased his sin. God
then interfered ([Gen 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017).md), and
smote Pharaoh and his house with great plagues. What the nature of these
plagues was, cannot be determined; they were certainly of such a kind,
however, that whilst Sarah was preserved by them from dishonour, Pharaoh
saw at once that they were sent as punishment by the Deity on account of
his relation to Sarai; he may also have learned, on inquiry from Sarai
herself, that she was Abram's wife. He gave her back to him, therefore,
with a reproof for his untruthfulness, and told him to depart,
appointing men to conduct him out of the land together with his wife and
all his possessions. שׁלּה, to dismiss, to give an escort ([Gen
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016.md); [Gen
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#027).md), does not necessarily denote an
involuntary dismissal here. For as Pharaoh had discovered in the plague
the wrath of the God of Abraham, he did not venture to treat him
harshly, but rather sought to mitigate the anger of his God, by the
safe-conduct which he granted him on his departure. But Abram was not
justified by this result, as was very apparent from the fact, that he
was mute under Pharaoh's reproofs, and did not venture to utter a single
word in vindication of his conduct, as he did in the similar
circumstances described in [Gen
10:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#011.md). The saving mercy of God had
so humbled him, that he silently acknowledged his guilt in concealing
his relation to Sarah from the Egyptian king.
