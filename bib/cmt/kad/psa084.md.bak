### [Psalms Chapter 84](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 84:0</span></span>

Longing for the House of God, and for the Happiness of Dwelling There

With Ps 83 the circle of the Asaphic songs is closed (twelve Psalms,
viz., one in the Second Book and eleven in the Third), and with [Psa
84:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md) begins the other half of the
Korahitic circle of songs, opened by the last of the Korahitic
Elohim-Psalms. True, Hengstenberg (transl. vol. iii. Appendix. p. xlv)
says that no one would, with my Symbolae, p. 22, regard this [Psa
84:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md) as an Elohimic Psalm; but the
marks of the Elohimic style are obvious. Not only that the poet uses
Elohim twice, and that in [Psa 84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md),
where a non-Elohimic Psalm ought to have said Jahve; it also delights in
compound names of God, which are so heaped up that Jahve Tsebaoth occurs
three times, and the specifically Elohimic Jahve Elohim Tsebaoth once.
The origin of this Psalm has been treated of already in connection with
its counterpart, [Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md). It is a
thoroughly heartfelt and intelligent expression of the love to the
sanctuary of Jahve which years towards it out of the distance, and calls
all those happy who have the like good fortune to have their home there.
The prayer takes the form of an intercession for God's anointed; for the
poet is among the followers of David, the banished one.

(Note: Nic. Nonnen takes a different view in his Dissertatio de Tzippor
et Deror, etc., 1741. He considers one of the Ephraimites who were
brought back to the fellowship of the true worship of God in the reign
of Jehoshaphat ([Ch2 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#004).md) to be the
subject of the Psalm.)

He does not pray, as it were, out of his soul (Hengstenberg, Tholuck,
von Gerlach), but for him; for loving Jahve of Hosts, the heavenly King,
he also loves His inviolably chosen one. And wherefore should he not do
so, since with him a new era for the neglected sanctuary had dawned, and
the delightful services of the Lord had taken a new start, and one so
rich in song? With him he shares both joy and brief. With his future he
indissolubly unites his own.

To the Precentor upon the Gittith, the inscription runs, by Ben-Korah, a
Psalm. Concerning על־הגּתּית, vid., on [Psa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001.md). The structure of the Psalm is
artistic. It consists of two halves with a distichic ashr-conclusion.
The schema is 3. 5. 2 5. 5. 5. 3. 2.

[Psalms 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 84:1</span></span>

How loved and lovely (ידידות) is the sacred dwelling-place (plur. as in
[Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003).md) of the all-commanding,
redemptive God, viz., His dwelling-place here below upon Zion! Thither
the poet is drawn by the deeply inward yearning of love, which makes him
pale (נכסף from כּסף, to grow pale, [Psa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012).md) and consumes him (כּלה as in
[Job 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#027).md). His heart and flesh
joyfully salute the living God dwelling there, who, as a never-failing
spring, quenches the thirst of the soul ([Psa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003).md); the joy that he feels when he
throws himself back in spirit into the long-denied delight takes
possession even of his bodily nature, the bitter-sweet pain of longing
completely fills him ([Psa 63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002).md). The
mention of the "courts" (with the exception of the Davidic [Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005.md), occurring only in the anonymous
Psalms) does not preclude the reference of the Psalm to the tent-temple
on Zion. The Tabernacle certainly had only one חצר; the arrangement of
the Davidic tent-temple, however, is indeed unknown to us, and,
according to reliable traces,

(Note: Vid., Knobel on Exodus, S. 253-257, especially S. 255.)

it may be well assumed that it was more gorgeous and more spacious than
the old Tabernacle which remained in Gibeon. In [Psa
84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md) the preference must be given to
that explanation which makes את־מזבּחותיך dependent upon מצאה, without
being obliged to supply an intermediate thought like בּית (with
hardening Dagesh like בּן, [Gen 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#038.md),
vid., the rule at [Psa 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005).md) and קן as
a more definite statement of the object which the poet has in view. The
altars, therefore, or (what this is meant to say without any need for
taking את as a preposition) the realm, province of the altars of Jahve -
this is the house, this the nest which sparrow and swallow have found
for themselves and their young. The poet thereby only indirectly says,
that birds have built themselves nests on the Temple-house, without
giving any occasion for the discussion whether this has taken place in
reality. By the bird that has found a comfortable snug home on the place
of the altars of Jahve in the Temple-court and in the Temple-house, he
means himself. צפּור (from צפר) is a general name for whistling,
twittering birds, like the finch

(Note: Vid., Tobler, Denkbltter aus Jerusalem, 1853, S. 117.)

and the sparrow, just as the lxx here renders it. דּרור is not the
turtle-dove (lxx, Targum, and Syriac), but the swallow, which is
frequently called even in the Talmud צפור דרור (= סנוּנית), and appears
to take its name from its straightforward darting, as it were, radiating
flight (cf. Arabic jadurru of the horse: it darts straight forward).
Saadia renders dûrı̂je, which is the name of the sparrow in Palestine and
Syria (vid., Wetzstein's Excursus I). After the poet has said that his
whole longing goes forth towards the sanctuary, he adds that it could
not possibly be otherwise (גּם standing at the head of the clause and
belonging to the whole sentence, as e.g., in [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033); Ewald, 352, b.md): he, the
sparrow, the swallow, has found a house, a nest, viz., the altars of
Jahve of Hosts, his King and his God ([Psa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005.md); [Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007).md), who gloriously and inaccessibly
protects him, and to whom he unites himself with most heartfelt and
believing love. The addition "where (אשׁר as in [Psa
95:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#009.md); [Num
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013).md) she layeth her young," is not
without its significance. One is here reminded of the fact, that at the
time of the second Temple the sons of the priests were called פּרחי
כהנּה, and the Levite poet means himself together with his family; God's
altars secure to them shelter and sustenance. How happy, blessed,
therefore, are those who enjoy this good fortune, which he now longs for
again with pain in a strange country, viz., to be able to make his home
in the house of such an adorable and gracious God! עוד here signifies,
not "constantly" ([Gen 46:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#029).md), for
which תּמיד would have been used, but "yet," as in [Psa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md). The relation of [Psa
84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md) to [Psa
84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md) is therefore like [Psa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md). The present is dark, but it will
come to pass even yet that the inmates of God's house (οἰκεῖοι τοῦ Θεοῦ,
[Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010).md) will praise Him as their
Helper. The music here strikes in, anticipating this praise.

[Psalms 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 84:5</span></span>

This second half takes up the "blessed" of the distichic epode
(epoodo's) of the first, and consequently joins member to member
chain-like on to it. Many hindrances must be cleared away if the poet is
to get back to Zion, his true home; but his longing carries the surety
within itself of its fulfilment: blessed, yea in himself blessed, is the
man, who has his strength (עוז only here plene) in God, so that,
consequently, the strength of Him to whom all things are possible is
mighty in his weakness. What is said in [Psa
84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md) is less adapted to be the object
of the being called blessed than the result of that blessed relationship
to God. What follows shows that the "high-roads" are not to be
understood according to [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md)., or
any other passage, as an ethical, notional figure (Venema, Hengstenberg,
Hitzig, and others), but according to [Isa
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008.md) (cf. [Jer
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021).md), with Aben-Ezra, Vatablus, and
the majority of expositors, of the roads leading towards Zion; not,
however, as referring to the return from the Exile, but to the going up
to a festival: the pilgrim-high-roads with their separate halting-places
(stations) were constantly present to the mind of such persons. And
though they may be driven never so far away from them, they will
nevertheless reach the goal of their longing. The most gloomy present
becomes bright to them: passing through even a terrible wilderness, they
turn it (ישׁיתהו) into a place of springs, their joyous hope and the
infinite beauty of the goal, which is worth any amount of toil and
trouble, afford them enlivening comfort, refreshing strengthening in the
midst of the arid steppe. עמק הבּכא does not signify the "Valley of
weeping," as Hupfeld at last renders it (lxx κοιλάδα τοῦ κλαυθμῶνος),
although Burckhardt found a \[Arab.\] wâdı̂ 'l-bk' (Valley of weeping) in
the neighbourhood of Sinai. In Hebrew "weeping" is בּכי, בּכה, בּכוּת,
not בּכא, Rnan, in the fourth chapter of his Vie de Jsus, understands
the expression to mean the last station of those who journey from
northern Palestine on this side of the Jordan towards Jerusalem, viz.,
Ain el-Haramı̂je, in a narrow and gloomy valley where a black stream of
water flows out of the rocks in which graves are dug, so that
consequently עמק הככא signifies Valley of tears or of trickling waters.
But such trickling out of the rock is also called בּכי, [Job
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011.md), and not בּכא. This latter is
the singular to בּכאים in [Sa2 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#024.md)
(cf. נכאים, צבאים, [Psa 103:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#021).md), the
name of a tree, and, according to the old Jewish lexicographers, of the
mulberry-tree (Talmudic תּוּת, Arab. tût); but according to the
designation, of a tree from which some kind of fluid flows, and such a
tree is the Arab. baka'un, resembling the balsam-tree, which is very
common in the arid valley of Mecca, and therefore might also have given
its name to some arid valley of the Holy Land (vid., Winer's
Realwrterbuch, s.v. Bacha), and, according to [Sa2
5:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022.md), to one belonging, as it would
appear, to the line of valley which leads from the coasts of the
Philistines to Jerusalem. What is spoken of in passages like [Isa
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#007.md); [Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018.md), as being wrought by the
omnipotence of God, who brings His people home to Zion, appears here as
the result of the power of faith in those who, keeping the same end of
their journeyings in view, pass through the unfruitful sterile valley.
That other side, however, also does not remain unexpressed. Not only
does their faith bring forth water out of the sand and rock of the
desert, but God also on His part lovingly anticipates their love, and
rewardingly anticipates their faithfulness: a gentle rain, like that
which refreshes the sown fields in the autumn, descends from above and
enwraps it (viz., the Valley of Baca) in a fulness of blessing (יעטּה,
Hiphil with two accusatives, of which one is to be supplied: cf. on the
figure, Ps 65:14). The arid steppe becomes resplendent with a flowery
festive garment ([Isa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001)..md), not to
outward appearance, but to them spiritually, in a manner none the less
true and real. And whereas under ordinary circumstances the strength of
the traveller diminishes in proportion as he has traversed more and more
of his toilsome road, with them it is the very reverse; they go from
strength to strength (cf. on the expression, [Jer
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002.md); [Jer
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#002).md), i.e., they receive strength for
strength (cf. on the subject-matter, [Isa
40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031.md); [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016).md), and that an ever increasing
strength, the nearer they come to the desired goal, which also they
cannot fail to reach. The pilgrim-band (this is the subject to יראה),
going on from strength to (אל) strength, at last reaches, attains to (אל
instead of the אל־פּני used in other instances) Elohim in Zion. Having
reached this final goal, the pilgrim-band pours forth its heart in the
language of prayer such as we have in [Psa
84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009.md), and the music here strikes up
and blends its sympathetic tones with this converse of the church with
its God.

The poet, however, who in spirit accompanies them on their pilgrimage,
is now all the more painfully conscious of being at the present time far
removed from this goal, and in the next strophe prays for relief. He
calls God מגנּנוּ (as in [Psa 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012).md),
for without His protection David's cause is lost. May He then behold
(ראה, used just as absolutely as in [Ch2
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#022.md), cf. [Lam
3:50](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#050).md), and look upon the face of His
anointed, which looks up to Him out of the depth of its reproach. The
position of the words shows that מגנּנוּ is not to be regarded as the
object to ראה, according to [Psa 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md)
(cf. Ps 47:10) and in opposition to the accentuation, for why should it
not then have been אלהים ראה מגננו? The confirmation ([Psa
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011).md) puts the fact that we have
before us a Psalm belonging to the time of David's persecution by
Absalom beyond all doubt. Manifestly, when his king prevails, the poet
will at the same time (cf. David's language, [Sa2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#025).md) be restored to the sanctuary. A
single day of his life in the courts of God is accounted by him as
better than a thousand other days (מאלף with Olewejored and preceded by
Rebia parvum). He would rather lie down on the threshold (concerning the
significance of this הסתּופף in the mouth of a Korahite, vid., supra, p.
311) in the house of his God than dwell within in the tents of
ungodliness (not "palaces," as one might have expected, if the house of
God had at that time been a palace). For how worthless is the pleasure
and concealment to be had there, when compared with the salvation and
protection which Jahve Elohim affords to His saints! This is the only
instance in which God is directly called a sun (שׁמשׁ) in the sacred
writings (cf. Sir. 42:16). He is called a shield as protecting those who
flee to Him and rendering them inaccessible to their foes, and a sun as
the Being who dwells in an unapproachable light, which, going forth from
Him in love towards men, is particularized as חן and כבוד, as the gentle
and overpowering light of the grace and glory (χάρις and δόξα) of the
Father of Lights. The highest good is self-communicative (communicativum
sui). The God of salvation does not refuse any good thing to those who
walk בּתמים (בּדרך תמים, [Psa 101:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#006.md);
cf. on [Psa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002).md). Upon all receptive
ones, i.e., all those who are desirous and capable of receiving His
blessings, He freely bestows them out of the abundance of His good
things. Strophe and anti-strophe are doubled in this second half of the
song. The epode closely resembles that which follows the first half. And
this closing ashrê is not followed by any Sela. The music is hushed. The
song dies away with an iambic cadence into a waiting expectant
stillness.
