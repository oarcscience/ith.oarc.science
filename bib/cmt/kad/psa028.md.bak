Cry for Help and Thanksgiving, in a Time of Rebellion

To [Psa 26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md) and [Psa
27:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md) a third Psalm is here added,
belonging to the time of the persecution by Absolom. In this Psalm,
also, the drawing towards the sanctuary of God cannot be lost sight of;
and in addition thereto we have the intercession of the anointed one,
when personally imperilled, on behalf of the people who are equally in
need of help, - an intercession which can only be rightly estimated in
connection with the circumstances of that time. Like [Psa
27:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md) this, its neighbour, also
divides into two parts; these parts, however, though their lines are of
a different order, nevertheless bear a similar poetic impress. Both are
composed of verses consisting of two and three lines. There are many
points of contact between this Psalm and [Psa
27:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md); e.g., in the epithet applied
to God, מעוז; but compare also [Psa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003.md) with [Psa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009.md); [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md) with [Psa
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md); [Psa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#009.md) with [Psa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md). The echoes of this Psalm in
Isaiah are very many, and also in Jeremiah.

[Psalms 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 28:1</span></span>

This first half of the Psalm ([Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001).md) is supplicatory. The preposition
מן in connection with the verbs חרשׁ, to be deaf, dumb, and חשׁה, to
keep silence, is a pregnant form of expression denoting an aversion or
turning away which does not deign to give the suppliant an answer. Jahve
is his צוּר, his ground of confidence; but if He continues thus to keep
silence, then he who confides in Him will become like those who are
going down ([Psa 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030).md), or are gone
down ([Isa 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019).md) to the pit. The
participle of the past answers better to the situation of one already on
the brink of the abyss. In the double sentence with פּן, the chief
accent falls upon the second clause, for which the first only
paratactically opens up the way (cf. [Isa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md); [Isa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md); in Latin it would be ne, te
mihi non respondente, similis fiam. Olshausen, and Baur with him,
believes that because ונמשׁלתּי has not the accent on the ultima as
being perf. consec., it must be interpreted according to the
accentuation thus, "in order that Thou mayst no longer keep silence,
whilst I am already become like..." But this ought to be ואני נמשׁל, or
at least נמשׁלתּי ואני. And if ונמשלתי were to be taken as a real
perfect, it would then rather have to be rendered "and I should then be
like." But, notwithstanding ונמשׁלתּי is Milel, it is still perf.
consecuticum ("and I am become like"); for if, in a sentence of more
than one member following upon פן, the fut., as is usually the case
(vid., on [Psa 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017).md), goes over into
the perf., then the latter, in most instances, has the tone of the perf.
consec. ([Deu 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md), [Jdg
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#025.md), [Pro
5:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009.md), [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006).md), but not always. The
penultima-accentuation is necessarily retained in connection with the
two great pausal accents, Silluk and Athnach, [Deu
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#012.md); [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md); in this passage in connection
with Rebia mugrash, just as we may say, in general, the perf. consec.
sometimes retains its penultima-accentuation in connection with
distinctives instead of being accented on the ultima; e.g., in
connection with Rebia mugrash, [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md); with Rebia, [Pro
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014.md) (cf. [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md) with [Eze
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#017).md); with Zakeph. [Sa1
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008.md); and even with Tiphcha Obad. [Oba
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010.md), [Joe
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#021.md). The national grammarians are
ignorant of any law on this subject.

(Note: Aben-Ezra (Moznajim 36b) explains the perfect accented on the
penult. in [Pro 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md) from the
conformity of sound, and Kimchi (Michlol 6b) simply records the
phenomenon.)

The point towards which the psalmist stretches forth his hands in prayer
is Jahve's holy דּביר. Such is the word (after the form בּריח, כּליא,
עטין) used only in the Books of Kings and Chronicles, with the exception
of this passage, to denote the Holy of Holies, not as being
χρηματιστήριον (Aquila and Symmachus), or λαλητήριον, oraculum (Jerome),
as it were, Jahve's audience chamber (Hengstenberg) - a meaning that is
not in accordance with the formation of the word, - but as the hinder
part of the tent, from דּבר, Arabic dabara, to be behind, whence dubr
(Talmudic דּוּבר), that which is behind (opp. kubl. kibal, that which is
in the front), cf. Jesurun p. 87f. In [Psa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003.md), [Psa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004.md) the prayer is expanded. משׁך
(instead of which we find אסף in [Psa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009).md), to draw any one down forcibly
to destruction, or to drag him to the place of judgment, [Eze
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#020.md), cf. [Psa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md); [Job
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022.md). The delineation of the ungodly
David borrows from his actual foes, Should he succumb to them, then his
fate would be like that which awaits them, to whom he is conscious that
he is radically unlike. He therefore prays that God's recompensing
justice may anticipate him, i.e., that He may requite them according to
their desert, before he succumbs, to whom they have feigned שׁלום, a
good understanding, or being on good terms, whereas they cherished in
their heart the רעה that is now unmasked (cf. [Jer
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007).md). נתן, used of an official
adjudication, as in [Hos 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#014.md); [Jer
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019.md). The epanaphora of תּן־להם is
like [Psa 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md).

(Note: This repetition, at the end, of a significant word that has been
used at the beginning of a verse, is a favourite custom of Isaiah's
(Comment. S. 387; transl. ii. 134).)

The phrase השׁיב גּמוּל (שׁלּם), which occurs frequently in the
prophets, signifies to recompense or repay to any one his accomplishing,
his manifestation, that is to say, what he has done and merited; the
thoughts and expression call to mind more particularly [Isa
3:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#008.md); [Isa
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md). The right to pray for recompense
(vengeance) is grounded, in [Psa 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005.md),
upon their blindness to God's just and merciful rule as it is to be seen
in human history (cf. [Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md); [Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011).md). The contrast of בּנה and חרס,
to pull down (with a personal object, as in [Exo
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#007).md), is like Jeremiah's style ([Psa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md), cf. 1:10; [Psa
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009), and frequently, Sir. 49:7.md). In
[Psa 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005.md), the prominent thought in
David's mind is, that they shamefully fail to recognise how gloriously
and graciously God has again and again acknowledged him as His anointed
one. He has (2 Sam 7) received the promise, that God would build him a
house, i.e., grant perpetual continuance to his kingship. The
Absolomites are in the act of rebellion against this divine appointment.
Hence they shall experience the very reverse of the divine promise given
to David: Jahve will pull them down and not build them up, He will
destroy, at its very commencement, this dynasty set up in opposition to
God.

[Psalms 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 28:6</span></span>

The first half of the Psalm prayed for deliverance and for judgment;
this second half gives thanks for both. If the poet wrote the Psalm at
one sitting then at this point the certainty of being answered dawns
upon him. But it is even possible that he added this second part later
on, as a memorial of the answer he experienced to his prayer (Hitzig,
Ewald). It sounds, at all events, like the record of something that has
actually taken place. Jahve is his defence and shield. The conjoined
perfects in [Psa 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#007.md) denote that
which is closely united in actual realisation; and in the fut. consec.,
as is frequently the case, e.g., in [Job
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002.md), the historical signification
retreats into the background before the more essential idea of that
which has been produced. In משּׁירי, the song is conceived as the spring
whence the הודות bubble forth; and instead of אודנּוּ we have the more
impressive form אהודנּוּ, as in Ps 45:18; [Psa
116:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#006.md); [Sa1
17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047.md), the syncope being omitted. From
suffering (Leid) springs song (Lied), and from song springs the praise
(Lob) of Him, who has "turned" the suffering, just as it is attuned in
[Psa 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006.md) and [Psa
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008.md).

(Note: There is a play of words and an alliteration in this sentence
which we cannot fully reproduce in the English. - Tr.)

The αὐτοί, who are intended by למו in [Psa
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008.md), are those of Israel, as in [Psa
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#008.md); [Isa
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002) (Hitzig.md). The lxx (κραταίωμα τοῦ
λαοῦ αὐτοῦ) reads לעמּו, as in [Psa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md), which is approved by Bצttcher,
Olshausen and Hupfeld; but למו yields a similar sense. First of all
David thinks of the people, then of himself; for his private character
retreats behind his official, by virtue of which he is the head of
Israel. For this very reason his deliverance is the deliverance of
Israel, to whom, so far as they have become unfaithful to His anointed,
Jahve has not requited this faithlessness, and to whom, so far as they
have remained true to him, He has rewarded this fidelity. Jahve is a עז
a si evhaJ to them, inasmuch as He preserves them by His might from the
destruction into which they would have precipitated themselves, or into
which others would have precipitated them; and He is the מעוז ישׁוּעות
of His anointed inasmuch as He surrounds him as an inaccessible place of
refuge which secures to him salvation in all its fulness instead of the
destruction anticipated. Israel's salvation and blessing were at stake;
but Israel is in fact God's people and God's inheritance - may He, then,
work salvation for them in every future need and bless them. Apostatised
from David, it was a flock in the hands of the hireling - may He ever
take the place of shepherd to them and carry them in His arms through
the destruction. The נשּׂאם coupled with וּרעם (thus it is to be pointed
according to Ben-Asher) calls to mind [Deu
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031.md), "Jahve carried Israel as a man
doth carry his son," and [Exo 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004.md);
[Deu 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md), "as on eagles' wings." The
Piel, as in [Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md), is used of
carrying the weak, whom one lifts up and thus removes out of its
helplessness and danger. [Psa 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md)
closes just in the same way with an intercession; and the close of [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md) is similar, but promissory,
and consequently it is placed next to [Psa
28:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md).
