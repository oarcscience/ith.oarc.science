### [Numbers Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001)

[Numbers 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 2:1</span></span>

Order of the Twelve Tribes in the Camp and on the March. - [Num
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001), [Num
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#002). The twelve tribes were to encamp
each one by his standard, by the signs of their fathers' houses,
opposite to the tabernacle (at some distance) round about, and,
according to the more precise directions given afterwards, in such order
that on every side of the tabernacle three tribes were encamped side by
side and united under one banner, so that the twelve tribes formed four
large camps or divisions of an army. Between these camps and the court
surrounding the tabernacle, the three leading mishpachoth of the Levites
were to be encamped on three sides, and Moses and Aaron with the sons of
Aaron (i.e., the priests) upon the fourth, i.e., the front or eastern
side, before the entrance (Num 3:21-38). דּגל, a standard, banner, or
flag, denotes primarily the larger field sign, possessed by every
division composed of three tribes, which was also the banner of the
tribe at the head of each division; and secondarily, in a derivative
signification, it denotes the army united under one standard, like
σημεία, or vexillum. It is used thus, for example, in [Num
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017), [Num
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#031), [Num
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#034), and in combination with מחנה in
[Num 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003), [Num
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#010), [Num
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#018), and [Num
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#025), where "standard of the camp of
Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan" signifies the hosts of the tribes
arranged under these banners. אתת, the signs (ensigns), were the smaller
flags or banners which were carried at the head of the different tribes
and subdivisions of the tribes (the fathers' houses). Neither the Mosaic
law, nor the Old Testament generally, gives us any intimation as to the
form or character of the standard (degel). According to rabbinical
tradition, the standard of Judah bore the figure of a lion, that of
Reuben the likeness of a man or of a man's head, that of Ephraim the
figure of an ox, and that of Dan the figure of an eagle; so that the
four living creatures united in the cherubic forms described by Ezekiel
were represented upon these four standards.

(Note: Jerome Prado, in his commentary upon Ezekiel (ch. 1 p. 44), gives
the following minute description according to rabbinical tradition: "The
different leaders of the tribes had their own standards, with the crests
of their ancestors depicted upon them. On the east, above the tent of
Naasson the first-born of Judah, there shone a standard of a green
colour, this colour having been adopted by him because it was in a green
stone, viz., an emerald, that the name of his forefather Judah was
engraved on the breastplate of the high priest ([Exo
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015).), and on this standard there
was depicted a lion, the crest and hieroglyphic of his ancestor Judah,
whom Jacob had compared to a lion, saying, 'Judah is a lion's whelp.'
Towards the south, above the tent of Elisur the son of Reuben, there
floated a red standard, having the colour of the sardus, on which the
name of his father, viz., Reuben, was engraved upon the breastplate of
the high priest. The symbol depicted upon this standard was a human
head, because Reuben was the first-born, and head of the family. On the
west, above the tent of Elishamah the son of Ephraim, there was a golden
flag, on which the head of a calf was depicted, because it was through
the vision of the calves or oxen that his ancestor Joseph had predicted
and provided for the famine in Egypt (Gen 41); and hence Moses, when
blessing the tribe of Joseph, i.e., Ephraim ([Deu
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017)), said, 'his glory is that of
the first-born of a bull.' The golden splendour of the standard of
Ephraim resembled that of the chrysolite, in which the name of Ephraim
was engraved upon the breastplate. Towards the north, above the tent of
Ahiezer the son of Dan, there floated a motley standard of white and
red, like the jaspis (or, as some say, a carbuncle), in which the name
of Dan was engraved upon the breastplate. The crest upon this was an
eagle, the great doe to serpents, which had been chosen by the leader in
the place of a serpent, because his forefather Jacob had compared Dan to
a serpent, saying, 'Dan is a serpent in the way, an adder (cerastes, a
horned snake) in the path;' but Ahiezer substituted the eagle, the
destroyer of serpents as he shrank from carrying an adder upon his
flag.")

[Numbers 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 2:3</span></span>

Order of the tribes in the camp and on the march. - [Num
2:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003). The standard of the tribe of
Judah was to encamp in front, namely towards the east, according to its
hosts; and by its side the tribes of Issachar and Zebulun, the
descendants of Leah, under the command and banner of Judah: an army of
186,400 men, which was to march out first when the camp was broken up
([Num 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#009)), so that Judah led the way
as the champion of his brethren ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)).

[Num 2:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#004)

"His host, and those that were numbered of them" (cf. [Num
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#006), [Num
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#008), [Num
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#011), etc.), i.e., the army according
to its numbered men.

[Num 2:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#010)

On the south side was the standard of Reuben, with which Simeon and Gad,
descendants of Leah and her maid Zilpah, were associated, and to which
they were subordinated. In [Num 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#014),
Reuel is a mistake for Reuel ([Num
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#014); [Num
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#042); [Num
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#020)), which is the reading given
here in 118 MSS cited by Kennicott and De Rossi, in several of the
ancient editions, and in the Samaritan, Vulgate, and Jonah Saad.,
whereas the lxx, Onk., Syr., and Pers. read Reuel. This army of 151,450
men was to break up and march as the second division.

[Num 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017)

The tabernacle, the camp of the Levites, was to break up after this in
the midst of the camps (i.e., of the other tribes). "As they encamp, so
shall they break up," that is to say, with Levi in the midst of the
tribes, "every man in his place, according to his banner." יד, place, as
in [Deu 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#013); [Isa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#008).

[Num 2:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#018)

On the west the standard of Ephraim, with the tribes of Manasseh and
Benjamin, that is to say, the whole of the descendants of Rachel,
108,100 men, as the third division of the army.

[Num 2:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#025)

Lastly, towards the north was the standard of Gad, with Asher and
Naphtali, the descendants of the maids Bilhah and Zilpah, 157,600 men,
who were to be the last to break up, and formed the rear on the march.

[Num 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#031)

לדגליהם (according to their standards) is equivalent to לצבאתם
(according to their hosts) in [Num
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#009), [Num
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#016), and [Num
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#024), i.e., according to the hosts of
which they consisted.

[Numbers 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 2:32</span></span>

In [Num 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#032) we have the whole number
given, 603,550 men, not including the Levites ([Num
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#033), see at [Num
1:49](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#049)); and in [Num
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#034) the concluding remark as to the
subsequent execution of the divine command-an anticipatory notice, as in
[Exo 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#050); [Exo
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#016), etc.
