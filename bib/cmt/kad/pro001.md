### [Proverbs Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 1:1</span></span>

The external title, i.e., the Synagogue name, of the whole collection of
Proverbs is משׁלי (Mishle), the word with which it commences. Origen
(Euseb. h. e. vi. 25) uses the name Μισλώθ, i.e., משׁלות, which occurs
in the Talmud and Midrash as the designation of the book, from its
contents. In a similar way, the names given to the Psalter, תּהלּים and
תּהלּות, are interchanged.

This external title is followed by one which the Book of Proverbs,
viewed as to its gradual formation, and first the older portion, gives
to itself. It reaches from [Pro 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md) to
[Pro 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md), and names not only the
contents and the author of the book, but also commends it in regard to
the service which it is capable of rendering. It contains "Proverbs of
Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel." The books of the נבואה and
חכמה, including the Canticles, thus give their own titles; among the
historical books, that of the memoirs of Nehemiah is the only one that
does so. משׁלי has the accent Dech, to separate

(Note: Norzi has erroneously accented משלי with the accent Munach. The מ
is besides the Masoretic majusculum, like the ב, שׁ, and א at the
commencement of the Law, the Canticles, and Chronicles.)

it from the following complex genitive which it governs, and מלך ישׂראל
is made the second hemistich, because it belongs to שׁלמה, not to דּוד.

(Note: If it had belonged to דוד, then the sentence would have been
accented thus: משׁלי שלמה בן־דוד מלך ישראל.)

As to the fundamental idea of the word משׁל, we refer to the derivation
given in the Gesch. der jud. Poesie, p. 196, from משׁל, Aram. מתל, root
תל, Sanskr. tul (whence tul, balance, similarity), Lat. tollere; the
comparison of the Arab. mathal leads to the same conclusion. "משׁל
signifies, not, as Schultens and others after him affirm, effigies ad
similitudinem alius rei expressa, from משׁל in the primary signification
premere, premente manu tractare; for the corresponding Arab. verb mathal
does not at all bear that meaning, but signifies to stand, to present
oneself, hence to be like, properly to put oneself forth as something,
to represent it; and in the Hebr. also to rule, properly with על to
stand on or over something, with בּ to hold it erect, like Arab. kam
with b, rem administravit \[vid. Jesaia, p. 691\]. Thus e.g., [Gen
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#002.md), it is said of Eliezer: המּשׁל
בּכל־אשׁר־לו, who ruled over all that he (Abraham) had (Luther: was a
prince over all his goods). Thus משׁל, figurative discourse which
represents that which is real, similitude; hence then parable or shorter
apothegm, proverb, in so far as they express primarily something
special, but which as a general symbol is then applied to everything
else of a like kind, and in so far stands figuratively. An example is
found in [Sa1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#011.md). It is incorrect
to conclude from this meaning of the word that such memorial sayings or
proverbs usually contained comparisons, or were clothed in figurative
language; for that is the case in by far the fewest number of instances:
the oldest have by far the simplest and most special interpretations"
(Fleischer). Hence Mashal, according to its fundamental idea, is that
which stands with something = makes something stand forth =
representing. This something that represents may be a thing or a person;
as e.g., one may say Job is a Mashal, i.e., a representant, similitude,
type of Israel (vide the work entitled עץ החיים, by Ahron b. Elia, c.
90, p. 143); and, like Arab. mathal (more commonly mithl = משׁל, cf.
משׁל, [Job 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#025).md), is used quite as
generally as is its etymological cogn. instar (instare). But in Hebr.
Mashal always denotes representing discourse with the additional marks
of the figurative and concise, e.g., the section which presents ([Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006).md) him to whom it refers as a
warning example, but particularly, as there defined, the gnome, the
apothegm or maxim, in so far as this represents general truths in
sharply outlined little pictures.

[Pro 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002.md)

Now follows the statement of the object which these proverbs subserve;
and first, in general,

To become acquainted with wisdom and instruction,

To understand intelligent discourses.

They seek on the one side to initiate the reader in wisdom and
instruction, and on the other to guide him to the understanding of
intelligent discourses, for they themselves contain such discourses in
which there is a deep penetrating judgment, and they sharpen the
understanding of him who engages his attention with them.

(Note: לדעת is rightly pointed by Lwenstein with Dech after Cod. 1294;
vide the rule by which the verse is divided, Torath Emeth, p. 51, 12.)

As Schultens has already rightly determined the fundamental meaning of
ידע, frequently compared with the Sanskr. vid, to know (whence by
gunating,

(Note: Guna = a rule in Sanskrit grammar regulating the modification of
vowels.)

vda, knowledge), after the Arab. wad'a, as deponere, penes se condere,
so he also rightly explains חכמה by soliditas; it means properly (from
חכם, Arab. hakm, R. hk, vide under [Psa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008), to be firm, closed.md) compactness,
and then, like πυκνότης, ability, worldly wisdom, prudence, and in the
higher general sense, the knowledge of things in the essence of their
being and in the reality of their existence. Along with wisdom stands
the moral מוּסר, properly discipline, i.e., moral instruction, and in
conformity with this, self-government, self-guidance, from יסר = וסר,
cogn. אסר, properly adstrictio or constrictio; for the מ of the noun
signifies both id quod or aliquid quod (ὅ, τι) and quod in the
conjunctional sense (ὅτι), and thus forms both a concrete (like מוסר =
מאסר, fetter, chain) and an abstract idea. The first general object of
the Proverbs is דּעת, the reception into oneself of wisdom and moral
edification by means of education and training; and second is to
comprehend utterances of intelligence, i.e., such as proceed from
intelligence and give expression to it (cf. אמרי אמת, [Pro
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#021).md). בּין, Kal, to be distinguished
(whence בּין, between, constr. of בּין, space between, interval),
signifies in Hiph. to distinguish, to understand; בּינה is, according to
the sense, the n. actionis of this Hiph., and signifies the
understanding as the capability effective in the possession of the right
criteria of distinguishing between the true and the false, the good and
the bad ([Kg1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009).md), the wholesome and
the pernicious.

[Pro 1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003.md)

In the following, 2a is expanded in [Pro
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003.md), then 2b in [Pro
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md). First the immediate object:

3 To attain intelligent instruction,

Righteousness, and justice, and integrity;

4 To impart to the inexperienced prudence,

To the young man knowledge and discretion

5 Let the wise man hear and gain learning,

And the man of understanding take to himself rules of conduct.

With דּעת, denoting the reception into oneself, acquiring, is
interchanged (cf. [Pro 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001).md) קחת, its
synonym, used of intellectual reception and appropriation, which,
contemplated from the point of view of the relation between the teacher
and the learner, is the correlative of תּת, παραδιδόναι, tradere ([Pro
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#009).md). But מוּסר השׂכּל is that which
proceeds from chokma and musar when they are blended together:
discipline of wisdom, discipline training to wisdom; i.e., such morality
and good conduct as rest not on external inheritance, training,
imitation, and custom, but is bound up with the intelligent knowledge of
the Why and the Wherefore. השׂכּל, as [Pro
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016.md), is inf. absol. used
substantively (cf. השׁקט, keeping quiet, [Isa
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017).md) of שׂכל (whence שׂכל,
intellectus), to entwine, involve; for the thinking through a subject is
represented as an interweaving, complicating, configuring of the
thoughts (the syllogism is in like manner represented as אשׁכּל, Aram.
סגול, a bunch of grapes), (with which also סכל, a fool, and חסכּיל, to
act foolishly, are connected, from the confusion of the thoughts, the
entangling of the conceptions; cf. Arab. 'akl, to understand, and
מעקּל). The series of synonyms (cf. [Pro
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#023).md) following in 3b, which are not
well fitted to be the immediate object to לקחת, present themselves as
the unfolding of the contents of the מוּסר השׂכּל, as meaning that
namely which is dutiful and right and honest. With the frequently
occurring two conceptions צדק וּמשׁפּט ([Pro
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#009).md), (or with the order reversed as
in [Psa 119:121](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#121).md) is interchanged
משׁפּט וּצדקה (or with the order also reversed, [Pro
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003).md). The remark of Heidenheim, that
in צדק the conception of the justum, and in צדקה that of the aequum
prevails, is suggested by the circumstance that not צדק but צדקה
signifies δικαιοσύνη (cf. [Pro 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002).md)
in the sense of liberality, and then of almsgiving (ἐλεημοσύνη); but צדק
also frequently signifies a way of thought and action which is regulated
not by the letter of the law and by talio, but by love (cf. [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md); [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006).md). Tsedek and ts'dakah have almost
the relation to one another of integrity and justice which practically
brings the former into exercise. משׁפּט (from שׁפט, to make straight, to
adjust, cf. שׁבט, Arab. sabita, to be smooth) is the right and the
righteousness in which it realizes itself, here subjectively considered,
the right mind.

(Note: According to Malbim, משׁפט is the fixed objective right, צדק the
righteousness which does not at once decide according to the letter of
the law, but always according to the matter and the person.)

משׁרים (defect. for מישׁרים, from ישׁר, to be straight, even) is plur.
tantum; for its sing. מישׁר (after the form מיטב) the form מישׁור (in
the same ethical sense, e.g., [Mal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006).md) is used: it means thus a way of
thought and of conduct that is straight, i.e., according to what is
right, true, i.e., without concealment, honest, i.e., true to duty and
faithful to one's word.

[Pro 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004.md)

This verse presents another aspect of the object to be served by this
book: it seeks to impart prudence to the simple. The form פּתאים

(Note: Like עפאים, [Psa 104:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#012.md),
וכצבאים, [Ch1 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md), cf. Michlol, 196a.
In [Pro 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022.md), [Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032), the mute א is wanting..md)

(in which, as in גּוים, the י plur. remains unwritten) is, in this
mongrel form in which it is written (cf. [Pro
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#007.md); [Pro
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#005.md); [Pro
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#006.md); [Pro
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#018.md); [Pro
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#012).md), made up of פּתים ([Pro
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022.md), [Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032.md), once written plene, פּתיים, [Pro
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003).md) and פּתאים ([Pro
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#007).md). These two forms with י and the
transition of י into א are interchanged in the plur. of such nouns as
פּתי, segolate form, "from פּתה (cogn. פּתח), to be open, properly the
open-hearted, i.e., one whose heart stands open to every influence from
another, the harmless, good-natured - a vox media among the Hebrews
commonly (though not always, cf. e.g., [Psa
116:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#006).md) in malam partem: the foolish,
silly, one who allows himself to be easily persuaded or led astray, like
similar words in other languages - Lat. simplex, Gr. εὐήθης, Fr. nav;
Arab. fatyn, always, however, in a good sense: a high and noble-minded
man, not made as yet mistrustful and depressed by sad experiences,
therefore juvenis ingenuus, vir animi generosi" (Fl.). The פּתאים, not
of firm and constant mind, have need of ערמה; therefore the saying [Pro
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015.md), cf. [Pro
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#005.md); [Pro
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025.md). The noun ערמה (a fem. segolate
form like חכמה) means here calliditas in a good sense, while the
corresponding Arab. 'aram (to be distinguished from the verb 'aram, ערם,
to peel, to make bare, nudare) is used only in a bad sense, of
malevolent, deceptive conduct. In the parallel member the word נער is
used, generally (collectively) understood, of the immaturity which must
first obtain intellectual and moral clearness and firmness; such an one
is in need of peritia et sollertia, as Fleischer well renders it; for
דּעת is experimental knowledge, and מזמּה (from זמם, according to its
primary signification, to press together, comprimere; then, referred to
mental concentration: to think) signifies in the sing., sensu bono, the
capability of comprehending the right purposes, of seizing the right
measures, of projecting the right plans.

[Pro 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005.md)

In this verse the infinitives of the object pass into independent
sentences for the sake of variety. That ישׁמע cannot mean audiet, but
audiat, is shown by [Pro 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#009.md); but ויסף
is jussive (with the tone thrown back before לקח; cf. [Pro
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md), and [Pro
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#021.md), [Pro
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#023.md), where the tone is not thrown
back, as also [Sa2 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#003).md) with the
consecutive Vav ( ו ) (= Arab. f): let him hear, thus will he... or, in
order that he. Whoever is wise is invited to hear these proverbs in
order to add learning (doctrinam) to that which he already possesses,
according to the principle derived from experience, [Pro
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#009.md); [Mat
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012.md). The segolate לקח, which in
pausa retains its segol (as also בּטח, ישׁע, צמח, מלך, צדק, קדם, and
others), means reception, and concretely what one takes into himself
with his ear and mind; therefore learning (διδαχὴ with the object of the
ἀποδοχή), as [Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md) (parallel אמרה,
as [Deu 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002) תּורה.md), and then learning
that has passed into the possession of the receiver, knowledge, science
([Isa 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#024), parall. בּינה.md). Schultens
compares the Arab. laḳah, used of the fructification of the female palm
by the flower-dust of the male. The part. נבון (the inf. of which is
found only once, [Isa 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013).md) is the
passive or the reflexive of the Hiph. הבין, to explain, to make to
understand: one who is caused to understand or who lets himself be
informed, and thus an intelligent person - that is one who may gain
תּחבּות by means of these proverbs. This word, found only in the plur.
(probably connected with חבל, shipmaster, properly one who has to do
with the חבלים, ship's ropes, particularly handles the sails, lxx
κυβέρνησιν), signifies guidance, management, skill to direct anything
([Job 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#007.md), of God's skill which
directs the clouds), and in the plur. conception, the taking measures,
designs in a good sense, or also (as in [Pro
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#005).md) in a bad sense; here it means
guiding thoughts, regulating principles, judicious rules and maxims, as
[Deu 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014.md), prudent rules of
government, [Deu 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#018.md); [Deu
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006.md) of stratagems. Fl. compares the
Arab. tedbı̂r (guidance, from דּבר, to lead cattle), with its plur.
tedâbı̂r, and the Syr. dubôro, direction, management, etc.

[Pro 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md)

The mediate object of these proverbs, as stated in [Pro
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002.md), is now expanded, for again it is
introduced in the infinitive construction: - The reader shall learn in
these proverbs, or by means of them as of a key, to understand such like
apothegms generally (as [Pro 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017)..md):

To understand proverb and symbol,

The words of wise men and their enigmas.

In the Gesch. der jd. Poesie, p. 200f., the derivation of the noun מליצה
is traced from לוּץ, primarily to shine, Sanskr. las, frequently with
the meanings ludere and lucere; but the Arab. brings near another
primary meaning. "מליצה, from Arab. root las, flexit, torsit, thus
properly oratio detorta, obliqua, non aperta; hence לץ, mocker, properly
qui verbis obliquis utitur: as Hiph. הליץ, to scoff, but also verba
detorta retorquere, i.e., to interpret, to explain" (Fl.). Of the root
ideas found in חידה, to be sharp, pointed (חד, perhaps related to the
Sanskr. kaṭu, sharp of taste, but not to acutus), and to be twisted (cf.
אחד, אגד ,אחד, עקד, harmonizing with the at present mysterious catena),
that the preference is given to the latter already, [Psa
78:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002.md). "The Arab. ḥâd, to revolve, to
turn (whence hid, bend, turn aside!), thence חידה, στροφή, cunning,
intrigue, as also enigma, dark saying, perlexe dictum" (Fl.). The
comparison made by Schultens with the Arab. ḥidt as the name of the knot
on the horn of the wild-goat shows the sensible fundamental conception.
In post-biblical literature חידה is the enigma proper, and מליצה poetry
(with הלצה of poetical prose). The Graec. Venet. translates it
ῥητορείαν.

[Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md)

The title of the book is followed by its motto, symbol, device:

The fear of Jahve is the beginning of knowledge;

Wisdom and discipline is despised by fools.

The first hemistich expresses the highest principle of the Israelitish
Chokma, as it is found also in [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md) (cf. [Pro
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033).md), [Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md), and in [Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md) (whence the lxx has
interpolated here two lines). ראשׁית combines in itself, as ἀρχή, the
ideas of initium (accordingly J. H. Michaelis: initium cognitionis, a
quo quisquis recte philosophari cupit auspicium facere debet) and
principium, i.e., the basis, thus the root (cf. [Mic
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#013.md) with [Job
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#028).md).

(Note: In Sirach 1:14, 16, the Syr. has both times רישׁ חכמתא; but in
the second instance, where the Greek translation has πλησμονὴ σοφίας,
שׂבע חכמה (after [Psa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011).md) may have
existed in the original text.)

Wisdom comes from God, and whoever fears Him receives it (cf. [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005)..md). יראת יהוה is reverential
subordination to the All-directing, and since designedly יהוה is used,
and not אלהים (ה), to the One God, the Creator and Governor of the
world, who gave His law unto Israel, and also beyond Israel left not His
holy will unattested; the reverse side of the fear of Jahve as the Most
Holy One is שׂנאת רע, [Pro 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#013.md)
(post-biblical יראת חטא). The inverted placing of the words 7b imports
that the wisdom and discipline which one obtains in the way of the fear
of God is only despised by the אוילים, i.e., the hard, thick, stupid;
see regarding the root-word אול, coalescere, cohaerere, incrassari, der
Prophet Jesaia, p. 424, and at [Psa
73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004.md). Schultens rightly compares
παχεῖς, crassi pro stupidis.

(Note: Malbim's explanation is singular: the sceptics, from אוּלי,
perhaps! This also is Heidenheim's view.)

בּזוּ has the tone on the penult., and thus comes from בּוּז; the 3rd
pr. of בּזה would be בּזוּ or בּזיוּ. The perf. (cf. [Pro
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#029).md) is to be interpreted after the
Lat. oderunt (Ges. 126).

[Proverbs 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 1:8</span></span>

After the author has indicated the object which his Book of Proverbs is
designed to subserve, and the fundamental principle on which it is
based, he shows for whom he has intended it; he has particularly the
rising generation in his eye:

8 Hear, my son, thy father's instruction,

And refuse not the teaching of thy mother;

9 For these are a fair crown to thy head,

And Jewels to thy neck.

"My son," says the teacher of wisdom to the scholar whom he has, or
imagines that he has, before him, addressing him as a fatherly friend.
The N.T. representation of birth into a new spiritual life, [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md); [Plm
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010.md); [Gal
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md), lies outside the circle of the
O.T. representation; the teacher feels himself as a father by virtue of
his benevolent, guardian, tender love. Father and mother are the beloved
parents of those who are addressed. When the Talmud understands אביך of
God, אמּך of the people (אמּה), that is not the grammatico-historic
meaning, but the practical interpretation and exposition, after the
manner of the Midrash. The same admonition (with נצר, keep, instead of
שׁמע, hear, and מצות, command, instead of מוּסר, instruction) is
repeated in [Pro 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020.md), and what is
said of the parents in one passage is in [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md) divided into two synonymous
parallel passages. The stricter musar, which expresses the idea of
sensible means of instruction (discipline), ([Pro
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024.md); [Pro
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015.md); [Pro
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013)..md), is suitably attributed to the
father, and the torah to the mother, only administered by the word;
Wisdom also always says תּורתי (my torah), and only once, [Pro
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#010), מוּסרי (my musar.md).

[Pro 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009.md)

הם, which is also used in the neut. illa, e.g., [Job
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#024.md), refers here to the paternal
discipline and the maternal teaching. These, obediently received and
followed, are the fairest ornament of the child. לויה, from לוה, to
wind, to roll, Arab. lawy (from לו, whence also לוּל = לולו, as דּוּד,
to boil up, = דּודּו), means winding, twisted ornament, and especially
wreath; a crown of gracefulness is equivalent to a graceful crown, a
corolla gratiosa, as Schultens translates it; cf. [Pro
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#009.md), according to which, Wisdom
bestows such a crown.

(Note: In לוית חן the חן has the conjunctive accent shalsheleth, on
account of which the Pesiq accent is omitted. This small shalsheleth
occurs only eight times. See Torath Emeth, p. 36.)

ענקים (or ענקות, [Jdg 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#026).md) are
necklaces, jewels for the neck; denom. of the Arab. 'unek, and Aram.
עוּנק, the neck (perhaps from ענק = עוּק, to oppress, of heavy burdens;
cf. αὐχήν, the neck). גּרגּות, is, like fauces, the throat by which one
swallows (Arab. ǵarǵara, taǵarǵara), a plur. extensive (Bttcher, 695),
and is better fitted than גּרון to indicate the external throat;
Ezekiel, however, uses ([Eze 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#011).md)
garon, as our poet ([Pro 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md), [Pro
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022.md); [Pro
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#021).md) uses garg'roth, to represent the
front neck.

(Note: The writing varies greatly. Here and at [Pro
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#021.md) we have לגרגּרתך; at [Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md), על־גּרגּותך, [Pro
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022.md), לגרגּרתיך. Thus according to the
Masora and correct texts.)

[Proverbs 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 1:10</span></span>

The general counsel of [Pro 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009.md) is
here followed by a more special warning:

My son, if sinners entice thee

Consent thou not.

The בּני

(Note: The accent Pazer over the בּני has the force of Athnach.)

(my son) is emphatically repeated. The intensive from חטּאים (signifies
men to whom sin has become a habit, thus vicious, wicked. פּתּה (Pi. of
פּתה, to open) is not denom., to make or wish to make a פּתי; the
meaning, to entice (harmonizing with πείθειν), פּתּה obtains from the
root-meaning of the Kal, for it is related to it as pandere (januam) to
patere: to open, to make accessible, susceptible, namely to persuasion.
The warning 10b is as brief as possible a call of alarm back from the
abyss. In the form תּבא (from אבה, to agree to, to be willing, see
Wetstein in Job, p. 349) the preformative א is wanting, as in תּמרוּ,
[Sa2 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#014.md), cf. [Psa
139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020.md), Ges. 68, 2, and instead of
תּבה (= תּאבה, [Kg1 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#008).md) is vocalized
not תּבא (cf. [Pro 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025).md), but after
the Aram. תּבא (cf. יגלי); see [Gen
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#029.md), and Comment. on Isaiah, p. 648;
Gesen. 75, 17.

[Proverbs 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 1:11</span></span>

Of the number of wicked men who gain associates to their palliation and
strengthening, they are adduced as an example whom covetousness leads to
murder.

11 If they say, "Go with us, we will lurk for blood,

Lie in wait for the innocent without cause;

12 Like the pit we will swallow them alive

And in perfect soundness like them that go down to the grave.

13 We find all manner of precious treasure,

Fill our houses with spoil.

14 Thou shalt cast thy lot amongst us,

We all have only one purse."

[Pro 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011.md)

The verb ארב signifies nectere, to bind fast (from רב, close, compact),
(see under [Isa 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#011).md), and
particularly (but so that it bears in itself its object without ellipse)
insidias nectere = insidiari. Regarding לדם Fleischer remarks: "Either
elliptically for לשׁפּך־דּם (Jewish interp.), or, as the parallelism and
the usage of the language of this book rather recommend, per synecd.
for: for a man, with particular reference to his blood to be poured out
(cf. our saying 'ein junges Blut,' a young blood = a youth, with the
underlying conception of the blood giving colour to the body as shining
through it, or giving to it life and strength), as [Psa
94:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#021.md)." As in post-biblical Heb. בּשׂר
ודם (or inverted, αἱμα καὶ σάρξ, [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014).md), used of men as such, is not so
used in the O.T., yet דּם, like נפשׁ, is sometimes used synecdochically
for the person, but never with reference to the blood as an essentially
constituent part of corporealness, but always with reference to violent
putting to death, which separates the blood from the body (cf. my System
der bibl. Psychologie, p. 242). Here לדם is explained by לדמים, with
which it is interchanged, [Mic 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002.md) :
let us lurk for blood (to be poured out). The verb צפן is never, like
טמן (to conceal), connected with חבלים, מוקשׁים ,ח, פּח, רשׁת - thus
none of these words is here to be supplied; the idea of gaining over one
expressed in the organic root צף (whence צפּה, diducendo obducere) has
passed over into that of restraining oneself, watching, lurking, hence
צפן (cog. Aram. כּמן) in the sense of speculari, insidiari, interchanges
with צפה (to spy), (cf. [Psa 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md);
[Psa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md) with [Psa
37:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#032).md). The adv. חנּם (an old accus.
from חן) properly means in a gracious manner, as a free gift (δωρεάν,
gratis = gratiis), and accordingly, without reward, also without cause,
which frequently = without guilt; but it never signifies sine effectu
qui noceat, i.e., with impunity (Lwenst.). We have thus either to
connect together נקי חנּם "innocent in vain" (as איבי חנּם, my enemies
without a cause, [Lam 3:52](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#052).md): his
innocence helps him nothing whom God protects not against us
notwithstanding his innocence (Schultens, Bertheau, Elster, and others);
or connect חנם with the verb (lie in wait for), for which Hitzig, after
the lxx, Syr., Rashi,

(Note: Rashi, i.e., Rabbi Salomo Isaaki, of Troyes, died a.d. 1105.
Ralbag, i.e., Rabbi Levi ben Gershon, usually referred to by Christian
writers as Master Leo de Bannolis, or Gersonides, a native of Banolas
near Gerona, died about 1342.)

Ralbag, Immanuel, rightly decides in view of [Sa1
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#005.md); [Sa1
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#031.md); cf. also [Job
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#017.md), where the succession of the
accents is the same (Tarcha transmuted from Mugrash). Frequently there
are combined together in his חנם (cf. [Isa
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014)..md), that which the author thinks,
and that which those whom he introduces as speaking think.

[Pro 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012.md)

The first clause of this verse Hitzig translates: "as the pit (swallows)
that which lives." This is untenable, because כּ with the force of a
substantive (as instar, likeness) is regarded as a preposition, but not
a conjunction (see at [Psa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#014)..md).
חיּים (the living) is connected with נבלעם, and is the accus. of the
state (hâl, according to the terminology of the Arab. grammarians) in
which they will, with impunity, swallow them up like the pit (the
insatiable, [Pro 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md); [Pro
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#016).md), namely, while these their
sacrifices are in the state of life's freshness,

(Note: Only in this sense is the existing accentuation of this verse
(cf. the Targ.) to be justified.)

"the living," - without doubt, like [Psa
55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md); [Psa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010.md); [Psa
124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md), in fact and in expression an
allusion to the fate of the company of Korah, [Num
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030.md), [Num
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#033.md). If this is the meaning of חיים,
then תּמימים as the parallel word means integros not in an ethical
sense, in which it would be a synonym of נקי of [Pro
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011.md) (cf. [Pro
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#010.md) with [Psa
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014).md), but in a physical sense
(Graec. Venet. καὶ τελείους; Parchon as Rashi, בריאים ושלמים, vid.,
Bttcher, De Inferis, 293). This physical sense is claimed for תּם, [Job
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#023.md), for תּם probably, [Psa
73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004.md), and why should not תמים, used in
the law regarding sacrifices (e.g., [Exo
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005), "without blemish".md) of the
faultlessness of the victim, also signify such an one אשׁר אין־בּו מתם
([Isa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md)? In the midst of complete
external health they will devour them like those that go down to the
grave (cf. [Psa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md); [Psa
88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md), with [Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019).md), i.e., like those under whose
feet the earth is suddenly opened, so that, without leaving any trace
behind, they sink into the grave and into Hades. The connection of the
finite with the accus. of place, [Psa
55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md), lies at the foundation of the
genitive connection יורדי בור (with the tone thrown back): those that go
down to the grave.

[Pro 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#013.md)

(Note: Here, in [Pro 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#014.md), גורלך is to
be written with Munach (not Metheg) in the second syllable; vid., Torath
Emeth, p. 20. Accentuationssystem, vii. 2.)

To their invitation, bearing in itself its own condemnation, they add as
a lure the splendid self-enriching treasures which in equal and just
fellowship with them they may have the prospect of sharing. הון (from
הוּן, levem, then facilem esse, tre ais, son aise) means aisance,
convenience, opulence, and concretely that by which life is made
agreeable, thus money and possessions (Fleischer in Levy's Chald.
Wrterbuch, i. 423f.). With this הון with remarkable frequency in the
Mishle יקר (from יקר, Arab. waḳar, grave esse) is connected in direct
contrast, according to its primary signification; cf. [Pro
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027.md); [Pro
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#004.md) : heavy treasures which make life
light. Yet it must not be maintained that, as Schultens has remarked,
this oxymoron is intended, nor also that it is only consciously present
in the language. מצא has here its primitive appropriate signification of
attaining, as [Isa 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#014.md) of reaching.
שׁלל (from שׁלל, to draw from, draw out, from של, cf. שׁלה, שׁלף, Arab.
salab, Comm. on Isa. p. 447) is that which is drawn away from the enemy,
exuviae, and then the booty and spoil taken in war generally. נמלּא, to
fill with anything, make full, governs a double accusative, as the Kal
(to become full of anything) governs only one. In [Pro
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#014.md), the invitation shows how the
prospect is to be realized. Interpreters have difficulty in conceiving
what is here meant. Do not a share by lot and a common purse exclude one
another? Will they truly, in the distribution of the booty by lot, have
equal portions at length, equally much in their money-bags? Or is it
meant that, apart from the portion of the booty which falls to every one
by lot, they have a common purse which, when their business is ebbing,
must supply the wants of the company, and on which the new companion can
maintain himself beforehand? Or does it mean only that they will be as
mutually helpful to one another, according to the principle τὰ τῶν φίλων
κοινά (amicorum omnia communia), as if they had only one purse? The
meaning is perfectly simple. The oneness of the purse consists in this,
that the booty which each of them gets, belongs not wholly or chiefly to
him, but to the whole together, and is disposed of by lot; so that, as
far as possible, he who participated not at all in the affair in
obtaining it, may yet draw the greatest prize. This view harmonizes the
relation between 14b and 14a. The common Semitic כּים is even used at
the present day in Syria and elsewhere as the name of the Exchange
("Brse") (plur. akjâs); here it is the purse ("Kasse") (χρημάτων
δοχεῖον, Procop.), which is made up of the profits of the business. This
profit consists not merely in gold, but is here thought of in regard to
its worth in gold. The apparent contradiction between distributing by
lot and having a common purse disappears when the distribution by lot of
the common property is so made, that the retaining of a stock-capital,
or reserve fund, is not excluded.

[Proverbs 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 1:15</span></span>

After the men are described against whose enticements a warning is given
forth, the warning is emphatically repeated, and is confirmed by a
threefold reason:

My son! go not in the way with them.

Keep back thy foot from their path.

If בּדרך (in the way), taken alone, cannot be equivalent to בדרך אחד (in
one way), so is אתּם (with them) to be regarded as its determination.

(Note: The Arab. grammarians regard this as half determination, and call
it takhsys; that אתּם has with them the force of a virtually coordinated
attributive; while, according to the Arab. gram., it is also possible
that בּדרך, "in one way," is equivalent to on the common way, for in the
indetermination sometimes there lies the conception not merely of âhad,
but of weahad.)

Foot (not feet), as eye, hand, etc., is used where the members come less
under consideration than what they unitedly bring about ([Pro
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026)..md). נתיבה, from נתב, signifies
properly that which is raised, especially the (raised) footstep.

[Proverbs 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 1:16</span></span>

The first argument to enforce the warning:

For their feet run to the evil,

And hasten to shed blood.

That this is their object they make no secret ([Pro
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011)..md); but why is it that such an
object as this should furnish no ground of warning against them,
especially as on this beginning the stamp of that which is morally
blamable is here impressed with לרע? Besides, this circular movement of
the thoughts is quite after the manner of this poet; and that [Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md) is his style, [Pro
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#018.md) shows. The want of this distich
([Pro 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md) = [Rom
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015).md) in lxx B. א. weighs heavier
certainly than the presence of it in lxx A. (Procop., Syro-Hezap.),
since the translation is not independent, but is transferred from [Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md); but if for the first time, at a
later period, it is supplied in the lxx, yet it has the appearance of an
addition made to the Hebr. text from [Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007) (Hitzig, Lagarde.md); cf. Comm. on
Isaiah, 40-66. לשׁפּך is always pointed thus; for, as a regular rule,
after ל as well as מ sa llew s the aspiration disappears; but in [Eze
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017.md) בּשׁפּך is also found, and in
this case (cf. at [Psa 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015).md) the
punctuation is thus inconsequent.

[Proverbs 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 1:17</span></span>

The second argument in support of the warning.

For in vain is the net spread out

In the eyes of all (the winged) birds.

The interpretation conspersum est rete, namely, with corn as a bait,
which was put into circulation by Rashi, is inadmissible; for as little
as הזּה (Hiph. of נזה) can mean to strew, can זרה mean to spread. The
object is always that which is scattered (gestreut), not that which is
spread (bestreut). Thus, expansum est rete, but not from מזר, extendere,
from which מזורה

(Note: The MS Masora remarks לית וחסר, and hence מזרה is written
defectively in the Erfurt, 1, 2, 3, Frankf. 1294, in the edition of
Norzi and elsewhere.)

in this form cannot be derived (it would in that case be מזוּרה), but
from זרה, pass. of זרה, to scatter, spread out. The alluring net, when
it is shaken out and spread, is, as it were, scattered, ventilatur. But
if this is done incautiously before the eyes of the birds to be caught,
they forthwith fly away. The principle stress lies on the בּעיני (before
the eyes) as the reason of the חנּם (in vain), according to the saying
of Ovid, Quae nimis apparent retia, vitat avis. The applicatio
similitudinis lying near, according to J. H. Michaelis, is missed even
by himself and by most others. If the poet wished to say that they
carried on their work of blood with such open boldness, that he must be
more than a simpleton who would allow himself to be caught by them, that
would be an unsuitable ground of warning; for would there not be equally
great need for warning against fellowship with them, if they had begun
their enticement with more cunning, and reckoned on greater success?
Hitzig, Ewald, Zckler, and others, therefore interpret חנם, not in the
sense of in vain, inasmuch as they do not let themselves be caught; but:
in vain, for they see not the net, but only the scattered corn. But
according to the preceding, הרשׁת (the net) leads us to think only
either of the net of the malicious designs, or the net of the alluring
deceptions. Thus, as Ziegler has noticed, the warned ought to make
application of the similitude to himself: Go not with them, for their
intention is bad; go not with them, for if the bird flees away from the
net which is spread out before it, thou wilt not surely be so blind as
suffer thyself to be ensnared by their gross enticements. בּעל כּנף: the
furnished with the wing (wings in [Ecc
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020).md); בּעל forms the idea of
property (lord).

[Proverbs 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 1:18</span></span>

The causal conj. כּי (for) in [Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md) and [Pro
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017.md) are coordinated; and there now
follows, introduced by the conj. ו ("and"), a third reason for the
warning:

And they lie in wait for their own blood,

They lay snares for their own lives.

The warning of [Pro 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md) is founded on
the immorality of the conduct of the enticer; that of [Pro
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017.md) on the audaciousness of the
seduction as such, and now on the self-destruction which the robber and
murderer bring upon themselves: they wish to murder others, but, as the
result shows, they only murder themselves. The expression is shaped
after [Pro 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011.md), as if it were: They
lay snares, as they themselves say, for the blood of others; but it is
in reality for their own blood: they certainly lie in wait, as they say;
but not, as they add, for the innocent, but for their own lives (Fl.).
Instead of לדמם, there might be used לדמיהם, after [Mic
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002.md); but לנפשׁם would signify ipsis
(post-biblical, לעצמם), while לנפשׁתם leaves unobliterated the idea of
the life: animis ipsorum; for if the O.T. language seeks to express ipse
in any other way than by the personal pronoun spoken emphatically, this
is done by the addition of נפשׁ ([Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011).md). המו was on this account
necessary, because [Pro 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017.md) has
another subject (cf. [Psa 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010).md).

[Proverbs 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 1:19</span></span>

An epiphonema:

Such is the lot of all who indulge in covetousness;

It takes away the life of its owner.

This language is formed after [Job
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013.md). Here, as there, in the word
ארחות, the ideas of action and issue, manner of life and its result, are
all combined. בּצע signifies properly that which is cut off, a piece,
fragment broken off, then that which one breaks off and takes to himself
- booty, gain, particularly unjust gain ([Pro
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016).md). בּצע בּצע is he who is greedy
or covetous. The subject to יקּח is בּצע, covetousness, πλεονεξία (see
[Isa 57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017).md). As Hoses, [Job
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#011.md), says of three other things that
they taken away לב, the understanding (νοῦς), so here we are taught
regarding unjust gain or covetousness, that it takes away נפשׁ, the life
(ψυχή) (לקח נפשׁ, to take away the life, [Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md); [Psa
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014).md). בּעליו denotes not the
possessor of unjust gain, but as an inward conception, like בעל אף, [Pro
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024.md), cf. [Pro
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#002.md); [Pro
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008.md); [Ecc
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md), him of whom covetousness is the
property. The sing. נפשׁ does not show that בּעליו is thought of as
sing.; cf. [Pro 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#023.md), Ps. 34:23; but
according to [Pro 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md); [Pro
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#022.md); [Ecc
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md), this is nevertheless probable,
although the usage without the suffix is always בּעל בּצע, and not בּעלי
(of plur. intens. בּעלים).

[Proverbs 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 1:20</span></span>

Looking to its form and vocalization, חכמות may be an Aramaizing
abstract formation (Gesen.; Ew. 165, c; Olsh. 219, b); for although the
forms אחות and גּלות are of a different origin, yet in רבּות and הוללות
such abstract formations lie before us. The termination ûth is here, by
the passing over of the u into the less obscure but more intensive o
(cf. יהו in the beginning and middle of the word, and יהוּ יהו at the
end of the word), raised to ôth, and thereby is brought near to the fem.
plur. (cf. חכמות, [Pro 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001.md),
sapientia, as our plur. of the neut. sapiens, חכמה), approaching to the
abstract. On the other hand, that חכמות is sing. of abstract
signification, is not decisively denoted by its being joined to the
plur. of the predicate (for תּרנּה here, as at [Pro
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#003.md), is scarcely plur.; and if ראמות,
[Pro 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#007.md), is plur., חכמות as the
numerical plur. may refer to the different sciences or departments of
knowledge); but perhaps by this, that it interchanges with תּבוּנות,
[Psa 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004.md), cf. [Pro
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#012.md); [Pro
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016.md), and that an abstract formation
from חכמה (fem. of חכם, חכם), which besides is not concrete, was
unnecessary. Still less is חכמות = חכמת a singular, which has it in view
to change חכמה into a proper name, for proof of which Hitzig refers to
תּהומות, [Psa 78:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#015.md); the singular
ending ôth without an abstract signification does not exist. After that
Dietrich, in his Abhandl. 1846, has shown that the origin of the plur.
proceeds not from separate calculation, but from comprehension,

(Note: In the Indo-Germanic languages the s of the plur. also probably
proceeds from the prep. sa (sam) = συν. See Schleicher, Compend. der
vergl. Gram. 247.)

and that particularly also names denoting intellectual strength are
frequently plur., which multiply the conception not externally but
internally, there is no longer any justifiable doubt that חכמות
signifies the all-comprehending, absolute, or, as Bttcher, 689,
expresses it, the full personal wisdom. Since such intensive plurals are
sometimes united with the plur. of the predicate, as e.g., the
monotheistically interpreted Elohim, [Gen
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#007) (see l.c..md), so תּרנּה may be
plur. On the other hand, the idea that it is a forma mixta of תּרן (from
רנן) and תּרנה ([Job 39:23](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#023).md) or תּרנּה,
the final sound in ah opposes. It may, however, be the emphatic form of
the 3rd fem. sing. of רנן; for, that the Hebr. has such an emphatic
form, corresponding to the Arab. taktubanna, is shown by these three
examples (keeping out of view the suspicion of a corruption of the text,
Olsh. p. 452), [Jdg 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#026.md); [Job
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016.md); [Isa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#003.md); cf. תּשׁלחנה, [Oba
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#013) (see Caspari, l.c..md), an example
of the 2nd masc. sing. of this formation. רנן (with רנה) is a word
imitative of sound (Schallwort), used to denote "a clear-sounding,
shrill voice (thence the Arab. rannan, of a speaker who has a clear,
piercing voice); then the clear shrill sound of a string or chord of a
bow, or the clear tinkle of the arrow in the quiver, and of the metal
that has been struck" (Fl.). The meaning of רחבות is covered by plateae
([Luk 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021).md), wide places; and חוּץ,
which elsewhere may mean that which is without, before the gates of the
city and courts, here means the "open air," in contradistinction to the
inside of the houses.

[Proverbs 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 1:21</span></span>

המיּות (plur. of הומי, the ground-form of הומה, from המי = המה), "they
who are making noise;" for the epithet is poetically used ([Isa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002).md) as a substantive, crowded noisy
streets or places. ראשׁ is the place from which on several sides streets
go forth: cf. ras el-ain, the place where the well breaks forth; ras
en-nahr, the place from which the stream divides itself; the sing. is
meant distributively as little as at [Pro
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002.md). פּתח, if distinguished from שׁער
(which also signifies cleft, breach), is the opening of the gate, the
entrance by the gate. Four times the poet says that Wisdom goes forth
preaching, and four times that she preaches publicly; the בּעיר used in
five places implies that Wisdom preaches not in the field, before the
few who there are met with, but in the city, which is full of people.

[Proverbs 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 1:22</span></span>

The poet has now reached that part of his introduction where he makes
use of the very words uttered by Wisdom:

How long, ye simple, will ye love simplicity,

And scorners delight in scorning,

And fools hate knowledge?

Three classes of men are here addressed: the פּתים, the simple, who,
being accessible to seduction, are only too susceptible of evil; the
לצים, mockers, i.e., free-thinkers (from לוּץ, Arab. luṣ, flectere,
torquere, properly qui verbis obliquis utitur); and the כּסילים, fools,
i.e., the mentally imbecile and stupid (from כּסל, Arab. kasal, to be
thick, coarse, indolent). The address to these passes immediately over
into a declaration regarding them; cf. the same enallage, [Pro
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027.md). עד־מתי has the accent Mahpach,
on account of the Pasek following; vid., Torath Emeth, p. 26.
Intentionally, Wisdom addresses only the פתים, to whom she expects to
find soonest access. Between the futt., which express the continuing
love and hatred, stands the perf. חמדוּ, which expresses that in which
the mockers found pleasure, that which was the object of their love. להם
is the so-called dat. ethicus, which reflexively refers to that which is
said to be the will and pleasure of the subject; as we say, "I am fond
of this and that." The form תּאהבוּ, Abulwald, Parchon, and Kimchi
regard as Piel; but תּאהבוּ instead of תּאהבוּ would be a recompensatio
of the virtual doubling, defacing the character of the Piel. Schultens
regards it as a defectively written Pail (in Syr.), but it is not proved
that this conjugation exists in Hebr.; much rather תּאהבוּ is the only
possible Kal form with תּאהבוּן without the pause, regularly formed from
תּאהבוּ (vid., Ewald, 193, a). The division by the accent Mercha-Mahpach
of the two words תאהבו פתי is equal in value to the connecting of them
by Makkeph; vid., Baer's Psalterium, p. x. In codd., and also in correct
texts, תאהבו is written with the accent Galgal on the first syllable, as
the servant of the Mercha-Mahpach. The Gaja is incorrectly here and
there placed under the תּ.

[Proverbs 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 1:23</span></span>

To the call to thoughtfulness which lies in the complaint "How long?"
there follows the entreaty:

Turn ye at my reproof!

Behold! I would pour out my Spirit upon you,

I would make you to know my words.

23a is not a clause expressive of a wish, which with the particle
expressive of a wish, which is wanting, would be תּשׁוּבוּ־נא, or
according to [Pro 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#001.md) and [Pro
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md) would be שׁוב תּשׁוּבוּ. The
הנּה, introducing the principal clause, stamps 23a as the conditional
clause; the relation of the expressions is as [Isa
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010.md); [Job
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md). תּשׁוּבוּ

(Note: In the Hagiographa everywhere written plene, with exception of
[Job 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010)..md)

is not equivalent to si convertamini, which would require תּפנוּ, but to
si revertamini; but לתוכהתּי

(Note: The Metheg belongs to the ת, under which it should be placed (and
not to the ל), as the commencing sound of the second syllable before the
tone-syllable; cf. [Pro 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#025)..md)

does not therefore mean at my reproof, i.e., in consequence of it
(Hitzig, after [Num 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#034).md), but it is
a constructio praegnans: turning and placing yourselves under my
reproof. With תוכחת there is supposed an ἔλεγχος (lxx, Symm.): bringing
proof, conviction, punishment. If they, leaving their hitherto
accustomed way, permit themselves to be warned against their wickedness,
then would Wisdom cause her words to flow forth to them, i.e., would
without reserve disclose and communicate to them her spirit, cause them
to know (namely by experience) her words. הבּיע (from נבע, R. נב; vid.,
Genesis, p. 635) is a common figurative word, expressive of the free
pouring forth of thoughts and words, for the mouth is conceived of as a
fountain (cf. [Pro 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#004.md) with [Mat
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034)), and the ῥῆσις (vid., lxx.md) as
ῥεῦσις; only here it has the Spirit as object, but parallel with דּברי,
thus the Spirit as the active power of the words, which, if the Spirit
expresses Himself in them, are πνεῦμα καὶ ζωή, [Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md). The addresses of Wisdom in the
Book of Proverbs touch closely upon the discourses of the Lord in the
Logos-Gospel. Wisdom appears here as the fountain of the words of
salvation for men; and these words of salvation are related to her, just
as the λόγοι to the divine λόγος expressing Himself therein.

[Proverbs 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 1:24</span></span>

The address of Wisdom now takes another course. Between [Pro
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023.md) and [Pro
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md) there is a pause, as between [Isa
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#020.md) and [Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md). In vain Wisdom expects that her
complaints and enticements will be heard. Therefore she turns her call
to repentance into a discourse announcing judgment.

24 Because I have called, and ye refused;

Stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;

25 And ye have rejected all my counsel

And to my reproof have not yielded:

26 Therefore will I also laugh at your calamity,

Will mock when your terror cometh;

27 When like a storm your terror cometh,

And your destruction swept on like a whirlwind;

When distress and anguish cometh upon you.

Commencing with יען (which, like מען, from ענה, to oppose, denotes the
intention, but more the fundamental reason or the cause than, as למען,
the motive or object), the clause, connected with גּם־אני, ego vicissim,
turns to the conclusion. As here יען קראתי (as the word of Jahve) are
connected by גּם־אני to the expression of the talio in [Isa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004.md), so also מאם, with its contrast
אבה, [Isa 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019.md). The construction
quoniam vocavi et renuistis for quoniam quum vocarem renuistis (cf. [Isa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md) is the common diffuse
(zerstreute) Semitic, the paratactic instead of the periodizing style.
The stretching out of the hand is, like the "spreading out" in [Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002.md), significant of striving to
beckon to the wandering, and to bring them near. Regarding הקשׁיב, viz.,
אזנו, to make the ear still (R. קש), arrigere, incorrectly explained by
Schultens, after the Arab ḳashab, polire, by aurem purgare, vid.,
Isaiah, p. 257, note.

[Pro 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#025.md)

פּרע is synonymous with נטשׁ, [Pro
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008.md); cf. [Pro
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#015.md) פּרעהוּ, turn from it. Gesenius
has inaccurately interpreted the phrase פרע ראש of the shaving off of
the hair, instead of the letting it fly loose. פרע means to loosen (= to
lift up, syn. החל), to release, to set free; it combines the meanings of
loosening and making empty, or at liberty, which is conveyed in Arab. by
fr' and frg. The latter means, intrans., to be set free, therefore to be
or to become free from occupation or business; with mn of an object, to
be free from it, i.e., to have accomplished it, to have done with it
(Fl.). Thus: since ye have dismissed (missum fecistis) all my counsel
(עצה as לדה, from יעץ, Arabic w'd), i.e., what I always would advise to
set you right. אבה combines in itself the meanings of consent, [Pro
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010.md), and compliance, [Pro
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#030) (with ל.md), and, as here, of
acceptance. The principal clause begins like an echo of [Psa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md) (cf. [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007).md).

[Pro 1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026.md)

שׂחק, as [Pro 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#025.md) shows, is not to
be understood with בּ; בּ is that of the state or time, not of the
object. Regarding איד, calamitas opprimens, obruens (from אוּד = Arabic
âda, to burden, to oppress), see at [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md). בא is related to יאתה as
arriving to approaching; פחדּכם is not that for which they are in terror
- for those who are addressed are in the condition of carnal security -
but that which, in the midst of this, will frighten and alarm them. The
Chethı̂b שאוה is pointed thus, שׁאוה (from שׁאו = שׁאה, as ראוה, זעוה
after the form אהבה, דּאבה); the Kerı̂ substitutes for this infinitive
name the usual particip. שׁאה (where then the Vav is יתיר,
"superfluous"), crashing (fem. of שׁאה), then a crash and an overthrow
with a crash; regarding its root-meaning (to be waste, and then to sound
hollow), see under [Psa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008.md). סוּפה
(from סוּף = ספה), sweeping forth as a (see [Pro
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025).md) whirlwind. The infinitive
construction of 27a is continued in 27b in the finite. "This syntactical
and logical attraction, by virtue of which a modus or tempus passes by ו
or by the mere parallel arrangement (as [Pro
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#002).md) from one to another, attracted
into the signification and nature of the latter, is peculiar to the
Hebr. If there follows a new clause or section of a clause where the
discourse takes, as it were, a new departure, that attraction ceases,
and the original form of expression is resumed; cf. 1:22, where after
the accent Athnach the future is returned to, as here in 27c the
infinitive construction is restored" (Fl.). The alliterating words צרה
וצוּקה, cf. [Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md); [Zep
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#015.md), are related to each other as
narrowness and distress (Hitzig); the Mashal is fond of the stave-rhyme.

(Note: Jul. Ley, in his work on the Metrical Forms of Hebrew Poetry,
1866, has taken too little notice of these frequently occurring
alliteration staves; Lagarde communicated to me (8th Sept. 1846) his
view of the stave-rhyme in the Book of Proverbs, with the remark, "Only
the Hebr. technical poetry is preserved to us in the O.T. records; but
in such traces as are found of the stave-rhyme, there are seen the
echoes of the poetry of the people, or notes passing over from it.")

[Proverbs 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 1:28</span></span>

Then - this sublime preacher in the streets continues - distress shall
teach them to pray:

28 Then shall they call on me, and I will not answer;

They shall early seek after me, and not find me;

29 Because that they hated knowledge,

And did not choose the fear of Jahve.

30 They have not yielded to my counsel,

Despised all my reproof:

31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way,

And satiate themselves with their own counsels.

In the full emphatic forms, יקראנני, they shall call on me, ישׁחרנני,
they shall seek me, and ימצאנני, they shall find me, the suffix ני may
be joined to the old plur. ending ûn (Gesenius, Olshausen, Bttcher); but
open forms like יברכנהוּ, He will bless him,יכבּדנני, He will honour me
(from יכבּדנּי), and the like, rather favour the conclusion that נ is
epenthetic (Ew. 250, b).

(Note: In the Codd. יקראנני is written; in this case the Metheg
indicates the tone syllable: vid., Torath Emeth, p. 7 note, p. 21 note;
and Accentssystem, ii. 1, note. In ישׁחרנני the Rebia is to be placed
over the ר. In the Silluk-word ימצאנני it appears undoubtedly that the
form is to be spoken as Milel, i.e., with tone on the penult.)

The address here takes the form of a declaration: Stultos nunc indignos
censet ulteriori alloquio (Mich.). It is that laughter and scorn, [Pro
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026.md), which here sounds forth from the
address of the Judge regarding the incorrigible. שׁחר is denom. of שׁחר,
to go out and to seek with the morning twilight, as also בּקּר, [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md), perhaps to appear early, and
usually (Arab.) bakar (I, II, IV), to rise early, to be zealous (Lane:
"He hastened to do or accomplish, or attain the thing needed"). Zckler,
with Hitzig, erroneously regards [Pro
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#029.md), [Pro
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#030.md) as the antecedent to [Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md). With ויאכלוּ, "and they shall
eat," the futt. announcing judgment are continued from [Pro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028.md); cf. [Deu
28:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#046.md). The conclusion after תּהת
כּי, "therefore because," or as usually expressed (except here and [Deu
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037.md), cf. [Gen
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025)), תּהת אשׁר (ἀνθ ̓ ὧν.md), is
otherwise characterized, [Deu 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#029.md);
[Ch2 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md); and besides, תהת אשׁר
stands after (e.g., [Sa1 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021.md); [Kg2
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#017.md); [Jer
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#019).md) oftener than before the
principal clause. בּחר combines in itself the meanings of eligere and
diligere (Fl.). The construction of אבה ל (to be inclining towards)
follows that of the analogous שׁמע ל (to hear). Each one eats of the
fruit of his way - good fruit of good ways ([Isa
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010).md), and evil fruit of evil ways.
"The מן, 31b, introduces the object from which, as a whole, that which
one eats, and with which he is satisfied, is taken as a part, or the
object from which, as from a fountain, satisfaction flows forth" (Fl.).
In correct texts, ויאכלוּ has the accent Dech, and at the same time
Munach as its servant. Regarding the laws of punctuation, according to
which וּממּעצתיהם (with Munach on the tone-syllable, Tarcha on the
antepenult, and Metheg before the Chateph-Pathach) is to be written, see
Baer's Torath Emeth, p. 11, Accentssystem, iv. 4. Norzi accents the word
incorrectly with Rebia Mugrash. With the exception of [Pro
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md), the pluralet

(Note: A plur. denoting unity in the circumstances, and a similarity in
the relations of time and space.)

מועצות has always the meaning of ungodly counsels.

[Proverbs 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 1:32</span></span>

The discourse is now summarily brought to a close:

32 For the perverseness of the simple slays them,

And the security of fools destroys them.

33 But whoever harkeneth to me dwells secure,

And is at rest from fear of evil.

Of the two interpretations of שׁוּב, a turning towards (with אל and the
like, conversion) or a turning away (with מאחרי or מעל, desertion), in
משׁוּבה the latter (as in the post-Bib. תּשׁוּבה, repentance, the
former) is expressed; apostasy from wisdom and from God are conjoined.
שׁלוה is here carnalis securitas; but the word may also denote the
external and the internal peace of the righteous, as שׁאנן, whence
שׁלאנן, [Job 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#023.md), as a superlative
is formed by the insertion of the ל of שׁלו, is taken in bonam et malam
partem. שׁאנן is, according to the Masora (also in [Jer
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md); [Jer
46:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#027.md); [Jer
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011).md), 3rd perf. Pilel (Ewald, 120,
a), from the unused שׁאן, to be quiet: he has attained to full
quietness, and enjoys such. The construction with מן follows the analogy
of הניח מן (to give rest from), שׁקט מן (to rest from), and the like.
The negative interpretation of מן, sine ullo pavore mali (Schultens,
Ewald), is unnecessary; also [Job 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009.md)
may be explained by "peace from terror," especially since שׁלום is
derived from the root של, extrahere. פּחד רעה, "fear of evil," one may
perhaps distinguish from פחד רע as the genitive of combination.
