### [Job Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001.md)

1 Then Job began, and said:

2 How has thou helped him that is without power,

Raised the arm that hath no strength!

3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom,

And fully declared the essence of the matter!

4 To whom hast thou uttered words,

And whose breath proceeded from thee?

Bildad is the person addressed, and the exclamations in [Job
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#002.md), [Job
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#003.md) are ironical: how thy speech
contains nothing whatever that might help me, the supposedly feeble one,
in conquering my affliction and my temptation; me, the supposedly
ignorant one, in comprehending man's mysterious lot, and mine! ללא־כח,
according to the idea, is only equivalent to כח לו (אין) לאשׁר לא, and
זרוע לא־עז equivalent to זרוע בלא־עז (לא עז לו); the former is the
abstr. pro concreto, the latter the genitival connection - the arm of
the no-power, i.e., powerless (Ges. 152, 1). The powerless one is Job
himself, not God (Merc., Schlottm.), as even the choice of the verbs,
[Job 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#002.md), [Job
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#003.md), shows. Respecting תּוּשׁיּה,
which we have translated essentiality, duration, completion, we said, on
[Job 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#012.md), that it is formed from ישׁ
(vid., [Pro 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#021).md), not directly
indeed, but by means of a verb ושׁי brev a fo (ושׁה), in the
signification subsistere (comp. Arab. kân, and Syriac קום);

(Note: Comp. also Spiegel, Grammatik der Huzvresch-Sprache, S. 103.)

it is a Hophal-formation (like תּוּגה), and signifies, so to speak,
durability, subsistentia, substantia, ὑπόστασις, so that the comparison
of ושׁי with אשׁשׁ, Arab. 'ss (whence אשׁישׁ, Arab. ası̂s, asâs, etc.,
fundamentum) is forced upon one, and the relationship to the Sanskrit as
(asmi = εἰμὶ) can remain undecided. The observation of J. D. Michaelis

(Note: Against the comparison of the Arab. wâsâ, solari, by Michaelis,
Ges., and others (who assume the primary significations solatium,
auxilium), Lagarde (Anmerkungen zur griech. Uebersetzung der Proverbien,
1863, S. 57f.) correctly remarks that Arab. wâsâ, is only a change of
letters of the common language for Arab. âsâ; but Arab. wâšâ, to finish
painting (whence Arab. twšyt, decoration), or ושׁה as a transposition
from שׁוה, to be level, simple (Hitzig on [Pro
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021)), leads to no suitable sense..md)

to the contrary, Supplem. p. 1167: non placent in linguis ejusmodi etyma
metaphysica nimis a vulgari sensu remota; philosophi in scholis ejusmodi
vocabula condunt, non plebs, is removed by the consideration that
תושׁיה, which out of Prov. and Job occurs only in [Isa
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029.md), Mich. [Job
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#009.md), is a Chokma-word: it signifies
here, as frequently, vera et realis sapientia (J. H. Michaelis). The
speech of Bildad is a proof of poverty of thought, of which he himself
gives the evidence. His words - such is the thought of [Job
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#004.md) - are altogether inappropriate,
inasmuch as they have no reference whatever to the chief point of Job's
speech; and they are, moreover, not his own, but the suggestion of
another, and that not God, but Eliphaz, from whom Bildad has borrowed
the substance of his brief declamation. Since this is the meaning of
[Job 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#004.md), it might seem as though
את־מי were intended to signify by whose assistance (Arnh., Hahn); but as
the poet also, in [Job 31:37](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#037.md), comp.
[Eze 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#010.md), uses הגּיד seq. acc., in
the sense of explaining anything to any one, to instruct him concerning
anything, it is to be interpreted: to whom hast thou divulged the words
(lxx, τίνι ἀνήγγειλας ῥήματα), i.e., thinking and designing thereby to
affect him?

In what follows, Job now continues the description of God's exalted
rule, which Bildad had attempted, by tracing it through every department
of creation; and thus proves by fact, that he is wanting neither in a
recognition nor reverence of God the almighty Ruler.

[Job 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 26:5</span></span>

5 - The shades are put to pain

Deep under the waters and their inhabitants.

6 Shel is naked before him,

And the abyss hath no covering.

7 He stretched the northern sky over the emptiness;

He hung the earth upon nothing.

Bildad has extolled God's majestic, awe-inspiring rule in the heights of
heaven, His immediate surrounding; Job continues the strain, and
celebrates the extension of this rule, even to the depths of the lower
world. The operation of the majesty of the heavenly Ruler extends even
to the realm of shades; the sea with the multitude of its inhabitants
forms no barrier between God and the realm of shades; the marrowless,
bloodless phantoms or shades below writhe like a woman in travail as
often as this majesty is felt by them, as, perhaps, by the raging of the
sea or the quaking of the earth. On רפאים, which also occurs in
Phoenician inscriptions, vid., Psychol. S. 409; the book of Job
corresponds with [Psa 88:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md) in the use
of this appellation. The sing. is not רפאי (whence רפאים, as the name of
a people), but רפא (רפה), which signifies both giants or heroes of
colossal stature (from רפה = Arab. rafu‛a, to be high), and the relaxed
(from רפה, to be loose, like Arab. rafa'a, to soften, to soothe), i.e.,
those who are bodiless in the state after death (comp. חלּה, [Isa
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#010.md), to be weakened, i.e., placed in
the condition of a rapha). It is a question whether יחוללוּ be Pilel
(Ges.) or Pulal (Olsh.); the Pul., indeed, signifies elsewhere to be
brought forth with writing ([Job
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007).md); it can, however, just as well
signify to be put in pain. On account of the reference implied in it to
a higher causation here at the commencement of the speech, the Pul. is
more appropriate than the Pil.; and the pausal , which is often found
elsewhere with Hithpael (Hithpal.), [Psa
88:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#014.md); [Job
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#005), but never with Piel (Pil..md),
proves that the form is intended to be regarded as passive.

[Job 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006.md)

שׁאול is seemingly used as fem., as in [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md); but in reality the adj. precedes
in the primitive form, without being changed by the gender of שׁאול.
אבדּון alternates with שׁאול, like קבר in [Psa
88:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#012.md). As [Psa
139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008.md) testifies to the presence of God
in Shel, so here Job (comp. [Job
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017.md), and especially [Pro
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011).md) that Shel is present to God,
that He possesses a knowledge which extends into the depths of the realm
of the dead, before whom all things are γυμνὰ καὶ τετραχηλισμένα ([Heb
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013).md). The following partt., [Job
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md), depending logically upon the
chief subject which precedes, are to be determined according to [Job
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002.md); they are conceived as present,
and indeed of God's primeval act of creation, but intended of the acts
which continue by virtue of His creative power.

[Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md)

By צפון many modern expositors understand the northern part of the
earth, where the highest mountains and rocks rise aloft (accordingly, in
[Isa 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013.md), ירכתי צפון are mentioned
parallel with the starry heights), and consequently the earth is the
heaviest (Hirz., Ew., Hlgst., Welte, Schlottm., and others). But (1) it
is not probable that the poet would first have mentioned the northern
part of the earth, and then in [Job
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md) the earth itself - first the
part, and then the whole; (2) נטה is never said of the earth, always of
the heavens, for the expansion of which it is the stereotype word (נטה,
[Job 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008.md); [Isa
40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022.md); [Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024.md); [Isa
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013.md); [Zac
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md); [Psa
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002.md); נוטיהם, [Isa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005.md); נטה, [Jer
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012.md); [Jer
51:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#015.md); ידי נטו, [Isa
45:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#012)); (3.md) one expects some mention
of the sky in connection with the mention of the earth; and thus is
צפון,

(Note: The name צפון signifies the northern sky as it appears by day,
from its beclouded side in contrast with the brighter and more rainless
south; comp. old Persian apâkhtara, if this name of the north really
denotes the "starless" region, Greek ζόφος, the north-west, from the
root skap, σκεπᾶν, σκεπανός (Curtius, Griech. Etymologie, ii. 274),
aquilo, the north wind, as that which brings black clouds with it.)

with Rosenm., Ges., Umbr., Vaih., Hahn, and Olsh., to be understood of
the northern sky, which is prominently mentioned, because there is the
pole of the vault of heaven, which is marked by the Pole-star, there the
constellation of the greater Bear (עשׁ, [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009).md) formed by the seven bright stars,
there (in the back of the bull, one of the northern constellations of
the ecliptic) the group of the Pleiades (כּימה), there also, below the
bull and the twins, Orion (כּסיל). On the derivation, notion, and
synonyms of תּהוּ, vid., Genesis, S. 93; here (where it may be compared
with the Arab. theı̂j-un, empty, and tı̂h, desert) it signifies nothing
more than the unmeasurable vacuum of space, parall. בּלימה, not anything
= nothing (comp. modern Arabic lâsh, or even mâsh, compounded of Arab.
lâ or mâ and šâ, a thing, e.g., bilâs, for nothing, ragul mâsh, useless
men). The sky which vaults the earth from the arctic pole, and the earth
itself, hang free without support in space. That which is elsewhere
(e.g., [Job 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006).md) said of the pillars
and foundations of the earth, is intended of the internal support of the
body of the earth, which is, as it were, fastened together by the
mountains, with their roots extending into the innermost part of the
earth; for the idea that the earth rests upon the bases of the mountains
would be, indeed, as Lwenthal correctly observes, an absurd inversion.
On the other side, we are also not justified in inferring from Job's
expression the laws of the mechanism of the heavens, which were unknown
to the ancients, especially the law of attraction or gravitation. The
knowledge of nature on the part of the Israelitish Chokma, expressed in
[Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md), however, remains still
worthy of respect. On the ground of similar passages of the book of Job,
Keppler says of the yet unsolved problems of astronomy: Haec et cetera
hujusmodi latent in Pandectis aevi sequentis, non antea discenda, quam
librum hunc Deus arbiter seculorum recluserit mortalibus. From the
starry heavens and the earth Job turns to the celestial and
sub-celestial waters.

[Job 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 26:8</span></span>

8 He bindeth up the waters in His clouds,

Without the clouds being rent under their burden.

9 He enshroudeth the face of His throne,

Spreading His clouds upon it.

10 He compasseth the face of the waters with bounds,

To the boundary between light and darkness.

The clouds consist of masses of water rolled together, which, if they
were suddenly set free, would deluge the ground; but the omnipotence of
God holds the waters together in the hollow of the clouds (צרר, Milel,
according to a recognised law, although it is also found in Codd.
accented as Milra, but contrary to the Masora), so that they do not
burst asunder under the burden of the waters (תּחתּם); by which nothing
more nor less is meant, than that the physical and meteorological laws
of rain are of God's appointment. [Job
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#009.md) describes the dark and
thickly-clouded sky that showers down the rain in the appointed rainy
season. אחז signifies to take hold of, in architecture to hold together
by means of beams, or to fasten together (vid., Thenius on [Kg1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#010.md), comp. [Ch2
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#018), מאחזים, coagmentata.md), then also,
as usually in Chald. and Syr., to shut (by means of cross-bars, [Neh
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#003).md), here to shut off by surrounding
with clouds: He shuts off פּני־כסּה, the front of God's throne, which is
turned towards the earth, so that it is hidden by storm-clouds as by a
סכּה, [Job 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029.md); [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md). God's throne, which is here, as
in [Kg1 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#019.md), written כּסּה instead
of כּסּא (comp. Arab. cursi, of the throne of God the Judge, in
distinction from Arab. 'l-‛arš, the throne of God who rules over the
world),

(Note: According to the more recent interpretation, under Aristotelian
influence, Arab. 'l-‛rš is the outermost sphere, which God as πρῶτον
κινοῦν having set in motion, communicates light, heat, life, and motion
to the other revolving spheres; for the causae mediae gradually descend
from God the Author of being (muhejji) from the highest heaven into the
sublunary world.)

is indeed in other respects invisible, but the cloudless blue of heaven
is His reflected splendour ([Exo
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010).md) which is cast over the earth.
God veils this His radiance which shines forth towards the earth, פּרשׁז
אליו עננו, by spreading over it the clouds which are led forth by Him.
פּרשׁו is commonly regarded as a Chaldaism for פּרשׁז (Ges. 56, Olsh.
276), but without any similar instance in favour of this vocalizaton of
the 3 pr. Piel (Pil.). Although רענן and שׁאנן, [Job
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032.md); [Job
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#018.md), have given up the i of the Pil.,
it has been under the influence of the following guttural; and although,
moreover, i before Resh sometimes passes into a, e.g., ויּרא, it is more
reliable to regard פרשז as inf. absol. (Ew. 141, c): expandendo. Ges.
and others regard this פרשז as a mixed form, composed from פרשׁ and פרז;
but the verb פרשׁ (with Shin) has not the signification to expand, which
is assumed in connection with this derivation; it signifies to separate
(also [Eze 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md), vid., Hitzig on that
passage), whereas פרשׂ certainly signifies to expand ([Job
36:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029).md); wherefore the reading
פּרשׂז (with Sin), which some Codd. give, is preferred by Br, and in
agreement with him by Luzzatto (vid., Br's Leket zebi, p. 244), and it
seems to underlie the interpretation where פרשז עליו is translated by
עליו (פּרשׂ) פרש, He spreadeth over it (e.g., by Aben-Ezra, Kimchi,
Ralbag). But the Talmud, b. Sabbath, 88 b (פירש שדי מזיו שכינתו ועננו
עליו, the Almighty separated part of the splendour of His Shechina and
His cloud, and laid it upon him, i.e., Moses, as the passage is applied
in the Haggada), follows the reading פּרשׁז (with Shin), which is to be
retained on account of the want of naturalness in the consonantal
combination שׂז; but the word is not to be regarded as a mixed formation
(although we do not deny the possibility of such forms in themselves,
vid., supra, p. 468), but as an intensive form of פרשׂ formed by
Prosthesis and an Arabic change of Sin into Shin, like Arab. fršḥ, fršd,
fršṭ, which, being formed from Arab. frš = פּרשׂ (פּרשׂ), to expand,
signifies to spread out (the legs).

[Job 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#010.md) passes from the waters
above to the lower waters. תּכלית signifies, as in [Job
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md); [Job
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003.md); [Neh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#021.md), the extremity, the extreme
boundary; and the connection of תּכלית אור is genitival, as the Tarcha
by the first word correctly indicates, whereas אור with Munach, the
substitute for Rebia mugrasch In this instance (according to Psalter,
ii. 503, 2), is a mistake. God has marked out (חן, lxx ἐγύρωσεν) a law,
i.e., here according to the sense: a fixed bound (comp. [Pro
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#029.md) with [Psa
104:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#009).md), over the surface of the waters
(i.e., describing a circle over them which defines their circuit) unto
the extreme point of light by darkness, i.e., where the light is touched
by the darkness. Most expositors (Rosenm., Hirz., Hahn, Schlottm., and
others) take עד־תכלית adverbially: most accurately, and refer חג to אור
as a second object, which is contrary to the usage of the language, and
doubtful and unnecessary. Pareau has correctly interpreted: ad lucis
usque tenebrarumque confinia; עם in the local sense, not aeque ac,
although it might also have this meaning, as e.g., [Ecc
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md). The idea is, that God has
appointed a fixed limit to the waters, as far as to the point at which
they wash the terra firma of the extreme horizon, and where the boundary
line of the realms of light and darkness is; and the basis of the
expression, as Bouillier, by reference to Virgil's Georg. i. 240f., has
shown, is the conception of the ancients, that the earth is surrounded
by the ocean, on the other side of which the region of darkness begins.

[Job 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 26:11</span></span>

11 The pillars of heaven tremble

And are astonished at His threatening.

12 By His power He rouseth up the sea,

And by His understanding He breaketh Rahab in pieces.

13 By His breath the heavens become cheerful;

His hand hath formed the fugitive dragon.

The mountains towering up to the sky, which seem to support the vault of
the sky, are called poetically "the pillars of heaven." ירופפוּ is
Pulal, like יחוללוּ, [Job 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005.md); the
signification of violent and quick motion backwards and forwards is
secured to the verb רוּף by the Targ. אתרופף = התפּלּץ, [Job
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006.md), and the Talm. רפרף of churned
milk, blinding eyes (comp. הרף עין, the twinkling of the eye, and Arab.
rff, fut. i. o. nictare), flapping wings (comp. Arab. rff and rfrf,
movere, motitare alas), of wavering thinking. גּערה is the divine
command which looses or binds the powers of nature; the astonishment of
the supports of heaven is, according to the radical signification of
תּמהּ (cogn. שׁמם), to be conceived of as a torpidity which follows the
divine impulse, without offering any resistance whatever. That רגע, [Job
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#012.md), is to be understood
transitively, not like [Job 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#005.md),
intransitively, is proved by the dependent (borrowed) passages, [Isa
51:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#015.md); [Jer
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035.md), from which it is also evident
that רגע cannot with the lxx be translated κατέπαυσεν. The verb combines
in itself the opposite significations of starting up, i.e., entering
into an excited state, and of being startled, from which the
significations of stilling (Niph., Hiph.), and of standing back or
retreat (Arab. rj‛), branch off. The conjecture גּער after the Syriac
version (which translates, go‛ar bejamo) is superfluous. רהב, which here
also is translated by the lxx τὸ κῆτος, has been discussed already on
[Job 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013.md). It is not meant of the
turbulence of the sea, to which מחץ is not appropriate, but of a sea
monster, which, like the crocodile and the dragon, are become an emblem
of Pharaoh and his power, as [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md). has applied this primary
passage: the writer of the book of Job purposely abstains from such
references to the history of Israel. Without doubt, רהב denotes a
demoniacal monster, like the demons that shall be destroyed at the end
of the world, one of which is called by the Persians akomano, evil
thought, another taromaiti, pride. This view is supported by [Job
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md), where one is not at liberty to
determine the meaning by [Isa 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md),
and to understand נחשׁ בּרח, like תּנּין in that passage, of Egypt. But
this dependent passage is an important indication for the correct
rendering of חללה. One thing is certain at the outset, that שׁפרה is not
perf. Piel = שׁפרה, and for this reason, that the Dagesh which
characterizes Piel cannot be omitted from any of the six mutae; the
translation of Jerome, spiritus ejus ornavit coelos, and all similar
ones, are therefore false. But it is possible to translate: "by His
spirit (creative spirit) the heavens are beauty, His hand has formed the
flying dragon." Thus, in the signification to bring forth (as [Pro
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023.md); [Pro
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#024)..md), חללה is rendered by Rosenm.,
Arnh., Vaih., Welte, Renan, and others, of whom Vaih. and Renan,
however, do not understand [Job 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md)
of the creation of the heavens, but of their illumination. By this
rendering [Job 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md) and [Job
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md) are severed, as being without
connection; in general, however, the course of thought in the
description does not favour the reference of the whole of half of [Job
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md) to the creation. Accordingly,
חללה is not to be taken as Pilel from חול (ליל), but after [Isa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009.md), as Poel from חלל, according to
which the idea of [Job 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md) is
determined, since both lines of the verse are most closely connected.

(בּריח) נחשׁ בּרח is, to wit, the constellation of the Dragon,

(Note: Ralbag, without any ground for it, understands it of the milky
way (העגול החלבי), which, according to Rapoport, Pref. to Slonimski's
Toledoth ha-schamajim (1838), was already known to the Talmud b.
Berachoth, 58 b, under the name of נהר דנוד.)

one of the most straggling constellations, which winds itself between
the Greater and Lesser Bears almost half through the polar circle.

"Maximus hic plexu sinuoso elabitur Anguis

Circum perque duas in morem fluminis Arctos."

(Virgil, Georg. i. 244f.)

Aratus in Cicero, de nat. Deorum, ii. 42, describes it more graphically,
both in general, and in regard to the many stars of different magnitudes
which form its body from head to tail. Among the Arabs it is called
el-hajje, the serpent, e.g., in Firuzabdi: the hajje is a constellation
between the Lesser Bear (farqadân, the two calves) and the Greater Bear
(benât en-na‛sch, the daughters of the bier), "or et-tanı̂n, the dragon,
e.g., in one of the authors quoted by Hyde on Ulugh Beigh's Tables of
the Stars, p. 18: the tann lies round about the north pole in the form
of a long serpent, with many bends and windings." Thus far the testimony
of the old expositors is found in Rosenmller. The Hebrew name תּלי (the
quiver) is perhaps to be distinguished from טלי and דּלי, the Zodiac
constellations Aries and Aquarius.

(Note: Vid., Wissenschaft, Kunst, Judenthum (1838), S. 220f.)

It is questionable how בּרח is to be understood. The lxx translates
δράκοντα ἀποστάτην in this passage, which is certainly incorrect, since
בריח beside נחשׁ may naturally be assumed to be an attributive word
referring to the motion or form of the serpent. Accordingly, [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md), ὄφιν φείγοντα is more correct,
where the Syr. version is חויא חרמנא, the fierce serpent, which is
devoid of support in the language; in the passage before us the Syr.
also has חויא דערק, the fleeing serpent, but this translation does not
satisfy the more neuter signification of the adjective. Aquila in Isaiah
translates ὄφιν μόχλον, as Jerome translates the same passage serpentem
vectem (whereas he translates coluber tortuosus in our passage), as
though it were בּריח; Symm. is better, and without doubt a substantially
similar thought, ὄφιν συγκλείοντα, the serpent that joins by a bolt,
which agrees with the traditional Jewish explanation, for the dragon in
Aben-Ezra and Kimchi (in Lex.) - after the example of the learned
Babylonian teacher of astronomy, Mar-Samuel (died 257), who says of
himself that the paths of the heavens are as familiar to him as the
places of Nehardea

(Note: Vid., Grtz, Geschichte der Juden, iv. 324. On [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md) Kimchi interprets the מבריח
differently: he scares (pushes away).)

\- is called נחשׁ עקלתון, because it is as though it were wounded, and
בריח, because it forms a bar (מבריח) from one end of the sky to the
other; or as Sabbatai Donolo (about 94), the Italian astronomer,

(Note: Vid., extracts from his המזלות ספר in Joseph Kara's Comm. on Job,
contributed by S. D. Luzzatto in Kerem Chemed, 7th year, S. 57ff.)

expresses it: "When God created the two lights (the sun and moon) and
the five stars (planets) and the twelve מזלור (the constellations of the
Zodiac), He also created the תלי (dragon), to unite these heavenly
bodies as by a weaver's beam (מנור אורגים), and made it stretch itself
on the firmament from one end to another as a bar (כבריח), like a
wounded serpent furnished with the head and tail." By this explanation
בּריח is either taken directly as בּריח, vectis, in which signification
it does not, however, occur elsewhere, or the signification transversus
(transversarius) is assigned to the בּריח (= barrı̂ah) with an
unchangeable Kametz, - a signification which it might have, for brch
Arab. brḥ signifies properly to go through, to go slanting across, of
which the meanings to unite slanting and to slip away are only
variations. בּריח, notwithstanding, has in the language, so far as it is
preserved to us, everywhere the signification fugitivus, and we will
also keep to this: the dragon in the heavens is so called, as having the
appearance of fleeing and hastening away. But in what sense is it said
of God, that He pierces or slays it? In [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md), where the תנין is the emblem of
Egypt (Pharaoh), and [Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md), where
נחשׁ בריח is the emblem of Assyria, the empire of the Tigris, the idea
of destruction by the sword of Jehovah is clear. The present passage is
to be explained according to [Job 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008.md),
where לויתן is only another name for נחש בריח (comp. [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md). It is the dragon in the heavens
which produces the eclipse of the sun, by winding itself round about the
sun; and God must continually wound it anew, and thus weaken it, if the
sun is to be set free again. That it is God who disperses the clouds of
heaven by the breath of His spirit, the representative of which in the
elements is the wind, so that the azure becomes visible again; and that
it is He who causes the darkening of the sun to cease, so that the earth
can again rejoice in the full brightness of that great light, - these
two contemplations of the almighty working of God in nature are so
expressed by the poet, that he clothes the second in the mythological
garb of the popular conception.

In the closing words which now follow, Job concludes his illustrative
description: it must indeed, notwithstanding, come infinitely short of
the reality.

[Job 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 26:14</span></span>

14 Behold, these are the edges of His ways,

And how do we hear only a whisper thereof!

But the thunder of His might - who comprehendeth it?

These (אלּה retrospective, as in [Job
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#021).md) are only קצות, the extremest
end-points or outlines of the ways of God, which Job has depicted; the
wondrous fulness of His might, which extends through the whole creation,
transcends human comprehension; it is only שׁמץ דּבר therefrom that
becomes audible to us men. שׁמץ (שׁמץ) is translated by Symm. here
ψιθύρισμα, [Job 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#012.md), ψιτηυρισμός; the
Arab. šamiṣa (to speak very quickly, mutter) confirms this idea of the
word; Jerome's translation, vix. parvam stillam sermonis ejus (comp.
[Job 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#012), venas, tropical for parts.md),
is doubly erroneous: the rendering of the שׁמץ has the antithesis of רעם
against it, and דּבר is not to be understood here otherwise than in ערות
דּבר, [Deu 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md); [Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md) : shame of something = something
that excites a feeling of shame, a whisper of something = some whisper.
The notion "somewhat," which the old expositors attribute to שׁמץ, lies
therefore in דבר. מה is exclamatory in a similar manner as in [Psa
89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048) : how we hear (נשׁמע, not נשׁמע.md)
only some whisper thereof (בּו partitive, as e.g., [Isa
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022).md), i.e., how little therefrom is
audible to us, only as the murmur of a word, not loud and distinct,
which reaches us!

As in the speech of Bildad the poet makes the opposition of the friends
to fade away and cease altogether, as incapable of any further counsel,
and hence as conquered, so in Job's closing speech, which consists of
three parts, [Job 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001.md), [Job
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001.md), [Job
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#001.md), he shows how Job in every
respect, as victor, maintains the field against the friends. The friends
have neither been able to loose the knot of Job's lot of suffering, nor
the universal distribution of prosperity and misfortune. Instead of
loosing the knot of Job's lot of suffering, they have cut it, by adding
to Job's heavy affliction the invention of heinous guilt as its ground
of explanation; and the knot of the contradictions of human life in
general with divine justice they have ignored, in order that they may
not be compelled to abandon their dogma, that suffering everywhere
necessarily presupposes sin, and sin is everywhere necessarily followed
by suffering. Even Job, indeed, is not at present able to solve either
one or other of the mysteries; but while the friends' treatment of these
mysteries is untrue, he honours the truth, and keenly perceives that
which is mysterious. Then he proves by testimony and an appeal to facts,
that the mystery may be acknowledged without therefore being compelled
to abandon the fear of God. Job firmly holds to the objective reality
and the testimony of his consciousness; in the fear of God he places
himself above all those contradictions which are unsolvable by and
perplexing to human reason; his faith triumphs over the rationalism of
the friends, which is devoid of truth, of justice, and of love.

Job first answers Bildad, [Job 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001.md).
He characterizes his poor reply as what it is: as useless, and not
pertinent in regard to the questions before them: it is of no service to
him, it does not affect him, and is, moreover, a borrowed weapon. For he
also is conscious of and can praise God's exalted and awe-inspiring
majesty. He has already shown this twice, [Job
9:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004.md); [Job
12:13-25](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#013.md), and shows here for the third
time: its operation is not confined merely to those creatures that
immediately surround God in the heavens; it extends, without being
restrained by the sea, even down to the lower world; and as it makes the
angels above to tremble, so there it sets the shades in consternation.
From the lower world, Job's contemplation rises to the earth, as a body
suspended in space without support; to the clouds above, which contain
the upper waters without bursting, and veil the divine throne, of which
the sapphire blue of heaven is the reflection; and then he speaks of the
sea lying between Shel and heaven, which is confined within fixed
bounds, at the extreme boundaries of which light passes over into
darkness; - he celebrates all this as proof of the creative might of
God. Then he describes the sovereign power of God in the realm of His
creation, how He shakes the pillars of heaven, rouses the sea, breaks
the monster in pieces, lights up the heavens by chasing away the clouds
and piercing the serpent, and thus setting free the sun. But all these -
thus he closes - are only meagre outlines of the divine rule, only a
faint whisper, which is heard by us as coming from the far distance. Who
has the comprehension necessary to take in and speak exhaustively of all
the wonders of His infinite nature, which extends throughout the whole
creation? From such a profound recognition and so glorious a description
of the exaltation of God, the infinite distance between God and man is
most clearly proved. Job has adequately shown that his whole soul is
full of that which Bildad is anxious to teach him; a soul that only
requires a slight impulse to make it overflow with such praise of God,
as is not wanting in an universal perception of God, nor is it full of
wicked devices. When therefore Bildad maintains against Job that no man
is righteous before such an exalted God, Job ought indeed to take it as
a warning against such unbecoming utterances concerning God as those
which have escaped him; but the universal sinfulness of man is no ground
of explanation for his sufferings, for there is a righteousness which
avails before God; and of this, job, the suffering servant of God, has a
consciousness that cannot be shaken.
