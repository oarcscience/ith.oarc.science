Cry of a Persecuted One for Help

This short Psalm, placed after Ps 69 on account of the kindred nature of
its contents (cf. more especially v. 6 with [Psa
69:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#030).md), is, with but few deviations, a
repetition of [Psa 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md). This portion
of the second half of Ps 40 is detached from it and converted into the
Elohimic style. Concerning להזכּיר, at the presentation of the memorial
portion of the mincha, vid., [Psa
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md). It is obvious that David himself
is not the author of the Psalm in this stunted form. The לדוד is
moreover justified, if he composed the original Psalm which is here
modified and appropriated to a special liturgical use.

[Psalms 70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 70:1</span></span>

We see at once at the very beginning, in the omission of the רצה ([Psa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014).md), that what we have here before
us is a fragment of Ps 40, and perhaps a fragment that only accidentally
came to have an independent existence. The להצּילני, which was under the
government of רצה, now belongs to הוּשׁה, and the construction is
without example elsewhere. In [Psa
70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003.md) (= [Psa
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015).md) יחד and לספּותהּ are given up
entirely; the original is more full-toned and soaring. Instead of
ישׁמּוּ, torpescant, [Psa 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004.md) has
ישׁוּבוּ, recedant (as in Ps 6:11, cf. [Psa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018).md), which is all the more flat for
coming after יסגו אחור. In [Psa 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004.md),
after ויאמרים the לי, which cannot here (cf. on the contrary, [Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021).md) be dispensed with, is wanting.

[Psalms 70:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 70:4</span></span>

ויאמרו instead of יאמרו is unimportant. But since the divine name Jahve
is now for once chosen side by side with Elohim, it certainly had a
strong claim to be retained in [Psa
70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005.md). Instead of תּשׁועתך we have
ישׁועתך here; instead of עזרתי, here עזרי. And instead of אדני יחשׁב לי
we have here אלהים חוּשׁה־לּי - the hope is turned into petition: make
haste unto me, is an innovation in expression that is caused by the
taking over of the לי.
