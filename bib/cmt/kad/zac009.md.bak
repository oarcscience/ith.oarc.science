III\. Future of the World-Powers, and of the Kingdom of God - Zechariah
9-14

The two longer prophecies, which fill up the last part of our book (ch.
9-11 and 12-14), show by their headings, as well as by their contents,
and even by their formal arrangement, that they are two corresponding
portions of a greater whole. In the headings, the fact that they have
both the common character of a threatening prophecy or proclamation of
judgment, is indicated by the application of the same epithet, Massâ'
debhar Yehōvâh (burden of the word of Jehovah), whilst the objects,
"land of Hadrach" ([Zac 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001).md) and
"Israel' ([Zac 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001).md), point to a
contrast, or rather to a conflict between the lands of Hadrach and
Israel. This contrast or conflict extends through the contents of both.
All the six chapters treat of the war between the heathen world and
Israel, though in different ways. In the first oracle (ch. 9-11), the
judgment, through which the power of the heathen world over Israel is
destroyed and Israel is endowed with strength to overcome all its
enemies, forms the fundamental thought and centre of gravity of the
prophetic description. In the second (ch. 12-14), the judgment through
which Israel, or Jerusalem and Judah, is sifted in the war with the
heathen nations, and translated into the holy nation of the Lord by the
extermination of its spurious members, is the leading topic. And lastly,
in a formal respect the two oracles resemble one another, in the fact
that in the centre of each the announcement suddenly takes a different
tone, without any external preparation ([Zac
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001.md) and [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).md), so that it is apparently the
commencement of a new prophecy; and it is only by a deeper research into
the actual fact, that the connection between the two is brought out, and
the relation between the two clearly seen, - namely, that the second
section contains a more minute description of the manner in which the
events announced in the first section are to be realized. In the
threatening word concerning the land of Hadrach, ch. 9 and [Zac
10:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md) form the first section, ch. 11
the second; in that concerning Israel, the first section extends from
[Zac 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) to [Zac
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#006.md), and the second from [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md) to the end of the book.

Fall of the Heathen World, and Deliverance and Glorification of Zion -
Zechariah 9 and [Zac 10:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md)

Whilst the judgment falls upon the land of Hadrach, upon Damascus and
Hamath, and upon Phoenicia and Philistia, so that these kingdoms are
overthrown and the cities laid waste and the remnant of their
inhabitants incorporated into the nation of God ([Zac
9:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001).md), Jehovah will protect His
people, and cause His King to enter Zion, who will establish a kingdom
of peace over the whole earth ([Zac
9:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008).md). Those members of the covenant
nation who are still in captivity are redeemed, and endowed with victory
over the sons of Javan ([Zac 9:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011).md),
and richly blessed by the Lord their God to overcome all enemies in His
strength ([Zac 10:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001).md). The unity of
the two chapters, which form the first half of this oracle, is evident
from the close substantial connection between the separate sections. The
transitions from one complex of thought to the other are so vanishing,
that it is a matter of dispute, in the case of [Zac
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md), [Zac
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002.md), for example, whether these
verses should be connected with ch. 9, or retained in connection with
[Zac 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004.md).

[Zechariah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 9:1</span></span>

Judgment upon the Land of Hadrach; and Zion's King of Peace. - [Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md). The true interpretation of this
section, and, in fact, of the whole prophecy, depends upon the
explanation to be given to the heading contained in this verse. The
whole verse reads thus: "Burden of the word of Jehovah over the land of
Hadrach, and Damascus is its resting-place; for Jehovah has an eye upon
the men, and upon all the tribes of Israel." There is a wide divergence
of opinion concerning the land of חדרך. We need not stop to give any
elaborate refutation to the opinion that Hadrach is the name of the
Messiah (as some Rabbins suppose), or that it is the name of an unknown
Syrian king (Ges., Bleek), or of an Assyrian fire-god, Adar or Asar
(Movers), or of a deity of Eastern Aramaea (Babylonia), as Hitzig
maintained, since there is no trace whatever of the existence of such a
king or deity; and even Hitzig himself has relinquished his own
conjecture. And the view defended by J. D. Mich. and Rosenmller, that
Hadrach is the name of an ancient city, situated not far from Damascus,
is destitute of any tenable basis, since Hengstenberg (Christol. iii. p.
372, transl.) has proved that the historical testimonies adduced in
support of this rest upon some confusion with the ancient Arabian city
of Dra, Adra, the biblical Edrei ([Deu
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004).md). As the name Hadrach or Chadrach
never occurs again, and yet a city which gives its name to a land, and
occurs in connection with Damascus, Hamath, Tyre, and Sidon, could not
possibly have vanished so completely, that even the earlier Jewish and
Christian commentators heard nothing of it, Chadrach can only be a
symbolical name formed by the prophet himself (as Jerome maintained,
according to a Jewish tradition), from chad, acris, sharp, brave, ready
for war (in Arabic, ḥdd, vehemens fuit, durus in ira, pugna), and râkh,
soft, tender, in the sense of sharp-soft, or strong-tender, after the
analogy of the symbolical names. Dumah for Edom, in [Isa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md); Sheshach for Babylon, in [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md); [Jer
51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md); Ariel for Jerusalem, in [Isa
29:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md), [Isa
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md). This view can no more be upset
by the objection of Koehler, that the interpretation of the name is a
disputed point among the commentators, and that it is doubtful why the
prophet should have chosen such a symbolical epithet, than by the
circumstance that the rabbinical interpretation of the word as a name
for the Messiah is evidently false, and has long ago been given up by
the Christian commentators. That Hadrach denotes a land or kingdom, is
raised above all reach of doubt by the fact that 'erets (the land) is
placed before it. But what land? The statement in the following sentence
by no means compels us to think of a province of Syria, as Hitzig,
Koehler, and others suppose. As the cities and lands which follow are
quoted under their ordinary names, it is impossible to imagine any
reason for the choice of a symbolical name for another district of Syria
bordering upon Damascus and Hamath. The symbolical name rather points to
the fact that the land of Hadrach denotes a territory, of which
Damascus, Hamath, Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia formed the several parts.
And this is favoured by the circumstance that the words, "Burden of the
word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach," form the heading to the
oracle, in which the preposition ב is used as in the expression משּׂא
בּערב in [Isa 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md), and is to be
explained from the phrase נפל דּבר ב in [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md) : The burdensome word falls,
descends upon the land of Hadrach. The remark of Koehler in opposition
to this, to the effect that these words are not a heading, but form the
commencement of the exposition of the word of Jehovah through the
prophet, inasmuch as the following clause is appended with ו, is quite
groundless. The clause in [Isa 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028.md),
"In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden," is also a heading;
and the assertion that the ו before דּמּשׂק is not a ו explic., but an
actual ו conjunct., rests upon the assumption that the cities and lands
mentioned in the course of this prophecy have not already been all
embraced by the expression ארץ חדרך - an assumption which has not been
sustained by any proofs. On the contrary, the fact that not only is
Damascus mentioned as the resting-place of the word of Jehovah, but
Hamath and also the capitals of Phoenicia and Philistia are appended,
proves the very opposite. This evidently implies that the burden resting
upon the land of Hadrach will affect all these cities and lands.

The exposition of the burden announced upon the land of Hadrach
commences with ודמּשׂק. This is attached to the heading with Vav,
because, so far as the sense is concerned, massâ' is equivalent to "it
presses as a burden." The exposition, however, is restricted, so far as
Damascus and Hamath are concerned, to the simple remark that the
burdensome word upon Hadrach will rest upon it, i.e., will settle
permanently upon it. (The suffix in מנחתו refers to משּׂא דבר יי.) It is
only with the lands which stood in a closer relation to Judah, viz.,
Tyre, Sidon, and the provinces of Philistia, that it assumes the form of
a specially prophetic description. The contents of the heading are
sustained by the thought in the second hemistich: "Jehovah has an eye
upon men, and upon all the tribes of Israel." עין אדם with the genit.
obj. signifies the rest of mankind, i.e., the heathen world, as in [Jer
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#020.md), where "Israel" and "men" are
opposed to one another. The explanatory clause, according to which the
burden of Jehovah falls upon the land of Hadrach, and rests upon
Damascus, because the eyes of Jehovah looks upon mankind and all the
tribes of Israel, i.e., His providence stretches over the heathen world
as well as over Israel, is quite sufficient in itself to overthrow the
assumption of Hofmann and Koehler, that by the land of Hadrach we are to
understand the land of Israel. For if the explanatory clause were
understood as signifying that the burden, i.e., the judgment, would not
only fall upon Hamath as the representative of the human race outside
the limits of Israel, but also upon the land of Hadrach as the land of
all the tribes of Israel, this view would be precluded not only by the
circumstance that in what follows heathen nations alone are mentioned as
the objects of the judgment, whereas salvation and peace are proclaimed
to Israel, but also by the fact that no ground whatever can be
discovered for the application of so mysterious an epithet to the land
of Israel. According to Hofmann (Schriftb. ii. 2, p. 604), ארץ חדרך
signifies the whole of the territory of the kingdom of David, which is
so called as "the land of Israel, which, though weak in itself, was,
through the strength of God, as sharp as a warrior's sword." But if a
judgment of destruction, which Hofmann finds in our prophecy, were
announced "to all the nations dwelling within the bounds of what was
once the Davidic kingdom," the judgment would fall upon Israel in the
same way as upon the heathen nations that are named, since the tribes of
Israel formed the kernel of the nations who dwelt in what was once the
Davidic kingdom, and Israel would therefore show itself as a sharp-soft
people. Hence Koehler has modified this view, and supposes that only the
heathen dwelling within the limits of the nation of the twelve tribes
are threatened with Jehovah's judgment, - namely, all the heathen within
the land which Jehovah promised to His people on their taking possession
of Canaan ([Num 34:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001).md). But apart
from the unfounded assumption that Hadrach is the name of a district of
Syria on the border of Damascus and Hamath, this loophole is closed by
the fact that, according to [Num
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001.md)., Hamath and Damascus are not
included in the possession promised to Israel. According to [Num
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008.md), the northern boundary of the
land of Israel was to extend to Hamath, i.e., to the territory of the
kingdom of Hamath, and Damascus is very far beyond the eastern boundary
of the territory assigned to the Israelites (see the exposition of [Num
34:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001).md). Now, if the land of Hadrach,
Damascus, and Hamath were not within the ideal boundaries of Israel, and
if Hamath and Hadrach did not belong to the Israelitish kingdom in the
time of David, the other lands or cities mentioned in our oracle cannot
be threatened with the judgment on account of their lying within the
Mosaic boundaries of the land of Israel, or being subject to the
Israelites for a time, but can only come into consideration as enemies
of Israel whose might was to be threatened and destroyed by the
judgment. Consequently the land of Hadrach must denote a land hostile to
the covenant nation or the kingdom of God, and can only be a symbolical
epithet descriptive of the Medo-Persian empire, which is called
sharp-soft or strong-weak on account of its inwardly divided character,
as Hengstenberg and Kliefoth assume. Now, however difficult it may be
satisfactorily to explain the reason why Zechariah chose this symbolical
name for the Medo-Persian monarchy, so much is certain, that the choice
of a figurative name was much more suitable in the case of the dominant
empire of that time, than in that of any small country on the border of
Damascus or Hamath. All the cities and land enumerated after "the land
of Hadrach," as losing their glory at the same time, belonged to the
Medo-Persian monarchy. Of these the prophet simply refers to Damascus
and Hamath in general terms; and it is only in the case of the
Phoenician and Philistian cities that he proceeds to a special
description of their fall from their lofty eminence, because they stood
nearest to the kingdom of Israel, and represented the might of the
kingdom of the world, and its hostility to the kingdom of God, partly in
the worldly development of their own might, and partly in their
hostility to the covenant nation. The description is an individualizing
one throughout, exemplifying general facts by particular cities. This is
also evident from the announcement of salvation for Zion in [Zac
9:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md), from which we may see that the
overthrow of the nations hostile to Israel stands in intimate connection
with the establishment of the Messianic kingdom; and it is also
confirmed by the second half of our chapter, where the conquest of the
imperial power by the people of God is set forth in the victories of
Judah and Ephraim over the sons of Javan. That the several peoples and
cities mentioned by name are simply introduced as representatives of the
imperial power, is evident from the distinction made in this verse
between (the rest of) mankind and all the tribes of Israel.

[Zechariah 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 9:2</span></span>

[Zac 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#002.md). "And Hamath also, which
borders thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because it is very wise. [Zac
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#003.md). And Tyre built herself a
stronghold, and heaped up silver like dust, and gold like dirt of the
streets. [Zac 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#004.md). Behold, the Lord
will cause it to be taken, and smite its might in the sea, and she will
be consumed by fire." Chămâth is appended to Damascus by vegam (and
also). Tigbol-bâh is to be taken as a relative clause; and bâh refers to
chămâth, and not to 'erets chadrâkh (the land of Hadrach). "Hamath
also," i.e., Ἐπιφάνεια on the Orontes, the present Hamah (see at [Gen
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018).md), which borders on Damascus,
i.e., which has its territory touching the territory of Damascus, sc.
will be a resting-place of the burden of Jehovah. The relative clause
connects Hamath with Damascus, and separates it from the names which
follow. Damascus and Hamath represent Syria. Tyre and Sidon, the two
capitals of Phoenicia, are connected again into a pair by the
explanatory clause כּי חכמה מאד. For although חכמה is in the singular,
it cannot be taken as referring to Sidon only, because Tyre is mentioned
again in the very next verse as the subject, and the practical display
of its wisdom is described. The singular חכמה cannot be taken
distributively in this sense, that being wise applies in just the same
manner to both the cities (Koehler); for the cases quoted by Gesenius
(146, 4) are of a totally different kind, since there the subject is in
the plural, and is construed with a singular verb; but צידון is
subordinate to צר, "Tyre with Sidon," Sidon being regarded as an annex
of Tyre, answering to the historical relation in which the two cities
stood to one another, - namely, that Tyre was indeed originally a colony
of Sidon, but that it very soon overshadowed the mother city, and rose
to be the capital of all Phoenicia (see the comm. on Isaiah 23), so that
even in Isaiah and Ezekiel the prophecies concerning Sidon are attached
to those concerning Tyre, and its fate appears interwoven with that of
Tyre (cf. [Isa 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md), [Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md); [Eze
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#021)..md). Hence we find Tyre only
spoken of here in [Zac 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#003.md), [Zac
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#004.md). This city showed its wisdom in
the fact that it built itself a fortress, and heaped up silver and gold
like dust and dirt of the streets. Zechariah has here in his mind the
insular Tyre, which was built about three or four stadia from the
mainland, and thirty stadia to the north of Palae-tyrus, and which is
called מעוז היּם in [Isa 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md),
because, although very small in extent, it was surrounded by a wall a
hundred and fifty feet high, and was so strong a fortification, that
Shalmaneser besieged it for five years without success, and
Nebuchadnezzar for thirteen years, and apparently was unable to conquer
it (see Delitzsch on Isaiah, at [Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018).md). This fortification is called
mâtsōr. Here Tyre had heaped up immense treasures. Chârūts is shining
gold ([Psa 68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014), etc..md). but the
wisdom through which Tyre had acquired such might and such riches (cf.
[Eze 28:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#004).md) would be of no help to
it. For it was the wisdom of this world ([Co1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020).md), which ascribes to itself the
glory due to God, and only nourishes the pride out of which it sprang.
The Lord will take the city. Hōrı̄sh does not mean to drive from its
possession - namely, the population (Hitzig) - for the next two clauses
show that it is not the population of Tyre, but the city itself, which
is thought of as the object; nor does it mean to "give as a possession"
- namely, their treasures (Calv., Hengst., etc.) - but simply to take
possession, to take, to conquer, as in [Jos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#007.md); [Jos
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#012.md); [Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024) (Maurer, Koehler.md). And will
smite in the sea חילהּ, not "her bulwarks:" for חיל, when used of
fortifications, neither denotes the city wall nor earthworks, but the
moat, including the small outer wall ([Sa2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015).md) as distinguished from the true
city wall (chōmâh, [Isa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md); [Lam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008).md), and this does not apply to the
insular Tyre; moreover, חיל cannot be taken here in any other sense than
in [Eze 28:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#004.md), which Zechariah
follows. There it denotes the might which Tyre had acquired through its
wisdom, not merely warlike or military power (Koehler), but might
consisting in its strong situation and artificial fortification, as well
as in the wealth of its resources for defence. This will be smitten in
the sea, because Tyre itself stood in the sea. And finally, the city
will be destroyed by fire.

[Zechariah 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 9:5</span></span>

[Zac 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#005.md). "Ashkelon shall see it, and
fear; Gaza, and tremble greatly; and Ekron, for her hope has been put to
shame; and the king will perish out of Gaza, and Ashkelon will not
dwell. [Zac 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#006.md). The bastard will
dwell in Ashdod; and I shall destroy the pride of the Philistines. [Zac
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#007.md). And I shall take away his blood
out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he
will also remain to our God, and will be as a tribe-prince in Judah, and
Ekron like the Jebusite." From the Phoenicians the threat turns against
the Philistines. The fall of the mighty Tyre shall fill the Philistian
cities with fear and trembling, because all hope of deliverance from the
threatening destruction is thereby taken away (cf. [Isa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#005).md). תּרא is jussive. The effect,
which the fall of Tyre will produce upon the Philistian cities, is thus
set forth as intended by God. The description is an individualizing one
in this instance also. The several features in this effect are so
distributed among the different cities, that what is said of each
applies to all. They will not only tremble with fear, but will also lose
their kingship, and be laid waste. Only four of the Philistian capitals
are mentioned, Gath being passed over, as in [Amo
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md), [Amo
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008.md); [Zep
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004.md), and [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md); and they occur in the same
order as in Jeremiah, whose prophecy Zechariah had before his mind. To
ועזּה we must supply תּרא from the parallel clause; and to עקרון not
only תּרא, but also ותירא. The reason for the fear is first mentioned in
connection with Ekron, - namely, the fact that the hope is put to shame.
הובישׁ is the hiphil of בּושׁ (Ewald, 122, e), in the ordinary sense of
this hiphil, to be put to shame. מבּט with seghol stands for מבּט
(Ewald, 88, d, and 160, d), the object of hope or confidence. Gaza loses
its king. Melekh without the article is the king as such, not the
particular king reigning at the time of the judgment; and the meaning
is, "Gaza will henceforth have no king," i.e., will utterly perish,
answering to the assertion concerning Ashkelon: לא תשׁב, she will not
dwell, i.e., will not come to dwell, a poetical expression for be
inhabited (see at [Joe 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#020).md). The
reference to a king of Gaza does not point to times before the
captivity. The Babylonian and Persian emperors were accustomed to leave
to the subjugated nations their princes or kings, if they would only
submit as vassals to their superior control. They therefore bore the
title of "kings of kings" ([Eze 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007.md);
cf. Herod. iii. 15; Stark, Gaza, pp. 229, 230; and Koehler, ad h. l.).
In Ashdod will mamzēr dwell. This word, the etymology of which is
obscure (see at [Deu 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md), the only
other passage in which it occurs), denotes in any case one whose birth
has some blemish connected with it; so that he is not an equal by birth
with the citizens of a city or the inhabitants of a land. Hengstenberg
therefore renders it freely, though not inappropriately, by Gesindel
(rabble). The dwelling of the bastard in Ashdod is not at variance with
the fact that Ashkelon "does not dwell," notwithstanding the
individualizing character of the description, according to which what is
affirmed of one city also applies to the other. For the latter simply
states that the city will lose its native citizens, and thus forfeit the
character of a city. The dwelling of bastards or rabble in Ashdod
expresses the deep degradation of Philistia, which is announced in
literal terms in the second hemistich. The pride of the Philistines
shall be rooted out, i.e., everything shall be taken from them on which
as Philistines they based their pride, viz., their power, their
fortified cities, and their nationality. "These words embrace the entire
contents of the prophecy against the Philistines, affirming of the whole
people what had previously been affirmed of the several cities"
(Hengstenberg).

A new and important feature is added to this in [Zac
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#007.md). Their religious peculiarity -
namely, their idolatry - shall also be taken from them, and their
incorporation into the nation of God brought about through this
judgment. The description in [Zac 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#007.md)
is founded upon a personification of the Philistian nation. the suffixes
of the third pers. sing. and the pronoun הוּא in [Zac
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#007.md) do not refer to the mamzēr
(Hitzig), but to pelishtı̄m (the Philistines), the nation being
comprehended in the unity of a single person. This person appears as an
idolater, who, when keeping a sacrificial feast, has the blood and flesh
of the sacrificial animals in his mouth and between his teeth. Dâmı̄m is
not human blood, but the blood of sacrifices; and shiqqutsı̄m,
abominations, are not the idols, but the idolatrous sacrifices, and
indeed their flesh. Taking away the food of the idolatrous sacrifices
out of their mouth denotes not merely the interruption of the idolatrous
sacrificial meals, but the abolition of idolatry generally. He also (the
nation of the Philistines regarded as a person) will be left to our God.
The gam refers not to the Phoenicians and Syrians mentioned before, of
whose being left nothing was said in [Zac
9:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md), but to the idea of "Israel"
implied in לאלהינוּ, our God. Just as in the case of Israel a "remnant"
of true confessors of Jehovah is left when the judgment falls upon it,
so also will a remnant of the Philistines be left for the God of Israel.
The attitude of this remnant towards the people of God is shown in the
clauses which follow. He will be like an 'alluph in Judah. This word,
which is applied in the earlier books only to the tribe-princes of the
Edomites and Horites ([Gen 36:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015.md);
[Exo 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015.md); [Ch1
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#051)..md), is transferred by Zechariah to
the tribe-princes of Judah. It signifies literally not a phylarch, the
head of an entire tribe (matteh, φυλή), but a chiliarch, the head of an
'eleph, one of the families into which the tribes were divided. The
meaning "friend," which Kliefoth prefers (cf. [Mic
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#005).md), is unsuitable here; and the
objection, that "all the individuals embraced in the collective הוּא
cannot receive the position of tribe-princes in Judah" (Kliefoth), does
not apply, because הוּא is not an ordinary collective, but the remnant
of the Philistines personified as a man. Such a remnant might very well
assume the position of a chiliarch of Judah. This statement is completed
by the addition "and Ekron," i.e., the Ekronite "will be like the
Jebusite." The Ekronite is mentioned fore the purpose of individualizing
in the place of all the Philistines. "Jebusite" is not an epithet
applied to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but stands for the former
inhabitants of the citadel of Zion, who adopted the religion of Israel
after the conquest of this citadel by David, and were incorporated into
the nation of the Lord. This is evident from the example of the Jebusite
Araunah, who lived in the midst of the covenant nation, according to
[Sa2 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md)., [Ch1
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#015.md)., as a distinguished man of
property, and not only sold his threshing-floor to king David as a site
for the future temple, but also offered to present the oxen with which
he had been ploughing, as well as the plough itself, for a
burnt-offering. On the other hand, Koehler infers, from the conventional
mode of expression employed by the subject when speaking to his king,
"thy God," and the corresponding words of David, "my God" instead of our
God, that Araunah stood in the attitude of a foreigner towards the God
of Israel; but he is wrong in doing so. And there is quite as little
ground for the further inference drawn by this scholar from the fact
that the servants of Solomon and the Nethinim are reckoned together in
[Ezr 2:58](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#058.md) and [Neh
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#060.md), in connection with the statement
that Solomon had levied bond-slaves for his buildings from the remnants
of the Canaanitish population ([Kg1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020).md), viz., that the Jebusites
reappeared in the Nethinim of the later historical books, and that the
Nethinim "given by David and the princes" were chiefly Jebusites,
according to which "Ekron's being like a Jebusite is equivalent to
Ekron's not only meeting with reception into the national fellowship of
Israel through circumcision, but being appointed, like the Jebusites, to
service in the sanctuary of Jehovah." On the contrary, the thought is
simply this: The Ekronites will be melted up with the people of God,
like the Jebusites with the Judaeans. Kliefoth also observes quite
correctly, that "there is no doubt that what is specially affirmed of
the Philistians is also intended to apply to the land of Chadrach, to
Damascus, etc., as indeed an absolute generalization follows expressly
in [Zac 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010.md).... Just as in what
precedes, the catastrophe intended for all these lands and nations is
specially described in the case of Tyre alone; so here conversion is
specially predicted of the Philistines alone."

If we inquire now into the historical allusion or fulfilment of this
prophecy, it seems most natural to think of the divine judgment, which
fell upon Syria, Phoenicia, and Philistia through the march of Alexander
the Great from Asia Minor to Egypt. After the battle at Issus in
Cilicia, Alexander sent one division of his army under Parmenio to
Damascus, to conquer this capital of Coele-Syria. On this expedition
Hamath must also have been touched and taken. Alexander himself marched
from Cilicia direct to Phoenicia, where Sidon and the other Phoenician
cities voluntarily surrendered to him; and only Tyre offered so serious
a resistance in its confidence in its own security, that it was not till
after a seven months' siege and very great exertions that he succeeded
in taking this fortified city by storm. On his further march the
fortified city of Gaza also offered a prolonged resistance, but it too
was eventually taken by storm (cf. Arrian, ii. 15ff.; Curtius, iv. 12,
13, and 2-4; and Stark, Gaza, p. 237ff.). On the basis of these facts,
Hengstenberg observes (Christol. iii. p. 369), as others have done
before him, that "there can be no doubt that in [Zac
9:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md) we have before us a description
of the expedition of Alexander as clear as it was possible for one to be
given, making allowance for the difference between prophecy and
history." But Koehler has already replied to this, that the prophecy in
[Zac 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#007.md) was not fulfilled by the
deeds of Alexander, since neither the remnant of the Phoenicians nor the
other heathen dwelling in the midst of Israel were converted to Jehovah
through the calamities connected with Alexander's expedition; and on
this ground he merely regards the conquests of Alexander as the
commencement of the fulfilment, which was then continued throughout the
calamities caused by the wars of succession, the conflicts between the
Egyptians, Syrians, and Romans, until it was completed by the fact that
the heathen tribes within the boundaries of Israel gradually disappeared
as separate tribes, and their remnants were received into the community
of those who confessed Israel's God and His anointed. But we must go a
step further, and say that the fulfilment has not yet reached its end,
but is still going on, and will until the kingdom of Christ shall attain
that complete victory over the heathen world which is foretold in [Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md).

[Zechariah 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 9:8</span></span>

Whilst the heathen world falls under the judgment of destruction, and
the remnant of the heathen are converted to the living God, the Lord
will protect His house, and cause the King to appear in Jerusalem, who
will spread out His kingdom of peace over all the earth. [Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md). "I pitch a tent for my house
against military power, against those who go to and fro, and no
oppressor will pass over them any more; for now have I seen with my
eyes. [Zac 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md). Exult greatly, O
daughter Zion; shout, daughter Jerusalem: behold, thy King will come to
thee: just and endowed with salvation is He; lowly and riding upon an
ass, and that upon a foal, the she-ass's son. [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010.md). And I cut off the chariots out
of Ephraim, and the horses out of Jerusalem, and the war-bow will be cut
off: and peace will He speak to the nations; and His dominion goes from
sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth." Chânâh, to
encamp, to pitch a tent. לביתי, dat. commod. "for my house," for the
good of my house. The house of Jehovah is not the temple, but Israel as
the kingdom of God or church of the Lord, as in [Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md); [Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md); [Jer
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007.md), and even [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007.md), from which we may see that this
meaning is not founded upon the temple, but upon the national
constitution given to Israel, i.e., upon the idea of the house as a
family. In the verse before us we cannot think of the temple, for the
simple reason that the temple was not a military road for armies on the
march either while it was standing, or, as Koehler supposes, when it was
in ruins. מצּבה stands, according to the Masora, for מצּבא = מן־צבא, not
however in the sense of without an army, but "on account of (against) a
hostile troop," protecting His house from them. But Bttcher, Koehler,
and others, propose to follow the lxx and read מצּבה, military post,
after [Sa1 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#012.md), which is the
rendering given by C. B. Michaelis and Gesenius to מצּבה. But this does
not apply to חנה, for a post (מצּבה, that which is set up) stands up,
and does not lie down. מצּבה is more precisely defined by מעבר וּמשּׁב,
as going through and returning, i.e., as an army marching to and fro
(cf. [Zac 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014).md). There will come upon
them no more (עליהם, ad sensum, referring to בּיתי) nōgēs, lit., a
bailiff or taskmaster ([Exo 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007).md), then
generally any oppressor of the nation. Such oppressors were Egypt,
Asshur, Babel, and at the present time the imperial power of Persia.
This promise is explained by the last clause: Now have I seen with mine
eyes. The object is wanting, but it is implied in the context, viz., the
oppression under which my nation sighs (cf. [Exo
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#025.md); [Exo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007)). ‛Attâh (now.md) refers to the ideal
present of the prophecy, really to the time when God interposes with His
help; and the perfect ראיתי is prophetic.

God grants help to His people, by causing her King to come to the
daughter Zion. To show the magnitude of this salvation, the Lord calls
upon the daughter Zion, i.e., the personified population of Jerusalem as
a representative of the nation of Israel, namely the believing members
of the covenant nation, to rejoice. Through מלכּך, thy King, the coming
one is described as the King appointed for Zion, and promised to the
covenant nation. That the Messiah is intended, whose coming is predicted
by Isaiah ([Isa 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005).md), Micah ([Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001)..md), and other prophets, is admitted
with very few exceptions by all the Jewish and Christian commentators.

(Note: See the history of the exposition in Hengstenberg's Christology.)

לך, not only to thee, but also for thy good. He is tsaddı̄q, righteous,
i.e., not one who has right, or the good cause (Hitzig), nor merely one
righteous in character, answering in all respects to the will of Jehovah
(Koehler), but animated with righteousness, and maintaining in His
government this first virtue of a ruler (cf. [Isa
11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md); [Jer
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md); [Jer
33:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015), etc..md). For He is also נושׁע,
i.e., not σώζων, salvator, helper (lxx, Vulg., Luth.), since the niphal
has not the active or transitive sense of the hiphil (מושׁיע), nor
merely the passive σωζόμενος, salvatus, delivered from suffering; but
the word is used in a more general sense, endowed with ישׁע, salvation,
help from God, as in [Deu 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029.md); [Psa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016.md), or furnished with the
assistance of God requisite for carrying on His government. The next two
predicates describe the character of His rule. עני does not mean gentle,
πραΰ́ς (lxx and others) = ענו, but lowly, miserable, bowed down, full of
suffering. The word denotes "the whole of the lowly, miserable,
suffering condition, as it is elaborately depicted in [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)" (Hengstenberg.md). The next
clause answers to this, "riding upon an ass, and indeed upon the foal of
an ass." The ו before על עיר is epexegetical ([Sa1
17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040).md), describing the ass as a young
animal, not yet ridden, but still running behind the she-asses. The
youthfulness of the animal is brought out still more strongly by the
expression added to עיר, viz., בּן־אתנות, i.e., a foal, such as asses
are accustomed to bear (עתנות is the plural of the species, as in כּפיר
אריות, [Jdg 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005.md); שׂעיר העזּים, [Gen
37:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#031.md); [Lev
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023).md). "Riding upon an ass" is
supposed by most of the more modern commentators to be a figurative
emblem of the peacefulness of the king, that He will establish a
government of peace, the ass being regarded as an animal of peace in
contrast with the horse, because on account of its smaller strength,
agility, and speed, it is less adapted for riding in the midst of
fighting and slaughter than a horse. But, in the first place, this
leaves the heightening of the idea of the ass by the expression "the
young ass's foal" quite unexplained. Is the unridden ass's foal an
emblem of peace in a higher degree than the full-grown ass, that has
already been ridden?

(Note: We may see how difficult it is to reconcile the emphasis laid
upon the ass's foal with this explanation of the significance of the
ass, from the attempts made by the supporters of it to bring them into
harmony. The assertion made by Ebrard, that עיר denotes an ass of noble
breed, and בּן־אתנות signifies that it is one of the noblest breed, has
been already proved by Koehler to be a fancy without foundation; but his
own attempt to deduce the following meaning of this riding upon a young
ass from the precepts concerning the sacrifices, viz., that the future
king is riding in the service of Israel, and therefore comes in
consequence of a mission from Jehovah, can be proved to fail, from the
fact that he is obliged to collect together the most heterogeneous
precepts, of which those in [Num 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#002.md);
[Deu 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#003.md), and [Sa1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#007.md), that for certain expiatory
purposes animals were to be selected that had never borne a yoke, have a
much more specific meaning than that of simple use in the service of
Jehovah.)

And secondly, it is indeed correct that the ass was only used in war as
the exception, not the rule, and when there were no horses to be had
(cf. Bochart, Hieroz. i. p. 158, ed. Ros.); and also correct that in the
East it is of a nobler breed, and not so despised as it is with us; but
it is also a fact that in the East, and more especially among the
Israelites, it was only in the earlier times, when they possessed no
horses as yet, that distinguished persons rode upon asses ([Jdg
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010.md); [Jdg
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004.md); [Jdg
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#014.md); [Sa2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#023.md); [Sa2
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#027).md), whereas in the time of David
the royal princes and kings kept mules for riding instead of asses ([Sa2
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029.md); [Sa2
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md); [Kg1
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#033); 38:44.md); and from the time of
Solomon downwards, when the breeding of horses was introduced, not
another instance occurs of a royal person riding upon an ass, although
asses and mules are still constantly used in the East for riding and as
beasts of burden; and lastly, that in both the ancient and modern East
the ass stands much lower than the horse, whilst in Egypt and other
places (Damascus for example), Christians and Jews were, and to some
extent still are, only allowed to ride upon asses, and not upon horses,
for the purpose of putting them below the Mohammedans (for the proofs,
see Hengstenberg's Christology, iii. pp. 404-5). Consequently we must
rest satisfied with this explanation, that in accordance with the
predicate עני the riding of the King of Zion upon the foal of an ass is
an emblem, not of peace, but of lowliness, as the Talmudists themselves
interpreted it. "For the ass is not a more peaceful animal than the
horse, but a more vicious one" (Kliefoth).

[Zechariah 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 9:10</span></span>

Just as the coming of the King does not contain within itself a sign of
earthly power and exaltation, so will His kingdom not be established by
worldly power. The war-chariots and horses, in which the kingdoms of the
world seek their strength, will be exterminated by Jehovah out of
Ephraim and Jerusalem (cf. [Mic 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009).md).
And so also will the war-chariots, for which "the battle-bow" stands
synecdochically. Ephraim denotes the former kingdom of the ten tribes,
and Jerusalem is mentioned as the capital in the place of the kingdom of
Judah. Under the Messiah will the two kingdoms that were formerly
divided be united once more, and through the destruction of their
military power will their nature be also changed, the covenant nation be
divested of its political and worldly character, and made into a
spiritual nation or kingdom. The rule of this King will also speak peace
to the nations, i.e., will not command peace through His authoritative
word (Hitzig, Koehler, etc.), but bring the contests among the nations
to an end ([Mic 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003).md); for dibbēr
shâlōm does not mean to command peace, but it either simply denotes such
a speaking as has peace for its subject, giving an assurance of peace
and friendship, i.e., uttering words of peace (a meaning which is
inapplicable here), or signifies to speak peace for the purpose of
bringing disputes to an end ([Est
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003).md). But this is done not by
authoritative commands, but by His gaining the nations over through the
spiritual power of His word, or establishing His spiritual kingdom in
the midst of them. It is only as thus interpreted, that the statement
concerning the extension of His kingdom harmonizes with the rest. This
statement rests upon [Psa 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md), "from
sea to sea," as in [Amo 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#012.md) and [Mic
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012.md), viz., from the sea to the other
end of the world where sea begins again. "From the river:" i.e., from
the Euphrates, which is intended here by nâhâr without the article, as
in [Mic 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012.md) and [Isa
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020.md), and is mentioned as the remotest
eastern boundary of the land of Israel, according to [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); [Exo
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031.md), as being the terminus a quo, to
which the ends of the earth are opposed as the terminus ad quem.

The leading thought in the promise ([Zac
9:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008).md) is therefore the following:
When the catastrophe shall burst upon the Persian empire, Israel will
enjoy the marvellous protection of its God, and the promised King will
come for Zion, endowed with righteousness and salvation, but in outward
humiliation; and through the extermination of the materials of war out
of Israel, as well as by the peaceful settlement of the contests of the
nations, He will establish a kingdom of peace, which will extend over
all the earth. On the fulfilment of this prophecy, we learn from the
gospel history, that when Jesus took His last journey to Jerusalem, He
so arranged His entrance into this city, that our prophecy ([Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009).md), "Say ye to the daughter Zion,
Behold, thy King cometh," etc., was fulfilled (cf. [Mat
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md)., [Mar
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#002.md)., [Luk
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#030.md)., and [Joh
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#014)..md). The exact agreement between
the arrangement made by Jesus on this occasion and our prophecy is
especially evident from the account given by Matthew, according to which
Jesus ordered not only the ass's foal (πῶλον ὀνάριον), upon which He
rode into Jerusalem, to be brought, as Mark, Luke, and John relate, but
a she-ass and a foal with her ([Mat
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md), [Mat
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#007).md), "that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the prophet" ([Mat
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#004).md), although He could really only
ride upon one animal. The she-ass was to follow, to set forth
Zechariah's figurative description with greater completeness. For we
see, from the corresponding accounts of the other three evangelists,
that Jesus only mounted the ass's foal. John, even when quoting our
prophecy, only mentions the "sitting on an ass's colt" ([Joh
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#015).md), and then adds in [Joh
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#016.md), that the allusion in this act
of Jesus to the Old Testament prophecy was only understood by the
disciples after Jesus was glorified. By this mode of entering Jerusalem
before His death, Jesus intended to exhibit Himself to the people as the
King foretold by the prophets, who, coming in lowliness, would establish
His kingdom through suffering and dying, so as to neutralize the carnal
expectations of the people as to the worldly character of the Messianic
kingdom. The fulfilment, however, which Jesus thereby gave to our
prophecy is not to be sought for in this external agreement between His
act and the words of the prophet. The act of Jesus was in itself simply
an embodiment of the thought lying at the basis of the prophecy, -
namely, that the kingdom of the Messiah would unfold itself, through
lowliness and suffering, to might and glory; that Jesus, as the promised
Messiah, would not conquer the world by the force of arms, and so raise
His people to political supremacy, but that He would found His kingdom
by suffering and dying, - a kingdom which, though not of this world,
would nevertheless overcome the world. The figurative character of the
prophetic picture, according to which "riding upon an ass" merely serves
to individualize עני, and set forth the lowliness of the true King of
Zion under appropriate imagery, has been already pointed out by Calvin

(Note: Calvin says: "I have no doubt that the prophet added this clause
(viz., 'riding upon an ass,' etc.) as an appendix to the word עני, as
much as to say: The King of whom I speak will not be illustrious for His
magnificent and splendid state, as earthly princes generally are." He
then gives this explanation of the riding upon the ass: "He will not
prevail by His great exaltation; nor will He be conspicuous for arms,
riches, splendour, the number of his soldiers, or even the royal
insignia, which attract the eyes of the people.")

and Vitringa; and the latter has also correctly observed, that the
prophecy would have been fulfilled in Christ, even if He had not made
His entry into Jerusalem in this manner.

(Note: Vitringa says, on [Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md) :
"In that passage of Zechariah, indeed, according to its spiritual and
mystical sense, his meaning would have been evident without this
accident of the entry of Christ into Jerusalem; but when God would put
all the emphasis of which the words are capable upon the predictions
uttered by the prophets, His own providence took care that this accident
should also occur, so that no part of the machinery might be wanting
here.")

Hengstenberg and Koehler adopt the same view. Nevertheless, this entry
of Christ into Jerusalem forms the commencement of the fulfilment of our
prophecy, and that not merely inasmuch as Jesus thereby declared Himself
to be the promised Messiah and King of Zion, and set forth in a living
symbol the true nature of His person and of His kingdom in contrast with
the false notions of His friends and foes, but still more in this
respect, that the entry into Jerusalem formed the commencement of the
establishment of His kingdom, since it brought to maturity the
resolution on the part of the Jewish rulers to put Him to death; and His
death was necessary to reconcile the sinful world to God, and restore
the foundation of peace upon which His kingdom was to be built. With the
spread of His kingdom over the earth, treated of in [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010.md), the fulfilment continues till
the annihilation of all the ungodly powers, after which all war will
ceased. But this end can only be reached through severe conflicts and
victory. This is the subject of the following section.

[Zechariah 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 9:11</span></span>

Israel's Redemption from Captivity, and Victory over the Heathen. - [Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md). "Thou also, for the sake of thy
covenant blood, I release thy captives out of the pit wherein there is
no water. [Zac 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#012.md). Return to the
fortress, ye prisoners of hope. Even to-day I proclaim: Double will I
repay to thee." This is addressed to the daughter Zion, i.e., to all
Israel, consisting of Ephraim and Judah. We not only learn this from the
context, since both of them are spoken of before ([Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010).md) and afterwards ([Zac
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013).md); but it is also obvious from the
expression bedam berı̄thēkh, since the covenant blood belonged to all
Israel of the twelve tribes ([Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008).md). גּם־אתּ stands at the head
absolutely, on account of the emphasis lying upon the אתּ. But as the
following clause, instead of being directly attached to אתּ, is so
constructed that the pronoun אתּ is continued with suffixes, the
question arises, to what the גּם is to be taken as referring, or which
is the antithesis indicated by גּם. The answer may easily be obtained if
we only make it clear to ourselves which of the two words, with the
second pers. suffix, forms the object of the assertion made in the
entire clause. This is not בּדם־בּריתך, but אסיריך: thou also (= thee) -
namely, thy prisoners - I release. But the emphasis intended by the
position in which גּם־אתּ is placed does not rest upon the prisoners of
Israel in contrast with any other prisoners, but in contrast with the
Israel in Jerusalem, the daughter Zion, to which the King is coming.
Now, although גּם actually belongs to אסיריך, it refers primarily to the
אתּ to which it is attached, and this only receives its more precise
definition afterwards in אסיריך. And the allusion intended by גּם is
simply somewhat obscured by the fact, that before the statement to which
it gives emphasis בּדם־בּריתך is inserted, in order from the very first
to give a firm pledge of the promise to the people, by declaring the
motive which induced God to make this fresh manifestation of grace to
Israel. This motive also acted as a further reason for placing the
pronoun אתּ at the head absolutely, and shows that אתּ is to be taken as
an address, as for example in [Gen
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md). בּדם־בּריתך: literally, being in
thy covenant blood, because sprinkled therewith, the process by which
Israel was expiated and received into covenant with God ([Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008).md). "The covenant blood, which
still separates the church and the world from one another, was therefore
a certain pledge to the covenant nation of deliverance out of all
trouble, so long, that is to say, as it did not render the promise
nugatory by wickedly violating the conditions imposed by God"
(Hengstenberg). The new matter introduced by גּם־אתּ in [Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md) is therefore the following: The
pardon of Israel will not merely consist in the fact that Jehovah will
send the promised King to the daughter Zion; but He will also redeem
such members of His nation as shall be still in captivity out of their
affliction. The perfect shillachtı̄ is prophetic. Delivering them out of
a pit without water is a figure denoting their liberation out of the
bondage of exile. This is represented with an evident allusion to the
history of Joseph in [Gen 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#022.md), as
lying in a pit wherein there is no water, such as were used as prisons
(cf. [Jer 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006).md). Out of such a pit the
captive could not escape, and would inevitably perish if he were not
drawn out. The opposite of the pit is בּצּרון, a place cut off, i.e.,
fortified, not the steep height, although fortified towns were generally
built upon heights. The prisoners are to return where they will be
secured against their enemies; compare [Psa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md), where the rock is opposed to the
miry pit, as being a place upon which it is possible to stand firmly.
"Prisoners of hope" is an epithet applied to the Israelites, because
they possess in their covenant blood a hope of redemption. גּם־היּום,
also to-day, i.e., even to-day or still to-day, "notwithstanding all
threatening circumstances" (Ewald, Hengstenberg). I repay thee double,
i.e., according to [Isa 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007.md), a double
measure of glory in the place of the sufferings.

[Zechariah 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 9:13</span></span>

This thought is supported in [Zac
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013.md). by a picture of the glory
intended for Israel. [Zac 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013.md). "For I
stretch Judah as my bow, fill it with Ephraim, and stir up thy sons, O
Zion, against thy sons, O Javan, and make thee like the sword of a hero.
[Zac 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#014.md). And Jehovah will appear
above them, and like the lightning will His arrow go forth; and the Lord
Jehovah will blow the trumpets, and will pass along in storms of the
south. [Zac 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#015.md). Jehovah of hosts
will shelter above them, and they will eat and tread down sling-stones,
and will drink, make a noise, as if with wine, and become full, like the
sacrificial bowls, like the corners of the altar." The double recompense
which the Lord will make to His people, will consist in the fact that He
not only liberates them out of captivity and bondage, and makes them
into an independent nation, but that He helps them to victory over the
power of the world, so that they will tread it down, i.e., completely
subdue it. The first thought is not explained more fully, because it is
contained implicite in the promise of return to a strong place; the
"double" only is more distinctly defined, namely, the victory over
Javan. The expression, "I stretch," etc., implies that the Lord will
subdue the enemies by Judah and Ephraim, and therefore Israel will carry
on this conflict in the power of its God. The figurative description is
a bold one. Judah is the extended bow; Ephraim the arrow which God
shoots at the foe. קשׁת is indeed separated from יהוּדה by the accents;
but the lxx, Targ., Vulg., and others, have taken it more correctly, as
in apposition to יהוּדה; because with the many meanings that דּרך
possesses, the expression דּרך יהוּדה needs a more precise definition;
whereas there is no difficulty in supplying in thought the noun qesheth,
which has been mentioned only just before, to the verb מלּאתי (I fill).
מלּאתי is to be understood as signifying the laying of the arrow upon
the bow, and not to be explained from [Kg2
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#024.md), "to fill the hand with the bow."
A bow is filled when it is supplied with the arrow for shooting. We must
bear in mind that the matter is divided rhetorically between the
parallel members; and the thought is this: Judah and Ephraim are bow and
arrow in the hand of Jehovah. עוררתּי, I stir up, not I swing thy
children as a lance (Hitzig and Koehler); for if עורר had this meaning,
חנית could not be omitted. The sons of Zion are Judah and Ephraim, the
undivided Israel, not the Zionites living as slaves in Javan (Hitzig).
The sons of Javan are the Greeks, as the world-power, the
Graeco-Macedonian monarchy (cf. [Dan
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021).md), against which the Lord will
make His people into a hero's sword. This took place in weak beginnings,
even in the wars between the Maccabees and the Seleucidae, to which,
according to Jerome, the Jews understood our prophecy to refer; but it
must not be restricted to this, as the further description in [Zac
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#014.md), [Zac
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#015.md) points to the complete
subjugation of the imperial power.

Jehovah appears above them, i.e., coming from heaven as a defence, to
fight for them (the sons of Zion), as a mighty man of war ([Psa
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008).md). His arrow goes out like the
lightning (כ the so-called כ veritatis; for the fact described, compare
[Hab 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#011).md). Marching at the head of
His people, He gives the signal of battle with a trumpet-blast, and
attacks the enemy with terribly devastating violence. The description
rests upon the poetical descriptions of the coming of the Lord to
judgment, the colours of which are borrowed from the phenomena of a
storm (cf. Psalm 18 and [Hab 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#008)..md).
Storms of the south are the most violent storms, as they come from the
Arabian desert, which bounds Canaan on the south ([Isa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md); cf. [Hos
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015).md). But Jehovah not only fights
for His people; He is also a shield to them in battle, covering them
against the weapons of the foe. This is affirmed in יגן עליהם in [Zac
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#015.md). Hence they are able to destroy
their enemies, and, like devouring lions, to eat their flesh and drink
their blood. That this figure lies at the foundation of the horrible
picture of ואכלוּ, is evident from [Num
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024.md), which was the passage that
Zechariah had in his mind: "Behold a people like the lioness; it rises
up, and like the lion does it lift itself up: it lies not down till it
devour the prey, and drink the blood of the slain." Hence the object to
אכלוּ is not the possessions of the heathen, but their flesh. כּבשׁוּ
אבני קלע does not mean, they tread down (subdue) the enemy with
sling-stones (lxx, Vulg., Grot.); for אבני ק cannot, when considered
grammatically, be taken in an instrumental sense, and is rather an
accus. obj.; but they tread down sling-stones. The sling-stones might be
used per synecdochen to signify darts, which the enemy hurls at them,
and which they tread down as perfectly harmless (Kliefoth). But the
comparison of the Israelites to the stones of a crown, in [Zac
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#016.md), leads rather to the conclusion
that the sling-stones are to be taken as a figure denoting the enemy,
who are trampled under the feet like stones (Hitzig, Hengstenberg). Only
we cannot speak of eating sling-stones, as Koehler would interpret the
words, overlooking כּבשׁוּ, and appealing to the parallel member: they
will drink, reel as if from wine, which shows, in his opinion, that it
is the sling-stones that are to be eaten. But this shows, on the
contrary, that just as there no mention is made of what is to be drunk,
so here what is to be eaten is not stated. It is true that wine and
sacrificial blood point to the blood of the enemy; but wine and blood
are drinkable, whereas sling-stones are not edible. The description of
the enemy as sling-stones is to be explained from the figure in [Sa1
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#029.md), to hurl away the soul of the
enemy. They drunk (sc., the blood of the enemy) even to intoxication,
making a noise, as if intoxicated with wine (כּמו יין, an abbreviated
comparison; cf. Ewald, 221, a, and 282, e), and even to overflowing, so
that they become full, like the sacrificial bowls in which the blood of
the sacrificial animals was caught, and like the corners of the altar,
which were sprinkled with the sacrificial blood. זויּת are corners, not
the horns of the altar. The sacrificial blood was not sprinkled upon
these; they were simply smeared with a little blood applied with the
finger, in the case of the expiatory sacrifices. According to the law
([Lev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005.md), [Lev
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#011.md); [Lev
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#002), etc..md), the blood was to be swung
against the altar. This was done, according to rabbinical tradition
(Mishn. Seb. [Sa1 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#004.md)., and Rashi on
[Lev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005).md), in such a manner, that with
two sprinklings all the four sides of the altar were wetted, - a result
which could only be ensured by swinging the bowls filled with blood, so
as to strike the corners of the altar.

[Zechariah 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 9:16</span></span>

Through this victory over the world-power Israel will attain to glory.
[Zac 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#016.md). "And Jehovah their God will
endow them with salvation in that day, like a flock His people; for
stones of a crown are they, sparkling in His land. [Zac
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#017.md). For how great is its goodness,
and how great its beauty! Corn will make youths to sprout, and new wine
maidens." הושׁיע does not mean to help or deliver here; for this would
affirm much too little, after what has gone before. When Israel has
trodden down its foes, it no longer needs deliverance. It denotes the
granting of positive salvation, which the explanatory clause that
follows also requires. The motive for this is indicated in the clause,
"like a flock His people." Because Israel is His (Jehovah's) people, the
Lord will tend it as a shepherd tends his flock. The blessings which
Jehovah bestows upon His people are described by David in [Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md). The Lord will do this also,
because they (the Israelites) are crown-stones, namely as the chosen
people, which Jehovah will make a praise and glory for all nations ([Zep
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019).md). To the predicate אבני נזר
the subject המּה may easily be supplied from the context, as for example
in מגּיד in [Zac 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#012.md). To this subject
מתנוססות וגו attaches itself. This verb is connected with nēs, a banner,
in [Psa 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006.md), the only other passage
in which it occurs; but here it is used in the sense of nâtsats, to
glitter or sparkle. The meaning, to lift up, which is given by the
lexicons, has no foundation, and is quite unsuitable here. For
crown-stones do not lift themselves up, but sparkle; and the figure of
precious stones, which sparkle upon the land, denotes the highest
possible glory to which Israel can attain. The suffix attached to אדמתו
refers to Jehovah, only we must not identify the land of Jehovah with
Palestine. The application of this honourable epithet to Israel is
justified in [Zac 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#017.md), by an allusion
to the excellence and beauty to which it will attain. The suffixes in
טוּבו and יפיו cannot refer to Jehovah, as Ewald and Hengstenberg
suppose, but refer to עמּו, the people of Jehovah. יפי is quite
irreconcilable with an allusion to Jehovah, since this word only occurs
in connection with men and the Messianic King ([Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003.md); [Isa
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#017).md); and even if it were used of
Jehovah, it would still be unsuitable here. For though the vigorous
prosperity of the nation is indeed a proof of the goodness of God, it is
not a proof of the beauty of God. Mâh is an exclamation of Amazement:
"how great!" (Ewald, 330, a). טוּב, when affirmed of the nation, is not
moral goodness, but a good appearance, and is synonymous with יפי,
beauty, as in [Hos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md). This
prosperity proceeds from the blessings of grace, which the Lord causes
to flow down to His people. Corn and new wine are mentioned as such
blessings, for the purpose of individualizing, as indeed they frequently
are (e.g., [Deu 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md); [Psa
72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016).md), and are distributed
rhetorically between the youths and the maidens.
