David King Over Judah, and Ishbosheth King Over Israel. Battle at Gibeon
- 2 Samuel 2

After David had mourned for the fallen king, he went, in accordance with
the will of the Lord as sought through the Urim, to Hebron, and was
there anointed king by the tribe of Jabesh, for the love which they had
shown to Saul in burying his bones ([Sa2
2:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001).md), and reigned seven years and a
half at Hebron over Judah alone ([Sa2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010.md) and [Sa2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#011).md). Abner, on the other hand, put
forward Ishbosheth the son of Saul, who still remained alive, as king
over Israel ([Sa2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md) and [Sa2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#009).md); so that a war broke out between
the adherents of Ishbosheth and those of David, in which Abner and his
army were beaten, but the brave Asahel, the son-in-law of David, was
slain by Abner (vv. 12-32). The promotion of Ishbosheth as king was not
only a continuation of the hostility of Saul towards David, but also an
open act of rebellion against Jehovah, who had rejected Saul and chosen
David prince over Israel, and who had given such distinct proofs of this
election in the eyes of the whole nations, that even Saul had been
convinced of the appointment of David to be his successor upon the
throne. But David attested his unqualified submission to the guidance of
God, in contrast with this rebellion against His clearly revealed will,
not only by not returning to Judah till he had received permission from
the Lord, but also by the fact that after the tribe of Judah had
acknowledged him as king, he did not go to war with Ishbosheth, but
contented himself with resisting the attack made upon him by the
supporters of the house of Saul, because he was fully confident that the
Lord would secure to him in due time the whole of the kingdom of Israel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 2:1</span></span>

David's return to Hebron, and anointing as king over Judah. - [Sa2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001.md). "After this," i.e., after the
facts related in 2 Samuel 1, David inquired of the Lord, namely through
the Urim, whether he should go up to one of the towns of Judah, and if
so, to which. He received the reply, "to Hebron," a place peculiarly
well adapted for a capital, not only from its situation upon the
mountains, and in the centre of the tribe, but also from the sacred
reminiscences connected with it from the olden time. David could have no
doubt that, now that Saul was dead, he would have to give up his
existing connection with the Philistines and return to his own land. But
as the Philistines had taken the greater part of the Israelitish
territory through their victory at Gilboa, and there was good reason to
fear that the adherents of Saul, more especially the army with Abner,
Saul's cousin, at its head, would refuse to acknowledge David as king,
and consequently a civil war might break out, David would not return to
his own land without the express permission of the Lord. [Sa2
1:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#002.md). When he went with his wives and
all his retinue (vid., [Sa1 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#002).md) to
Hebron and the "cities of Hebron," i.e., the places belonging to the
territory of Hebron, the men of Judah came (in the persons of their
elders) and anointed him king over the house, i.e., the tribe, of Judah.
Just as Saul was made king by the tribes after his anointing by Samuel
([Sa1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015).md), so David was first of
all anointed by Judah here, and afterwards by the rest of the tribes
([Sa2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003).md).

A new section commences with ויּגּדוּ. The first act of David as king
was to send messengers to Jabesh, to thank the inhabitants of this city
for burying Saul, and to announce to them his own anointing as king. As
this expression of thanks involved a solemn recognition of the departed
king, by which David divested himself of even the appearance of a
rebellion, the announcement of the anointing he had received contained
an indirect summons to the Jabeshites to recognise him as their king
now.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 2:6</span></span>

"And now," sc., that ye have shown this love to Saul your lord, "may
Jehovah show you grace and truth." "Grace and truth" are connected
together, as in [Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md), as the two
sides by which the goodness of God is manifested to men, namely in His
forgiving grace, and in His trustworthiness, or the fulfilment of His
promises (vid., [Psa 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010).md). "And I
also show you this good," namely the prayer for the blessing of God
([Sa2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#005).md), because ye have done this
(to Saul). In [Sa2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#007.md) there is
attached to this the demand, that now that Saul their lord was dead, and
the Judaeans had anointed him (David) king, they would show themselves
valiant, namely valiant in their reverence and fidelity towards David,
who had become their king since the death of Saul. ידיכם תּחזקנה, i.e.,
be comforted, spirited (cf. [Jdg
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#011).md). It needed some resolution and
courage to recognise David as king, because Saul's army had fled to
Gilead, and there was good ground for apprehending opposition to David
on the part of Abner. Ishbosheth, however, does not appear to have been
proclaimed king yet; or at any rate the fact was not yet known to David.
וגם does not belong to אתי, but to the whole clause, as אתי is placed
first merely for the sake of emphasis.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 2:8</span></span>

Promotion of Ishbosheth to be king over Israel. - The account of this is
attached to the foregoing in the form of an antithesis: "But Abner, the
chief captain of Saul (see at [Sa1
14:50](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#050).md), had taken Ishbosheth the son
of Saul, and led him over to Mahanaim." Ishbosheth had probably been in
the battle at Gilboa, and fled with Abner across the Jordan after the
battle had been lost. Ishbosheth (i.e., man of shame) was the fourth son
of Saul (according to [Ch1 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md); [Ch1
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#039).md): his proper name was Esh-baal
(i.e., fire of Baal, probably equivalent to destroyer of Baal). This
name was afterwards changed into Ishbosheth, just as the name of the god
Baal was also translated into Bosheth ("shame," [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md); [Jer
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024), etc..md), and Jerubbaal changed
into Jerubbosheth (see at [Jdg 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#035).md).
Ewald's supposition, that bosheth was originally employed in a good
sense as well, like αἰδως and פּחד ([Gen
31:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#053).md), cannot be sustained. Mahanaim
was on the eastern side of the Jordan, not far from the ford of Jabbok,
and was an important place for the execution of Abner's plans, partly
from its historical associations ([Gen
32:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002).md), and partly also from its
situation. There he made Ishbosheth king "for Gilead," i.e., the whole
of the land to the east of the Jordan (as in [Num
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#029.md); [Jos
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#009), etc..md). "For the Ashurites:" this
reading is decidedly faulty, since we can no more suppose it to refer to
Assyria (Asshur) than to the Arabian tribe of the Assurim ([Gen
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003).md); but the true name cannot be
discovered.

(Note: In the Septuagint we find Θασιρὶ or Θασούρ, an equally mistaken
form. The Chaldee has "over the tribe of Asher," which is also
unsuitable, unless we include the whole of the northern portion of
Canaan, including the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali. But there is no
proof that the name Asher was ever extended to the territory of the
three northern tribes. We should be rather disposed to agree with
Bachienne, who supposes it to refer to the city of Asher ([Jos
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007).md) and its territory, as this city
was in the south-east of Jezreel, and Abner may possibly have conquered
this district for Ishbosheth with Gilead as a base, before he ventured
to dispute the government of Israel with the Philistines, if only we
could discover any reason why the inhabitants ("the Ashurites") should
be mentioned instead of the city Asher, or if it were at all likely that
one city should be introduced in the midst of a number of large
districts. The Syriac and Vulgate have Geshuri, and therefore seem to
have read or conjectured הגּשׁוּרי; and Thenius decides in favour of
this, understanding the name Geshur to refer to the most northerly
portion of the land on both sides of the Jordan, from Mount Hermon to
the Lake of Gennesareth (as in [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md); [Jos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005.md); [Jos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013.md); [Ch1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#023).md). But no such usage of speech can
be deduced from any of these passages, as Geshuri is used there to
denote the land of the Geshurites, on the north-east of Bashan, which
had a king of its own in the time of David (see at [Sa2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003).md), and which Abner would certainly
never have thought of conquering.)

"And for Jezreel," i.e., not merely the city of that name, but the plain
that was named after it (as in [Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001).md). "And for Ephraim, and Benjamin,
and all (the rest of) Israel," of course not including Judah, where
David had already been acknowledged as king.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 2:10</span></span>

Length of the reigns of Ishbosheth over Israel, and David at Hebron. The
age of Ishbosheth is given, as is generally the case at the commencement
of a reign. He was forty years old when he began to reign, and reigned
two years; whereas David was king at Hebron over the house of Judah
seven years and a half. We are struck with this difference in the length
of the two reigns; and it cannot be explained, as Seb. Schmidt,
Clericus, and others suppose, on the simple assumption that David
reigned two years at Hebron over Judah, namely up to the time of the
murder of Ishbosheth, and then five years and a half over Israel, namely
up to the time of the conquest of Jerusalem: for this is at variance
with the plain statement in the text, that "David was king in Hebron
over the house of Judah seven years and a half." The opinion that the
two years of Ishbosheth's reign are to be reckoned up to the time of the
war with David, because Abner played the principal part during the other
five years and a half that David continued to reign at Hebron, is
equally untenable. We may see very clearly from 2 Samuel 3-5 not only
that Ishbosheth was king to the time of his death, which took place
after that of Abner, but also that after both these events David was
anointed king over Israel in Hebron by all the tribes, and that he then
went directly to attack Jerusalem, and after conquering the citadel of
Zion, chose that city as his own capital. The short duration of
Ishbosheth's reign can only be explained, therefore, on the supposition
that he was not made king, as David was, immediately after the death of
Saul, but after the recovery by Abner of the land which the Philistines
had taken on this side the Jordan, which may have occupied five years.

(Note: From the fact that in [Sa2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010.md), [Sa2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#011.md), Ishbosheth's ascending the
throne is mentioned before that of David, and is also accompanied with a
statement of his age, whereas the age of David is not given till [Sa2
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004.md), when he became king over all
Israel, Ewald draws the erroneous conclusion that the earlier (?)
historian regarded Ishbosheth as the true king, and David as a
pretender. But the very opposite of this is stated as distinctly as
possible in [Sa2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004.md). (compared with
[Sa2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008).md). The fact that Ishbosheth is
mentioned before David in [Sa2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010.md)
may be explained simply enough from the custom so constantly observed in
the book of Genesis, of mentioning subordinate lines or subordinate
persons first, and stating whatever seemed worth recording with regard
to them, in order that the ground might be perfectly clear for relating
the history of the principal characters without any interruption.)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 2:12</span></span>

War between the supporters of Ishbosheth and those of David. - [Sa2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#012.md), [Sa2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#013.md). When Abner had brought all
Israel under the dominion of Ishbosheth, he also sought to make Judah
subject to him, and went with this intention from Mahanaim to Gibeon,
the present Jib, in the western portion of the tribe of Benjamin, two
good hours to the north of Jerusalem (see at [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003).md), taking with him the servants,
i.e., the fighting men, of Ishbosheth. There Joab, a son of Zeruiah,
David's sister ([Ch1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#016).md), advanced
to meet him with the servants, i.e., the warriors of David; and the two
armies met at the pool of Gibeon, i.e., probably one of the large
reservoirs that are still to be found there (see Rob. Pal. ii. pp.
135-6; Tobler, Topogr. v. Jerusalem, ii. pp. 515-6), the one encamping
upon the one side of the pool and the other upon the other.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 2:14</span></span>

Abner then proposed to Joab that the contest should be decided by a
single combat, probably for the purpose of avoiding an actual civil war.
"Let the young men arise and wrestle before us." שׂחק, to joke or play,
is used here to denote the war-play of single combat. As Joab accepted
this proposal, twelve young warriors for Benjamin and Ishbosheth, and
twelve from David's men, went over, i.e., went out of the two camps to
the appointed scene of conflict; "and one seized the other's head, and
his sword was (immediately) in the side of the other (his antagonist),
so that they fell together." The clause רעהוּ בּצד וחרבּו is a
circumstantial clause: and his sword (every one's sword) was in the side
of the other, i.e., thrust into it. Sending the sword into the
opponent's side is thus described as simultaneous with the seizure of
his head. The ancient translators expressed the meaning by supplying a
verb (ἐνέπηξαν, defixit: lxx, Vulg.). This was a sign that the young men
on both sides fought with great ferocity, and also with great courage.
The place itself received the name of Helkath-hazzurim, "field of the
sharp edges," in consequence (for this use of zur, see [Psa
89:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#044).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 2:17</span></span>

As this single combat decided nothing, there followed a general and very
sore or fierce battle, in which Abner and his troops were put to flight
by the soldiers of David. The only thing connected with this, of which
we have any further account, is the slaughter of Asahel by Abner, which
is mentioned here ([Sa2 2:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018).md) on
account of the important results which followed. Of the three sons of
Zeruiah, viz., Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, Asahel was peculiarly light of
foot, like one of the gazelles; and he pursued Abner most eagerly,
without turning aside to the right or to the left.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 2:20</span></span>

Then Abner turned round, asked him whether he was Asahel, and said to
him, "Turn to thy right hand or to thy left, and seize one of the young
men and take his armour for thyself," i.e., slay one of the common
soldiers, and take his accoutrements as booty, if thou art seeking for
that kind of fame. But Asahel would not turn back from Abner. Then he
repeated his command that he would depart, and added, "Why should I
smite thee to the ground, and how could I then lift up my face to Joab
thy brother?" from which we may see that Abner did not want to put the
young hero to death, out of regard for Joab and their former friendship.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 2:23</span></span>

But when he still refused to depart in spite of this warning, Abner
wounded him in the abdomen with the hinder part, i.e., the lower end of
the spear, so that the spear came out behind, and Asahel fell dead upon
the spot. The lower end of the spear appears to have been pointed, that
it might be stuck into the ground (vid., [Sa1
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#007).md); and this will explain the fact
that the spear passed through the body. The fate of the young hero
excited such sympathy, that all who came to the place where he had
fallen stood still to mourn his loss (cf. [Sa2
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#012).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 2:24</span></span>

But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner till the sun set, and until they had
arrived at the hill Ammah, in front of Giah, on the way to the desert of
Gibeon. Nothing further is known of the places mentioned here.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 2:25</span></span>

The Benjaminites then gathered in a crowd behind Abner, and halted upon
the top of a hill to beat back their pursuers; and Abner cried out to
Joab, "Shall the sword then devour for ever (shall there be no end to
the slaughter)? dost thou not know that bitterness arises at last? and
how long wilt thou not say to the people, to return from pursuing their
brethren?" Thus Abner warns Joab of the consequences of a desperate
struggle, and calls upon him to put an end to all further bloodshed by
suspending the pursuit.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 2:27</span></span>

Joab replied, "If thou hadst not spoken (i.e., challenged to single
combat, [Sa2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#014).md), the people would
have gone away in the morning, every one from his brother," i.e., there
would have been no such fratricidal conflict at all. The first כּי
introduces the substance of the oath, as in [Sa1
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#034.md); the second gives greater force
to it (vid., Ewald, 330, b.). Thus Joab threw all the blame of the fight
upon Abner, because he had been the instigator of the single combat; and
as that was not decisive, and was so bloody in its character, the two
armies had felt obliged to fight it out. But he then commanded the
trumpet to be blown for a halt, and the pursuit to be closed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 2:29</span></span>

Abner proceeded with his troops through the Arabah, i.e., the valley of
the Jordan, marching the whole night; and then crossing the river, went
through the whole of Bithron back to Mahanaim. Bithron is a district
upon the eastern side of the Jordan, which is only mentioned here.
Aquila and the Vulgate identify it with Bethhoron; but there is no more
foundation for this than for the suggestion of Thenius, that it is the
same place as Bethharam, the later Libias, at the mouth of the Nahr
Hesbn (see at [Num 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#036).md). It is very
evident that Bithron is not the name of a city, but of a district, from
the fact that it is preceded by the word all, which would be perfectly
unmeaning in the case of a city. The meaning of the word is a cutting;
and it was no doubt the name given to some ravine in the neighbourhood
of the Jabbok, between the Jordan and Mahanaim, which was on the north
side of the Jabbok.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 2:30</span></span>

Joab also assembled his men for a retreat. Nineteen of his soldiers were
missing besides Asahel, all of whom had fallen in the battle. But they
had slain as many as three hundred and sixty of Benjamin and of Abner's
men. This striking disproportion in the numbers may be accounted for
from the fact that in Joab's army there were none but brave and
well-tried men, who had gathered round David a long time before; whereas
in Abner's army there were only the remnants of the Israelites who had
been beaten upon Gilboa, and who had been still further weakened and
depressed by their attempts to recover the land which was occupied by
the Philistines.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 2:32</span></span>

On the way back, David's men took up the body of Asahel, and buried it
in his father's grave at Bethlehem. They proceeded thence towards
Hebron, marching the whole night, so that they reached Hebron itself at
daybreak. "It got light to them (i.e., the day dawned) at Hebron."
