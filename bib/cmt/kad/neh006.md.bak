### [Nehemiah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 6:1</span></span>

When Sanballat and the enemies associated with him were unable to
obstruct the building of the wall of Jerusalem by Open violence (Neh 4),
they endeavoured to ruin Nehemiah by secret snares. They invited him to
meet them in the plain of Ono ([Neh
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001.md), [Neh
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#002).md); but Nehemiah, perceiving that
they intended mischief, replied to them by messengers, that he could not
come to them on account of the building. After receiving for the fourth
time this refusal, Sanballat sent his servant to Nehemiah with an open
letter, in which he accused him of rebellion against the king of Persia.
Nehemiah, however, repelled this accusation as the invention of
Sanballat ([Neh 6:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#003).md). Tobiah and
Sanballat, moreover, hired a false prophet to make Nehemiah flee into
the temple from fear of the snares prepared for him, that they might
then be able to calumniate him ([Neh
6:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#010).md). The building of the wall was
completed in fifty-two days, and the enemies were disheartened ([Neh
6:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#015).md), although at that time many
nobles of Judah had entered into epistolary correspondence with Tobiah,
to obstruct the proceedings of Nehemiah ([Neh
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#018.md), [Neh
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#019).md).

[Neh 6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001.md)

The attempts of Sanballat and his associates to ruin Nehemiah. - [Neh
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001.md), [Neh
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#002.md). When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem
the Arabian, and the rest of the enemies, heard that the wall was built,
and that no breaches were left therein, though the doors were then not
yet set up in the gates, he sent, etc. לו נשׁמע, it was heard by him, in
the indefinite sense of: it came to his ears. The use of the passive is
more frequent in later Hebrew; comp. [Neh
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#006.md), [Neh
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#007.md), [Neh
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#027.md); [Est
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#020.md), and elsewhere. On Sanballat and
his allies, see remarks on [Neh 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019.md).
The "rest of our enemies" were, according to [Neh
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md) ([Neh
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007), A.V..md), Ashdodites, and also other
hostile individuals. וגו העת עד גּם introduces a parenthetical sentence
limiting the statement already made: Nevertheless, down to that time I
had not set up the doors in the gates. The wall-building was quite
finished, but doors to the gates were as yet wanting to the complete
fortification of the city. The enemies sent to him, saying, Come, let us
meet together (for a discussion) in the villages in the valley of Ono. -
In [Neh 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#007.md), נוּערה of the present
verse. The form כּפרים, elsewhere only כּפר, [Ch1
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025.md), or כּפר, village, [Sa1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#018.md), occurs only here. כּפירה,
however, being found [Ezr 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#025.md) and
elsewhere as a proper name, the form כּפיר seems to have been in use as
well as כּפר. There is no valid ground for regarding כּפרים as the
proper name of a special locality. To make their proposal appear
impartial, they leave the appointment of the place in the valley of Ono
to Nehemiah. Ono seems, according to [Ch1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md), to have been situate in the
neighbourhood of Lod (Lydda), and is therefore identified by Van de
Velde (Mem. p. 337) and Bertheau with Kefr Ana (Arab. kfr ‛ânâ) or Kefr
Anna, one and three-quarter leagues north of Ludd. But no certain
information concerning the position of the place can be obtained from
[Ch1 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012.md); and Roediger (in the
Hallische Lit. Zeitung, 1842, No. 71, p. 665) is more correct, in
accordance both with the orthography and the sense, in comparing it with
Beit Unia (Arab. byt ûniya), north-west of Jerusalem, not far from
Beitin (Bethel); comp. Rob. Pal. ii. p. 351. The circumstance that the
plain of Ono was, according to the present verse, somewhere between
Jerusalem and Samaria, which suits Beit Unia, but not Kefr Ana (comp.
Arnold in Herzog's Realenc. xii. p. 759), is also in favour of the
latter view. "But they thought to do me harm." Probably they wanted to
make him a prisoner, perhaps even to assassinate him.

[Neh 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#003.md)

Nehemiah sent messengers to them, saying: "I am doing a great work, and
I cannot come down thither. Why should the work cease whilst I leave it
and come down to you?" That is, he let them know that he could not
undertake the journey, because his presence in Jerusalem was necessary
for the uninterrupted prosecution of the work of building.

[Neh 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#004.md)

They sent to him four times in the same manner (הזּה כּדּבר, comp. [Sa2
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#006).md), and Nehemiah gave them the same
answer.

[Neh 6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#005.md)

Then Sanballat sent his servant in this manner, the fifth time, with an
open letter, in which was written: "It is reported (נשׁמע, it is heard)
among the nations, and Gashmu saith, (that) thou and the Jews intend to
rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall, and thou wilt be their
king, according to these words." "The nations" are naturally the nations
dwelling in the land, in the neighbourhood of the Jewish community. On
the form Gashmu, comp. rem. on [Neh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019.md). הוה, the particip., is used of
that which any one intends or prepares to do: thou art intending to
become their king. על־כּן, therefore, for no other reason than to rebel,
dost thou build the wall.

[Neh 6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#007.md)

It was further said in the letter: "Thou hast also appointed prophets to
proclaim concerning thee in Jerusalem, saying, King of Judah; and now it
will be reported to the king according to these words (or things). Come,
therefore, and let us take counsel together," sc. to refute these things
as groundless rumours. By such accusations in an open letter, which
might be read by any one, Sanballat thought to oblige Nehemiah to come
and clear himself from suspicion by an interview.

[Neh 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#008.md)

Nehemiah, however, saw through his stratagem, and sent word to him by a
messenger: "There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou
feignest them out of thine own heart." בּודאם, a contraction of בּודאם,
from בּדא, which occurs again only in [Kg1
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#033.md), to invent, to feign, especially
evil things.

[Neh 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#009.md)

"For," adds Nehemiah when writing of these things, "they all desired to
make us afraid, thinking (לאמר) their hands will cease from the work,
that it be not done." The last words, "And now strengthen my hands," are
to be explained by the fact that Nehemiah hastily transports himself
into the situation and feelings of those days when he prayed to God for
strength. To make this request fit into the train of thought, we must
supply: I however thought, or said, Strengthen, O God, my hands. חזּק is
imperative. The translation, in the first pers. sing. of the imperfect,
"I strengthened" (lxx, Vulg., Syr.), is only an attempt to fit into
their context words not understood by the translators.

[Nehemiah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 6:10</span></span>

A false prophet, hired by Tobiah and Sanballat, also sought, by
prophesying that the enemies of Nehemiah would kill him in the night, to
cause him to flee with him into the holy place of the temple, and to
protect his life from the machinations of his enemies by closing the
temple doors. His purpose was, as Nehemiah subsequently learned, to
seduce him into taking an illegal step, and so give occasion for
speaking evil of him.

[Neh 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#010.md)

"And I came into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of
Mehetabeel, who was shut up." Nothing further is known of this prophet
Shemaiah. From what is here related we learn, that he was one of the
lying prophets employed by Sanballat and Tobiah to ruin Nehemiah. We are
not told what induced or caused Nehemiah to go into the house of
Shemaiah; he merely recounts what the latter was hired by his enemies to
effect. From the accessory clause, "and he was shut up," we may perhaps
infer that Shemaiah in some way or other, perhaps by announcing that he
had something of importance to communicate, persuaded Nehemiah to visit
him at his house. עצוּר והוּא does not, however, involved the meaning
which Bertheau gives it, viz., that Nehemiah went to Shemaiah's house,
because the latter as עצוּר could not come to him. The phrase says only,
that when Nehemiah entered Shemaiah's house, he found him עצוּר, which
simply means shut up, shut in his house, not imprisoned, and still less
in a state of ceremonial uncleanness (Ewald), or overpowered by the hand
of Jahve - laid hold on by a higher power (Bertheau). It is evident from
his proposal to Nehemiah, "Let us go together to the house of God,"
etc., that he was neither imprisoned in his house, nor prevented by any
physical cause from leaving home. Hence it follows that he had shut
himself in his house, to intimate to Nehemiah that also he felt his life
in danger through the machinations of his enemies, and that he was thus
dissimulating in order the more easily to induce him to agree to his
proposal, that they should together escape the snares laid for them by
fleeing to the temple. In this case, it may be uncertain whether
Shemaiah had shut himself up, feigning that the enemies of Judah were
seeking his life also, as the prophet of Jahve; or whether by this
action he was symbolically announcing what God charged him to make known
to Nehemiah. Either view is possible; while the circumstance that
Nehemiah in [Neh 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#012.md) calls his advice
to flee into the temple a נבוּאה against him, and that it was quite in
character with the proceedings of such false prophets to enforce their
words by symbolical signs (comp. [Kg1
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011).md), favours the former. The going
into the house of God is more closely defined by ההיכל אל־תּוך, within
the holy place; for they (the enemies) will come to slay thee, and
indeed this night will they come to slay thee." He seeks to corroborate
his warning as a special revelation from God, by making it appear that
God had not only made known to him the design of the enemies, but also
the precise time at which they intended to carry it into execution.

[Neh 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#011.md)

Nehemiah, however, was not to be alarmed thereby, but exclaimed: Should
such a man as I flee? and what man like me could go into the holy place
and live? I will not go in. וחי is the perf. with Vav consecutive: that
he may live. This word is ambiguous; it may mean: to save his life, or:
and save his life, not, expiate such a transgression of the law with his
life. Probably Nehemiah used it in the latter sense, having in mind the
command, [Num 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#007.md), that the stranger
that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

[Neh 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#012.md)

And I perceived, - viz. from the conduct of Shemaiah on my refusal to
follow his advice, - and, lo, not God had sent him (i.e., had not
commissioned or inspired him to speak these words; לא emphatically
precedes אלהים: not God, but himself), but that he pronounced this
prophecy against me, because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. The
verb שׂכרו (sing.) agrees only with the latter word, although in fact it
refers to both these individuals.

[Neh 6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#013.md)

"On this account was he hired that I might be afraid, and do so; and if
I had sinned (by entering the holy place), it (my sin) would have been
to them for an evil report, that they might defame me." The use of למאן
before two sentences, the second of which expresses the purpose of the
first, is peculiar: for this purpose, that I might fear, etc., was he
hired. To enter and to shut himself within the holy place would have
been a grave desecration of the house of God, which would have given
occasion to his enemies to cast suspicion upon Nehemiah as a despiser of
God's commands, and so to undermine his authority with the people. - In
[Neh 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014.md) Nehemiah concludes his
account of the stratagems of his enemies, with the wish that God would
think upon them according to their works. In expressing it, he names,
besides Tobiah and Sanballat, the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the
prophets who, like Shemaiah, would have put him in fear: whence we
perceive, 1st, that the case related ([Neh
6:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#010).md) is given as only one of the
chief events of the kind (מיראים, like [Neh
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#009.md), [Neh
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#019).md); and 2nd, that false prophets
were again busy in the congregation, as in the period preceding the
captivity, and seeking to seduce the people from hearkening to the voice
of the true prophets of God, who preached repentance and conversation as
the conditions of prosperity.

[Nehemiah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 6:15</span></span>

The wall completed, and the impression made by this work upon the
enemies of the Jews. - [Neh 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#015.md) The
wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, i.e., of
the sixth month, in fifty-two days. According to this statement, it must
have been begun on the third day of the fifth month (Ab). The year is
not mentioned, the before-named ([Neh
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001).md) twentieth year of Artaxerxes
being intended. This agrees with the other chronological statements of
this book. For, according to [Neh 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md),
it was in Nisan (the first month) of this year that Nehemiah entreated
permission of the king to go to Jerusalem; and we learn from [Neh
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014.md) and [Neh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006.md) that he was governor in Jerusalem
from the twentieth year onwards, and must therefore have set out for
that place immediately after receiving the royal permission. In this
case, he might well arrive in Jerusalem before the expiration of the
fourth month. He then surveyed the wall, and called a public assembly
for the purpose of urging the whole community to enter heartily upon the
work of restoration ([Neh 2:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#011).md).
All this might take place in the course of the fourth month, so that the
work could be actually taken in hand in the fifth. Nor is there any
reasonable ground, as Bertheau has already shown, for doubting the
correctness of the statement, that the building was completed in
fifty-two days, and (with Ewald) altering the fifty-two days into two
years and four months.

(Note: Ewald, Gesch. iv. p. 178, thinks that traces of the correct
reading of this verse are found in the statement of Josephus, Ant. xi.
5. 7f., that the wall of Jerusalem was finished in two years and four
months, and that the word וּשׁנתים may have been omitted from [Neh
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#015.md) by an ancient clerical error,
though he is obliged to admit that Josephus in other instances gives no
trustworthy dates concerning Nehemiah, whom he makes arrive at Jerusalem
in the twenty-fifth, and complete the wall in the twenty-eight year of
Xerxes. On the other hand, Bertheau has already remarked, that even if
שׁנתים is supplied, no agreement with the statement of Josephus is
obtained, since the question still remains how four months can be made
out of fifty-two days, or vice versa, fifty-two days of four months. In
fact, it is vain to seek for any common ground on which these two
different statements can be harmonized; and hence the two years and four
months of Josephus can scarcely be regarded as furnishing traces of
another reading of the text.)

For we must in this case consider, 1st, the necessity for hastening the
work repeatedly pointed out by Nehemiah; 2nd, the zeal and relatively
very large number of builders - the whole community, both the
inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Jericho, Tekoa, Gibeon, Mizpah,
etc. having combined their efforts; 3rd, that the kind of exertion
demanded by such laborious work and unintermitted watchfulness as are
described Neh 4, though it might be continued for fifty-two days, could
scarcely endure during a longer period; and lastly, the amount of the
work itself, which must not be regarded as the rebuilding of the whole
wall, but only as the restoration of those portions that had been
destroyed, the repair of the breaches ([Neh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md); [Neh
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#013.md); [Neh
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001).md), and of the ruined gates, - a
large portion of wall and at least one gate having remained uninjured.).
To this must be added that the material, so far as stone was concerned,
was close at hand, stone needing for the most part to be merely brought
out of the ruins; besides which, materials of all kind might have been
collected and prepared beforehand. It is, moreover, incorrect to compute
the extent of this fortified wall by the extent of the wall of modern
Jerusalem.

[Neh 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#016.md)

The news that the wall was finished spread fear among the enemies, viz.,
among the nations in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem (comp. [Neh
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md); [Neh
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#009).md); they were much cast down, and
perceived "that this work was effected with the help of our God." The
expression בעניהם יפּלוּ occurs only here, and must be explained
according to פּניו יפּלוּ, his countenance fell ([Gen
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#005).md), and לב יפּל, the heart fails
(i.e., the courage) ([Sa1 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#032).md): they
sank in their own eyes, i.e., they felt themselves cast down,
discouraged.

[Nehemiah 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 6:17</span></span>

To this Nehemiah adds the supplementary remark, that in those days even
nobles of Judah were in alliance and active correspondence with Tobiah,
because he had married into a respectable Jewish family.

[Neh 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#017.md)

"Also in those days the nobles of Judah wrote many letters (אגּרתיהם
מרבּים, they made many, multiplied, their letters) passing to Tobiah,
and those of Tobiah came to them."

[Neh 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#018.md)

For many in Judah were sworn unto him, for he was the son-in-law of
Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken (to wife) the
daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. In this case Tobiah was
connected with two Jewish families, - a statement which is made to
confirm the fact that many in Judah were שׁבוּעה בּעלי, associates of an
oath, joined to him by an oath, not allies in consequence of a treaty
sworn to (Bertheau). From this reason being given, we may conclude his
affinity by marriage was confirmed by an oath. Shecaniah ben Arah was
certainly a respectable Jew of the race of Arah, [Ezr
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#005.md). Meshullam ben Berechiah appears
among those who shared in the work of building, [Neh
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#004.md) and [Neh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#030.md). According to [Neh
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004.md), the high priest Eliashib was
also related to Tobiah. From the fact that both Tobiah and his son
Jehohanan have genuine Jewish names, Bertheau rightly infers that they
were probably descended from Israelites of the northern kingdom of the
ten tribes. With this the designation of Tobiah as "the Ammonite" may be
harmonized by the supposition that his more recent or remote ancestors
were naturalized Ammonites.

[Neh 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#019.md)

"Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to
him." טּובתיו, the good things in him, or "his good qualities and
intentions" (Bertheau). The subject of the sentence is the nobles of
Judah. לו מוציאים, they were bringing forth to him. On this matter
Bertheau remarks, that there is no reason for assuming that the nobles
of Judah endeavoured, by misrepresenting and distorting the words of
Nehemiah, to widen the breach between him and Tobiah. This is certainly
true; but, at the same time, we cannot further infer from these words
that they were trying to effect an understanding between the two, and
representing to Nehemiah how dangerous and objectionable his undertaking
was; but were by this very course playing into the hands of Tobiah. For
an understanding between two individuals, hostile the one to the other,
is not to be brought about by reporting to the one what is the other's
opinion of him. Finally, Nehemiah mentions also that Tobiah also sent
letters to put him in fear (יראני, infin. Piel, like [Ch2
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#018.md); comp. the participle above,
[Neh 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#009.md) and [Neh
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014).md). The letters were probably of
similar contents with the letter of Sanballat given in [Neh
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#006.md).
