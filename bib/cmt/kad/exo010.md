### [Exodus Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 10:1</span></span>

The eighth plague; the Locusts. - [Exo
10:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#001.md). As Pharaoh's pride still
refused to bend to the will of God, Moses was directed to announce
another, and in some respects a more fearful, plague. At the same time
God strengthened Moses' faith, by telling him that the hardening of
Pharaoh and his servants was decreed by Him, that these signs might be
done among them, and that Israel might perceive by this to all
generations that He was Jehovah (cf. [Exo
7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003).md). We may learn from Ps 78 and
105 in what manner the Israelites narrated these signs to their children
and children's children. אתת שׁית, to set or prepare signs ([Exo
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#001).md), is interchanged with שׂוּם
([Exo 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#002).md) in the same sense (vid.,
[Exo 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#012).md). The suffix in בּקרבּו
([Exo 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#001).md) refers to Egypt as a
country; and that in בּם ([Exo 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#002).md)
to the Egyptians. In the expression, "thou mayest tell," Moses is
addressed as the representative of the nation. התעלּל: to have to do
with a person, generally in a bad sense, to do him harm ([Sa1
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004).md). "How I have put forth My might"
(De Wette).

[Exodus 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 10:3</span></span>

As Pharaoh had acknowledged, when the previous plague was sent, that
Jehovah was righteous ([Exo 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027).md), his
crime was placed still more strongly before him: "How long wilt thou
refuse to humble thyself before Me?" (לענת for להענת, as in [Exo
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#024).md).

[Exodus 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 10:4</span></span>

To punish this obstinate refusal, Jehovah would bring locusts in such
dreadful swarms as Egypt had never known before, which would eat up all
the plants left by the hail, and even fill the houses. "They will cover
the eye of the earth." This expression, which is peculiar to the
Pentateuch, and only occurs again in [Exo
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#015.md) and [Num
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005.md), [Num
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#011.md), is based upon the ancient and
truly poetic idea, that the earth, with its covering of plants, looks up
to man. To substitute the rendering "surface" for the "eye," is to
destroy the real meaning of the figure; "face" is better. It was in the
swarms that actually hid the ground that the fearful character of the
plague consisted, as the swarms of locusts consume everything green.
"The residue of the escape" is still further explained as "that which
remaineth unto you from the hail," viz., the spelt and wheat, and all
the vegetables that were left ([Exo
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#012.md) and [Exo
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#015).md). For "all the trees that
sprout" ([Exo 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#005).md), we find in [Exo
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#015.md), "all the tree-fruits and
everything green upon the trees."

[Exodus 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 10:7</span></span>

The announcement of such a plague of locusts, as their forefathers had
never seen before since their existence upon earth, i.e., since the
creation of man ([Exo 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#006).md), put the
servants of Pharaoh in such fear, that they tried to persuade the king
to let the Israelites go. "How long shall this (Moses) be a snare to
us?...Seest thou not yet, that Egypt is destroyed?" מוקשׁ, a snare or
trap for catching animals, is a figurative expression for destruction.
האנשׁים ([Exo 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007).md) does not mean the
men, but the people. The servants wished all the people to be allowed to
go as Moses had desired; but Pharaoh would only consent to the departure
of the men (הגּברים, [Exo 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#011).md).

[Exo 10:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#008.md)

As Moses had left Pharaoh after announcing the plague, he was fetched
back again along with Aaron, in consequence of the appeal made to the
king by his servants, and asked by the king, how many wanted to go to
the feast. ומי מי, "who and who still further are the going ones;" i.e.,
those who wish to go? Moses required the whole nation to depart, without
regard to age or sex, along with all their flocks and herds. He
mentioned "young and old, sons and daughters;" the wives as belonging to
the men being included in the "we." Although he assigned a reason for
this demand, viz., that they were to hold a feast to Jehovah, Pharaoh
was so indignant, that he answered scornfully at first: "Be it so;
Jehovah be with you when I let you and your little ones go;" i.e., may
Jehovah help you in the same way in which I let you and your little ones
go. This indicated contempt not only for Moses and Aaron, but also for
Jehovah, who had nevertheless proved Himself, by His manifestations of
mighty power, to be a God who would not suffer Himself to be trifled
with. After this utterance of his ill-will, Pharaoh told the messengers
of God that he could see through their intention. "Evil is before your
face;" i.e., you have evil in view. He called their purpose an evil one,
because they wanted to withdraw the people from his service. "Not so,"
i.e., let it not be as you desire. "Go then, you men, and serve
Jehovah." But even this concession was not seriously meant. This is
evident from the expression, "Go then," in which the irony is
unmistakeable; and still more so from the fact, that with these words he
broke off all negotiation with Moses and Aaron, and drove them from his
presence. ויגרשׁ: "one drove them forth;" the subject is not expressed,
because it is clear enough that the royal servants who were present were
the persons who drove them away. "For this are ye seeking:" אתהּ relates
simply to the words "serve Jehovah," by which the king understood the
sacrificial festival, for which in his opinion only the men could be
wanted; not that "he supposed the people for whom Moses had asked
permission to go, to mean only the men" (Knobel). The restriction of the
permission to depart to the men alone was pure caprice; for even the
Egyptians, according to Herodotus (2, 60), held religious festivals at
which the women were in the habit of accompanying the men.

[Exodus 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 10:12</span></span>

After His messengers had been thus scornfully treated, Jehovah directed
Moses to bring the threatened plague upon the land. "Stretch out thy
hand over the land of Egypt with locusts;" i.e., so that the locusts may
come. עלה, to go up: the word used for a hostile invasion. The locusts
are represented as an army, as in [Joe
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006.md). Locusts were not an unknown
scourge in Egypt; and in the case before us they were brought, as usual,
by the wind. The marvellous character of the phenomenon was, that when
Moses stretched out his hand over Egypt with the staff, Jehovah caused
an east wind to blow over the land, which blew a day and a night, and
the next morning brought the locusts ("brought:" inasmuch as the swarms
of locusts are really brought by the wind).

[Exo 10:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#013.md)

"An east wind: not νότος (lxx), the south wind, as Bochart supposed.
Although the swarms of locusts are generally brought into Egypt from
Libya or Ethiopia, and therefore by a south or south-west wind, they are
sometimes brought by the east wind from Arabia, as Denon and others have
observed (Hgstb. p. 120). The fact that the wind blew a day and a night
before bringing the locusts, showed that they came from a great
distance, and therefore proved to the Egyptians that the omnipotence of
Jehovah reached far beyond the borders of Egypt, and ruled over every
land. Another miraculous feature in this plague was its unparalleled
extent, viz., over the whole of the land of Egypt, whereas ordinary
swarms are confined to particular districts. In this respect the
judgment had no equal either before or afterwards ([Exo
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#014).md). The words, "Before them there
were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such," must
not be diluted into "a hyperbolical and proverbial saying, implying that
there was no recollection of such noxious locusts," as it is by
Rosenmller. This passage is not at variance with [Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md), for the former relates to Egypt,
the latter to the land of Israel; and Joel's description unquestionably
refers to the account before us, the meaning being, that quite as
terrible a judgment would fall upon Judah and Israel as had formerly
been inflicted upon Egypt and the obdurate Pharaoh. In its dreadful
character, this Egyptian plague is a type of the plagues which will
precede the last judgment, and forms the groundwork for the description
in [Rev 9:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#003.md); just as Joel discerned
in the plagues which burst upon Judah in his own day a presage of the
day of the Lord ([Joe 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md); [Joe
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001).md), i.e., of the great day of
judgment, which is advancing step by step in all the great judgments of
history or rather of the conflict between the kingdom of God and the
powers of this world, and will be finally accomplished in the last
general judgment.

[Exo 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#015.md)

The darkening of the land, and the eating up of all the green plants by
swarms of locusts, have been described by many eye-witnesses of such
plagues. "Locustarum plerumque tanta conspicitur in Africa frequentia,
ut volantes instar nebulae solis radios operiant" (Leo Afric). "Solemque
obumbrant" (Pliny, h. n. ii. 29).

[Exodus 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 10:16</span></span>

This plague, which even Pliny calls Deorum irae pestis, so terrified
Pharaoh, that he sent for Moses and Aaron in haste, confessed his sin
against Jehovah and them, and entreated them but this once more to
procure, through their intercession with Jehovah their God, the
forgiveness of his sin and the removal of "this death." He called the
locusts death, as bringing death and destruction, and ruining the
country. Mors etiam agrorum est et herbarum atque arborum, as Bochart
observes with references to [Gen
47:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#019.md); [Job
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#008.md); [Psa
78:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#046.md).

[Exodus 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 10:18</span></span>

To show the hardened king the greatness of the divine long-suffering,
Moses prayed to the Lord, and the Lord cast the locusts into the Red Sea
by a strong west wind. The expression "Jehovah turned a very strong west
wind" is a concise form, for "Jehovah turned the wind into a very strong
west wind." The fact that locusts do perish in the sea is attested by
many authorities. Gregatim sublatae vento in maria aut stagna decidunt
(Pliny); many others are given by Bochart and Volney. ויּתקעהוּ: He
thrust them, i.e., drove them with irresistible force, into the Red Sea.
The Red Sea is called סוּף ים, according to the ordinary supposition, on
account of the quantity of sea-weed which floats upon the water and lies
upon the shore; but Knobel traces the name to a town which formerly
stood at the head of the gulf, and derived its name from the weed, and
supports his opinion by the omission of the article before Suph, though
without being able to prove that any such town really existed in the
earlier times of the Pharaohs.

[Exodus 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 10:21</span></span>

Ninth plague: The Darkness. - As Pharaoh's defiant spirit was not broken
yet, a continuous darkness came over all the land of Egypt, with the
exception of Goshen, without any previous announcement, and came in such
force that the darkness could be felt. חשׁך וימשׁ: "and one shall feel,
grasp darkness." המשׁ: as in [Psa
115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007.md); [Jdg
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#026), ψηλαφητὸν σκότος (lxx.md); not
"feel in the dark," for משׁשׁ has this meaning only in the Piel with בּ
([Deu 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029).md). אפלה חשׁך: darkness of
obscurity, i.e., the deepest darkness. The combination of two words or
synonyms gives the greatest intensity to the thought. The darkness was
so great that they could not see one another, and no one rose up from
his place. The Israelites alone "had light in their dwelling-places."
The reference here is not to the houses; so that we must not infer that
the Egyptians were unable to kindle any lights even in their houses. The
cause of this darkness is not given in the text; but the analogy of the
other plagues, which had all of them a natural basis, warrants us in
assuming, as most commentators have done, that there was the same here -
that it was in fact the Chamsin, to which the lxx evidently allude in
their rendering: σκότος καὶ γνόφος καὶ θύελλα. This wind, which
generally blows in Egypt before and after the vernal equinox and lasts
two or three days, usually rises very suddenly, and fills the air with
such a quantity of fine dust and coarse sand, that the sun loses its
brightness, the sky is covered with a dense veil, and it becomes so dark
that "the obscurity cause by the thickest fog in our autumn and winter
days is nothing in comparison" (Schubert). Both men and animals hide
themselves from this storm; and the inhabitants of the towns and
villages shut themselves up in the innermost rooms and cellars of their
houses till it is over, for the dust penetrates even through well-closed
windows. For fuller accounts taken from travels, see Hengstenberg (pp.
120ff.) and Robinson's Palestine i. pp. 287-289. Seetzen attributes the
rising of the dust to a quantity of electrical fluid contained in the
air. - The fact that in this case the darkness alone is mentioned, may
have arisen from its symbolical importance. "The darkness which covered
the Egyptians, and the light which shone upon the Israelites, were types
of the wrath and grace of God" (Hengstenberg). This occurrence, in
which, according to Arabian chroniclers of the middle ages, the nations
discerned a foreboding of the day of judgment or of the resurrection,
filled the king with such alarm that he sent for Moses, and told him he
would let the people and their children go, but the cattle must be left
behind. יצּג: sistatur, let it be placed, deposited in certain places
under the guard of Egyptians, as a pledge of your return. Maneat in
pignus, quod reversuri sitis, as Chaskuni correctly paraphrases it. But
Moses insisted upon the cattle being taken for the sake of their
sacrifices and burnt-offerings. "Not a hoof shall be left behind." This
was a proverbial expression for "not the smallest fraction." Bochart
gives instances of a similar introduction of the "hoof" into proverbial
sayings by both Arabians and Romans (Hieroz. i. p. 490). This firmness
on the part of Moses he defended by saying, "We know not with what we
shall serve the Lord, till we come thither;" i.e., we know not yet what
kind of animals or how many we shall require for the sacrifices; our God
will not make this known to us till we arrive at the place of sacrifice.
עבד with a double accusative as in [Gen
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#029.md); to serve any one with a thing.

[Exodus 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 10:27</span></span>

At this demand, Pharaoh, with the hardness suspended over him by God,
fell into such wrath, that he sent Moses away, and threatened him with
death, if he ever appeared in his presence again. "See my face," as in
[Gen 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#003.md). Moses answered, "Thou hast
spoken rightly." For as God had already told him that the last blow
would be followed by the immediate release of the people, there was no
further necessity for him to appear before Pharaoh.
