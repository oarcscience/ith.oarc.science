### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 2:1</span></span>

"I have said in mine heart: Up then, I will prove thee with mirth, and
enjoy thou the good! And, lo, this also is vain." Speaking in the heart
is not here merely, as at [Ecc
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md), speaking to the heart, but
the words are formed into a direct address of the heart. The Targ. and
Midrash obliterate this by interpreting as if the word were אנסּנּה, "I
will try it" ([Ecc 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023).md). Jerome also,
in rendering by vadam et affluam deliciis et fruar bonis, proceeds
contrary to the usual reading of 'אן Niph. of נסך, vid., at [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md), as if this could mean, "I will
pour over myself." It is an address of the heart, and ב is, as at [Kg1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md), that of the means: I will try
thee with mirth, to see whether thy hunger after satisfaction can be
appeased with mirth. וּראה also is an address; Grtz sees here, contrary
to the Gramm., an infin. continuing the בּשׂ; ūrēh, [Job
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015.md), is the connect. form of the
particip. adj. rāěh; and if reēh could be the inf. after the forms
naqqēh, hinnāqqēh, it would be the inf. absol., instead of which וּראות
was to be expected. It is the imper.: See good, sinking thyself therein,
i.e., enjoy a cheerful life. Elsewhere the author connects ראה less
significantly with the accus. - obj., [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md); [Ecc
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#006.md); [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md).

This was his intention; but this experiment also to find out the summum
bonum proves itself a failure: he found a life of pleasure to be a
hollow life; that also, viz., devotedness to mirth, was to him
manifestly vanity.

[Ecclesiastes 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 2:2</span></span>

"To laughter I said: It is mad; and to mirth: What doth it issue in?"
Laughter and mirth are personified; meholāl is thus not neut. (Hitz., a
foolish matter), but mas. The judgment which is pronounced regarding
both has not the form of an address; we do not need to supply אתּה and
אתּ, it is objectively like an oratio obliqua: that it is mad; cf. [Psa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012.md). In the midst of the laughter
and revelling in sensual delight, the feeling came over him that this
was not the way to true happiness, and he was compelled to say to
laughter, It has become mad (part. Poal, as at [Psa
102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009).md), it is like one who is raving
mad, who finds his pleasure in self-destruction; and to joy (mirth),
which disregards the earnestness of life and all due bounds, he is
constrained to say, What does it result in? = that it produces nothing,
i.e., that it brings forth no real fruit; that it produces only the
opposite of true satisfaction; that instead of filling, it only enlarges
the inner void. Others, e.g., Luther, "What doest thou?" i.e., How
foolish is thy undertaking! Even if we thus explain, the point in any
case lies in the inability of mirth to make man truly and lastingly
happy, - in the inappropriateness of the means for the end aimed at.
Therefore עשׂה is thus meant just as in עשׂה פרי (Hitz.), and מעשׂה,
effect, [Isa 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017.md). Thus Mendelssohn:
What profit does thou bring to me? Regarding זה; מה־זּה = mah-zoth, [Gen
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#013.md), where it is shown that the
demonstrative pronoun serves here to sharpen the interrogative: What
then, what in all the world!

After this revelling in sensual enjoyment has been proved to be a
fruitless experiment, he searches whether wisdom and folly cannot be
bound together in a way leading to the object aimed at.

[Ecclesiastes 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 2:3</span></span>

"I searched in my heart, (henceforth) to nourish my body with wine,
while my heart had the direction by means of wisdom; and to lay hold on
folly, till I might see what it was good for the children of men that
they should do, all the number of the days of their life." After he
became conscious that unbridled sensual intoxication does not lead to
the wished-for end, he looked around him farther, and examined into the
following reception for happiness. Inappropriately, Zckl., with Hengst.:
"I essayed in my heart to nourish ...." תּוּר does not mean probare, but
explorare, to spy out, [Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md), and
frequently in the Book of Koheleth (here and at [Ecc
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013.md); [Ecc
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025).md) of mental searching and
discovery (Targ. אלּל). With למשׁוך there then follows the new thing
that is contrived. If we read משׁך and נהג in connection, then the idea
of drawing a carriage, [Isa 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018.md), cf.
[Deu 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#003.md), and of driving a carriage,
[Sa2 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003.md), lies near; according to
which Hitzig explains: "Wine is compared to a draught beast such as a
horse, and he places wisdom as the driver on the box, that his horse may
not throw him into a ditch or a morass." But moshēk is not the wine, but
the person himself who makes the trial; and nohēg is not the wisdom, but
the heart, - the former thus only the means of guidance; no man
expresses himself thus: I draw the carriage by means of a horse, and I
guide it by means of a driv. Rightly the Syr.: "To delight (למבסמן, from
בּסּם, oblectare) my flesh with wine." Thus also the Targ. and the
Venet., by "drawing the flesh." The metaphor does not accord with the
Germ. ziehen = to nourish by caring for (for which רבּה is used); it is
more natural, with Gesen., to compare the passing of trahere into
tractare, e.g., in the expression se benignius tractare (Horace, Ep.
1:17); but apart from the fact that trahere is a word of doubtful
etymology,

(Note: Vid., Crossen's Nachtr. zur lat. Formenlehre, pp. 107-109.)

tractare perhaps attains the meaning of attending to, using, managing,
through the intermediate idea of moving hither and thither, which is
foreign to the Heb. משׁך, which means only to draw, - to draw to
oneself, and hold fast (attractum sive prehensum tenere). As the Talm.
משׁך occurs in the sense of "to refresh," e.g., Chagiga 14a: "The
Haggadists (in contradistinction to the Halachists) refresh the heart of
a man as with water"; so here, "to draw the flesh" = to bring it into
willing obedience by means of pleasant attractions.

(Note: Grtz translates: to embrocate my body with wine, and remarks that
in this lies a raffinement. But why does he not rather say, "to bathe in
wine"? If משׁח can mean "to embrocate," it may also mean "to bathe," and
for ביין may be read ביוני: in Grecian, i.e., Falernian, Chian, wine.)

The phrase which follows: velibbi nohēg bahhochmāh, is conditioning:
While my heart had the direction by means of wisdom; or, perhaps in
accordance with the more modern usus loq. While my heart guided,
demeaned, behaved itself with wisdom. Then the inf. limshok, depending
on tarti as its obj., is carried forward with velěěhhoz besichluth.
Plainly the subject treated of is an intermediate thing (Bardach:
ממצּעת). He wished to have enjoyment, but in measure, without losing
himself in enjoyment, and thereby destroying himself. He wished to give
himself over to sweet desipere, but yet with wise self-possession
(because it is sadly true that ubi mel ibi fel) to lick the honey and
avoid the gall. There are drinkers who know how to guide themselves so
that they do not end in drunken madness; and there are habitual
pleasure-seekers who yet know how so far to control themselves, that
they do not at length become rous. Koheleth thus gave himself to a
foolish life, yet tempered by wisdom, till there dawned upon him a
better light upon the way to true happiness.

The expression of the donec viderem is old Heb. Instead of אי־זה טוב,
quidnam sit bonum in indirect interrog. (as [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md), cf. [Jer
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016).md), the old form מה־טוב ([Heb
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012).md) would lie at least nearer. Asher
yǎǎsu may be rendered: quod faciant or ut faciant; after [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md); [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004.md); [Ecc
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md), the latter is to be assumed. The
accus. designation of time, "through the number of days of their life,"
is like [Ecc 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md); [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md). We have not, indeed, to
translate with Knobel: "the few days of their life," but yet there
certainly lies in מספּר the idea that the days of man's life are
numbered, and that thus even if they are not few but many ([Ecc
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003).md), they do not endure for ev.

The king now, in the verse following, relates his undertakings for the
purpose of gaining the joys of life in fellowship with wisdom, and
first, how he made architecture and gardening serviceable to this new
style of life.

[Ecclesiastes 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 2:4</span></span>

"I undertook great works, built me houses, planted me vineyards. I made
me gardens and parks, and planted therein all kinds of fruit-trees. I
made me water-pools to water therewith a forest bringing forth trees."
The expression, "I made great my works," is like [Ecc
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md); the verb contains the adj. as
its obj. The love of wisdom, a sense of the beautiful in nature and art,
a striving after splendour and dignity, are fundamental traits in
Solomon's character. His reign was a period of undisturbed and assured
peace. The nations far and near stood in manifold friendly relations
with him. Solomon was "the man of rest," [Ch1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009.md); his whole appearance was as it
were the embodied glory itself that had blossomed from out of the evils
and wars of the reign of David. The Israelitish commonwealth hovered on
a pinnacle of worldly glory till then unattained, but with the danger of
falling and being lost in the world. The whole tendency of the time
followed, as it were, a secular course, and it was Solomon first of all
whom the danger of the love of the world, and of worldly conformity to
which he was exposed, brought to ruin, and who, like so many of the O.T.
worthies, began in the spirit and ended in the flesh. Regarding his
buildings, - the house of the forest of Lebanon, the pillared hall
(porch), the hall of judgment, the palace intended for himself and the
daughter of Pharaoh, - vid. the description in [Kg1
7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md), gathered from the annals of
the kingdom; [Kg1 9:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md) = [Ch2
8:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#003.md), gives an account of Solomon's
separate buildings (to which also the city of Millo belongs), and of the
cities which he built; the temple, store-cities, treasure-cities, etc.,
are naturally not in view in the passage before us, where it is not so
much useful buildings, as rather buildings for pleasure ([Kg1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019).md), that are referred to.
Vineyards, according to [Ch1 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#027.md),
belonged to David's royal domain; a vineyard in Baal-hamon which Solomon
possessed, but appears at a later period to have given up, is mentioned
at the close of the Song. That he was fond of gardening, appears from
manifold expressions in the Song; delight in the life and movements of
the natural world, and particularly in plants, is a prominent feature in
Solomon's character, in which he agrees with Shulamith. The Song; [Sol
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002.md), represents him in the garden at
the palace. We have spoken under the Song; [Sol
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011.md)., of the gardens and parks at
Etam, on the south-west of Bethlehem. Regarding the originally Persian
word pardēs (plur. pardesim, Mishnic pardesoth), vid., under [Sol
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013.md); regarding the primary meaning of
berēchah (plur. const. berēchoth, in contradistinction to birchoth,
blessings), the necessary information is found under [Sol
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005.md). These Solomonic pools are at the
present day to be seen near old Etam, and the clause here denoting a
purpose, "to water from them a forest which sprouted trees, i.e.,
brought forth sprouting trees," is suitable to these; for verbs of
flowing and swarming, also verbs of growing, thought of transitively,
may be connected with obj. - accus., Ewald, 281b; cf. under [Isa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md). Thus, as he gave himself to the
building of houses, the care of gardens, and the erection of pools, so
also to the cultivation of forests, with the raising of new trees.

Another means, wisely considered as productive of happiness, was a large
household and great flocks of cattle, which he procured for himself.

[Ecclesiastes 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 2:7</span></span>

"I procured servants and maidens, and also I obtained servants born in
the house; also the possession of flocks; I obtained many horned and
small cattle before all who were in Jerusalem before me." The obtaining
of these possessions is, according to [Gen
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012.md)., to be understood of purchase.
There is a distinction between the slaves, male and female (mancipia),
obtained by purchase, and those who were home-born (vernae), the בּית
(ילידי) בּני, who were regarded as the chief support of the house ([Gen
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014).md), on account of their attachment
to it, and to this day are called (Arab.) fada wayyt, as those who offer
themselves a sacrifice for it, if need be. Regarding לי היה, in the
sense of increasing possession; and regarding היה for היוּ, vid., at
[Ecc 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#010.md), [Ecc
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md); at all events, the sing. of the
pred. may be explained from this, that the persons and things named are
thought of in the mass, as at [Zac
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#005.md); [Joe
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020.md) (although the idea there may be
also individualizing); but in the use of the pass., as at [Gen
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#026.md); [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), the Semite custom is different,
inasmuch as for it the passive has the force of an active without a
definite subject, and thus with the most general subject; and as to the
case lying before us in [Ecc 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007.md), we
see from [Exo 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#049.md), cf. [Gen
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017), that היה (יהיה.md) in such
instances is thought of as neut. According to [Gen
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#014.md) and the passage before us, מקנה
lay nearer than מקנה, but the primary form instead of the connecting
form is here the traditional reading; we have thus apposition
(Nebenordnung) instead of subordination (Annexion), as in zevahim
shelamim, [Exo 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md), and in habbaqar
hannehhosheth, [Kg2 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md), although
vaqar vatson may also be interpreted as the accus. of the more accurate
definition: the possession of flocks consisting in cattle and sheep. But
this manner of construction is, for a book of so late an origin, too
artificial. What it represents Solomon as saying is consistent with
historical fact; at the consecration of the temple he sacrificed
hecatombs, [Kg1 8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md); and the daily
supply for the royal kitchen, which will at the same time serve to show
the extent of the royal household, was, according to [Kg1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#002.md)., enormous.

There now follows the enumeration of riches and jewels which were a
delight to the eye; and finally, the large provision made for revelling
in the pleasures of music and of sensual love.

[Ecclesiastes 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 2:8</span></span>

"I heaped up for myself also silver and gold, and the peculiar property
of kings and of countries; I gat me men singers and women singers, and
the delights of the children of men: mistress and mistresses." The verb
כּנשׁ כּנס, συνάγειν, is common to all Semitic dialects (also the to
Assyr.), and especially peculiar to the more recent Heb., which forms
from it the name of the religious community συναγωγή, כּנסת; it is used
here of that which is brought together merely for the purpose of
possession. Segūllah (from sagal, Targ., to make oneself possess),
properly possession, and that something which specially and peculiarly
belongs to one as his property; the word is here meant collect., as at
[Ch1 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003.md) : that which only kings and
individual countries possess. The interchange of melachim, which is
without the article, with the determ. hammedinoth, is arbitrary:
something special, such as that which a king possesses, the specialities
which countries possess, - one country this, and another that. The
hammedinoth are certainly not exclusively the regions embraced within
the dominion of Solomon (Zckl.), as, according to [Est
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001.md), the Persian kingdom was divided
into 127 medinoth. Solomon had a fleet which went to Ophir, was in a
friendly relation with the royal house of Tyre, the metropolis of many
colonies, and ruled over a widely-extended kingdom, bound by commerce
with Central Asia and Africa. - His desires had thus ample opportunity
to stretch beyond the limits of his own kingdom, and facilities enough
for procuring the peculiar natural and artistic productions which other
lands could boast of. Medinah is, first of all, a country, not as a
territory, but as under one government (cf. [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007).md); in the later philosophical
language it is the Heb. word for the Greek πολιτεία; in the passage
before us, medinoth is, however, not different from ארצות.

From the singing men and singing women who come into view here, not as
appertaining to the temple service (vid., the Targ.), with which no
singing women were connected, but as connected with the festivities of
the court ([Sa2 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#036.md); cf. [Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012).md), advance is made to shiddah
veshiddoth; and since these are designated by the preceding ותענגות (not
ותענגּות) bene hāādam, especially as objects and means of earthly
pleasure, and since, according to [Heb
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007.md), sexual love is the fairest and
the most pleasant, in a word, the most attractive of all earthly
delights (Solomon's luxus, also here contradicting the law of the king,
[Deu 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017.md), came to a height,
according to [Kg1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003.md), after the
example of Oriental rulers, in a harem of not fewer than one thousand
women, princesses and concubines), of necessity, the expression shiddah
veshiddoth must denote a multitude of women whom the king possessed for
his own pleasure. Cup-bearers, male and female (Syr., lxx), cannot at
all be understood, for although it may be said that the enumeration thus
connects itself with the before-named בּיּין, yet this class of female
attendants are not numbered among the highest human pleasures; besides,
with such an explanation one must read שׁרה ושׁדות, and, in addition,
שׁדא (to throw, to pour to, or pour out), to which this Heb. שׁדה may
correspond, is nowhere used of the pouring out of wine. Rather might
שׁדה, like שדא, hydria, be the name of a vessel from which one pours out
anything, according to which Aq. translates by κυλίκιον καὶ κυλίκια,
Symmachus, after Jerome, by mensurarum (read mensarum)

(Note: Thus, according to Vallarsi, a Cod. Vat. and Cod. Palat. of the
first hand.)

species et appositioines, and Jerome, scyphos et urceos in ministerio ad
vina fundenda; but this word for kelē mashkēh, [Kg1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021.md) (= [Ch2
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#020).md), is not found. Also the Targ.,
which translates by dimasaya uvē venavan, public baths (δημόσια), and
balneae, vindicates this translation by referring the word to the verb
שׁדא, "with pipes which pour out (דּשׁרין) tepid water, and pipes which
pour out hot water." But this explanation is imaginary; שׁדּה occurs in
the Mishna, Mikwaoth (of plunge-baths) [Ecc
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005.md), but there it denotes a chest
which, when it swims in the water, makes the plunge-bath unsuitable.
Such an untenable conceit also is the translation suggested by Kimchi,
כלי זמר, according to which the Event. σύστεεμα καὶ συστήματα (in a
musical sense: concentus), and Luther: "all kinds of musical
instruments;" the word has not this meaning; Orelli, Sanchuniathon, p.
33, combines therewith Σιδών, according to the Phoenician myth, the
inventress of the artistic song. The explanation by Kimchi is headed,
"Splendour of every kind;" Ewald, Elster, and Zckler find therein a
general expression, following taanugoth: great heap and heaps = in great
abundance \[die Hlle und Flle\]. But the synon. of כבוד, "splendour," is
not שׁד, but עז; and that שׁדד, like עצם, is referred to a great number,
is without proof. Thus shiddah veshiddoth will denote something
definite; besides, "a large number" finds its expression in the
climactic union of words. In the Jerus. Talm. Taanith [Ecc
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005.md), shiddah must, according to the
gloss, be the name of a chariot, although the subject there is not that
of motion forward, or moving quickly; it is there announced that Schn,
not far from Sepphoris, a place famed also for its pottery, formerly
possessed 80 such shiddoth wholly of metal. The very same word is
explained by Rashi, Baba kamma ix. 3, Shabbath 120a, Erubin 30b, Gittin
8b, 68a, Chagiga 25a, and elsewhere, of a carriage of wood, and
especially of a chariot for women and distinguished persons. The
combination of the synonyms, shiddah uthivah umigdal, does not in itself
mean more than a chest; and Rashi himself explains, Kethuboth 65a,
quolphi dashidah of the lock of a chest (argaz); and the author of Aruch
knows no other meaning than that of a repository such as a chest. But in
passages such as Gittin 8b, the shiddah is mentioned as a means of
transport; it is to all appearance a chest going on wheels, moved
forward by means of wheels, but on that very account not a
state-chariot. Rashi's tradition cannot be verified.

Bttcher, in the Neue Aehrenlese, adduces for comparison the Syr. Shydlo,
which, according to Castelli, signifies navis magna, corbita, arca; but
from a merchant ship and a portable chest, it is a great way to a lady's
palanquin.

He translates: palanquin and palinquins = one consignment to the harem
after another. Gesen., according to Rdiger, Thes. 1365b, thinks that
women are to be understood; for he compares the Arab. z'ynat, which
signifies a women's carriage, and then the woman herself (cf. our
Frauenzimmer, women's apartment, women, like Odaliske, from the Turk.
oda, apartment). But this all stands or falls with that gloss of
Rashi's: 'agalah lemerkavoth nashim usarim. Meanwhile, of all the
explanations as yet advanced, this last of splendid coaches, palanquins
is the best; for it may certainly be supposed that the words shiddah
veshiddoth are meant of women. Aben Ezra explains on this supposition,
shiddoth = shevuyoth, females captured in war; but unwarrantably,
because as yet Solomon had not been engaged in war; others (vid.,
Pinsker's Zur Gesch. des Karaismus, p. 296), recently Bullock, connect
it with shadim, in the sense of (Arab.) nahidah (a maiden with swelling
breast); Knobel explains after shadad, to barricade, to shut up,
occlusa, the female held in custody (cf. bethulah, the separated one,
virgin, from bathal, cogn. badal); Hitzig, "cushions," "bolsters," from
shanad, which, like (Arab.) firash, λέχος, is then transferred to the
juncta toro. Nothing of all that is satisfactory. The Babyl. Gemara,
Gittin 68a, glosses ותען וגו by "reservoirs and baths," and then further
says that in the west (Palestine) they say שׁדּתא, chests (according to
Rashi: chariots); but that here in this country (i.e., in Babylon) they
translate shiddah veshiddoth by shēdah veshēdathin, which is then
explained, "demons and demonesses," which Solomon had made subservient
to him.

(Note: A demon, and generally a superhuman being, is called, as in Heb.
שׁד, so in the Babyl.-Assyr. sîdu, vid., Norris' Assyrian Dictionary, II
p. 668; cf. Schrader, in the Jena. Lit. Zeit. 1874, p. 218f., according
to which sîdu, with alap, is the usual name of Adar formed like an ox.)

This haggadic-mytholog. interpretation is, linguistically at least, on
the right track. A demon is not so named from fluttering or moving to
and fro (Levy, Schnhak), for there is no evidence in the Semitic
langauge of the existence of a verb שוד, to flee; also not from a verb
sadad, which must correspond to the Heb. השׁתחוה, in the sense of to
adore (Oppert's Inscription du palais de Khorsabad, 1863, p. 96); for
this meaning is more than doubtful, and, besides, שׁד is an active, and
not a passive idea-much rather שׁד, Assyr. sîd, Arab. sayyid, signifies
the mighty, from שׁוּד, to force, [Psa
91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md).

(Note: Vid., Friedrich Delitzsch's Assyr. Theirnamen, p. 37.)

In the Arab. (cf. the Spanish Cid) it is uniformly the name of a lord,
as subduing, ruling, mastering (sabid), and the fem. sayyidat, of a
lady, whence the vulgar Arab. sitti = my lady, and sîdi = my lord. Since
שׁדד means the same as שׁוד, and in Heb. is more commonly used than it,
so also the fem. form שׁדּה is possible, so much the more as it may have
originated from שׁדה, 5 שׁיד = שׁד, by a sharpening contraction, like
סגּים, from סיגים (Olsh. 83c), perhaps intentionally to make שׁדה, a
demoness, and the name of a lady (donna = domina) unlike. Accordingly we
translate, with Gesen. and Meyer in their Handwrt.: "lady and ladies;"
for we take shiddoth as a name of the ladies of the harem, like shēglath
(Assyr. saklâti) and lehhenath in the book of Daniel, on which Ahron b.
Joseph the Karaite remarks: shedah hinqaroth shagal.

The connection expressing an innumerable quantity, and at the same time
the greatest diversity, is different from the genitival dor dorim,
generation of generations, i.e., lasting through all generations, [Psa
72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md), from the permutative heightening
the idea: rahham rahhamathaim, one damsel, two damsels, [Jdg
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030.md), and from that formed by placing
together the two gram. genders, comprehending every species of the
generic conception: mash'ēn umash'enah, [Isa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003.md) (vid., comm. l.c., and Ewald,
172b). Also the words cited by Ewald (Syr.), rogo urogo, "all possible
pleasures" (Cureton's Spicil. p. 10), do not altogether accord with this
passage for they heighten, like meod meod, by the repetition of the same
expression. But similar is the Arab. scheme, mal wamwal, "possession and
possessions," i.e., exceeding great riches, where the collective idea,
in itself according by its indetermination free scope to the
imagination, is multiplied by the plur. being further added.

After Koheleth has enumerated all that he had provided for the purpose
of gratifying his lusts, but without losing himself therein, he draws
the conclusion, which on this occasion also shows a perceptible deficit.

[Ecclesiastes 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 2:9</span></span>

"And I became great, and was always greater than all that were before me
in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. And all that mine eyes
desired I kept not from them, I refused not any kind of joy to my heart;
for my heart had joy of all my labour: and this was my portion of all my
labour. And I turned myself to all the works which my hands had done,
and to the labour which I had laboured to accomplish: and, behold, all
was vain, and windy effort, and there was no true profit under the sun."
In vehosaphti there is here no obj. as at [Ecc
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md); the obj. is the gedullah, the
greatness, to be concluded and thought of from vegadalti, "and I became
great." To the impers. היה for היוּ, 7b, cf. 7a, [Ecc
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md), [Ecc
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#010.md). He became great, and always
greater, viz., in the possession of all the good things, the possession
of which seemed to make a man happy on this earth. And what he resolved
upon, in the midst of this dulcis insania, viz., to deport himself as a
wise man, he succeeded in doing: his wisdom forsook him not, viz., the
means adapted to the end, and ruling over this colossal apparatus of
sensual lust; אף, as e.g., at [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md), belongs to the whole clause; and
עמד, with ל, does not mean here to stand by, sustain (Herzfeld, Ewald,
Elster), which it might mean as well as על עמד, [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md), but to continue, as Jerome, and
after him, Luther, translates: sapientia quoquo perseveravit mecum; the
Targ. connects the ideas of continuance (lxx, Syr., Venet.) and of help;
but the idea intended is that of continuance, for נהג, e.g., does not
refer to helping, but self-maintaining.

[Ecc 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010.md)

Thus become great and also continuing wise, he was not only in a
condition to procure for himself every enjoyment, but he also indulged
himself in everything; all that his eyes desired, i.e., all that they
saw, and after which they made him lust ([Deu
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#026).md) (cf. [Jo1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016).md), that he did not refuse to them
(אצל, subtrahere), and he kept not back his heart from any kind of joy
(מנע, with min of the thing refused, as at [Num
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#011.md), etc., oftener with min, of him
to whom it is refused, e.g., [Gen
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#002).md), for (here, after the foregoing
negations, coinciding with immo) his heart had joy of all his work; and
this, viz., this enjoyment in full measure, was his part of all his
work. The palindromic form is like [Ecc
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#006.md); [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md). We say in Heb. as well as in
German: to have joy in (an, ב), anything, joy over (ber, על) anything,
or joy of (von, מן) anything; Koheleth here purposely uses min, for he
wishes to express not that the work itself was to him an object and
reason of joy, but that it became to him a well of joy (cf. [Pro
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018.md); [Ch2
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#027).md). Falsely, Hahn and others:
after my work (min, as e.g., [Psa
73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020).md), for thereby the causative
connection is obliterated: min is the expression of the mediate cause,
as the concluding sentence says: Joy was that which he had of all his
work - this itself brought care and toil to him; joy, made possible to
him thereby, was the share which came to him from it.

[Ecc 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md)

But was this חלק a יתרון - was this gain that fell to him a true,
satisfying, pure gain? With the words uphanithi ani he proposes this
question, and answers it. פּנה (to turn to) is elsewhere followed by
expressions of motion to an end; here, as at [Job
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#028.md), by בּ, by virtue of a
constructio praegnans: I turned myself, fixing my attention on all my
works which my hands accomplished. La'asoth is, as at [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003) (vid., l.c..md), equivalent to
perficiendo, carrying out, viz., such works of art and of all his
labour. The exclamation "behold" introduces the summa summarum.
Regardingיתרון, vid., [Ecc 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003.md). Also
this way of finding out that which was truly good showed itself to be
false. Of all this enjoyment, there remained nothing but the feeling of
emptiness. What he strove after appeared to him as the wind; the
satisfaction he sought to obtain at such an expense was nothing else
than a momentary delusion. And since in this search after the true
happiness of life he was in a position more favourable for such a
purpose than almost any other man, he is constrained to draw the
conclusion that there is no יתרון, i.e., no real enduring and true
happiness, from all labour under the sun.

[Ecclesiastes 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 2:12</span></span>

"And I turned myself to examine wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what
is the man who could come after the king, him whom they have made so
long ago!" Mendelssohn's translation, [Ecc
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md): "I abandoned my design of
seeking to connect wisdom with folly and madness," is impossible,
because for such a rendering we should have had at least מלּראות instead
of לראות. Hitzig, otherwise followed by Stuart: "I turned myself to
examine me wisdom, and, lo, it was madness as well as folly." This
rendering is impossible also, for in such a case הנּהו ought to have
stood as the result, after חכמה. The pasage, [Zac
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006.md), cited by Hitz., does not prove
the possibility of such a brachyology, for there we read not veqaroth
veqeppayon, but eqaroth iqeppaūn (the splendid ones, i.e., the stars,
will draw themselves together, i.e., will become dark bodies). The two
vavs are not correlative, which is without example in the usage of this
book, but copulative: he wishes to contemplate (Zckler and others)
wisdom on the one side, and madness and folly on the other, in their
relation to each other, viz., in their relative worth. Hitzig's
ingenuity goes yet further astray in [Ecc
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md): "For what will the man do who
comes after the king? (He shall do) what was long ago his (own) doing,
i.e., inheriting from the king the throne, he will not also inherit his
wisdom." Instead of āsūhū, he reads ǎsōhū, after [Exo
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#018.md); but the more modern author,
whose work we have here before us, would, instead of this anomalous
form, use the regular form עשׂותו; but, besides, the expression ēth
asher-kevar 'asotho, "(he will do) what long ago was his doing," is not
Heb.; the words ought to have been keasotho kevar khen i'sah, or at
least 'asāhū. If we compare [Ecc 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)
with 18b, the man who comes after the king appears certainly to be his
successor.

(Note: The lxx and Symm. by hammělêk think of melak, counsel, βουλή,
instead of melek, king; and as Jerome, so also Bardach understands by
the king the rex factor, i.e., God the Creator.)

But by this supposition it is impossible to give just effect to the
relation (assigning a reason or motive) of [Ecc
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md) to 12a expressed by כּי. When I
considered, Knobel regards Koheleth as saying, that a fool would be heir
to me a wise man, it appeared strange to me, and I was led to compare
wisdom and folly to see whether or not the wise man has a superiority to
the fool, or whether his labour and his fate are vanity, like those of
the fool. This is in point of style absurd, but it is much more absurd
logically. And who then gave the interpreter the right to stamp as a
fool the man who comes after the king? In the answer: "That which has
long ago been done," must lie its justification; for this that was done
long ago naturally consists, as Zckler remarks, in foolish and perverse
undertakings, certainly in the destruction of that which was done by the
wise predecessor, in the lavish squandering of the treasures and goods
collected by him. More briefly, but in the same sense, Burger: Nihil
quod a solita hominum agendi ratione recedit. But in [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md), Koheleth places it as a question
whether his successor will be a wise man or a fool, while here he would
presuppose that "naturally," or as a matter of course, he will be a
fool. In the matter of style, we have nothing to object to the
translation on which Zckler, with Rabm., Rosenm., Knobel, Hengst., and
others, proceeds; the supplying of the verb יעשׂה to meh hāādām = what
can the man do? is possible (cf. [Mal
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015).md), and the neut. interpret. of the
suffix of עשׂוּהוּ is, after [Ecc
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013.md); [Amo
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003.md); [Job
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#011.md), admissible; but the reference
to a successor is not connected with the course of the thoughts, even
although one attaches to the plain words a meaning which is foreign to
them. The words עשׂוּהוּ...את are accordingly not the answer to the
question proposed, but a component part of the question itself. Thus
Ewald, and with him Elster, Heiligst., construes: "How will the man be
who will follow the king, compared with him whom they made (a king) long
ago, i.e., with his predecessor?" But את, in this pregnant sense,
"compared with," is without example, at least in the Book of Koheleth,
which generally does not use it as a prep.; and, besides, this
rendering, by introducing the successor on the throne, offends against
the logic of the relation of [Ecc 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)
to [Ecc 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md).

The motive of Koheleth's purpose, to weigh wisdom and folly against each
other as to their worth, consists in this, that a king, especially such
an one as Solomon was, has in the means at his disposal and in the
extent of his observation so much more than everyother, that no one who
comes after him will reach a different experience. This motive would be
satisfactorily expressed on the supposition that the answer begins with
את, if one should read עשׂהוּ for עשׂוּהוּ: he will be able to do
(accomplish) nothing but what he (the king) has long ago done, i.e., he
will only repeat, only be able to confirm, the king's report. But if we
take the text as it here stands, the meaning is the same; and, besides,
we get rid of the harsh ellipsis měh hāādām for měh yǎǎsěh hāādām. We
translate: for what is the man who might come after the king, him whom
they have made so long ago! The king whom they made so long ago is
Solomon, who has a richer experience, a more comprehensive knowledge,
the longer the time (viz., from the present time backwards) since he
occupied the throne. Regarding the expression eth asher = quem, instead
of the asher simply, vid., Khler under [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md). עשׂוּהוּ, with the most general
subj., is not different from נעשׂה, which, particularly in the Book of
Daniel (e.g., [Dan 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#028)..md), has
frequently an active construction, with the subject unnamed, instead of
the passive (Gesen. 137, margin). The author of the Book of Koheleth,
alienated from the theocratic side of the kingdom of Israel, makes use
of it perhaps not unintentionally; besides, Solomon's elevation to the
throne was, according to 1 Kings 1, brought about very much by human
agency; and one may, if he will, think of the people in the word 'asuhu
also, according to [Kg1 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039.md), who at
last decided the matter. Meh before the letters hheth and ayin commonly
occurs: according to the Masora, twenty-four times; before other initial
letters than these, eight times, and three of these in the Book of
Koheleth before the letter he, [Ecc
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md), [Ecc
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md); [Ecc
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md). The words are more an
exclamation than a question; the exclamation means: What kind of a man
is that who could come after the king! cf. "What wickedness is this!"
etc., [Jdg 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#012.md); [Jos
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#016.md); [Exo
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#014.md); [Kg1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#013.md), i.e., as standing behind with
reference to me-the same figure of extenuatio, as mah adam, [Psa
144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003.md); cf. [Ecc
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005.md).

There now follows an account of what, on the one side, happened to him
thus placed on a lofty watch-tower, such as no other occupied.

[Ecclesiastes 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 2:13</span></span>

"And I saw that wisdom has the advantage over folly, as light has the
advantage over darkness. The wise man has eyes in his head; but the fool
walketh in darkness." In the sacred Scriptures, "light" is generally the
symbol of grace, [Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md), but also
the contrast of an intellectually and morally darkened state, [Isa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004.md). To know a thing is equivalent to
having light on it, and seeing it in its true light ([Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010).md); wisdom is thus compared to
light; folly is once, [Job 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#019.md),
directly called "darkness." Thus wisdom stands so much higher than
folly, as light stands above darkness.יתרון, which hitherto denoted
actual result, enduring gain, signifies here preference; along with
כּיתרון

(Note: Thus written, according to J and other authorities.)

there is also found the form כּיתרון

(Note: Thus Ven. 1515, 1521; vid., Comm. under [Gen
27:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#028.md); [Psa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010)..md)

(vid., [Pro 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017).md). The fool walks in
darkness: he is blind although he has eyes ([Isa
43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008).md), and thus has as good as none, -
he wants the spiritual eye of understanding ([Job
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#003).md); the wise man, on the other
hand, his eyes are in his head, or, as we also say: he has eyes in his
head, - eyes truly seeing, looking at and examining persons and things.
That is the one side of the relation of wisdom to folly as put to the
test.

The other side of the relation is the sameness of the result in which
the elevation of wisdom above folly terminates.

"And I myself perceived that one experience happeneth to them all. And I
said in my heart, As it will happen to the fool, it will happen also to
me; and why have I then been specially wise? Thus I spake then in my
heart, that this also is vain." Zckler gives to גּם an adversative
sense; but this gam (= ὃμως, similiter) stands always at the beginning
of the clause, Ewald, 354a. Gam-ani corresponds to the Lat. ego idem,
which gives two predicates to one subject; while et ipse predicates the
same of the one of two subjects as it does of the other (Zumpt, 697).
The second gam-ani serves for the giving of prominence to the object,
and here precedes, after the manner of a substantival clause (cf. [Isa
45:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#012.md); [Eze
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#017.md); [Ch2
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#010).md), as at [Gen
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027.md); cf. Gesen. 121. 3. Miqrěh (from
קרה, to happen, to befall) is quiquid alicui accidit (in the later
philosoph. terminol. accidens; Venet. συμβεβεεκός); but here, as the
connection shows, that which finally puts an end to life, the final
event of death. By the word יד the author expresses what he had observed
on reflection; by בּל...אם, what he said inwardly to himself regarding
it; and by דּבּ דל, what sentence he passed thereon with himself. Lammah
asks for the design, as maddu'a for the reason. אז is either understood
temporally: then when it is finally not better with me than with the
fool (Hitz. from the standpoint of the dying hour), or logically: if yet
one and the same event happeneth to the wise man and to the fool
(Eslt.); in the consciousness of the author both are taken together.The
זה of the conclusion refers, not, as at [Ecc
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017.md), to the endeavouring after and
the possession of wisdom, but to this final result making no difference
between wise men and fools. This fate, happening to all alike, is הבל, a
vanity rendering all vain, a nullity levelling down all to nothing,
something full of contradictions, irrational. Paul also ([Rom
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020).md) speaks of this destruction,
which at last comes upon all, as a ματαιότης.

The author now assigns the reason for this discouraging result.

[Ecclesiastes 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 2:16</span></span>

"For no remembrance of the wise, as of the fool, remains for ever; since
in the days that are to come they are all forgotten. And how dieth the
wise man: as the fool!" As in [Ecc
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#011.md), so here זכרון is the principal
form, not different from זכּרון. Having no remembrance forever, is
equivalent to having no eternal endurance, having simply no onward
existence ([Ecc 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006).md). עם is both times
the comparat. combin., as at [Ecc
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011.md); [Job
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#026.md); [Job
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md); cf. יחד, [Psa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md). There are, indeed, individual
historically great men, the memory of whom is perpetuated from
generation to generation in words and in monuments; but these are
exceptions, which do not always show that posterity is able to
distinguish between wise men and fools. As a rule, men have a long
appreciating recollection of the wise as little as they have of the
fools, for long ago (vid., beshekvar, p. 640) in the coming days (כּב
אבּ, accus. of the time, like the ellipt.הב, [Isa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006).md) all are forgotten; הכּל is, as
at [Psa 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003.md), meant personally: the
one as the other; and נשׁכּח is rendered by the Masora, like [Psa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006.md), כּב אב, as the pausal form of the
finite; but is perhaps thought of as part., denoting that which only in
the coming days will become too soon a completed fact, since those who
survive go from the burial of the one, as well as from that of the
other, to the ordinary duties of the day. Death thus sinks the wise man,
as it does the fool, in eternal oblivion; it comes to both, and brings
the same to both, which extorted from the author the cry: How dieth the
wise man? as the fool! Why is the fate which awaits both thus the same!
This is the pointed, sarcastic איך (how!) of the satirical Mashal, e.g.,
[Isa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md); [Eze
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#017.md); and ימוּת is = moriendum est,
as at [Sa2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003.md), moriendum erat.
Rambach well: איך est h. l. particula admirationis super rei
indignitate.

What happened to the author from this sorrowful discovery he now states.

[Ecclesiastes 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 2:17</span></span>

"The life became hateful to me; for the work which man accomplsihes
under the sun was grievous to me: because all is vain and windy effort."
He hated life; and the labour which is done under the sun, i.e., the
efforts of men, including the fate that befalls men, appeared to him to
be evil (repugnant). The lxx translate: πονηρὸν επ ̓ ἐμέ; the Venet.:
κακὸν ἐπ ̓ ἐμοί; and thus Hitzig: as a woeful burden lying on me. But
עלי רע is to be understood after tov al, [Est
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#009.md), etc., cf. [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md), and as synon. with בּעיני or
לפני (cf. Dan. 3:32), according to which Symmachus: κακὸν γάρ μοι ἐφάνη.
This al belongs to the more modern usus loq., cf. Ewald, 217i. The end
of the song was also again the grievous ceterum censeo: Vanity, and a
labour which has wind as its goal, wind as its fruit.

[Ecclesiastes 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 2:18</span></span>

"And I hated all my labour with which I laboured under the sun, that I
should leave it to the man who shall be after me;" i.e., not: who shall
come into existence after me, but: who shall occupy my place after me.
The fiction discovers itself here in the expression: "The king," who
would not thus express himself indefinitely and unsympathetically
regarding his son and successor on the throne, is stripped of his
historical individuality. The first and third שׁ are relat. pron. (quem,
after the schema egymologicum עמל עמל, [Ecc
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md), [Ecc
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009), and qui.md), the second is relat.
conj. (eo) quod. The suffix of שׁאן refers to the labour in the sense of
that which is obtained by wearisome labour, accomplished or collected
with labour; cf. כּח, product, fruit, [Gen
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#012.md); עבודה, effect, [Isa
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017.md).

How this man will be circumstanced who will have at his disposal that
for which he has not laboured, is uncertain.

[Ecclesiastes 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 2:19</span></span>

"And who knoweth whether he shall be wise or foolish? and he will have
power over all my labour with which had wearied myself, and had acted
wisely, under the sun: this also is vain." או...ה, instead of אם...ה, in
the double question, as at [Job 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#003.md).
What kind of a man he will be no one can previously know, and yet this
person will have free control (cf. שׁלט, p.641) over all the labour that
the testator has wisely gained by labour - a hendiadys, for חכם with the
obj. accus. is only in such a connection possible: "my labour which I,
acting wisely, gained by labour."

In view of this doubtful future of that which was with pains and wisely
gained by him, his spirit sank within him.

[Ecclesiastes 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 2:20</span></span>

"Then I turned to give up my heart on account of = to despair of all the
labour with which I wearied myself under the sun." As at [Sa1
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#017.md)., [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md); [Jer
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#014.md), סבב has here the intrans.
meaning, to turn about (lxx ἐπέστρεψα = ἐπεστρεψάμην). Hitzig remarks
that פנה and שוב signify, "to turn round in order to see," and סבב, on
the contrary, "to turn round in order to do." But פנה can also mean, "to
turn round in order to do," e.g., [Lev
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#009.md); and סבב, "to turn in order to
examine more narrowly," [Ecc 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md). The
distinction lies in this, that פנה signifies a clear turning round; סבב,
a turning away from one thing to another, a turning in the direction of
something new that presents itself ([Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md), [Ecc
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007.md); [Ecc
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011).md). The phrase, יאשׁ את־בלבּו,

(Note: With Pathach under the yod in the text in Biblia Rabb. and the
note ל Thus also in the ms. Parva Masora, and e.g., Cod. P.)

closely corresponds to the Lat. despondet animum, he gives up his
spirits, lets them sink, i.e., he despairs. The old language knows only
נואשׁ, to give oneself up, i.e., to give up hope in regard to anything;
and נואשׁ, given up, having no prospect, in despair. The Talm., however,
uses along with nithyāēsh (vid., p. 638) not only noǎsh, but also יאשׁ,
in the sense of despair, or the giving up of all hope (subst. יאוּשׁ),
Meza 21b, from which it is at once evident that יאשׁ, is not to be
thought of as causative (like the Arab. ajjasa and aiasa), but as simply
transitive, with which, after the passage before us, לבו is to be
thought of as connected. He turned round to give up all heart. He had no
more any heart to labour.

[Ecclesiastes 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 2:21</span></span>

"For there is a man who labours with wisdom, and knowledge, and ability;
and to a man who has not laboured for it, must he leave it as his
portion: also that is vain, and a great evil." Ewald renders: whose
labour aims after wisdom. But בּח וטו do not denote obj. (for the obj.
of עמל is certainly the portion which is to be inherited), but are
particular designations of the way and manner of the labour. Instead of
שׁעמל, there is used the more emphatic form of the noun: שׁעמלו, who had
his labour, and performed it; [Sa1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017.md), cf. [Jer
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#005.md), [Jer
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#006.md), "Thine habitation is in the midst
of deceit," and Hitz. under [Job 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#027.md).
Kishron is not ἀνδρεία (lxx), manliness, moral energy (Elster), but
aptness, ability, and (as a consequence connecting itself therewith)
success, good fortune, thus skilfulness conducting to the end. בּו
refers to the object, and יתּננּוּ to the result of the work; חלקו is
the second obj.-accus., or, as we rather say, pred.-accus.: as his
portion, viz., inheritance.

That what one has gained by skill and good fortune thus falls to the lot
of another who perhaps recklessly squanders it, is an evil all the
greater in proportion to the labour and care bestowed on its
acquisition.

[Ecclesiastes 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ecc 2:22</span></span>

"For what has man of all his labour, and the endeavours of his heart
with which he wearies himself under the sun? All his days are certainly
in sorrows, and his activity in grief; his heart resteth not even in the
night: also this is vain." The question literally is: What is (comes
forth, results) to a man from all his labour; for "to become, to be, to
fall to, happen to," is the fundamental idea of הוה (whence here הוה,
γινόμενον, as at [Neh 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#006.md),
γενεεσόμενος) or היה, the root signification of which is deorsum ferri,
cadere, and then accidere, fieri, whence הוּה, eagerness precipitating
itself upon anything (vid., under [Pro
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003).md), or object.: fall, catastrophe,
destruction. Instead of שׁהוּא, there is here to be written שׁהוּא,

(Note: Thus according to tradition, in H, J, P, vid., Michlol 47b, 215b,
216a; vid., also Norzi.)

as at [Ecc 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md) שׁהם. The question
looks forward to a negative answer. What comes out of his labour for
man? Nothing comes of it, nothing but disagreeableness. This negative
contained in the question is established by כּי, 23a. The form of the
clause, "all his days are sorrows," viz., as to their condition, follows
the scheme, "the porch was 20 cubits," [Ch2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004.md), viz., in measurement; or, "their
feast is music and wine," [Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md),
viz., in its combination (vid., Philippi's Stat. Const. p. 90ff.). The
parallel clause is וכעם ענינו, not כו; for the final syllable, or that
having the accent on the penult, immediately preceding the Athnach-word,
takes Kametz, as e.g., [Lev 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005.md); [Pro
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003.md); [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017) (cf. Olsh. 224, p. 440.md).

(Note: But cf. also ולא with Zakeph Katan, [Kg2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#017.md); ואר וגו with Tiphcha, [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md); and וריב under [Psa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010)..md)

Many interpreters falsely explain: at aegritudo est velut quotidiana
occupatio ejus. For the sake of the parallelism, ענינו (from ענה, to
weary oneself with labour, or also to strive, aim; vid., Psalmen, ii.
390) is subj. not pred.: his endeavour is grief, i.e., brings only grief
or vexation with it.

Even in the night he has no rest; for even then, though he is not
labouring, yet he is inwardly engaged about his labour and his plans.
And this possession, acquired with such labour and restlessness, he must
leave to others; for equally with the fool he fails under the stroke of
death: he himself has no enjoyment, others have it; dying, he must leave
all behind him, - threefold הבל, [Ecc
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017.md), [Ecc
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021.md), [Ecc
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023.md), and thus הבלים הבל.

[Ecclesiastes 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 2:24</span></span>

"There is nothing better among men, than that one eat and drink, and
that he should pamper his soul by his labour: this also have I seen,
that it is in the hand of God." The lxx, as well as the other Greek
transl., and Jerome, had before them the words באדם שיאכל. The former
translates: "Man has not the good which he shall eat and drink," i.e.,
also this that he eats ... is for him no true good; but the direct
contrary of this is what Koheleth says. Jerome seeks to bring the
thought which the text presents into the right track, by using the form
of a question: nonne melius est comedere ...; against this [Ecc
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md), [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md), are not to be cited where טוב
אין stands in the dependent sentence; the thought is not thus to be
improved; its form is not this, for טוב rof ,siht, beginning a sentence,
is never interrog., but affirm.; thus טוב אין is not = הלא טוב, but is a
negative statement. It is above all doubt, that instead of שׁיּ בּאדם we
must read בּאדם משּׁיּ, after [Ecc
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md), [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md); for, as at [Job
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017.md), the initial letter mem after
the terminal mem has dropped out. Codd. of the lxx have accordingly
corrected ὃ into πλὴν ὃ or εἰ μὴ ὃ (thus the Compl. Ald.), and the Syr.
and Targ. render ש here by אלא דּ and אלהן דּ unless that he eat; Jerome
also has non est bonum homini nisi quod in his Comm.; only the Venet.
seeks to accommodate itself to the traditional text. Besides, only מ is
to be inserted, not אם כי; for the phrase לאכל אם כי is used, but not כי
אם ס. Instead of ba-a-da-m, the form la-a-da-m would be more agreeable,
as at [Ecc 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md); [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md). Hitzig remarks, without proof,
that bāādām is in accordance with later grammatical forms, which admit ב
= "for" before the object. ב, [Ecc
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#017.md), is neither prep. of the object,
nor is ἐν, Sir. 3:7, the exponent of the dative (vid., Grimm). bāādām
signifies, as at [Sa2 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#003.md), and as ἐν
ἀνθ, Sir. 11:14, inter homines; also [Ecc
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md) designates by טוב טוב what among
them (men) has to be regarded as good.

It is interesting to see how here the ancient and the modern forms of
the language run together, without the former wholly passing over into
the latter; משׁי, quam ut edat, is followed by norm. perfects, in
accordance with that comprehensive peculiarity of the old syntax which
Ewald, by an excellent figure, calls the dissolution of that which is
coloured into grey. טוב ... הד is equivalent to לו הי, [Psa
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019.md), the causative rendering of the
phrase טוב ראה, [Ecc 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md), or ר טובה,
[Ecc 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md); [Ecc
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#006.md). It is well to attend to בּעמלו by
his labour, which forms an essential component part of that which is
approved of as good. Not a useless sluggard-life, but a life which
connects together enjoyment and labour, is that which Koheleth thinks
the best in the world. But this enjoyment, lightening, embellishing,
seasoning labour, has also its But: etiam hoc vidi e manu Dei esse
(pendere). The order of the words harmonizes with this Lat.; it follows
the scheme referred to at [Gen 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004.md);
cf. on the contrary, [Ecc 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#006.md). Instead
of גּם־זה, neut. by attraction, there is here the immediately neut.
גּם־זה; the book uniformly makes use of this fem. form instead of זאת.
This or that is "in the hand of God," i.e., it is His gift, [Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md), [Ecc
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md), and it is thus conditioned by
Him, since man cannot give it to himself; cf. minni, [Isa
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md); mimmenni, [Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md); mimmennu, [Kg1
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#033.md).

This dependence of the enjoyment of life on God is established.

[Ecclesiastes 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ecc 2:25</span></span>

"For who can eat, and who can have enjoyment, without \[= except from
Him?\]" Also here the traditional text is tenable: we have to read ממנו
חוץ, after the lxx (which Jerome follows in his Comm.) and the Syr. If
we adopt the text as it lies before us, then the meaning would be, as
given by Gumpel,

(Note: Vid., regarding his noteworthy Comm. on Koheleth, my Jesurun, pp.
183 and 195. The author bears the name among Christians of Professor
Levisohn.)

and thus translated by Jerome: Quis ita devorabit et deliciis effluet ut
ego? But (1) the question thus understood would require ממּנּי יותר,
which Gumpel and others silently substitute in place of חוץ ם; (2) this
question, in which the king adjudicates to himself an unparalleled right
to eat and to enjoy himself, would stand out of connection with that
which precedes and follows.

Even though with Ginsburg, after Rashi, Aben Ezra, and Rashbam, we find
in [Ecc 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#025.md) the thought that the
labourer has the first and nearest title to the enjoyment of the fruit
of his labour (חוץ ם thus exemplif. as [Ecc
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008), ע ... למי.md), the continuation with
כּי, [Ecc 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md), is unsuitable; for the
natural sequence of the thoughts would then be this: But the enjoyment,
far from being connected with the labour as its self-consequence and
fruit, is a gift of God, which He gives to one and withholds from
another. If we read ממּנּוּ, then the sequence of the thoughts wants
nothing in syllogistic exactness. חוּשׁ .ssen here has nothing in common
with חוּשׁ = Arab. ḥât, to proceed with a violent, impetuous motion,
but, as at [Job 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#002.md), is = Arab. ḥss,
stringere (whence hiss, a sensible impression); the experience here
meant is one mediated by means of a pleasant external enjoyment. The
lxx, Theod., and Syr. translate: (and who can) drink, which Ewald
approves of, for he compares (Arab.) ḥasa (inf. ḥasy), to drink, to sip.
But this Arab. verb is unheard of in Heb.; with right, Heiligst. adheres
to the Arab., and at the same time the modern Heb. ḥass, חושׁ, sentire,
according to which Schultens, quis sensibus indulserit. ממנו חוּץ is not
= ולא ם, "except from him" (Hitz., Zckl.), but מן חוץ together mean
"except;" cf. e.g., the Mishnic לאמנה וחוץ לם, beyond the time and place
suitable for the thank-offering, חוץ מאחד מהם, excepting one of the
same, Menachoth vii. 3, for which the old Heb. would in the first case
use בלא, and in the second זולא or מן לבד (= Aram. מן בּר) (vid., p.
637). Accordingly ממנו חוץ means practer cum (Deum), i.e., unless he
will it and make it possible, Old Heb. מבּ, [Gen
41:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#044.md).

In enjoyment man is not free, it depends not on his own will: labour and
the enjoyment of it do not stand in a necessary connection; but
enjoyment is a gift which God imparts, according as He regards man as
good, or as a sinner.

[Ecclesiastes 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ecc 2:26</span></span>

"For to a man who appears to Him as good, He gave wisdom, and knowledge,
and joy; but to the sinner He gave the work of gathering and heaping up,
in order to give it to him who appears to Him as good: this also is
vain, and grasping after the wind;" viz., this striving after enjoyment
in and of the labour - it is "vain," for the purpose and the issue lie
far apart; and "striving after the wind," because that which is striven
for, when one thinks that he has it, only too often cannot be grasped,
but vanishes into nothing. If we refer this sentence to a collecting and
heaping up (Hengst., Grtz, and others), then the author would here come
back to what has already been said, and that too in the foregoing
section; the reference also to the arbitrary distribution of the good
things of life on the part of God (Knobel) is inadmissible, because
"this, although it might be called הבל, could not also be called רוח
רעות" (Hitz.); and perfectly inadmissible the reference to the gifts of
wisdom, knowledge, and joy (Bullock), for referred to these the sentence
gains a meaning only by introducing all kinds of things into the text
which here lie out of the connection.

Besides, what is here said has indeed a deterministic character, and
לפניו, especially if it is thought of in connection with ולח,

(Note: Written with segol under ט in P, Biblia Rabb., and elsewhere.
Thus correctly after the Masora, according to which this form of the
word has throughout the book segol under ,ט with the single exception of
[Ecc 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026). Cf. Michol 124b, 140b..md)

sounds as if to the good and the bad their objective worth and
distinction should be adjudicated; but this is not the meaning of the
author; the unreasonable thought that good or bad is what God's
arbitrary ordinance and judgment stamp it to be, is wholly foreign to
him. The "good before Him" is he who appears as good before God, and
thus pleases Him, because he is truly good; and the חוטא, placed in
contrast, as at [Ecc 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md), is the
sinner, not merely such before God, but really such; here לפניו has a
different signification than when joined with טוב: one who sins in the
sight of God, i.e., without regarding Him ([Luk
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#018), ἐνώπιον.md), serves sin. Regarding
ענין, vid., under 23a: it denotes a business, negotium; but here such as
one fatigues himself with, quod negotium facessit. Among the three
charismata, joy stands last, because it is the turning-point of the
series of thoughts: joy connected with wise, intelligent activity, is,
like wisdom and intelligence themselves, a gift of God. The obj. of לתת
(that He may give it) is the store gathered together by the sinner; the
thought is the same as that at [Pro
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md); [Pro
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#008.md); [Job
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016.md). The perfect we have so
translated, for that which is constantly repeating itself is here
designated by the general expression of a thing thus once for all
ordained, and thus always continued.
