The Yoke of Babylon upon Judah and the Neighbouring Peoples - Jeremiah
27-29

These three chapters are closely connected with one another. They all
belong to the earlier period of Zedekiah's reign, and contain words of
Jeremiah by means of which he confirms and vindicates against the
opposition of false prophets his announcement of the seventy years'
duration of the Chaldean supremacy over Judah and the nations, and warns
king and people patiently to bear the yoke laid on them by
Nebuchadnezzar. The three chapters have besides an external connection.
For Jer 28 is attached to the event of Jer 27 by its introductory
formula: And it came to pass in that year, at the beginning, etc., as
Jer 29 is to Jer 28 by ואלּה. To this, it is true, the heading handed
down in the Masoretic text is in contradiction. The date: In the
beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah king of Judah,
came this word to Jeremiah ([Jer
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001).md), is irreconcilable with the
date: And it came to pass in that year, in the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month. The name
"Jehoiakim the son of Josiah" in [Jer
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md) is erroneous. It is without doubt
the blunder of a copyist who had in his mind the heading of the 26th
chapter, and should have been "Zedekiah;" for the contents of Jer 27
carry us into Zedekiah's time, as plainly appears from [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md), [Jer
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012.md), and [Jer
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020.md). Hence the Syr. translation and
one of Kennicott's codd. have substituted the latter name.

(Note: Following the example of ancient comm., Haevernick in his Introd.
(ii. 2) has endeavoured to defend the date: "In the beginning of the
reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah." To this end he ventures the
hypothesis, that in Jer 27 there are placed beside one another three
discourses agreeing in their subject-matter: "one addressed to Jehoiakim
([Jer 27:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002).md), a second to Zedekiah
([Jer 27:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012).md), a third to the
priests and people;" and that the words: "by the hand of the ambassador
that came to Zedekiah the king of Judah," are appended to show how
Zedekiah ought to have obeyed the older prophecy of Jehoiakim's time,
and how he should have borne himself towards the nations with which he
was in alliance. but this does not solve the difficulty. The prophecy,
[Jer 27:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#004.md), is addressed to the
kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon; but since the envoys of
these kings did not come to Jerusalem till Zedekiah's time, we are
bound, if the prophecy dates from the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign, to
assume that this prophecy was communicated to Jeremiah and published by
him eleven years before the event, upon occasion of which it was to be
conveyed to the kings concerned. An assumption that would require
unusually cogent reasons to render it credible. Vv. 4b-21 contain
nothing whatever that points to Jehoiakim's time, or give countenance to
the hypothesis that the three sections of this chapter contain three
discourses of different dates, which have been put together on account
merely of the similarity of their contents.

Beyond this one error of transcription, these three chapters contain
nothing that could throw any doubt on the integrity of the text. There
are no traces of a later supplementary revision by another hand, such as
Mov., Hitz., and de W. profess to have discovered. The occurrence of
Jeremiah's name in the contracted form ירמיה, as also of other names
compounded with Jahu in the form Jah, does not prove later retouching;
for, as Graf has shown, we find alongside of it the fuller form also
([Jer 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012.md); [Jer
29:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#027).md), and have frequently both
longer and shorter forms in the same verse (so in [Jer
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md); [Jer
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012.md); [Jer
29:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029).md). And so long as other means
for distinguishing are wanting, it will not do to discriminate the
manner of expression in the original text from that of the reviser by
means of these forms alone. Again, as we have shown at p. 194, note,
there is a good practical reason for Jeremiah's being called "the
prophet" (הנּביא); so that this too is not the reviser's work. Finally,
we cannot argue later addition from the fact that the name of the king
of Babylon is written Nebuchadnezzar in [Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md), [Jer
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md),[Jer
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020.md); [Jer
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003.md), [Jer
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#011.md), [Jer
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014.md); [Jer
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md), [Jer
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003.md); for the same form appears again
in [Jer 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md) and [Jer
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md), and with it we have also
Nebuchadrezzar in [Jer 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md) and [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md). Elsewhere, it is true, we find
only the one form Nebuchadnezzar, and this is the unvarying spelling in
the books of Kings, Chron., Ezra, Dan., and in [Est
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#006.md); whereas Ezekiel uniformly writes
Nebuchadrezzar ([Eze 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007.md); [Eze
29:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018.md), and [Eze
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#010).md), and this form Jeremiah uses
twenty-seven times ([Jer 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002.md), [Jer
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#007.md); [Jer
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#025.md); [Jer
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md); [Jer
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md), [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md); [Jer
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md); [Jer
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001.md), [Jer
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#028.md); [Jer
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011.md); [Jer
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md); [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md), [Jer
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011.md); [Jer
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010.md); [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md); [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md), [Jer
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md), [Jer
46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026.md); [Jer
49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md), 40; [Jer
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md); [Jer
51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034.md); [Jer
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004.md), [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md), [Jer
52:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028.md) - not merely in the
discourses, but in the headings and historical parts as well). But
though the case is so, we are not entitled to conclude that
Nebuchadnezzar was a way of pronouncing the name that came into use at a
later time; the conclusion rather is, as we have remarked at p. 203, and
on [Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md), that the writing with n
represents the Jewish-Aramaean pronunciation, whereas the form
Nebuchadrezzar, according to the testimony of such inscriptions as have
been preserved, expresses more fairly Assyrian pronunciation. The Jewish
way of pronouncing would naturally not arise till after the king of
Babylon had appeared in Palestine, from which time the Jews would have
this name often on their lips. Hence it is in the book of Jeremiah alone
that we find both forms of the name (that with r 27 times, that with n
10 times). How it has come about that the latter form is used just three
times in each of Jer 27 and 28 cannot with certainty be made out. But
note, (1) that the form with n occurs twice in 28 ([Jer
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003.md) and [Jer
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#011).md) in the speech of the false
prophet Hananiah, and then, [Jer
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014.md), in Jeremiah's answer to that
speech; (2) that the prophecy of Jer 27 was addressed partly to the
envoys of the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, and Phoenicia, while it is
partly a warning to the people against the lying speeches of the false
prophets, and that it is just in these portions, [Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md), [Jer
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md), and [Jer
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020.md), that the name so written
occurs. If we consider this, we cannot avoid the conjecture, that by
changing the r for n, the Jewish people had accommodated to their own
mode of utterance the strange-sounding name Nabucudurusur, and that
Jeremiah made use of the popular pronunciation in these two discourses,
whereas elsewhere in all his discourses he uses Nebucahdrezzar alone;
for the remaining cases in which we find Nebuchadnezzar in this book are
contained in historical notices.)

[Jeremiah 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 27:1</span></span>

The Yoke of Babylon. - In three sections, connected as to their date and
their matter, Jeremiah prophesies to the nations adjoining Judah ([Jer
27:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002).md), to King Zedekiah ([Jer
27:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012).md), and to the priests and all
the people ([Jer 27:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#016).md), that God
has laid on them the yoke of the king of Babylon, and that they ought to
humble themselves under His almighty hand.

According to the (corrected) heading, the prophecy was given in the
beginning of the reign of Zedekiah. If we compare Jer 28 we find the
same date: "in that year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah,"
more fully defined as the fourth year of his reign. Graf has made
objection, that in the case of a reign of eleven years, one could not
well speak of the fourth year as the beginning of the reign. But the
idea of beginning is relative (cf. [Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010).md), and does not necessarily
coincide with that of the first year. The reign of Zedekiah is divided
into two halves: the first period, or beginning, when he was elevated by
Nebuchadnezzar, and remained subject to him, and the after or last
period, when he had rebelled against his liege lord.

[Jeremiah 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 27:2</span></span>

The yoke of the king of Babylon upon the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon,
Tyre, and Sidon. - [Jer 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002.md). "Thus
said Jahveh to me: Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy
neck, [Jer 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md). And send them to the
king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons of Ammon, the king
of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers that are
come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. [Jer
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#004.md). And command them to say unto
their masters, Thus hath Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, said: Thus
shall ye say unto your masters: [Jer
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#005.md). I have made the earth, the man
and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my
outstretched hand, and give it to whom it seemeth meet unto me. [Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md). And how have I given all these
lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my servant; and
the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him. [Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md). And all nations shall serve him,
and his son, and his son's son, until the time of his land come, and
many nations and great kings serve themselves of him. [Jer
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md). And the people and the kingdom
that will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will
not put its neck into the yoke of the king of Babylon, with sword, with
famine, and with pestilence I will visit that people, until I have made
an end of them by his hand. [Jer 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009.md).
And ye, hearken not to your prophets, and your soothsayers, and to your
dreams, to your enchanters and your sorcerers, which speak unto you,
saying: Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon. [Jer
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#010.md). For they prophesy a lie unto
you, that I should remove you far from your land, and that I should
drive you out and ye should perish. [Jer
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#011.md). But the people that will bring
its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and will serve him, that
will I let remain in its land, saith Jahveh, to till it and to dwell
therein."

The yoke Jeremiah is to make and lay on his neck is a plain emblem of
the Babylonian yoke the nations are to bear. The words "bonds and yokes"
denote together one yoke. מטות are the two wooden beams or poles of the
yoke, which were fastened together by means of the מוסרות, bonds, ropes,
so that the yoke might be laid on the beast's neck; cf. [Lev
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013.md). That Jeremiah really put such a
yoke on his neck and wore it, we see from [Jer
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010.md), [Jer
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012.md), where a false prophet breaks it
for him. He is to send the yoke to the kings of Edom, Moab, etc., by
means of envoys of those kings, who were come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah.
And since Jeremiah laid a yoke on his own neck, and so carried out the
commanded symbolical action in objective reality, there is no reason to
doubt that he made yokes for the five kings named and gave them to their
respective envoys. Chr. B. Mich., Hitz., Graf, hold this to be
improbable, and suppose that Jeremiah only made a yoke for himself and
put it on his neck; but by appearing abroad with it, he set before the
eyes of the ambassadors, the yoke that was to be laid on their kings,
and, in a certain sense, emblematically gave it to them. But even though
this might have sufficed to accomplish the aim of the prophecy, it is
difficulty to reconcile it with the wording of the text; hence Hitz.
seeks arbitrarily to change שׁלּחתּם into שׁלּחתּה. And it is a
worthless argument that Jeremiah cannot possibly have believed that the
envoys would carry the yokes with them and deliver them to their
masters. Why should not he have believed they would do so? And if they
did not, it was their concern. The plur. "bands and yokes" may indeed
mean a single yoke, but it may also mean many; and the verbs נתתּם and
שׁלּחתּם, both with plural suffixes, indicate clearly that he was to
make not merely one yoke for himself, but yokes for himself and the
kings. In [Jer 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010.md) and [Jer
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012.md), where one yoke is spoken of,
the singular המּוטה is used; while, [Jer
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#013.md), "yokes of wood hast thou
broken," does not prove that this plural has the same force as the
singular.

We are not told for what purpose ambassadors from the kings named had
come to Jerusalem; but we can discover what it was from the message
Jeremiah gives them for their lords. From this it appears, without a
doubt, that they were come to take counsel as to a coalition with the
view of throwing off the Chaldean supremacy. By God's command Jeremiah
opposes this design with the announcement, that the God of Israel, the
Creator of the world and of all creatures, has given all these lands
(those of the kings named in [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003).md) into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar;
that men, and even beasts, should serve him, i.e., that he might
exercise unbounded dominion over these lands and all that belonged to
them, cf. [Jer 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014.md). "My servant," as
in [Jer 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md). All nations are to serve
him, his son and his grandson. These words simply express the long
duration of the king of Babylon's power over them, without warranting us
in concluding that he was succeeded on the throne by his son and his
grandson, cf. [Deu 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#002.md); [Deu
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#025.md). For, as we know, Nebuchadnezzar
was succeeded by his son Evil-Merodach; then came his brother-in-law
Neriglissar, who murdered Evil-Merodach, who was followed by his son
Laborosoarchod, a child, murdered after a nine months' reign by
conspirators. Of these latter, Neboned ascended the throne of Babylon;
and it was under his reign that the time for his land came that it
should be made subject by many nations and great kings, cf. [Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md). גּם הוּא serves to strengthen
the suffix on ארצו; and the suffix, like בּו, refers to Nebuchadnezzar.

(Note: [Jer 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md) is wanting in the
lxx, and therefore Mov. and Hitz. pronounce it spurious. But, as Graf
remarked, they have no sufficient reason for this, since, reference
being had to [Jer 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#016.md) and to [Jer
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003.md), [Jer
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#011.md), this verse is very much in
place here. It is not a vaticinium ex eventu, as Hitz. asserts, but was
rather omitted by the lxx, simply because its contents, taken literally,
were not in keeping with the historical facts. The lxx omit also the
clause from "that will not serve" to "king of Babylon and," which is
accordingly, and for other subjective reasons of taste, pronounced
spurious by Hitz.; but Graf justly opposes this.)

What is said in [Jer 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md) and [Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md) is made sterner by the
threatening of [Jer 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md), that the
Lord will punish with sword, famine, and pestilence the people and
kingdom that will not serve Nebuchadnezzar. ואת introduces a second
relative clause, the את being here quite in place, since "the people and
the kingdom" are accusatives made to precede absolutely, and resumed
again by the 'על הגּוי ה, which belongs directly to the verb "visit."
With עד־תּמּי, cf. [Jer 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#010.md) and אתם
עד־כּלּותי, corresponding in meaning, in [Jer
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015.md).

[Jeremiah 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 27:9</span></span>

Therefore they must not hearken to their prophets, soothsayers, and
sorcerers, that prophesy the contrary. The mention of dreams between the
prophets and soothsayers on the one hand, and the enchanters and
sorcerers on the other, strikes us as singular. It is, however, to be
explained from the fact, that prophets and soothsayers often feigned
dreams and dream-revelations (cf. [Jer
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025).md); and other persons, too, might
have dreams, and could give them out as significant. Cf. [Jer
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008.md), where dreams are expressly
distinguished from the discourse of the prophets and soothsayers.
Whether the reckoning of five kinds of heathen prophecy has anything to
do with the naming of five kings (Hitz.), appears to us to be
questionable; but it is certain that Jeremiah does not design to specify
five different, i.e., distinct and separate, kinds of heathen
divination. For there was in reality no such distinction. Heathen
prophecy was closely allied with sorcery ad soothsaying; cf. [Deu
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009.md)., and Oehler on the Relation of
Old Testament Prophecy to Heathen Divination (Tb. 1861). The enumeration
of the multifarious means and methods for forecasting the future is
designed to show the multitude of delusive schemes for supplying the
lack of true and real divine inspiration. כּשּׁפים, equivalent to
מכשּׁפים , the same which in [Deu
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md) is used along with מעונן. The
explanation of the last-mentioned word is disputed. Some take it from
ענן, cloud = cloud-maker or storm-raiser; others from עין, eye =
fascinator, the idea being that of bewitching with the evil eye; see on
[Lev 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026.md). The use of the word along
with מנחשׁ וּמכשּׁף, [Deu 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md),
favours the latter rendering, whereas no passage in which the word is
used in the Old Testament supports the sig. storm-raiser. "That I should
remove you," as is shown by the continuation of the infinitive by
והדּחתּי. The false prophets delude the people, inducing them to rise in
rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, contrary to God's will, and thus
simply bringing about their expulsion from their land, i.e., removal
into banishment. למען shows, as frequently, that the inevitable
consequence of these persons' proceedings is designed by them.

[Jeremiah 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 27:11</span></span>

The people, on the other hand, that bends under the yoke of the king of
Babylon shall remain in its own land. For the great Asiatic conquerors
contented themselves, in the first place, with thoroughly subjecting the
vanquished nations and imposing a tribute; only in the case of stubborn
resistance or of insurrection on the part of the conquered did they
proceed to destroy the kingdoms and deport their populations. This
Zedekiah and the ambassadors that had come to him might have learnt from
Nebuchadnezzar's course of action after the capture of Jerusalem under
Jehoiachin, as compared with that in Jehoiakim's time, had they not been
utterly infatuated by the lying spirit of the false prophets, whose
prophecies accommodated themselves to the wishes of the natural heart.

[Jeremiah 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 27:12</span></span>

To King Zedekiah Jeremiah addressed words of like import, saying: "Bring
your necks into the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his
people, and ye shall live. [Jer 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013.md).
Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by sword, famine, and pestilence,
as Jahveh hath spoken concerning the people that will not serve the king
of Babylon? [Jer 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#014.md). And hearken
not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you: Ye shall not
serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you. [Jer
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#015.md). For I have not sent them, saith
Jahveh, and they prophesy in my name falsely, that I might drive you out
and ye might perish, ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you." - The
discourse addressed to the king in the plural, "bring your necks," etc.,
is explained by the fact that, as [Jer
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013.md) shows, in and along with the
king of his people are addressed. The imperative וחיוּ intimates the
consequence of the preceding command. [Jer
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013.md) gives the application of the
threat in [Jer 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md) to King Zedekiah
and his people; and [Jer 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#014.md). gives
the warning corresponding to [Jer 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009.md)
and [Jer 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#010.md) against the sayings of
the lying prophets; cf. [Jer 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#014.md) and
[Jer 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016.md), [Jer
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021.md).

[Jeremiah 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 27:16</span></span>

The priests and all the people are warned to give no belief to the false
prophesyings of a speedy restoration of the vessels carried off to
Babylon. - [Jer 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#016.md). "Thus hath
Jahveh said: Hearken not to the sayings of your prophets that prophesy
unto you: Behold, the vessels of Jahveh's house shall now shortly be
brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you. [Jer
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#017.md). Hearken not unto them; serve
the king of Babylon and live; wherefore should this city become a
desert? [Jer 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#018.md). But if they be
prophets, and if the word of Jahveh be with them, let them now make
intercession to Jahveh of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the
house of Jahveh, and in the king's house, and in Jerusalem, go not to
Babylon. [Jer 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md). For thus saith
Jahveh of hosts concerning the pillars and the \[brazen\] sea and the
frames, and concerning the other vessels that are left in this city,
[Jer 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020.md). Which Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon took not away when he carried away captive Jechoniah the son
of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, with all the
nobles of Judah and Jerusalem. [Jer
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#021.md). For thus saith Jahveh of hosts,
the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of
Jahveh, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: [Jer
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#022.md). To Babylon shall they be
brought, and there shall they remain until the day that I visit them,
saith Jahveh, and carry them up, and bring them back to this place."

Here Jeremiah gives King Zedekiah warning that the prophecies of a
speedy end to Chaldean bondage are lies, and that confidence in such
lies will hurry on the ruin of the state. He at the same time disabuses
the priests of the hope raised by the false prophets, that the vessels
of the temple and of the palace that had been carried off at the time
Jechoniah was taken to Babylon will very soon be restored; and assures
them that such statements can only procure the destruction of the city,
since their tendency is to seduce king and people to rebellion, and
rebellion against the king of Babylon means the destruction of Jerusalem
- a prophecy that was but too soon fulfilled. The vessels of the temple,
[Jer 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#016.md), are the golden vessels
Solomon caused to be made ([Kg1
7:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048)..md), which Nebuchadnezzar had
carried to Babylon, [Kg2 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013.md).
מבּבלה, from towards Babylon, i.e., from Babylon, whither they had been
taken; cf. Ew. 216, b. "Now shortly," lit., hastily or speedily, i.e.,
ere long, cf. [Jer 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003.md), where the
prophet Hananiah foretells the restoration of them within two years, in
opposition to Jeremiah's affirmation that the exile will last seventy
years.

(Note: These words are not given in lxx, and so Mov. and Hitz. pronounce
them spurious. Haev., on the other hand, and with greater justice, says
(Introd. ii. 2), that the lxx omitted the words, because, according to
an Alexandrian legend, the temple furniture was really very soon
restored, even in Zedekiah's time, cf. Baruch 1:8ff.; so that the false
prophets were in the right. The passage cited from Baruch does not
indeed give a very rigorous proof of this. It alleges that the silver
vessels which Zedekiah had caused to be made after Jechoniah's exile had
been brought back by Baruch. But considering the innumerable arbitrary
interferences of the lxx with the text of Jeremiah, the omission of the
words in question cannot justify the slightest critical suspicion of
their genuineness.)

To show more clearly the irreconcilableness of his own position with
that of the false prophets, Jeremiah further tells what true prophets,
who have the word of Jahveh, would do. They would betake themselves in
intercession to the Lord, seeking to avert yet further calamity or
punishment, as all the prophets sent by God, including Jeremiah himself,
did, cf. [Jer 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md). They should
endeavour by intercession to prevent the vessels that are still left in
Jerusalem from being taken away. The extraordinary expression לבלתּי
באוּ has probably come from the omission of Jod from the verb, which
should be read יבאוּ. As it stands, it can only be imperative, which is
certainly not suitable. לבלתּי is usually construed with the infinitive,
but occasionally also with the temp. fin.; with the imperf., which is
what the sense here demands, in [Exo
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#020.md); with the perf., [Jer
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014.md). - Of the temple furniture still
remaining, he mentions in [Jer 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md)
as most valuable the two golden pillars, Jachin and Boaz, [Kg1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#015.md)., the brazen sea, [Kg1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023.md)., and המּכונות, the artistic
waggon frames for the basins in which to wash the sacrificial flesh,
[Kg1 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027.md).; and he declares they too
shall be carried to Babylon, as happened at the destruction of
Jerusalem, [Kg2 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013.md). (בּגלותו for
בּהגלותו.)

(Note: The statement in [Jer 27:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md)
is wide and diffuse; it is therefore condensed in the lxx, but at the
same time mutilated. From the fact Mov., with Hitz. agreeing thereto,
concludes that the Hebr. text has been expanded by means of glosses.
Graf has already shown in reply to this, that the hand of a later
glossator interpolating materials from [Jer
52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017.md); [Kg2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013.md) and [Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md) is not betrayed in the extended
account of the furniture remaining, and of the occasion on which it was
left behind. He goes on to show that it is rather the editorial hand of
Baruch than the hand of the glossator that is to be presumed from the
fact that, in consequence of the narrative part of [Jer
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020.md), [Jer
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md) is repeated in [Jer
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#021.md); and from the further fact that
it is impossible here to discriminate the interpolated from the original
matter. Graf has also so conclusively proved the worthlessness of the
distinguishing marks of the glossator adduced by Mov. and Hitz., that we
adopt in full his argument. Such marks are (we are told), (1) the
scriptio plena of מכונות here, as contrasted with [Jer
52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017.md); [Kg2
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013.md); [Ch2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#014.md), and of יכוניה, as against [Ch2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001.md); [Ch2
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#004.md); [Ch2
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#002.md); and yet the interpolations in
[Jer 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md) and [Jer
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020.md) are said to have been taken
directly from [Jer 52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017.md) and [Jer
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001). (2.md) The expression חרים, which
is alleged not to have come into use till the exile. But the fact of its
standing here and in [Jer 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006.md) is
enough to show it to have been earlier in use; cf. also [Kg1
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008.md), [Kg1
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#011.md); and since it is not used in
[Jer 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md) and [Jer
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002.md), it is certain that it has not
been got from there. (3) The "slip-shod" וירושׁלים, [Jer
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#021.md), for ובירושׁלים, [Jer
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#018.md), which is, however, occasioned
simply by the preceding accusative of place, 'בית יהוה וגו ([Jer
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#018) also בּבית יהוה)..md)
