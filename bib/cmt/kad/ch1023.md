<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 23:0</span></span>

Enumeration and Arrangement of the Levites According to Their Divisions
and Employments - 1 Chronicles 23-26

These four chapters give a connected view of the condition of the
Levites towards the end, i.e., in the fortieth year, of David's reign
(cf. [Ch1 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001.md) and [Ch1
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#031).md), and of the sections into which
they were divided according to their various services. This review
begins with a statement of the total number belonging to the tribe of
Levi according to the census then undertaken, and their divisions
according to the duties devolving upon ([Ch1
23:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002).md); which is followed by an
enumeration of the heads of the fathers'-houses into which the four
families of Levites had branched out (23:6-23), together with a short
review of their duties ([Ch1
23:24-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024).md). Thereafter we have: 1. In 1
Chron 24, a catalogue of the Aaronites, i.e., of the priests, who were
divided into twenty-four classes, corresponding to the sons of Eleazar
and Ithamar, and were appointed to perform the service in succession,
according as it was determined by lot, special mention being made of the
heads of these twenty-four classes; and a catalogue of the heads of the
fathers'-houses of the other descendants of Levi, in an order of
succession, which was likewise settled by lot ([Ch1
24:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020).md). Then, 2. In 1 Chron 25 we
have a catalogue of the twenty-four orders of Levitic musicians, in an
order fixed by lot. And, 3. In 1 Chron 26 the classes of doorkeepers
(vv. 1-19), the administrators of the treasures of the sanctuary ([Ch1
26:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020).md), and the officials who
performed the external services ([Ch1
26:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029).md).

[1 Chronicles 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 23:1</span></span>

Number, duties, and fathers'-houses of the Levites. - This clear account
of the state and the order of service of the tribe of Levi is introduced
by the words, [Ch1 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001.md), "David was
old, and life weary; then he made his son Solomon king over Israel."
זקן, generally an adjective, is here third pers. perf. of the verb, as
in [Gen 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012.md), as שׂבע also is, to
which ימים is subordinated in the accusative. Generally elsewhere ימים
שׂבע is used, cf. [Gen 35:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029.md); [Job
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#017.md), and also שׂבע alone, with the
same signification, [Gen 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008.md). These
words are indeed, as Berth. correctly remarks, not a mere passing remark
which is taken up again at a later stage, say [Ch1
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#028.md), but an independent statement
complete in itself, with which here the enumeration of the arrangements
which David made in the last period of his life begins. But
notwithstanding that, it serves here only as an introduction to the
arrangements which follow, and is not to be taken to mean that David
undertook the numbering of the Levites and the arrangement of their
service only after he had given over the government to his son Solomon,
but signified that the arrangement of this matter immediately preceded
Solomon's elevation to the throne, or was contemporaneous with it. Our
verse therefore does not contain, in its few words, a "summary of the
contents of the narrative 1 Kings 1," as Berth. thinks, for in 1 Kings 1
we have an account of the actual anointing of Solomon and his accession
to the throne in consequence of Adonijah's attempt to usurp it. By that
indeed Solomon certainly was made king; but the chronicler, in
accordance with the plan of his book, has withdrawn his attention from
this event, connected as it was with David's domestic relations, and has
used המליך in its more general signification, to denote not merely the
actual elevation to the throne, but also his nomination as king. Here
the nomination of Solomon to be king, which preceded the anointing
narrated in 1 Kings 1, that taking place at a time when David had
already become bed-rid through old age, is spoken of. This was the first
step towards the transfer of the kingdom to Solomon; and David's
ordering of the Levitical service, and of the other branches of public
administration, so as to give over a well-ordered kingdom to his
successor, were also steps in the same process. Of the various branches
of the public administration, our historian notices in detail on the
Levites and their service, compressing everything else into the account
of the army arrangements and the chief public officials, 1 Chron 27.

[1 Chronicles 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 23:2</span></span>

Numbering of the Levites, and partition of their duties. - [Ch1
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002.md). For this purpose David collected
"all the princes of Israel, and the priests and Levites." The princes of
Israel, because the numbering of the Levites and the determination of
their duties was a matter of national importance. "The meaning is, that
David, in a solemn assembly of the princes, i.e., of the representatives
of the lay tribes, and of the priests and Levites, fixed the
arrangements of which an account is to be given" (Berth.).

[Ch1 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003.md)

The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upwards. This
statement agrees with that in [Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md), [Num
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#023.md), [Num
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#030.md), [Num
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#039.md)., where Moses caused those from
thirty to fifty years of age to be numbered, and appointed them for
service about the tabernacle during the journey through the wilderness.
But Moses himself, at a later time, determined that their period of
service should be from twenty-five to fifty; [Num
8:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#023.md). It is consequently not
probable that David confined the numbering to those of thirty and
upwards. But besides that, we have a distinct statement in [Ch1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md) that they were numbered from
twenty years of age, the change being grounded by David upon the nature
of their service; and that this was the proper age is confirmed by [Ch2
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#017.md) and [Ezr
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md), according to which the Levites
under Hezekiah, and afterwards, had to take part in the service from
their twentieth year. We must therefore regard שׁלשׂים in [Ezr
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md) as having crept into the text
through the error of copyists, who were thinking of the Mosaic census in
Num 4, and must read עשׂרים instead of it. The various attempts of
commentators to get rid of the discrepancy between [Ch1
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003.md) and [Ch1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md) are mere makeshifts; and the
hypothesis that David took two censuses is as little supported by the
text, as that other, that our chapter contains divergent accounts drawn
from two different sources; see on [Ch1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md). The number amounted to 38,000,
according to their heads in men. לגברים serves for a nearer definition
of לגלגּלתם, and explains that only men were numbered, women not being
included.

[Ch1 23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md)

[Ch1 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md) and [Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md) contain words of David, as we
learn from להלּל עשׂתי אשׁר ([Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005), end.md), so that we must supply
דויד ויּאמר before [Ch1 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md). מאלּה,
of these (38,000) 24,000 shall be וגו לנצּח, to superintend the
business, i.e., to conduct and carry on the business (the work) of the
house of Jahve. This business is in [Ch1
23:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#028.md) more nearly defined, and
embraces all the business that was to be carried on about the sanctuary,
except the specifically priestly functions, the keeping of the doors,
and the performance of the sacred music. For these two latter offices
special sections were appointed, 4000 for the porters' services, and the
same number for the sacred music ([Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005).md). Besides these, 5000 men were
appointed Shoterim and judges. "The instruments which I have made to
sing praise" are the stringed instruments which David had introduced
into the service to accompany the singing of the psalms; cf. [Ch2
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#026.md); [Neh
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#036.md).

[1 Chronicles 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 23:6</span></span>

The fathers'-houses of the Levites. - [Ch1
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#006.md). "And David divided them into
courses according to the sons of Levi, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari;" see
on [Ch1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md). The form ויּחלקם which
recurs in [Ch1 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003.md) with the same
pointing, is in more accurate MSS in that place pointed ויּחלקם. There
are also found in MSS and editions ויחלּקם, and the rare form of the Kal
ויּחלקם (for ויּחלקם); cf. J. H. Mich. Notae crit. This last
pronunciation is attested for, [Ch1
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003.md), by D. Kimchi, who expressly
remarks that the regular form ויּחלקם corresponds to it; cf. Norzi on
this passage. Gesen. (in Thes. p. 483) and Ew. (83, c) regard ויּחלקם as
a variety of the Piel (ויחלּקם), to which, however, Berth. rightly
remarks that it would be worth a thought only if the punctuation ויחלקם
were confirmed by good MSS, which is not the case, though we find the
Piel in the Chronicle in [Ch1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#003.md),
and then with the signification to distribute. Berth. therefore holds -
and certainly this is the more correct opinion - that the form ויּחלקם,
attested by Kimchi for [Ch1 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003.md), was
the original reading in our verse also, and considers it a rare form of
the impf. Kal derived from ויּחלקם (cf. [Ch1
24:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#004).md), by Kamets coming into the
pretonic syllable, after the analogy of יּשׁחטוּם for ישׁחטוּם, [Kg2
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#014.md), and by the passing of an ă
(Pathach) into ĕ (Seghol) before the Kamets, according to well-known
euphonic rules. מחלקות is a second accusative: "in divisions." The tribe
of Levi had been divided from ancient times into the three great
families of Gershonites, Kohathites, and Merarites, corresponding to the
three sons of Levi; cf. 1 Chron 6:1-53; 28:32. - From [Ch1
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007.md) onwards we have an enumeration of
the fathers'-houses into which these three families were divided: [Ch1
23:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007.md), the fathers'-houses of the
Gershonites; [Ch1 23:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#012.md), those of
the Kohathites; and [Ch1 23:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#021.md),
those of the Merarites. Berth., on the other hand, thinks that in these
verses only the fathers'-houses of those Levites who performed the
service of the house of Jahve, i.e., the 24,000 in [Ch1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md), and not the divisions of all the
Levites, are enumerated. But this opinion is incorrect, and certainly is
not proved to be true by the circumstance that the singers, porters, and
the scribes and judges, are only spoken of afterwards; nor by the remark
that, in great part, the names here enumerated appear again in the
sections [Ch1 24:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020.md) and [Ch1
26:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md), while in the enumeration of
the twenty-four classes of musicians (1 Chron 25), of the doorkeepers
(26:1-19), and of the scribes and judges ([Ch1
26:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029).md), quite other names are met
with. The recurrence of many of the names here enumerated in the
sections [Ch1 24:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020.md) and [Ch1
26:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020.md) is easily explained by the
fact that these sections treat of the divisions of the Levites,
according to the service they performed, and of course many heads of
fathers'-houses must again be named. The occurrence of quite other names
in the lists of musicians and doorkeepers, again, is simply the result
of the fact that only single branches of fathers'-houses, not whole
fathers'-houses, were appointed musicians and doorkeepers. Finally,
Bertheau's statement, that in the catalogue of the scribes and judges
quite other names occur than those in our verses, is based upon an
oversight; cf. [Ch1 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#031.md) with [Ch1
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#019.md).

[Ch1 23:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007.md)

The fathers'-houses of the Gershonites. - According to the natural
development of the people of Israel, the twelve sons of Jacob founded
the twelve tribes of Israel; his grandsons, or the sons of the twelve
patriarchs, founded the families (משׁפּחות); and their sons, i.e., the
great-grandsons of Jacob, founded the fathers'-houses (בּית־אבות). But
this natural division or ramification of the people into tribes,
families, and fathers'-houses (groups of related households), was not
consistently carried out. Even the formation of the tribes suffered a
modification, when the two sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, who
were born before Jacob's arrival in Egypt, were adopted by him as his
sons, and so made founders of tribes ([Gen
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005).md). The formation of the families
and fathers'-houses was also interfered with, partly by the descendants
of many grandsons or great-grandsons of Jacob not being numerous enough
to form independent families and fathers'-houses, and partly by
individual fathers'-houses (or groups of related households) having so
much decreased that they could no longer form independent groups, and so
were attached to other fathers'-houses, or by families which had
originally formed a בּית־אב becoming so numerous as to be divided into
several fathers'-houses. In the tribe of Levi there came into operation
this special cause, that Aaron and his sons were chosen to be priests,
and so his family was raised above the other Levites. From these causes,
in the use of the words משׁפּחה and בּית־אב many fluctuations occur; cf.
my bibl. Archol. ii. 140. Among the Levites, the fathers'-houses were
founded not by the grandsons, but by the great-grandsons of the
patriarch.

[Ch1 23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007.md)

"Of the Gershonites, Laadan and Shimei," i.e., these were heads of
groups of related families, since, according to [Ch1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#009.md), their sons and descendants
formed six fathers'-houses. The sons of Gershon, from whom all branches
of the family of Gershon come, are called in [Ch1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002.md), as in [Exo
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#017.md) and [Num
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#018.md), Libni and Shimei; while in our
verse, on the contrary, we find only the second name Shimei, whose sons
are enumerated in [Ch1 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#010.md), [Ch1
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#011.md); and instead of Libni we have
the name Laadan, which recurs in [Ch1
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#021.md). Laadan seemingly cannot be
regarded as a surname of Libni; for not only are the sons of Shimei
named along with the sons of Laadan in [Ch1
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#008.md) and [Ch1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#009.md) as heads of the fathers'-houses
of Laadan, without any hint being given of the genealogical connection
of this Shimei with Laadan, but mainly because of לגּרשׁנּי in [Ch1
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007.md). In the case of Kohath and
Merari, the enumeration of the fathers'-houses descended from them is
introduced by the mention of their sons, קהת בני and מררי בני ([Ch1
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#012.md), [Ch1
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#021).md), while in the case of Gershon
it is not so; - in his case, instead of גרשׁון בני, we find the Gentilic
designation גּרשׁנּי, to point out that Laadan and Shimei are not named
as being sons of Gershon, but as founders of the two chief lines of
Gershonites, of which only the second was named after Gershon's son
Shimei, while the second derived their name from Laadan, whose family
was divided in David's time into two branches, the sons of Laadan and
the sons of Shimei, the latter a descendant of Libni, not elsewhere
mentioned. That the Shimei of [Ch1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#009.md) is not the same person as Shimei
the son of Gershon mentioned in [Ch1
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007.md), is manifest from the fact that
the sons of the latter are enumerated only in [Ch1
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#010.md). Each of these two lines
numbered at that time three fathers'-houses, the heads of which are
named in [Ch1 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#008.md) and [Ch1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#009.md). הראשׁ in [Ch1
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#008.md) belongs to יחיאל: "the sons of
Laadan were: the head (also the first; cf. [Ch1
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#011.md), [Ch1
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#016).md) Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel,
three."

[Ch1 23:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#009.md)

The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth or Shelomith (both forms are found in
26:35 of another Shelomith), Haziel, and Haran, three. These (three and
three) are the heads of the fathers'-houses of Laadan. - In [Ch1
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#010.md) and [Ch1
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#011.md) there follow the fathers'-houses
of the Shimei mentioned in [Ch1 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007.md)
along with Laadan: they are likewise three, derived from the four sons
of Shimei, Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah; for the last two, as they
had not many sons, were included in one father's-house, one פּקדּה,
i.e., one official class ([Ch1 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003.md);
[Ch2 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#014).md). The Gershonites at that
time, therefore, numbered nine father's-houses-six named after Laadan,
and three after Shimei.

[Ch1 23:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#012.md)

The fathers'-houses of the Kohathites. - The four sons of Kohath who are
named in [Ch1 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#012.md), as in [Ch1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002.md); [Ch1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#018.md), and [Exo
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018.md), founded the four families of
Kohath, [Num 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027.md). From Amram came
Aaron and Moses; see on [Exo 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md). Of
these, Aaron with his sons was set apart "to sanctify him to be a most
holy one; he and his sons for ever to offer incense before Jahve, to
serve Him, and to bless in His name for ever." קדשׁ ק להקדּישׁו
signifies neither, ut ministraret in sancto sanctorum (Vulg., Syr.),
nor, ut res sanctissimas, sacrificia, vasa sacra etc. consecrarent
(Cler.). Against this interpretation we adduce not only the objection
advanced by Hgstb. Christol. iii. p. 119, trans., that the office
assigned by it to the Levites is far too subordinate to be mentioned
here in the first place, but also the circumstance that the suffix in
הקדּישׁו, after the analogy of שׁרתו, must denote the object of the
sanctifying; and this view is confirmed by the subject, who offers
incense and blesses, not being expressed with להקטיר and לברך. The
Vulgate translation cannot be accepted, for קדשׁים קדשׁ cannot be the
ablative, and the most holy place in the temple is always called
הקּדשׁים קדשׁ with the article. קדשׁים קדשׁ, without the article, is
only used of the most holy things, e.g., of the vessels connected with
the worship, the sacrificial gifts, and other things which no lay person
might touch or appropriate. See on [Exo
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md); [Lev
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md), and [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md). Here it is committed to Aaron,
who, by being chosen for the priest's service and anointed to the
office, was made a most holy person, to discharge along with his sons
all the priestly functions in the sanctuary. Specimens of such functions
are then adduced: יי לפני הקטיר, the offering of the sacrifice of
incense upon the altar of the inner sanctuary, as in [Ch2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#003.md), [Ch2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#005.md); [Exo
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007.md).; לשׁרתו, "to serve Him," Jahve,
- a general expression, including all the other services in the
sanctuary, which were reserved for the priests; and בּשׁמו לברך, to
bless in His name, i.e., to pronounce the blessing in the name of the
Lord over the people, according to the command in [Num
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023.md), cf. [Ch1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#002.md); [Deu
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#005.md); not "to bless His name" (Ges.,
Berth.). To call upon or praise the name of God is שׁמו בּרך, [Psa
96:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#002.md); [Psa
100:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#004.md); and the assertion that בשׁם
בּרך is a somewhat later phrase formed on the model of בשׁם קרא, for "to
call upon God" (Ges. in Lex. sub voce בלך), is quite groundless. Our
phrase occurs as early as in [Deu 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008.md)
and [Deu 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#005.md); and the latter passage
in connection with לשׁרתו of the priests; in the former, of the tribe of
Levi, but so used that it can refer only to the priests, not to the
Levites also.

[Ch1 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#014.md)

"But as to Moses the man of God" (cf. [Deu
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001).md), "his sons were called after the
tribe of Levi," i.e., were reckoned in the ranks of the Levites, not of
the priests. On על נקרא, cf. [Gen
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#006.md); [Ezr
2:61](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#061.md); [Neh
7:63](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#063.md).

[Ch1 23:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#015.md)

Each of his two sons Gershon and Eliezer (see [Exo
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#022.md) and [Exo
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#003)..md) founded a father's-house;
Gershon through his son Shebuel (שׁבוּאל, in [Ch1
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020) שׁוּבאל.md), Eliezer through
Rehabiah. The plurals בני ג, בני א are used, although in both cases only
one son, he who was head (הראשׁ) of the father's-house, is mentioned,
either because they had other sons, or those named had in their turn
sons, who together formed a father's-house. From the remark in [Ch1
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#017.md), that Eliezer had no other sons
than Rehabiah, while Rehabiah had very many, we may conclude that
Gershon had other sons besides Shebuel, who are not mentioned because
their descendants were numbered with Shebuel's father's-house.

[Ch1 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#018.md)

Only one son of Jizhar, the brother of Amram, is mentioned, Shelomith as
head, after whom the Jizharite father's-house is named.

[Ch1 23:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#019.md)

Amram's next brother Hebron had four sons, and the youngest brother
Uzziel two, who founded fathers'-houses; so that, besides the priests,
nine Levitical fathers'-houses are descended from Kohath, and their
chiefs who served in the sanctuary are enumerated in [Ch1
24:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020.md).

[Ch1 23:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#021.md)

The fathers'-houses of the Merarites. - [Ch1
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#021.md). As in [Ch1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#019.md); [Exo
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#019.md), and [Num
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#033.md), two sons of Merari are
mentioned-Mahli and Mushi-who founded the two families of Merari which
existed in the time of Moses. Mahli had two sons, Eleazar and Kish; the
first of whom, however, left behind him at his death only daughters, who
were married to the sons of Kish (אחיהם, i.e., their cousins), according
to the law as to daughters who were heiresses ([Num
26:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#006).md). The descendants of Mahli,
therefore, were comprehended in the one father's-house of Kish, whose
head at that time ([Ch1 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#029).md) was
Jerahmeel.

[Ch1 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#023.md)

Of the sons of Mushi, three founded fathers'-houses, so that the
Merarites formed only four fathers'-houses in all. If we compare the
enumeration of the Merarites in [Ch1
24:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026.md), we find there in [Ch1
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#030.md) Eleazar and Kish called sons of
Mahli, with the remark that Eleazar had no sons. In [Ch1
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026.md), however, of the same passage we
read, "sons of Merari (were) Mahli and Mushi, sons of Jaaziah his son;"
and [Ch1 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#027.md), "sons of Merari by
Jaaziah his son; and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri." From this Bertheau
concludes that Merari had really three sons, and that the name of the
third has been dropped out of 1 Chron 23; but in this he is incorrect,
for [Ch1 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#026.md) and [Ch1
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#027.md) of the 24th chapter are at once,
from their whole character, recognisable as arbitrary interpolations.
Not only is it strange that בּנו יעזיּהוּ בּני should follow the
before-mentioned sons of Merari in this unconnected way (Vav being
omitted before בּני), but the form of the expression also is peculiar.
If יעזיּהוּ be a third son of Merari, or the founder of a third family
of Merarites, coordinate with the families of Mahli and Mushi, as we
must conclude from the additional word בּנו, we should expect, after the
preceding, simply the name with the conjunction, i.e., ויעזיּהוּ. The
יעזיּהוּ בּני is all the more surprising that the names of the sons of
Jaaziah follow in [Ch1 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#027.md), and
there the name of the first son שׁהם is introduced by the Vav
copulative. This misled the older commentators, so that they took בּנו
for a proper name. The repetition of מררי בּני, too, at the beginning of
the second verse is strange, and without parallel in the preceding
enumeration of the fathers'-houses founded by Amram's sons ([Ch1
24:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020).md). We must, then, as the
result of all this, since the Pentateuch knows only two descendants of
Merari who founded families of fathers'-houses,

(Note: Bertheau, on the contrary, proceeding on the hypothesis that we
may presume the list of Merari's descendants which is given in our
verses to have been originally in perfect agreement with that in [Ch1
24:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026.md), would emend our text
according to [Ch1 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#021.md), for it cannot
be doubted that in our passage also Jaaziah and his three sons were
named. But since elsewhere only the two sons Mahli and Mushi occur, one
can easily see why the third son Jaaziah came to be omitted from our
passage, while we cannot conceive any motive which would account for the
later and arbitrary interpolation of the names in [Ch1
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026.md). This argumentation is weak to a
degree, since it quite overlooks the main difficulty connected with this
hypothesis. Had we no further accounts of the descendants of Merari than
those in the two passages of the Chronicle ([Ch1
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#011.md). and [Ch1
24:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026).md), it would be natural to
suppose that in [Ch1 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#021.md). the
additional names which we find in 1 Chron 24 had been dropped out. But
in the genealogical lists in the Pentateuch also ([Exo
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#019.md) and [Num
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#033).md), only two sons of Merari are
named; and according to them, the Merarites, when Moses' census of the
Levites was taken, formed only two families. Had Merari had yet a third
son besides the two - Mahli and Mushi, who alone were known in the time
of Moses - who left descendants, forming three fathers'-houses in
David's time, the omission of this third son in the family register in
the Pentateuch would be quite incomprehensible. Or are we to suppose
that in [Exo 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#019.md) also the name
Jaaziah had been dropped out, and that in consequence of that the family
descended from him has been omitted from [Num
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#033.md)? Supported by the Pentateuch, the
text of our verses is presumably entire, and this presumption of its
integrity is confirmed by the character of the additions in 24:26, 27,
as above exhibited.)

regard the additions in [Ch1 24:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026.md)
as later glosses, although we are not in a position to explain the
origin or the meaning of the interpolation. This inability arises from
the fact that, of the names Jaaziah, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri, only
Zaccur again occurs among the Asaphites ([Ch1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002).md), and elsewhere of other persons,
while the others are nowhere else to be met with. The three families of
Levi numbered therefore 9 + 9 + 4 = 22 fathers'-houses, exclusive of the
priests.

Concluding remarks. - [Ch1 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md).
"These (the just enumerated) are the sons of Levi according to their
fathers'-houses, according to those who were counted ([Num
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#021.md).; [Exo
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#014).md) in the enumeration by name
([Num 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#018.md); [Num
3:43](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#043).md), by the head, performing the
work for the service of the house of Jahve, from the men of twenty years
and upwards." המּלאכה עשׂה is not singular, but plural, as in [Ch2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#012.md); [Ch2
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#010.md), [Ch2
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#013.md); [Exo
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#009.md); [Neh
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#016.md), cf. [Ch2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md). It occurs along with עשׁי, with
a similar meaning and in a like position, [Ch2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#013.md); [Ch2
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#017.md); [Neh
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#012.md); [Neh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010.md). It is only another way of
writing עשׁי, and the same form is found here and there in other words;
cf. Ew. 16, b. The statement that the Levites were numbered from twenty
years old and upwards is accounted for in [Ch1
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#025.md) thus: David said, The Lord has
given His people rest, and He dwells in Jerusalem; and the Levites also
have no longer to bear the dwelling (tabernacle) with all its vessels.
From this, of course, it results that they had not any longer to do such
heavy work as during the march through the wilderness, and so might
enter upon their service even at the age of twenty. In [Ch1
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#027.md) a still further reason is given:
"For by the last words of David was this, (viz.) the numbering of the
sons of Levi from twenty years old and upwards." There is a difference
of opinion as to how העחרונים דויד בּדברי are to be understood. Bertheau
translates, with Kimchi, "in the later histories of David are the number
= the numbered," and adduces in support of his translation [Ch1
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029.md), whence it is clear that by "the
later histories of David" a part of a historical work is meant. But the
passage quoted does not prove this. In the formula והאחרנים והאחרנים
דּברי... ([Ch1 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029.md); [Ch2
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029.md); [Ch2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#015.md); [Ch2
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#011), etc..md), which recurs at the end
of each king's reign, דּברי denotes not historiae, in the sense of a
history, but res gestae, which are recorded in the writings named. In
accordance with this, therefore, דויד דּברי cannot denote writings of
David, but only words or things (= deeds); but the Levites who were
numbered could not be in the acts of David. We must rather translate
according to [Ch2 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030.md) and [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md). In the latter passage דויד דּברי
are the last words (utterances) of David, and in the former דויד
בּדּברי, "by the words of David," i.e., according to the commands or
directions of David. In this way, Cler. and Mich., with the Vulg. juxta
praecepta, have already correctly translated the words: "according to
the last commands of David." המּה is nowhere found in the signification
sunt as the mere copula of the subject and verb, but is everywhere an
independent predicate, and is here to be taken, according to later
linguistic usage, as neutr. sing. (cf. Ew. 318, b): "According to the
last commands of David, this," i.e., this was done, viz., the numbering
of the Levites from twenty years and upwards. From this statement, from
twenty years and upwards, which is so often repeated, and for which the
reasons are so given, it cannot be doubtful that the statement in [Ch1
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003.md), "from thirty years and upwards,"
is incorrect, and that, as has been already remarked on [Ch1
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003.md), שׁלשׁים has crept into the text
by an error of the copyist, who was thinking of the Mosaic census.

(Note: The explanation adopted from Kimchi by the older Christian
commentators, e.g., by J. H. Mich., is an untenable makeshift. It is to
this effect: that David first numbered the Levites from thirty years old
and upwards, according to the law ([Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md); [Num
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#030).md), but that afterwards, when he
saw that those of twenty years of age were in a position to perform the
duties, lightened as they were by its being no longer necessary for the
Levites to bear the sanctuary from place to place, he included all from
twenty years of age in a second census, taken towards the end of his
life; cf. [Ch1 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#027.md). Against this
Bertheau has already rightly remarked that the census of the Levites
gave the number at 38,000 ([Ch1 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003).md),
and these 38,000 and no others were installed; it is nowhere said that
this number was not sufficient, or that the arrangements based upon this
number ([Ch1 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md), [Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005).md) had no continued existence. He
is, however, incorrect in his further remark, that the historian clearly
enough is desirous of calling attention to the fact that here a
statement is made which is different from the former, for of this there
is no trace; the contrary, indeed, is manifest. Since אלּה ([Ch1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024).md) refers back to the just
enumerated fathers'-houses of the Levites, and [Ch1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md) consequently forms the
subscription to the preceding register, the historian thereby informs us
plainly enough that he does not communicate here a statement different
from the former, but only concludes that which he has formerly
communicated. We cannot very well see how, from the fact that he here
for the first time adduces the motive which determined David to cause
the Levites from twenty years old and upwards to be numbered and
employed in the service, it follows that he derived this statement of
David's motive from a source different from that account which he has
hitherto made use of. Nor would it be more manifest if [Ch1
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#027.md) contained - as it does not
contain - a reference to the source from which he derived this
statement.)

In [Ch1 23:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#028.md) we have, in the
enumeration of the duties which the Levites had to perform, another
ground for the employment of those from twenty years old and upwards in
actual service.

[1 Chronicles 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 23:28</span></span>

Their appointed place or post was at the hand of the sons of Aaron,
i.e., they were ready to the priest's hand, to aid him in carrying on
the service of the house of God. "Over the courts and the cells (of the
courts; cf. [Ch1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026).md), and the
purifying of every holy thing," i.e., of the temple rooms and the temple
vessels. On ל before כּל־קדשׁ, used for mediate connection after the
stat. const., cf. Ew. 289, b. עבדת וּמעשׂה, and for the performance of
the service of the house of God. Before מעשׂה, על is to be supplied from
the preceding. The individual services connected with the worship are
specialized in [Ch1 23:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#029.md), and
introduced by the preposition ל. For the bread of the pile, i.e., the
shew-bread (see on [Lev 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008)..md), viz.,
to prepare it; for the laying of the bread upon the table was the
priest's business. For fine meal (סלת, see on [Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001).md) for the meat-offering and
unleavened cakes (המּצּות רקיקי, see on [Lev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004).md), and for the pans, i.e., that
which was baked in pans (see on [Lev
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005).md), and for that which was roasted
(מרבּכת, see on [Lev 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014).md), and for
all measures of capacity and measures of length which were kept by the
Levites, because meal, oil, and wine were offered along with the
sacrifices in certain fixed quantities (cf. e.g., [Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040.md); [Exo
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#024).md), and the Levites had probably
to watch over the weights and measures in general ([Lev
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035).md).

[1 Chronicles 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 23:30</span></span>

"On each morning and evening to praise the Lord with song and
instruments." These words refer to the duties of the singers and
musicians, whose classes and orders are enumerated in 1 Chron 25. The
referring of them to the Levites who assisted the priests in the
sacrificial worship (Berth.) needs no serious refutation, for וּלהלּל
הודות is the standing phrase for the sacred temple music; and we can
hardly believe that the Levites sang psalms or played on harps or lutes
while the beasts for sacrifices were slaughtered and skinned, or the
meat-offerings baked, or such duties performed.

[1 Chronicles 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 23:31</span></span>

"And for all the bringing of offerings to Jahve on sabbaths, the new
moons, and the feasts, in the number according to the law concerning
them (i.e., according to the regulations that existed for this matter),
continually before Jahve." It was the duty of the Levites to procure the
necessary number of beasts for sacrifice, to see to their suitableness,
to slaughter and skin them, etc. תּמיד refers to עלות, the
burnt-offerings for Jahve, which are תּמיד, because they must always be
offered anew on the appointed days.

[1 Chronicles 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 23:32</span></span>

In conclusion, the whole duties of the Levites are summed up in three
clauses: they were to keep the charge of the tabernacle, the charge of
the sacred things, i.e., of all the sacred things of the worship, and
the charge of the sons of Aaron, i.e., of all that the priests committed
to them to be done; cf. [Num 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#003.md).,
where these functions are more exactly fixed.
