### [Jeremiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 4:1</span></span>

The answer of the Lord. - [Jer 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md).
"If thou returnest, Israel, saith Jahveh, returnest to me; and if thou
puttest away thine abominations from before my face, and strayest not,
[Jer 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002.md). and swearest, As Jahveh
liveth, in truth, with right, and uprightness; then shall the nations
bless themselves in Him, and in Him make their boast." Graf errs in
taking these verses as a wish: if thou wouldst but repent...and
swear...and if they blessed themselves. His reason is, that the
conversion and reconciliation with Jahveh has not yet taken place, and
are yet only hoped for; and he cites passages for אם with the force of a
wish, as [Gen 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#003.md); [Gen
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md), where, however, נא or לוּ is
joined with it. But if we take all the verbs in the same construction,
we get a very cumbrous result; and the reason alleged proceeds upon a
prosaic misconception of the dramatic nature of the prophet's mode of
presentation from [Jer 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md) onwards.
Just as there the prophet hears in spirit the penitent supplication of
the people, so here he hears the Lord's answer to this supplication, by
inward vision seeing the future as already present. The early
commentators have followed the example of the lxx and Vulg. in
construing the two verses differently, and take אלי and ולא תנוּד as
apodoses: if thou returnest, Israel, then return to me; or, if thou,
Israel, returnest to me, then shalt thou return, sc. into thy
fatherland; and if thou puttest away thine abominations from before mine
eyes, then shalt thou no longer wander; and if thou swearest...then will
they bless themselves. But by reason of its position after נאם יהוה it
is impossible to connect אלי with the protasis. It would be more natural
to take אלי תּשׁוּב as apodosis, the אלי being put first for the sake of
emphasis. But if we take it as apodosis at all, the apodosis of the
second half of the verse does not rightly correspond to that of the
first half. לא תנוּד would need to be translated, "then shalt thou no
longer wander without fixed habitation," and so would refer to the
condition of the people as exiled. but for this נוּד is not a suitable
expression. Besides, it is difficult to justify the introduction of אם
before ונשׁבּאתּ, since an apodosis has already preceded. For these
reasons we are bound to prefer the view of Ew. and Hitz., that [Jer
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md) and [Jer
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002.md) contain nothing but protases. The
removal of the abominations from before God's face is the utter
extirpation of idolatry, the negative moment of the return to the Lord;
and the swearing by the life of Jahveh is added as a positive expression
of their acknowledgment of the true God. תנוּד is the wandering of the
idolatrous people after this and the other false god, [Jer
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023.md) and [Jer
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013.md). "And strayest not" serves to
strengthen "puttest away thine abominations." A sincere return to God
demanded not only the destruction of images and the suppression of
idol-worship, but also the giving up of all wandering after idols, i.e.,
seeking or longing after other gods. Similarly, swearing by Jahveh is
strengthened by the additions: בּאמת, in truth, not deceptively (לשׁקר,
[Jer 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002).md), and with right and
uprightness, i.e., in a just cause, and with honest intentions. - The
promise, "they shall bless themselves," etc., has in it an allusion to
the patriarchal promises in [Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md);
[Gen 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#018.md); [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md); [Gen
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#004.md); [Gen
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014.md), but it is not, as most
commentators, following Jerome, suppose, a direct citation of these, and
certainly not "a learned quotation from a book" (Ew.), in which case בּו
would be referable, as in those promises, to Israel, the seed of
Abraham, and would stand for בּך. This is put out of the question by the
parallel וּבּו יתהלּלוּ, which never occurs but with the sense of
glorying in God the Lord; cf. [Isa
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#016.md), [Psa
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#003.md); 64:11; [Psa
105:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003.md), and [Jer
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022.md). Hence it follows that בּו must
be referred, as Calv. refers it, to יהוה, just as in [Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016.md) : the nations will bless
themselves in or with Jahveh, i.e., will desire and appropriate the
blessing of Jahveh and glory in the true God. Even under this
acceptation, the only one that can be justified from an exegetical point
of view, the words stand in manifest relation to the patriarchal
blessing. If the heathen peoples bless themselves in the name of Jahveh,
then are they become partakers of the salvation that comes from Jahveh;
and if this blessing comes to them as a consequence of the true
conversion of Israel to the Lord, as a fruit of this, then it has come
to them through Israel as the channel, as the patriarchal blessings
declare disertis verbis. Jeremiah does not lay stress upon this
intermediate agency of Israel, but leaves it to be indirectly understood
from the unmistakeable allusion to the older promise. The reason for the
application thus given by Jeremiah to the divine promise made to the
patriarchs is found in the aim and scope of the present discourse. The
appointment of Israel to be the channel of salvation for the nations is
an outcome of the calling grace of God, and the fulfilment of this
gracious plan on the part of God is an exercise of the same grace - a
grace which Israel by its apostasy does not reject, but helps onwards
towards its ordained issue. The return of apostate Israel to its God is
indeed necessary ere the destined end be attained; it is not, however,
the ground of the blessing of the nations, but only one means towards
the consummation of the divine plan of redemption, a plan which embraces
all mankind. Israel's apostasy delayed this consummation; the conversion
of Israel will have for its issue the blessing of the nations.

[Jeremiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 4:3</span></span>

Threatening of Judgment upon Jerusalem and Judah. - If Judah and
Jerusalem do not reform, the wrath of God will be inevitably kindled
against them ([Jer 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md), [Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004).md). Already the prophet sees in
spirit the judgment bursting in upon Judah from the north, to the dismay
of all who were accounting themselves secure ([Jer
4:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005).md). Like a hot tempest-blast it
rushes on, because of the wickedness of Jerusalem ([Jer
4:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011).md), bringing desolation and ruin
on the besotted people, devastating the whole land, and not to be turned
aside by any meretricious devices ([Jer
4:19-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019).md).

[Jer 4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md)

"For thus hath Jahveh spoken to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: Break
up for yourselves new ground, and sow not among thorns. [Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md). Circumcise yourselves to Jahveh,
and take away the foreskins of your heart, men of Judah and inhabitants
of Jerusalem, lest my fury break forth like fire and burn unquenchably,
because of the evil of your doings." The exhortation to a reformation of
life is attached by כּי, as being the ground of it, to the preceding
exhortation to return. The אם תּשׁוּב, [Jer
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md), contained the indirect call to
repent. In [Jer 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md) this was addressed
to Israel. In [Jer 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md) the call comes
to Judah, which the prophet had already in his eye in Jer 3; cf. [Jer
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#007.md), [Jer
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010.md). The transition from Israel to
Judah in the phrase: for thus saith Jahveh, is explained by the
introduction of a connecting thought, which can without difficulty be
supplied from the last clause of [Jer
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002.md); the promise that the nations
bless themselves in Jahveh will come to be fulfilled. The thought to be
supplied is: this conversion is indispensable for Judah also, for Judah
too must begin a new life. Without conversion there is no salvation. The
evil of their doings brings nought but heavy judgments with it. אישׁ, as
often, in collective sense, since the plural of this word was little in
use, see in [Jos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006.md). ניר לו ניר, as
in [Hos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md), plough up new land, to
bring new untilled soil under cultivation - a figure for the reformation
of life; as much as to say, to prepare new ground for living on, to
begin a new life. Sow not among thorns. The seed-corns are the good
resolutions which, when they have sunk into the soil of the mind, should
spring up into deeds (Hitz.). The thorns which choke the good seed as it
grows ([Mat 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#007).md) are not mala vestra
studia (Ros.), but the evil inclinations of the unrenewed heart, which
thrive luxuriantly like thorns. "Circumcise you to the Lord" is
explained by the next clause: remove the foreskins of your heart. The
stress lies in ליהוה; in this is implied that the circumcision should
not be in the flesh merely. In the flesh all Jews were circumcised. If
they then are called to circumcise themselves to the Lord, this must be
meant spiritually, of the putting away of the spiritual impurity of the
heart, i.e., of all that hinders the sanctifying of the heart; see in
[Deu 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md). The plur. ערלות is
explained by the figurative use of the word, and the reading ערלת,
presented by some codd., is a correction from [Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md). The foreskins are the evil
lusts and longings of the heart. Lest my fury break forth like fire; cf.
[Jer 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#020.md); [Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006.md); [Psa
89:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047.md). 'מפּני רע מ as in [Deu
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#020.md). This judgment of wrath the
prophet already in spirit sees breaking on Judah.

[Jeremiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 4:5</span></span>

From the north destruction approaches. - [Jer
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md). "Proclaim in Judah, and in
Jerusalem let it be heard, and say, Blow the trumpet in the land; cry
with a loud voice, and say, Assemble, and let us go into the defenced
cities. [Jer 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md). Raise a standard
toward Zion: save yourselves by flight, linger not; for from the north I
bring evil and great destruction. [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md). A lion comes up from his thicket,
and a destroyer of the nations is on his way, comes forth from his
place, to make they land a waste, that thy cities be destroyed, without
an inhabitant. [Jer 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008.md). For this gird
you in sackcloth, lament and howl, for the heat of Jahveh's anger hath
not turned itself from us. [Jer 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#009.md).
And it cometh to pass on that day, saith Jahveh, the heart of the king
and the heart of the princes shall perish, and the priests shall be
confounded and the prophets amazed." The invasion of a formidable foe is
here represented with poetic animation; the inhabitants being called
upon to publish the enemy's approach throughout the land, so that every
one may hide himself in the fortified cities.

(Note: By this dreaded foe the older commentators understand the
Chaldeans; but some of the moderns will have it that the Scythians are
meant. Among the latter are Dahler, Hitz., Ew., Bertheau (z. Gesch. der
Isr.), Movers, and others; and they have been preceded by Eichhorn
(Hebr. Proph. ii. 96 f), Cramer (in the Comm. on Zephaniah, under the
title Scythische Denkmler in Palstina, 1777). On the basis of their
hypothesis, M. Duncker (Gesch. des Alterth. S. 751ff.) has sketched out
a minute picture of the inundation of Palestine by hordes of Scythian
horsemen in the year 626, according to the prophecies of Jeremiah and
Zephaniah. For this there is absolutely no historical support, although
Roesch in his archaeological investigations on Nabopolassar
(Deutsch-morgld. Ztschr. xv. S. 502ff.), who, according to him, was a
Scythian king, alleges that "pretty nearly all (?) exegetical
authorities" understand these prophecies of the Scythians (S. 536). For
this view can be neither justified exegetically nor made good
historically, as has been admitted and proved by A. Kueper (Jerem. libr.
ss. int. p. 13f.), and Ad. Strauss (Vaticin. Zeph. p. 18f.), and then by
Tholuck (die Propheten u. ihre Weiss, S. 94ff.), Graf (Jer. S. 16ff.),
Ng., and others. On exegetical grounds the theory is untenable; for in
the descriptions of the northern foe, whose invasion of Judah Zephaniah
and Jeremiah threaten, there is not the faintest hint that can be taken
to point to the Scythian squadrons, and, on the contrary, there is much
that cannot be suitable to these wandering hordes. The enemies
approaching like clouds, their chariots like the whirlwind, with horses
swifter than eagles ([Jer 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013).md), every
city fleeing from the noise of the horsemen and of the bowmen ([Jer
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029).md), and the like, go to form a
description obviously founded on [Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md)., and on the account of the
Chaldeans ( כּשׂדּים) in [Hab 1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#007.md) -
a fact which leads Roesch to suppose Habakkuk meant Scythian by
כּשׂדּים. All the Asiatic world-powers had horsemen, war-chariots, and
archers, and we do not know that the Scythians fought on chariots. Nor
was it at all according to the plan of Scythian hordes to besiege cities
and carry the vanquished people into exile, as Jeremiah prophesies of
these enemies. Again, in Jer 25, where he expressly names Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babel as the fulfiller of judgment foretold, Jeremiah
mentions the enemy in the same words as in [Jer
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015.md), ּכל־משׁפּחות צפון ([Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009).md), and represents the
accomplishment of judgment by Nebuchadnezzar as the fulfilment of all
the words he had been prophesying since the 13th year of Josiah. This
makes it as clear as possible that Jeremiah regarded the Chaldeans as
the families of the peoples of the north who were to lay Judah waste,
conquer Jerusalem, and scatter its inhabitants amongst the heathen. In a
historical reference, also, the Scythian theory is quite unfounded. The
account in Herod. i. 103-105 of the incursion of the Scythians into
Media and of dominion exercised over Asia for 28 years by them, does say
that they came to Syrian Palestine and advanced on Egypt, but by means
of presents were induced by King Psammetichus to withdraw, that they
marched back again without committing any violence, and that only ὀλίγοι
τινὲς αὐτῶν plundered the temple of Venus Urania at Ascalon on the way
back. But these accounts, taken at their strict historical value, tell
us nothing more than that one swarm of the Scythian hordes, which
overspread Media and Asia Minor, entered Palestine and penetrated to the
borders of Egypt, passing by the ancient track of armies across the
Jordan at Bethshan, and through the plain of Jezreel along the
Philistine coast; that here they were bought off by Psammetichus and
retired without even so much as touching on the kingdom of Judah on
their way. The historical books of the Old Testament have no knowledge
whatever of any incursion into Judah of Scythians or other northern
nations during the reign of Josiah. On the other hand, we give no weight
to the argument that the march of the Scythians through Syria against
Egypt had taken place in the 7th or 8th year of Josiah, a few years
before Jeremiah's public appearance, and so could be no subject for his
prophecies (Thol., Graf, Ng.). For the chronological data of the
ancients as to the Scythian invasion are not so definite that we can
draw confident conclusions from them; cf. M. v. Niebuhr, Ges. Assurs u.
Babels, S. 67ff.

All historical evidence for a Scythian inroad into Judah being thus
entirely wanting, the supporters of this hypothesis can make nothing of
any point save the Greek name Scythopolis for Bethshan, which Dunck.
calls "a memorial for Judah of the Scythian raid." We find the name in
[Jdg 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md) of the lxx, Βαιθσάν ἥ ἐστι
Σκυθῶν πόλις, and from this come the Σκυθόπολις of Judith 3:10, 2 Macc.
12:29, and in Joseph. Antt. v. 1. 22, xii. 8. 5, etc. Even if we do not
hold, as Reland, Pal. ill. p. 992, does, that the gloss, ἥ ἐστι Σκυθῶν
πόλις, [Jdg 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md), has been
interpolated late into the lxx; even if we admit that it originated with
the translator, the fact that the author of the lxx, who lived 300 years
after Josiah, interpreted Σκυθόπολις by Σκυθῶν πόλις, does by no means
prove that the city had received this Greek name from a Scythian
invasion of Palestine, or from a colony of those Scythians who had
settled down there. The Greek derivation of the name shows that it could
not have originated before the extension of Greek supremacy in Palestine
- not before Alexander the Great. But there is no historical proof that
Scythians dwelt in Bethshan. Duncker e.g., makes the inference simply
from the name Σκυθῶν πόλις and Σκυθοπολίται, 2 Macc. 12:29f. His
statement: "Josephus (Antt. xii. 5. 8) and Pliny (Hist. n. v. 16) affirm
that Scythians had settled down there," is wholly unfounded. In Joseph.
l.c. there is no word of it; nor will a critical historian accept as
sufficient historical evidence of an ancient Scythian settlement in
Bethshan, Pliny's l.c. aphoristic notice: Scythopolin (antea Nysam a
Libero Patre, spulta nutrice ibi) Scythis deducts. The late Byzantine
author, George Syncellus, is the first to derive the name Scythopolis
from the incursion of the Scythians into Palestine; cf. Reland, p. 993.
The origin of the name is obscure, but is not likely to be found, as by
Reland, Gesen., etc., in the neighbouring Succoth. More probably it
comes from a Jewish interpretation of the prophecy of Ezekiel, [Eze
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011.md), regarding the overthrow of Gog
in the valley of the wanderers eastwards from the sea. This is
Hvernick's view, suggested by Bochart.

Taking all into consideration, we see that the reference of our prophecy
to the Scythians is founded neither on exegetical results nor on
historical evidence, but wholly on the rationalistic prejudice that the
prophecies of the biblical prophets are nothing more than either
disguised descriptions of historical events or threatenings of results
that lay immediately before the prophet's eyes, which is the view of
Hitz., Ew., and others.)

The ו before תּקעוּ in the Chet. has evidently got into the text through
an error in transcription, and the Keri, according to which all the old
versions translate, is the only correct reading. "Blow the trumpet in
the land," is that which is to be proclaimed or published, and the blast
into the far-sounding שׁופר is the signal of alarm by which the people
was made aware of the danger that threatened it; cf. [Joe
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md); [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md). The second clause expresses the
same matter in an intensified form and with plainer words. Cry, make
full (the crying), i.e., cry with a full clear voice; gather, and let us
go into the fortified cities; cf. [Jer
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014.md). This was the meaning of the
trumpet blast. Raise a banner pointing towards Zion, i.e., showing the
fugitives the way to Zion as the safest stronghold in the kingdom. נס, a
lofty pole with a waving flag ([Isa
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md); [Eze
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#007).md), erected upon mountains, spread
the alarm farther than even the sound of the pealing trumpet; see in
[Isa 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md). העיזוּ, secure your
possessions by flight; cf. [Isa 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#031.md).
The evil which Jahveh is bringing on the land is specified by שׁבר
גּדול, after [Zep 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#010.md), but very
frequently used by Jeremiah; cf. [Jer
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md); [Jer
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#003.md); [Jer
50:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#022.md); [Jer
51:54](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#054). שׁבר, breaking (of a limb.md),
[Lev 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#019.md), then the upbreaking of
what exists, ruin, destruction. In [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md) the evil is yet more fully
described. A lion is come up from his thicket (סבּכו with dag. forte
dirim., from שׂובך\[ סבך, [Sa2 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md)\],
or from סבך, [Psa 74:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005.md); cf. Ew. 255,
d, and Olsh. 155, b), going forth for prey. This lion is a destroyer of
the nations (not merely of individual persons as the ordinary lion); he
has started (נסע, or striking tents for the march), and is come out to
waste the land and to destroy the cities. The infin. is continued by the
temp. fin. תּצּינה, and the Kal of נצה is here used in a passive sense:
to be destroyed by war.

[Jeremiah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 4:8</span></span>

For this calamity the people was to mourn deeply. For the description of
the mourning, cf. [Joe 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013.md); [Mic
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md). For the wrath of the Lord has not
turned from us, as in blind self-delusion ye imagine, [Jer
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035.md). The heath of Jahveh's anger is
the burning wrath on account of the sins of Manasseh, with which the
people has been threatened by the prophets. This wrath has not turned
itself away, because even under Josiah the people has not sincerely
returned to its God.

[Jeremiah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 4:9</span></span>

When this wrath bursts over them, the rulers and leaders of the people
will be perplexed and helpless. The heart, i.e., the mind, is lot. For
this use of לב, cf. [Job 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003.md); [Job
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md); [Pro
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#007.md), etc. נשׁמּוּ, be paralyzed by
terror, like the Kal in [Jer 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012.md). The
prophets are mentioned last, because [Jer
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md) cites a word of prophecy whereby
they seduced the people into a false security.

[Jeremiah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 4:10</span></span>

"Then said I, Ah, Lord Jahveh, truly Thou hast deceived this people and
Jerusalem in saying, Peace shall be to you, and the sword is reaching
unto the soul." This verse is to be taken as a sign addressed to God by
Jeremiah when he heard the announcement of the judgment about to fall on
Judah, contained in [Jer 4:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md). The
Chald. has well paraphrased ואמר thus: et dixi: suscipe deprecationem
meam, Jahveh, Deus. but Hensler and Ew. wish to have ואמר changed to
ואמר, "so that they say," quite unnecessarily, and indeed unsuitably,
since השּׁאת, thou hast deceived, is out of place either in the mouth of
the people or of the lying prophets. That the word quoted, "Peace shall
be to you," is the saying of the false prophets, may be gathered from
the context, and this is directly supported by [Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013.md); [Jer
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md). The deception of the people by
such discourse from the false prophets is referred back to God: "Lord,
Thou hast deceived," inasmuch as God not only permits these lying
spirits to appear and work, but has ordained them and brought them forth
for the hardening of the people's heart; as He once caused the spirit of
prophecy to inspire as a lying spirit the prophets of Ahab, so that by
promises of victory they prevailed upon him to march to that war in
which, as a punishment for his godlessness, he was to perish; [Kg1
22:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#020.md). Umbr. takes the words less
correctly as spoken in the name of the people, to whom the unexpected
turn affairs had now taken seemed a deception on the part of God; and
this, although it was by itself it had been deceived, through its revolt
from God. For it is not the people's opinion that Jeremiah expresses,
but a truth concerning which his wish is that the people may learn to
recognise it, and so come to reflect and repent before it be too late.
On the use of the perf. consec. ונגעה, see Ew. 342, b. As to the fact,

[Jeremiah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 4:11</span></span>

Description of the impending ruin, from which nothing can save but
speedy repentance. - [Jer 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md). "At
that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind
from the bleak hills in the wilderness cometh on the way toward the
daughter of my people, not to winnow and not to cleanse. [Jer
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#012.md). A wind fuller than for this
shall come to me; now will I also utter judgments upon them. [Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md). Behold, like clouds it draws
near, and like the storm are it chariots, swifter than eagles its
horses. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled. [Jer
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md). Wash from wickedness thy heart,
Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thine iniquitous
thoughts lodge within thee? [Jer 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#015.md).
For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from the Mount
Ephraim. [Jer 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#016.md). Tell it to the
peoples; behold, publish it to Jerusalem: Besiegers come from a far
country, and let their voice ring out against the cities of Judah. [Jer
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017.md). As keepers of a field, they are
against her round about; for against me hath she rebelled, saith Jahveh.
[Jer 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#018.md). Thy way and thy doings have
wrought thee this. This is thy wickedness; yea, it is bitter, yea, it
reaCheth unto thine heart."

A more minute account of the impending judgment is introduced by the
phrase: at that time. It shall be said to this people; in other words,
it shall be said of this people; substantially, that shall fall upon it
which is expressed by the figure following, a hot wind blowing from the
naked hills of the wilderness. רוּח is stat. constr., and שׁפים dna its
genitive, after which latter the adjective צח should be placed; but it
is interpolated between the nomen regens and the n. rectum by reason of
its smallness, and partly, too, that it may not be too far separated
from its nomen, while בּמּדבּר belongs to שׁפים. The wind blowing from
the bleak hills in the wilderness, is the very severe east wind of
Palestine. It blows in incessant gusts, and cannot be used for winnowing
or cleansing the grain, since it would blow away chaff and seed
together; cf. Wetzst. in Del., Job, S. 320. דּרך is universally taken
adverbially: is on the way, i.e., comes, moves in the direction of the
daughter of Zion. The daughter of Zion is a personification of the
inhabitants of Zion or Jerusalem. This hot blast is a figure for the
destruction which is drawing near Jerusalem. It is not a chastisement to
purify the people, but a judgment which will sweep away the whole
people, carry away both wheat and chaff - a most effective figure for
the approaching catastrophe of the destruction of Jerusalem, and the
carrying away captive of its inhabitants. Hitz. and Graf have, however,
taken דּרך as subject of the clause: the path, i.e., the behaviour of my
people, is a keen wind of the bare hills in the wilderness. Thus the
conduct of the people would be compared with that wind as unprofitable,
inasmuch as it was altogether windy, empty, and further as being a
hurtful storm. But the comparison of the people's behaviour with a
parched violent wind is a wholly unnatural one, for the justification of
which it is not sufficient to point to [Hos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md) : sow wind and reap storm.
Besides, upon this construction of the illustration, the description:
not to winnow and not to cleanse, is not only unmeaning, but wholly
unsuitable. Who is to be winnowed and cleansed by the windy ways of the
people? Jahveh?! [Jer 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md) is indeed
so managed by Hitz. and Graf that the tempestuous wind blows against
God, "is directed against Jahveh like a blast of defiance and
hostility." But this argument is sufficient to overthrow that unnatural
view of the figure, which, besides, obtains no support from [Jer
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#012.md). מאלּה cannot refer to בּת־עמּי:
a full wind from these, i.e., the sons of my people; and יבוא לי, in
spite of the passages, [Jer 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023.md);
[Jer 50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md); [Jer
51:48](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#048.md); [Job
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#025.md), does not mean: comes towards me,
or: blows from them on me; for in all these passages לי is dativ commodi
or incommodi. Here, too, לי is dative, used of the originator and
efficient cause. The wind comes for me - in plainer English: from me.
Properly: it comes to God, i.e., at His signal, to carry out His will.
מלא מאלּה is comparative: fuller than these, namely, the winds useful
for winnowing and cleansing. Now will I too utter. The intensifying גּם
does not point to a contrast in the immediately preceding clause:
because the people blows against God like a strong wind, He too will
utter judgment against it. The גּם refers back to the preceding לי: the
storm comes from me; for now will I on my side hold judgment with them.
The contrast implied in גּם lies in the wider context, in the formerly
described behaviour of the people, particularly in the sayings of the
false prophets mentioned in [Jer 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md),
that there will be peace. On דּבּר משׁפּטים, cf. [Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016.md).

These judgments are already on the way in [Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md). "Like clouds it draws near." The
subject is not mentioned, but a hostile army is meant, about to execute
God's judgments. "Like clouds," i.e., in such thick dark masses; cf.
[Eze 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#016.md). The war-chariots drive
with the speed of the tempest; cf. [Isa
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028.md); [Isa
66:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015.md). The running of the horses
resembles the flight of the eagle; cf. [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md), where the same is said of the
horsemen of the hostile people. Both passages are founded on [Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md); but Jeremiah, while he had the
expression קלּוּ מנּמרים סוּסיו, [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md), in his mind, chose נשׁרים;
instead of leopards (נמרים), in this following the original in Deut.;
cf. [Sa2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#023.md) and [Lam
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#019.md). Already is heard the cry of woe:
we are spoiled, cf. [Jer 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md), [Jer
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#018.md); [Jer
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md).

[Jer 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md)

If Jerusalem wishes to be saved, it must thoroughly turn from its sin,
wash its heart clean; not merely abstain outwardly from wickedness, but
renounce the evil desires of the heart. In the question: How long
shall...remain? we have implied the thought that Jerusalem has already
only too long cherished and indulged wicked thoughts. תּלין is 3rd pers.
imperf. Kal, not 2nd pers. Hiph.: wilt thou let remain (Schnur. and
others). For the Hiphil of luwn is not in use, and besides, would need
to be תּליני. The מחשׁבות און, as in [Pro
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#018.md); [Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md), refer chiefly to sins against
one's neighbour, such as are reckoned up in [Jer
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#005.md)., [Jer
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008.md).

[Jeremiah 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 4:15</span></span>

It is high time to cleanse oneself from sin, periculum in mora est; for
already calamity is announced from Dan, even from the Mount Ephraim. קול
מגּיד, the voice of him who gives the alarm, sc. נשׁמע, is heard; cf.
[Jer 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md); [Jer
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015.md). That of which the herald gives
warning is not given till the next clause. און, mischief, i.e.,
calamity. משׁמיע is still dependent on קול. "From Dan," i.e., the
northern boundary of Palestine; see on [Jdg
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md). "From Mount Ephraim," i.e., the
northern boundary of the kingdom of Judah, not far distant from
Jerusalem. The alarm and the calamity draw ever nearer. "The messenger
comes from each successive place towards which the foe approaches"
(Hitz.). In [Jer 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#016.md) the substance of
the warning message is given, but in so animated a manner, that a charge
is given to make the matter known to the peoples and in Jerusalem. Tell
to the peoples, behold, cause to be heard. The הנּה in the first clause
points forward, calling attention to the message in the second clause. A
similar charge is given in [Jer 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md),
only "to the peoples" seems strange here. "The meaning would be simple
if we could take 'the peoples' to be the Israelites," says Graf. But
since גּוים in this connection can mean only the other nations, the
question obtrudes itself: to what end the approach of the besiegers of
Jerusalem should be proclaimed to the heathen peoples. Jerome remarks on
this: Vult omnes in circuitu nationes Dei nosse sententiam, et flagelat
Jerusalem cunctos recipere disciplinam. In like manner, Chr. B. Mich.,
following Schmid: Gentibus, ut his quoque innotescat severitatis divinae
in Judaeos exemplum. Hitz. and Gr. object, that in what follows there is
no word of the taking and destruction of Jerusalem, but only of the
siege; that this could form no such exemplum, and that for this the
issue must be awaited. But this objection counts for little. After the
description given of the enemies (cf. [Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013).md), there can be no doubt as to the
issue of the siege, that is, as to the taking of Jerusalem. But if this
be so, then the warning of the heathen as to the coming catastrophe, by
holding the case of Jerusalem before them, is not so far-fetched a
thought as that it should be set aside by Hitz.'s remark: "So friendly
an anxiety on behalf of the heathen is utterly unnatural to a Jew,
especially seeing that the prophet is doubly absorbed by anxiety for his
own people." Jeremiah was not the narrow-minded Jew Hitz. takes him for.
Besides, there is no absolute necessity for holding "Tell to the
peoples" to be a warning of a similar fate addressed to the heathen. The
charge is but a rhetorical form, conveying the idea that there is no
doubt about the matter to be published, and that it concerned not
Jerusalem alone, but the nations too. This objection settled, there is
no call to seek other interpretations, especially as all such are less
easily justified. By changing the imper. הזכּירוּ and השׁמיעוּ into
perfects, Ew. obtains the translation: "they say already to the peoples,
behold, they come, already they proclaim in Jerusalem," etc.; but Hitz.
and Graf have shown the change to be indefensible. Yet more
unsatisfactory is the translation, "declare of the heathen," which Hitz.
and Graf have adopted, following the lxx, Kimchi, Vat., and others. This
destroys the parallelism, it is out of keeping with the הנּה, and
demands the addition (with the lxx) of בּאוּ thereto to complete the
sense. Graf and Hitz. have not been able to agree upon the sense of the
second member of the verse. If we make לגּויםde gentibus, then 'השׁמיעוּ
וגו ought to be: proclaim upon (i.e., concerning) Jerusalem. Hitz.,
however, translates, in accordance with the use of משׁמיע in vv. 5 and
15: Cry it aloud in Jerusalem (prop. over Jerusalem, [Psa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012.md); [Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001).md); but this, though clearly
correct, does not correspond to the first part of the verse, according
to Hitz.'s translation of it. Graf, on the other hand, gives: Call them
(the peoples) out against Jerusalem - a translation which, besides
completely destroying the parallelism of the two clauses, violently
separates from the proclamation the thing proclaimed: Besiegers come,
etc. Nor can השׁמיעוּ be taken in the sense: call together, as in [Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md); [Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md); [Kg1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022.md); for in that case the object
could not be omitted, those who are to be called together would need to
be mentioned; and it is too much to assume גּוים from the לגּוים for an
object. The warning cry to Jerusalem runs: נצרים, besiegers, (acc. to
[Isa 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md) come from the far country
(cf. [Jer 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015).md), and give their voice
(cf. [Kg1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#015).md); i.e., let the tumult
of a besieging army echo throughout the cities of Judah. These besiegers
will be like field-keepers round about Jerusalem (עליה refers back to
Jerus.), like field-keepers they will pitch their tents round the city
(cf. [Kg1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#015).md) to blockade it. For
against me (Jahveh) was she refractory (מרה c. acc. pers., elsewhere
with ב, [Hos 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001.md); [Psa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011.md), or with את־פּי, [Num
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#024), and often.md). This is expanded in
[Jer 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#018.md). Thy way, i.e., they
behaviour and thy doings, have wrought thee this (calamity). This is thy
wickedness, i.e., the effect or fruit of thy wickedness, yea, it is
bitter, cf. [Jer 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019.md); yea, it
reacheth unto thine heart, i.e., inflicts deadly wounds on thee.

[Jeremiah 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 4:19</span></span>

Grief at the desolation of the land the infatuation of the people. -
[Jer 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md). "My bowels, my bowels! I am
pained! the chambers of my heart - my heart rages within me! I cannot
hold my peace! for thou hearest (the) sound of the trumpet, my soul,
(the) war-cry. [Jer 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md). Destruction
upon destruction is called; for spoiled is the whole land; suddenly are
my tents spoiled, my curtains in a moment. [Jer
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#021). How long shall I see (the.md)
standard, hear (the) sound of the trumpet? [Jer
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#022.md). For my people is foolish, me
they know not; senseless children are they, and without understanding;
wise are they to do evil, but to do good they know not. [Jer
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md). I look on the earth, and, lo, it
is waste and void; and towards the heavens, and there is no light in
them. [Jer 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#024.md). I look on the
mountains, and, lo, they tremble, and all the hills totter. [Jer
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#025.md). I look, and, lo, no man is
there, and all the fowls of the heavens are fled. [Jer
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#026.md). I look, and, lo, Carmel is the
wilderness, and all the cities thereof are destroyed before Jahveh,
before the heath of His anger."

To express the misery which the approaching siege of Jerusalem and the
cities of Judah is about to bring, the prophet breaks forth into
lamentation, [Jer 4:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md). It is a
much debated question, whether the prophet is the speaker, as the Chald.
has taken it, i.e., whether Jeremiah is uttering his own (subjective)
feelings, or whether the people is brought before us speaking, as Grot.,
Schnur., Hitz., Ew. believe. The answer is this: the prophet certainly
is expressing his personal feelings regarding the nearing catastrophe,
but in doing so he lends words to the grief which all the godly will
feel. The lament of [Jer 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md),
suddenly are my tents spoiled, is unquestionably the lament not of the
prophet as an individual, but of the congregation, i.e., of the godly
among the people, not of the mass of the blinded people. The violence of
the grief finds vent in abrupt ejaculations of distress. "My bowels, my
bowels!" is the cry of sore pain, for with the Hebrews the bowels are
the seat of the deepest feelings. The Chet. אוחולה is a monstrosity,
certainly a copyist's error for אחוּלה, as it is in many MSS and edd.,
from חוּל: I am driven to writhe in agony. The Keri אוחילה, I will wait
(cf. [Mic 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007).md), yields no good sense,
and is probably suggested merely by the cohortative form, a cohortative
being regarded as out of place in the case of חוּל. But that form may
express also the effort to incite one's own volition, and so would here
be rendered in English by: I am bound to suffer pain, or must suffer;
cf. Ew. 228, a. - קירות , prop. the walls of my heart, which quiver as
the heart throbs in anguish. הומה־לּי is not to be joined with the last
two words as if it were part of the same clause; in that case we should
expect הומה. But these words too are an ejaculation. The subject of הומה
is the following לבּי; cf. [Jer 48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md).
In defiance of usage, Hitz. connects לבּי with לא : my heart can I not
put to silence. But this verb in Hiph. means always: be silent, never:
put to silence. Not even in [Job 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#003.md)
can it have the latter meaning; where we have the same verb construed
with acc. rei, as in [Job 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#004.md), and
where we must translate: at thy harangues shall the people be silent.
The heart cannot be silent, because the soul hears the peal of the
war-trumpet. שׁמעתּי is 2nd pers. fem., as in [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md), [Jer
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033.md), and freq., the soul being
addressed, as in [Psa 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002) (in אמרתּ.md),
[Psa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006.md), 12. This apostrophe is in
keeping with the agitated tone of the whole verse.

[Jer 4:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md)

One destruction after another is heralded (on שׁבר, see [Jer
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006).md). Ew. translates loosely: wound
upon wound meet one another. For the word does not mean wound, but the
fracture of a limb; and it seems inadmissible to follow the Chald. and
Syr. in taking נקרא here in the sense of נקרה , since the sig. "meet"
does not suit שׁבר. The thought is this: tidings are brought of one
catastrophe after another, for the devastation extends itself over the
whole land and comes suddenly upon the tents, i.e., dwellings of those
who are lamenting. Covers, curtains of the tent, is used as synonymous
with tents; cf. [Jer 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020.md); [Isa
54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002.md). How long shall I see the
standard, etc.! is the cry of despair, seeing no prospect of the end to
the horrors of the war. The standard and the sound of the trumpet are,
as in [Jer 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md), the alarm-signals on
the approach of the enemy.

There is no prospect of an end to the horrors, for ([Jer
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#022).md) the people is so foolish that it
understands only how to do the evil, but not the good; cf. for this [Jer
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021.md); [Isa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003.md); [Mic
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003.md). [Jer
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#021.md) gives God's answer to the woful
query, how long the ravaging of the land by war is to last. The answer
is: as long as the people persists in the folly of its rebellion against
God, so long will chastising judgments continue. To bring this answer of
God home to the people's heart, the prophet, in [Jer
4:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md), tells what he has seen in the
spirit. He has seen (ראיתי, perf. proph.) bursting over Judah a
visitation which convulses the whole world. The earth seemed waste and
void as at the beginning of creation, [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md), before the separation of the
elements and before the creation of organic and living beings. In heaven
no light was to be seen, earth and heaven seemed to have been thrown
back into a condition of chaos. The mountains and hills, these firm
foundations of the earth, quivered and swayed (התקלקל, be put into a
light motion, cf. [Nah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005).md); men had
fled and hidden themselves from the wrath of God (cf. [Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019.md), [Isa
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021).md), and all the birds had flown out
of sight in terror at the dreadful tokens of the beginning catastrophe
([Gen 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#009).md). The fruitful field was the
wilderness - not a wilderness, but "changed into the wilderness with all
its attributes" (Hitz.). הכּרמל is not appell. as in [Jer
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007.md), but nom. prop. of the lower
slopes of Carmel, famed for their fruitfulness; these being taken as
representatives of all the fruitful districts of the land. The cities of
the Carmel, or of the fruitful-field, are manifestly not to be
identified with the store cities of [Kg1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019.md), as Hitz. supposes, but the
cities in the most fertile districts of the country, which, by reason of
their situation, were in a prosperous condition, but now are destroyed.
"Before the heat of His anger," which is kindled against the foolish and
godless race; cf. [Nah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006.md); [Isa
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#013.md).

[Jeremiah 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 4:27</span></span>

The devastation of Judah, though not its utter annihilation, is
irrevocably decreed, and cannot be turned away by any meretricious
expedients. - [Jer 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md). "For thus
saith Jahveh, A waste shall the whole land be, yet will I not make an
utter end. [Jer 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028.md). For this shall
the earth mourn, and the heaven above darken, because I have said it,
purposed it, and repent it not, neither will I turn back from it. [Jer
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029.md). For the noise of the horseman
and bowman every city flees; they come into thickets, and into clefts of
the rock they go up; every city is forsaken, and no man dwells therein.
[Jer 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030.md). And thou, spoiled one, what
wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself in purple, though thou
deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou tearest open thine eyes
with paint, in vain thou makest thyself fair; the lovers despise thee,
they seek thy life. [Jer 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md). For I
hear a voice as of a woman in travail, anguish as of one who bringeth
forth her first-born, the voice of the daughter of Zion; she sigheth,
she spreadeth out her hands: Woe is me! for my soul sinketh powerless
beneath murderers."

[Jer 4:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md)

[Jer 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md) and [Jer
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028.md) confirm and explain what the
prophet has seen in spirit in [Jer
4:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md). A waste shall the land
become; but the wasting shall not be a thorough annihilation, not such a
destruction as befell Sodom and Gomorrah. עשׂה , as in [Nah
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md)., [Isa
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md), and freq. This limitation is
yet again in v. [Jer 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md), [Jer
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018.md) made to apply to Jerusalem, as it
has done already to the people at large. It is founded on the promise in
[Lev 26:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044.md), that the Lord will punish
Israel with the greatest severity for its stubborn apostasy from Him,
but will not utterly destroy it, so as to break His covenant with it.
Accordingly, all prophets declare that after the judgments of
punishment, a remnant shall be left, from which a new holy race shall
spring; cf. [Amo 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md); [Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md); [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md), [Isa
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016.md); [Isa
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020.md)., [Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md); [Mic
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006.md); [Zep
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#013.md), etc. "For this" refers to the
first half of [Jer 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md), and is again
resumed in the על כּי following: for this, because Jahveh hath purposed
the desolation of the whole land. The earth mourns, as in [Hos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003.md), because her productive power is
impaired by the ravaging of the land. The heaven blackens itself, i.e.,
shrouds itself in dark clouds ([Kg1
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045).md), so as to mourn over the
desolated earth. The vividness of the style permits "have decreed it" to
be appended as asyndeton to "I have said it," for the sake of greater
emphasis. God has not only pronounced the desolation of the land, but
God's utterance in this is based upon a decree which God does not
repent, and from which He will not turn back. The lxx have placed the
זמּתי after נחמתּי, and have thus obtained a neater arrangement of the
clauses; but by this the force of expression in "I have said it, decreed
it," is weakened. In [Jer 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029.md) the
desolation of the land is further portrayed, set forth in [Jer
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030.md) as inevitable, and exhibited in
its sad consequences in [Jer 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md). On
the approach of the hostile army, all the inhabitants flee into
inaccessible places from the clatter or noise of the horsemen and
archers. He that casts the bow, the bowman; cf. [Psa
78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009.md). כּל־העיר means, in spite of the
article, not the whole city, but every city, all cities, as may be
gathered from the בּהן, which points back to this. So frequently before
the definite noun, especially when it is further defined by a relative
clause, as e.g., [Exo 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#022.md); [Deu
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#003.md); [Sa1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017.md); cf. Ew. 290, c. For the first
כּל־העירthe lxx have πᾶσα ἡ χώρα, and accordingly J. D. Mich., Hitz.,
and Graf propose to amend to כּל־הארץ, so as to avoid "the clumsy
repetition." But we cannot be ruled here by aesthetic principles of
taste. Clearly the first "every city" means the populace of the cities,
and so בּאוּ is: they (i.e., the men) come, pouring forth. עבים is not
here clouds, but, according to its etymology, to be dark, means the dark
thickets or woods; cf. the Syr. ̀āb, wood. כּפים, rocks, here clefts in
the rocks, as is demanded by the בּ. For this state of things, cf. [Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019.md), [Isa
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021.md), and the accounts of [Jdg
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002.md); [Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006.md), where the Israelites hide
themselves from the invading Midianites in caves, ravines,
thorn-thickets, rocks, and natural fastnesses.

[Jeremiah 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 4:30</span></span>

In vain will Jerusalem attempt to turn away calamity by the wiles of a
courtesan. In [Jer 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md) the daughter
of Zion is addressed, i.e., the community dwelling around the citadel of
Zion, or the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the capital of the kingdom,
regarded as a female personality (as to בּת־ציּון, see on [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md). "Spoiled one" is in apposition
not to the אתּי, but to the person in the verb; it is regarded as
adverbial, and so is without inflexion: if thou art spoiled, like ערום,
[Job 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#007.md), [Job
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#010.md); cf. Ew. 316, b. The following
clauses introduced by כּי are not so connected with the question, what
wilt thou do? as that כּי should mean that: what wilt thou do, devise to
the end that thou mayest clothe thee? (Graf); the כּי means if or
though, and introduces new clauses, the apodosis of which is: "in vain,"
etc. If thou even clothest thyself in purple. שׁני, the crimson dye, and
stuffs or fabrics dyed with it, see in [Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004.md). פּוּך is a pigment for the eye,
prepared from silver-glance, sulphur-antimony - the Cohol, yet much
esteemed by Arab women, a black powder with a metallic glitter. It is
applied to the eyelids, either dry or reduced to a paste by means of
oil, by means of a blunt-pointed style or eye-pencil, and increases the
lustre of dark eyes so that they seem larger and more brilliant. See the
more minute account in Hillel, on the eye-paint of the East, in ref. to
[Kg2 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md). קרע, tear asunder, not,
prick, puncture, as Ew., following J. D. Mich., makes it. This does not
answer the mode of using the eye-paint, which was this: the style rubbed
over with the black powder is drawn horizontally through between the
closed eyelids, and these are thus smeared with the ointment. This
proceeding Jeremiah sarcastically terms rending open the eyes. As a wife
seeks by means of paint and finery to heighten the charms of her beauty
in order to please men and gain the favour of lovers, so the woman
Jerusalem will attempt by like stratagems to secure the favour of the
enemy; but in vain like Jezebel in [Kg2
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md). The lovers will despise her. The
enemies are called lovers, paramours, just as Israel's quest for help
amongst the heathen nations is represented as intrigue with them; see on
[Jer 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033.md), [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036.md).

[Jeremiah 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 4:31</span></span>

[Jer 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md), as giving a reason, is
introduced by כּי. Zion's attempts to secure the goodwill of the enemy
are in vain, for already the prophet hears in spirit the agonized cry of
the daughter of Zion, who beseechingly stretches out her hands for help,
and falls exhausted under the assassin's strokes. חולה, partic. Kal
faem. from חוּל; see Ew. 151, b, and Gesen. 72, Rem. 1. צרה, in
parallelism with קול and dependent on "I hear," means cry of anguish.
התיפּח, breathe heavily, pant, sign. תּפרשׂ is joined asynd. with the
preceding word, but is in sense subordinate to it: she sighs with hands
spread out; a pleading gesture expressing a prayer for protection. עיף,
be exhausted, here = sink down faint, succumb to the murderers.
