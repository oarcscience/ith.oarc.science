Laws Relating to Clean and Unclean Animals - Leviticus 11

The regulation of the sacrifices and institution of the priesthood, by
which Jehovah opened up to His people the way of access to His grace and
the way to sanctification of life in fellowship with Him, were followed
by instructions concerning the various things which hindered and
disturbed this living fellowship with God the Holy One, as being
manifestations and results of sin, and by certain rules for avoiding and
removing these obstructions. For example, although sin has its origin
and proper seat in the soul, it pervades the whole body as the organ of
the soul, and shatters the life of the body, even to its complete
dissolution in death and decomposition; whilst its effects have spread
from man to the whole of the earthly creation, inasmuch as not only did
man draw nature with him into the service of sin, in consequence of the
dominion over it which was given him by God, but God Himself, according
to a holy law of His wise and equitable government, made the irrational
creature subject to "vanity" and "corruption" on account of the sin of
man ([Rom 8:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020).md), so that not only
did the field bring forth thorns and thistles, and the earth produce
injurious and poisonous plants (see at [Gen
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018).md), but the animal kingdom in many
of its forms and creatures bears the image of sin and death, and is
constantly reminding man of the evil fruit of his fall from God. It is
in this penetration of sin into the material creation that we may find
the explanation of the fact, that from the very earliest times men have
neither used every kind of herb nor every kind of animal as food; but
that, whilst they have, as it were, instinctively avoided certain plants
as injurious to health or destructive to life, they have also had a
horror naturalis, i.e., an inexplicable disgust, at many of the animals,
and have avoided their flesh as unclean. A similar horror must have been
produced upon man from the very first, before his heart was altogether
hardened, by death as the wages of sin, or rather by the effects of
death, viz., the decomposition of the body; and different diseases and
states of the body, that were connected with symptoms of corruption and
decomposition, may also have been regarded as rendering unclean. Hence
in all the nations and all the religions of antiquity we find that
contrast between clean and unclean, which was developed in a dualistic
form, it is true, in many of the religious systems, but had its primary
root in the corruption that had entered the world through sin. This
contrast was limited in the Mosaic law to the animal food of the
Israelites, to contact with dead animals and human corpses, and to
certain bodily conditions and diseases that are associated with the
decomposition, pointing out most minutely the unclean objects and
various defilements within these spheres, and prescribing the means for
avoiding or removing them.

The instructions in the chapter before us, concerning the clean and
unclean animals, are introduced in the first place as laws of food ([Lev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#002).md); but they pass beyond these
bounds by prohibiting at the same time all contact with animal carrion
([Lev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#008.md), [Lev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#011.md), [Lev
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024)..md), and show thereby that they
are connected in principle and object with the subsequent laws of
purification (ch. 12-15), to which they are to be regarded as a
preparatory introduction.

[Leviticus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 11:1</span></span>

[Lev 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md)

The laws which follow were given to Moses and Aaron ([Lev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md); [Lev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#001.md); [Lev
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001).md), as Aaron had been sanctified
through the anointing to expiate the sins and uncleannesses of the
children of Israel.

[Lev 11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#002.md)

(cf. [Deu 14:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#004).md). Of the larger
quadrupeds, which are divided in [Gen
1:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024.md) into beasts of the earth
(living wild) and tame cattle, only the cattle (behemah) are mentioned
here, as denoting the larger land animals, some of which were reared by
man as domesticated animals, and others used as food. Of these the
Israelites might eat "whatsoever parteth the hoof and is cloven-footed,
and cheweth the cud among the cattle." פּרסת שׁסע שׁסעת, literally
"tearing (having) a rent in the hoofs," according to [Deu
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#005.md) into "two claws," i.e., with a
hoof completely severed in two. גּרה, rumination, μηρυκισμός (lxx), from
גּרר (cf. יגּר [Lev 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#007).md), to draw
([Hab 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015).md), to draw to and fro; hence
to bring up the food again, to ruminate. גּרה מעלת is connected with the
preceding words with vav cop. to indicate the close connection of the
two regulations, viz., that there was to be the perfectly cloven foot as
well as the rumination (cf. [Lev
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004)..md). These marks are combined in
the oxen, sheep, and goats, and also in the stag and gazelle. The latter
are expressly mentioned in [Deu
14:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#004.md), where - in addition to the
common stag (איּל) and gazelle (צבי, δορκάς, lxx), or dorcas-antelope,
which is most frequently met with in Palestine, Syria, and Arabia, of
the size of a roebuck, with a reddish brown back and white body, horns
sixteen inches long, and fine dark eyes, and the flesh of which,
according to Avicenna, is the best of all the wild game-the following
five are also selected, viz.: (1) יחמוּר, not βούβαλος, the buffalo
(lxx, and Luther), but Damhirsch, a stag which is still much more common
in Asia than in Europe and Palestine (see v. Schubert, R. iii. p. 118);
(2) אקּו, probably, according to the Chaldee, Syriac, etc., the
capricorn (Steinbock), which is very common in Palestine, not τραγέλαφος
(lxx, Vulg.), the buck-stag (Bockhirsch), an animal lately discovered in
Nubia (cf. Leyrer in Herzog's Cycl. vi. p. 143); (3) דּישׁן, according
to the lxx and Vulg. πύραργος, a kind of antelope resembling the stag,
which is met with in Africa (Herod. 4, 192), - according to the Chaldee
and Syriac, the buffalo-antelope, - according to the Samar. and Arabic,
the mountain-stag; (4) תּאו, according to the Chaldee the wild ox, which
is also met with in Egypt and Arabia, probably the oryx (lxx, Vulg.), a
species of antelope as large as a stag; and (5) זמר, according to the
lxx and most of the ancient versions, the giraffe, but this is only
found in the deserts of Africa, and would hardly be met with even in
Egypt-it is more probably capreae sylvestris species, according to the
Chaldee.

[Lev 11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004.md)

Any animal which was wanting in either of these marks was to be unclean,
or not to be eaten. This is the case with the camel, whose flesh is
eaten by the Arabs; it ruminates, but it has not cloven hoofs. Its foot
is severed, it is true, but not thoroughly cloven, as there is a ball
behind, upon which it treads. The hare and hyrax (Klippdachs) were also
unclean, because, although they ruminate, they have not cloven hoofs. It
is true that modern naturalists affirm that the two latter do not
ruminate at all, as they have not the four stomachs that are common to
ruminant animals; but they move the jaw sometimes in a manner which
looks like ruminating, so that even Linnaeus affirmed that the hare
chewed the cud, and Moses followed the popular opinion. According to
Bochart, Oedmann, and others, the shaphan is the jerboa, and according
to the Rabbins and Luther, the rabbit or coney. But the more correct
view is, that it is the wabr of the Arabs, which is still called tsofun
in Southern Arabia (hyrax Syriacus), an animal which feeds on plants, a
native of the countries of the Lebanon and Jordan, also of Arabia and
Africa. They live in the natural caves and clefts of the rocks ([Psa
104:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#018).md), are very gregarious, being
often seen seated in troops before the openings to their caves, and
extremely timid as they are quite defenceless ([Pro
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#026).md). They are about the size of
rabbits, of a brownish grey or brownish yellow colour, but white under
the belly; they have bright eyes, round ears, and no tail. The Arabs eat
them, but do not place them before their guests.

(Note: See Shaw, iii. p. 301; Seetzen, ii. p. 228; Robinson's Biblical
Researches, p. 387; and Roediger on Gesenius thesaurus, p. 1467.)

[Lev 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#007.md)

The swine has cloven hoofs, but does not ruminate; and many of the
tribes of antiquity abstained from eating it, partly on account of its
uncleanliness, and partly from fear of skin-diseases.

[Lev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#008.md)

"Of their flesh shall ye not eat (i.e., not slay these animals as food),
and their carcase (animals that had died) shall ye not touch." The
latter applied to the clean or edible animals also, when they had died a
natural death ([Lev 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#039).md).

[Leviticus 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 11:9</span></span>

(cf. [Deu 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#009.md) and [Deu
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#010).md). Of water animals, everything
in the water, in seas and brooks, that had fins and scales was edible.
Everything else that swarmed in the water was to be an abomination, its
flesh was not to be eaten, and its carrion was to be avoided with
abhorrence. Consequently, not only were all water animals other than
fishes, such as crabs, salamanders, etc., forbidden as unclean; but also
fishes without scales, such as eels for example. Numa laid down this law
for the Romans: ut pisces qui sqamosi non essent ni pollicerent
(sacrificed): Plin. h. n. 32, c. 2, s. 10. In Egypt fishes without
scales are still regarded as unwholesome (Lane, Manners and Customs).

[Leviticus 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 11:13</span></span>

(cf. [Deu 14:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#011).md). Of birds, twenty
varieties are prohibited, including the bat, but without any common mark
being given; though they consist almost exclusively of birds which live
upon flesh or carrion, and are most of them natives of Western Asia.

(Note: The list is "hardly intended to be exhaustive, but simply
mentions those which were eaten by others, and in relation to which,
therefore, it was necessary that the Israelites should receive a special
prohibition against eating them" (Knobel). Hence in Deuteronomy Moses
added the ראה and enumerated twenty-one varieties; and on doubt, under
other circumstances, he could have made the list still longer. In [Deu
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#011.md) צפּור is used, as synonymous
with עוף in [Deu 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#020)..md)

The list commences with the eagle, as the king of the birds. Nesher
embraces all the species of eagles proper. The idea that the eagle will
not touch carrion is erroneous. According to the testimony of Arabian
writers (Damiri in Bochart, ii. p. 577), and several naturalists who
have travelled (e.g., Forskal. l.c. p. 12, and Seetzen, 1, p. 379), they
will eat carrion if it is still fresh and not decomposed; so that the
eating of carrion could very properly be attributed to them in such
passages as [Job 39:30](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#030.md); [Pro
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md), and [Mat
24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028.md). But the bald-headedness
mentioned in [Mic 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016.md) applies, not to
the true eagle, but to the carrion-kite, which is reckoned, however,
among the different species of eagles, as well as the bearded or golden
vulture. The next in the list is peres, from paras = parash to break,
ossifragus, i.e., wither the bearded or golden vulture, gypaetos
barbatus, or more probably, as Schultz supposes, the sea-eagle, which
may have been the species intended in the γρύψ = γρυπαίετος of the lxx
and gryphus of the Vulgate, and to which the ancients seem sometimes to
have applied the name ossifraga (Lucret. v. 1079). By the next, עזניּה,
we are very probably to understand the bearded or golden vulture. For
this word is no doubt connected with the Arabic word for beard, and
therefore points to the golden vulture, which has a tuft of hair or
feathers on the lower beak, and which might very well be associated with
the eagles so far as the size is concerned, having wings that measure 10
feet from tip to tip. As it really belongs to the family of cultures, it
forms a very fitting link of transition to the other species of vulture
and falcon ([Lev 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#014).md). דּאה (Deut.
דּיּה, according to a change which is by no means rare when the aleph
stands between two vowels: cf. דּואג in [Sa1
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#008.md); [Sa1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md), and דּויג in [Sa1
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018.md), [Sa1
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#022).md), from דּאה to fly, is either
the kite, or the glede, which is very common in Palestine (v. Schubert,
Reise iii. p. 120), and lives on carrion. It is a gregarious bird (cf.
[Isa 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015).md), which other birds of prey
are not, and is used by many different tribes as food (Oedmann, iii. p.
120). The conjecture that the black glede-kite is meant, - a bird which
is particularly common in the East, - and that the name is derived from
דּאה to be dark, is overthrown by the use of the word למינהּ in
Deuteronomy, which shows that דאה is intended to denote the whole genus.
איּה, which is referred to in [Job
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#007.md) as sharp-sighted, is either the
falcon, several species of which are natives of Syria and Arabia, and
which is noted for its keen sight and the rapidity of its flight, or
according to the Vulgate, Schultz, etc., vultur, the true vulture (the
lxx have Ἰκτίν, the kite, here, and γρύψ, the griffin, in Deut. and
Job), of which there are three species in Palestine (Lynch, p. 229). In
[Deu 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#013.md) הראה is also mentioned,
from ראה to see. Judging from the name, it was a keen-sighted bird,
either a falcon or another species of vulture (Vulg. ixion).

[Leviticus 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 11:15</span></span>

"Every raven after his kind," i.e., the whole genus of ravens, with the
rest of the raven-like birds, such as crows, jackdaws, and jays, which
are all of them natives of Syria and Palestine. The omission of ו before
את, which is found in several MSS and editions, is probably to be
regarded as the true reading, as it is not wanting before any of the
other names.

[Leviticus 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 11:16</span></span>

היּענה בּת, i.e., either daughter of screaming (Bochart), or daughter of
greediness (Gesenius, etc.), is used according to all the ancient
versions for the ostrich, which is more frequently described as the
dweller in the desert ([Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md);
[Isa 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013), etc..md), or as the mournful
screamer ([Mic 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md); [Job
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029).md), and is to be understood, not
as denoting the female ostrich only, but as a noun of common gender
denoting the ostrich generally. It does not devour carrion indeed, but
it eats vegetable matter of the most various kinds, and swallows
greedily stones, metals, and even glass. It is found in Arabia, and
sometimes in Hauran and Belka (Seetzen and Burckhardt), and has been
used as food not only by the Struthiophagi of Ethiopia (Diod. Sic. 3,
27; Strabo, xvi. 772) and Numidia (Leo Afric. p. 766), but by some of
the Arabs also (Seetzen, iii. p. 20; Burckhardt, p. 178), whilst others
only eat the eggs, and make use of the fat in the preparation of food.
תּחמס, according to Bochart, Gesenius, and others, is the male ostrich;
but this is very improbable. According to the lxx, Vulg., and others, it
is the owl (Oedmann, iii. pp. 45ff.); but this is mentioned later under
another name. According to Saad. Ar. Erp. it is the swallow; but this is
called סיס in [Jer 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007.md). Knobel
supposes it to be the cuckoo, which is met with in Palestine (Seetzen,
1, p. 78), and derives the name from חמס, violenter egit, supposing it
to be so called from the violence with which it is said to turn out or
devour the eggs and young of other birds, for the purpose of laying its
own eggs in the nest (Aristot. hist. an. 6, 7; 9, 29; Ael. nat. an. 6,
7). שׁחף is the λάρος, or slender gull, according to the lxx and Vulg.
Knobel follows the Arabic, however, and supposes it to be a species of
hawk, which is trained in Syria for hunting gazelles, hares, etc.; but
this is certainly included in the genus נץ. נץ, from נצץ to fly, is the
hawk, which soars very high, and spreads its wings towards the south
([Job 39:26](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#026).md). It stands in fact, as
למינהוּ shows, for the hawk-tribe generally, probably the ἱέραξ,
accipiter, of which the ancients enumerate many different species. כּוס,
which is mentioned in [Psa 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md) as
dwelling in ruins, is an owl according to the ancient versions, although
they differ as to the kind. In Knobel's opinion it is either the
screech-owl, which inhabits ruined buildings, walls, and clefts in the
rock, and the flesh of which is said to be very agreeable, or the little
screech-owl, which also lives in old buildings and walls, and raises a
mournful cry at night, and the flesh of which is said to be savoury.
שׁלך, according to the ancient versions an aquatic bird, and therefore
more in place by the side of the heron, where it stands in Deuteronomy,
is called by the lxx καταῤῥάκτης; in the Targ. and Syr. נוּנא שׁלי,
extrahens pisces. It is not the gull, however (larus catarractes), which
plunges with violence, for according to Oken this is only seen in the
northern seas, but a species of pelican, to be found on the banks of the
Nile and in the islands of the Red Sea, which swims well, and also
dives, frequently dropping perpendicularly upon fishes in the water. The
flesh has an oily taste, but it is eaten for all that.

ינשׁוּף: from נשׁף to snort, according to [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md), dwelling in ruins, no doubt a
species of owl; according to the Chaldee and Syriac, the uhu, which
dwells in old ruined towers and castles upon the mountains, and cries
uhupuhu. תּנשׁמת, which occurs again in [Lev
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#030.md) among the names of the lizards,
is, according to Damiri, a bird resembling the uhu, but smaller.
Jonathan calls it uthya = ὠτός, a night-owl. The primary meaning of the
word נשׁם is essentially the same as that of נשׁף, to breathe or blow,
so called because many of the owls have a mournful cry, and blow and
snort in addition; though it cannot be decided whether the strix otus is
intended, a bird by no means rare in Egypt, which utters a whistling
blast, and rolls itself into a ball and then spreads itself out again,
or the strix flammea, a native of Syria, which sometimes utters a
mournful cry, and at other times snores like a sleeping man, and the
flesh of which is said to be by no means unpleasant, or the hissing owl
(strix stridula), which inhabits the ruins in Egypt and Syria, and is
sometimes called massusu, at other times bane, a very voracious bird,
which is said to fly in at open windows in the evening and kill children
that are left unguarded, and which is very much dreaded in consequence.
קאת, which also lived in desolate places ([Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md); [Zep
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014).md), or in the desert itself ([Psa
102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007).md), was not the kat, a species of
partridge or heath-cock, which is found in Syria (Robinson, ii. p. 620),
as this bird always flies in large flocks, and this is not in harmony
with [Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md) and [Zep
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014), but the pelican (πελεκάν, lxx.md),
as all the ancient versions render it, which Ephraem (on [Num
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#017).md) describes as a marsh-bird, very
fond of its young, inhabiting desolate places, and uttering an incessant
cry. It is the true pelican of the ancients (pelecanus graculus), the
Hebrew name of which seems to have been derived from קוא to spit, from
its habit of spitting out the fishes it has caught, and which is found
in Palestine and the reedy marshes of Egypt (Robinson, Palestine). רחם,
in Deut. רחמה, is κυκνός, the swan, according to the Septuagint;
porphyrio, the fish-heron, according to the Vulgate; a marsh-bird
therefore, possibly vultur percnopterus (Saad. Ar. Erp.), which is very
common in Arabia, Palestine, and Syria, and was classed by the ancients
among the different species of eagles (Plin. h. n. 10, 3), but which is
said to resemble the vulture, and was also called ὀρειπέλαργος, the
mountain-stork (Arist. h. an. 9, 32). It is a stinking and disgusting
bird, of the raven kind, with black pinions; but with this exception it
is quite white. It is also bald-headed, and feeds on carrion and filth.
But it is eaten notwithstanding by many of the Arabs (Burckhardt, Syr.
p. 1046). It received its name of "tenderly loving" from the tenderness
with which it watches over its young (Bochart, iii. pp. 56, 57). In this
respect it resembles the stork, חסידה, avis pia, a bird of passage
according to [Jer 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007.md), which builds
its nest upon the cypresses ([Psa
104:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#017), cf. Bochart, iii. pp. 85ff..md).
In the East the stork builds its nest not only upon high towers and the
roofs of houses, but according to Kazwini and others mentioned by
Bochart (iii. p. 60), upon lofty trees as well.

(Note: Oedmann (v. 58ff.), Knobel, and others follow the Greek
translation of Leviticus and the Psalms, and the Vulgate rendering of
Leviticus, the Psalms, and Job, and suppose the reference to be to the
ἐρωδιός, herodius, the heron: but the name chasidah points decidedly to
the stork, which was generally regarded by the ancients as pietatis
cultrix (Petron. 55, 6), whereas, with the exception of the somewhat
indefinite passage in Aelian (Nat. an. 3, 23), καὶ τοὺς ἐρωδιοὺς ἀκούω
ποιεῖν ταὐτόν (i.e., feed their young by spitting out their food) καὶ
τοὺς πελεκᾶνας μέντοι, nothing is said about the parental affection of
the heron. And the testimony of Bellonius, "Ciconiae quae aetate in
Europa sunt, magna hyemis parte ut in Aegypto sic etiam circa Antiochiam
et juxta Amanum montem degunt," is a sufficient answer to Knobel's
assertion, that according to Seetzen there are not storks in Mount
Lebanon.)

אנפה, according to the lxx and Vulgate χαραδριός, a marsh-bird of the
snipe kind, of which there are several species in Egypt (Hasselquist, p.
308). This is quite in accordance with the expression "after her kind,"
which points to a numerous genus. The omission of ואת before האנפה,
whereas it is found before the name of every other animal, is very
striking; but as the name is preceded by the copulative vav in
Deuteronomy, and stands for a particular bird, it may be accounted for
either from a want of precision on the part of the author, or from an
error of the copyist like the omission of the ו before את in [Lev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#015.md).

(Note: On account of the omission of ואת Knobel would connect האנפה as
an adjective with החסידה, and explain אנף as derived from ענף frons, ענף
frondens, and signifying bushy. The herons were called "the bushy
chasidah," he supposes, because they have a tuft of feathers at the back
of their head, or long feathers hanging down from their neck, which are
wanting in the other marsh-birds, such as the flamingo, crane, and ibis.
But there is this important objection to the explanation, that the
change of א for ע in such a word as ענף frons, which occurs as early as
[Lev 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md), and has retained its ע
even in the Aramaean dialects, is destitute of all probability. In
addition to this, there is the improbability of the chasidah being
restricted by anaphah to the different species of heron, with three of
which the ancients were acquainted (Aristot. h. an. 9, 2; Plin. h. n.
10, 60). If chasidah denoted the heron generally, or the white heron,
the epithet anaphah would be superfluous. It would be necessary to
assume, therefore, that chasidah denotes the whole tribe of marsh-birds,
and that Moses simply intended to prohibit the heron or bushy
marsh-bird. But either of these is very improbable: the former, because
in every other passage of the Old Testament chasidah stands for one
particular kind of bird; the latter, because Moses could hardly have
excluded storks, ibises, and other marsh-birds that live on worms, from
his prohibition. All that remains, therefore, is to separate ha-anaphah
from the preceding word, as in Deuteronomy, and to understand it as
denoting the plover (?) or heron, as there were several species of both.
Which is intended, it is impossible to decide, as there is nothing
certain to be gathered from either the ancient versions or the
etymology. Bochart's reference of the word to a fierce bird, viz., a
species of eagle, which the Arabs call Tammaj, is not raised into a
probability by a comparison with the similarly sounding ἀνοπαῖα of Od.
1, 320, by which Aristarchus understands a kind of eagle.)

דּוּכיפת: according to the lxx, Vulg., and others, the lapwing, which is
found in Syria, Arabia, and still more commonly in Egypt (Forsk, Russel,
Sonnini), and is eaten in some places, as its flesh is said to be fat
and savoury in autumn (Sonn. 1, 204). But it has a disagreeable smell,
as it frequents marshy districts seeking worms and insects for food, and
according to a common belief among the ancients, builds its nest of
human dung. Lastly, העטלּף is the bat ([Isa
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020).md), which the Arabs also classified
among the birds.

[Leviticus 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 11:20</span></span>

(cf. [Deu 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#019).md). To the birds there
are appended flying animals of other kinds: "all swarms of fowl that go
upon fours," i.e., the smaller winged animals with four feet, which are
called sherez, "swarms," on account of their multitude. These were not
to be eaten, as they were all abominations, with the exception of those
"which have two shank-feet above their feet (i.e., springing feet) to
leap with" (לא for לו as in [Exo
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#008).md). Locusts are the animals
referred to, four varieties being mentioned with their different species
("after his kind"); but these cannot be identified with exactness, as
there is still a dearth of information as to the natural history of the
oriental locust. It is well known that locusts were eaten by many of the
nations of antiquity both in Asia and Africa, and even the ancient
Greeks thought the Cicades very agreeable in flavour (Arist. h. an. 5,
30). In Arabia they are sold in the market, sometimes strung upon cords,
sometimes by measure; and they are also dried, and kept in bags for
winter use. For the most part, however, it is only by the poorer classes
that they are eaten, and many of the tribes of Arabia abhor them
(Robinson, ii. p. 628); and those who use them as food do not eat all
the species indiscriminately. They are generally cooked over hot coals,
or on a plate, or in an oven, or stewed in butter, and eaten either with
salt or with spice and vinegar, the head, wings, and feet being thrown
away. They are also boiled in salt and water, and eaten with salt or
butter. Another process is to dry them thoroughly, and then grind them
into meal and make cakes of them. The Israelites were allowed to eat the
arbeh, i.e., according to [Exo 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#013.md),
[Exo 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#019.md); [Nah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017.md), etc., the flying migratory
locust, gryllus migratorius, which still bears this name, according to
Niebuhr, in Maskat and Bagdad, and is poetically designated in [Psa
78:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#046.md); [Psa
105:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034.md), as חסיל, the devourer, and
ילק, the eater-up; but Knobel is mistaken in supposing that these names
are applied to certain species of the arbeh. סלעם, according to the
Chaldee, deglutivit, absorpsit, is unquestionably a larger and
peculiarly voracious species of locust. This is all that can be inferred
from the rashon of the Targums and Talmud, whilst the ἀττάκης and
attacus of the lxx and Vulg. are altogether unexplained. חרגּל:
according to the Arabic, a galloping, i.e., a hopping, not a flying
species of locust. This is supported by the Samaritan, also by the lxx
and Vulg., ὀφιομάχης, ophiomachus. According to Hesychius and Suidas, it
was a species of locust without wings, probably a very large kind; as it
is stated in Mishnah, Shabb. vi. 10, that an egg of the chargol was
sometimes suspended in the ear, as a remedy for earache. Among the
different species of locusts in Mesopotamia, Niebuhr (Arab. p. 170) saw
two of a very large size with springing feet, but without wings. חגב, a
word of uncertain etymology, occurs in [Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md), where the spies are described
as being like chagabim by the side of the inhabitants of the country,
and in [Ch2 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#013.md), where the chagab
devours the land. From these passages we may infer that it was a species
of locust without wings, small but very numerous, probably the
ἀττέλαβος, which is often mentioned along with the ἀκρίς, but as a
distinct species, locustarum minima sine pennis (Plin. h. n. 29, c. 4,
s. 29), or parva locusta modicis pennis reptans potius quam volitans
semperque subsiliens (Jerome (on [Nah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017).md).

(Note: In [Deu 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#019.md) the edible kinds
of locusts are passed over, because it was not the intention of Moses to
repeat every particular of the earlier laws in these addresses. But when
Knobel (on Lev. pp. 455 and 461) gives this explanation of the omission,
that the eating of locusts is prohibited in Deuteronomy, and the
Deuteronomist passes them over because in his more advanced age there
was apparently no longer any necessity for the prohibition, this
arbitrary interpretation is proved to be at variance with historical
truth by the fact that locusts were eaten by John the Baptist, inasmuch
as this proves at all events that a more advanced age had not given up
the custom of eating locusts.)

[Leviticus 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 11:24</span></span>

In [Lev 11:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024.md) there follow still
further and more precise instructions, concerning defilement through
contact with the carcases (i.e., the carrion) of the animals already
mentioned. These instructions relate first of all ([Lev
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024.md) and [Lev
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#025).md) to aquatic and winged animals,
which were not to be eaten because they were unclean (the expression
"for these" in [Lev 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024.md) relates to
them); and then ([Lev 11:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#026).md) to
quadrupeds, both cattle that have not the hoof thoroughly divided and do
not ruminate ([Lev 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#026).md), and animals
that go upon their hands, i.e., upon paws, and have no hoofs, such as
cats, dogs, bears, etc.

[Leviticus 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 11:27</span></span>

The same rule was applicable to all these animals: "whoever toucheth the
carcase of them shall be unclean until the even," i.e., for the rest of
the day; he was then of course to wash himself. Whoever carried their
carrion, viz., to take it away, was also unclean till the evening, and
being still more deeply affected by the defilement, he was to wash his
clothes as well.

[Leviticus 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 11:29</span></span>

To these there are attached analogous instructions concerning defilement
through contact with the smaller creeping animals (Sherez), which formed
the fourth class of the animal kingdom; though the prohibition against
eating these animals is not introduced till [Lev
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#041.md), [Lev
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#042.md), as none of these were usually
eaten. Sherez, the swarm, refers to animals which swarm together in
great numbers (see at [Gen 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021).md), and
is synonymous with remes (cf. [Gen
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#014.md) and [Gen
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#021).md), "the creeping;" it denotes the
smaller land animals which move without feet, or with feet that are
hardly perceptible (see at [Gen 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024).md).
Eight of the creeping animals are named, as defiling not only the men
with whom they might come in contact, but any domestic utensils and food
upon which they might fall; they were generally found in houses,
therefore, or in the abodes of men. חלד is not the mole (according to
Saad. Ar. Abys., etc.), although the Arabs still call this chuld, but
the weasel (lxx, Onk., etc.), which is common in Syria and Palestine,
and is frequently mentioned by the Talmudists in the feminine form
חוּלדה, as an animal which caught birds (Mishn. Cholin iii. 4), which
would run over the wave-loaves with a sherez in its mouth (Mishn. Tohor.
iv. 2), and which could drink water out of a vessel (Mishn. Para ix. 3).
עכבּר is the mouse (according to the ancient versions and the Talmud),
and in [Sa1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#005.md) the field-mouse, the
scourge of the fields, not the jerboa, as Knobel supposes; for this
animal lives in holes in the ground, is very shy, and does not frequent
houses as is assumed to be the case with the animals mentioned here. צב
is a kind of lizard, but whether the thav or dsabb, a harmless yellow
lizard of 18 inches in length, which is described by Seetzen, iii. pp.
436ff., also by Hasselquist under the name of lacerta Aegyptia, or the
waral, as Knobel supposes, a large land lizard reaching as much as four
feet in length, which is also met with in Palestine (Robinson, ii. 160)
and is called el worran by Seetzen, cannot be determined.

[Lev 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#030.md)

The early translators tell us nothing certain as to the three following
names, and it is still undecided how they should be rendered. אנקה is
translated μυγάλη by the lxx, i.e., shrew-mouse; but the oriental
versions render it by various names for a lizard. Bochart supposes it to
be a species of lizard with a sharp groaning voice, because אנק
signifies to breathe deeply, or groan. Rosenmller refers it to the
lacerta Gecko, which is common in Egypt, and utters a peculiar cry
resembling the croaking of frogs, especially in the night. Leyrer
imagines it to denote the whole family of monitores; and Knobel, the
large and powerful river lizard, the water-waral of the Arabs, called
lacerta Nilotica in Hasselquist, pp. 361ff., though he has failed to
observe, that Moses could hardly have supposed it possible that an
animal four feet long, resembling a crocodile, could drop down dead into
either pots or dishes. כּוח is not the chameleon (lxx), for this is
called tinshemeth, but the chardaun (Arab.), a lizard which is found in
old walls in Natolia, Syria, and Palestine, lacerta stellio, or lacerta
coslordilos (Hasselquist, pp. 351-2). Knobel supposes it to be the frog,
because coach seems to point to the crying or croaking of frogs, to
which the Arabs apply the termkuk, the Greeks κοάξ, the Romans coaxare.
But this is very improbable, and the frog would be quite out of place in
the midst of simple lizards. לטאה, according to the ancient versions, is
also a lizard. Leyrer supposes it to be the nocturnal, salamander-like
family of beckons; Knobel, on the contrary, imagines it to be the
tortoise, which creeps upon the earth (terrae adhaeret), because the
Arabic verb signifies terrae adhaesit. This is very improbable, however.
חמט (lxx), σαῦρα, Vulg. lacerta, probably the true lizard, or, as Leyrer
conjectures, the anguis (Luth. Blindschleiche, blind-worm), or zygnis,
which forms the link between lizards and snakes. The rendering "snail"
(Sam. Rashi, etc.) is not so probable, as this is called שׁבלוּל in [Psa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md); although the purple snail and
all the marine species are eaten in Egypt and Palestine. Lastly,
תּנשׁמת, the self-inflating animal (see at [Lev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#018).md), is no doubt the chameleon,
which frequently inflates its belly, for example, when enraged, and
remains in this state for several hours, when it gradually empties
itself and becomes quite thin again. Its flesh was either cooked, or
dried and reduced to powder, and used as a specific for corpulence, or a
cure for fevers, or as a general medicine for sick children (Plin. h. n.
28, 29). The flesh of many of the lizards is also eaten by the Arabs
(Leyrer, pp. 603, 604).

[Lev 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#031.md)

The words, "these are unclean to you among all swarming creatures," are
neither to be understood as meaning, that the eight species mentioned
were the only swarming animals that were unclean and not allowed to be
eaten, nor that they possessed and communicated a larger amount of
uncleanness; but when taken in connection with the instructions which
follow, they can only mean, that such animals would even defile domestic
utensils, clothes, etc., if they fell down dead upon them. Not that they
were more unclean than others, since all the unclean animals would
defile not only persons, but even the clothes of those who carried their
dead bodies ([Lev 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#025.md), [Lev
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#028).md); but there was more fear in
their case than in that of others, of their falling dead upon objects in
common use, and therefore domestic utensils, clothes, and so forth,
could be much more easily defiled by them than by the larger quadrupeds,
by water animals, or by birds. "When they be dead," lit., "in their
dying;" i.e., not only if they were already dead, but if they died at
the time when they fell upon any object.

[Lev 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#032.md)

In either case, anything upon which one of these animals fell became
unclean, "whether a vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin." Every vessel
(כּלי in the widest sense, as in [Exo
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#006).md), "wherein any work is done,"
i.e., that was an article of common use, was to be unclean till the
evening, and then placed in water, that it might become clean again.

[Lev 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#033.md)

Every earthen vessel, into which (lit., into the midst of which) one of
them fell, became unclean, together with the whole of its contents, and
was to be broken, i.e., destroyed, because the uncleanness as absorbed
by the vessel, and could not be entirely removed by washing (see at [Lev
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#021).md). Of course the contents of such
a vessel, supposing there were any, were not to be used.

[Lev 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#034.md)

"Every edible food (מן before כּל partitive, as in [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002).md) upon which water comes," - that
is to say, which was prepared with water, - and "every drink that is
drunk...becomes unclean in every vessel," sc., if such an animal should
fall dead upon the food, or into the drink. The traditional rendering of
[Lev 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#034.md), "every food upon which
water out of such a vessel comes," is untenable; because מים without an
article cannot mean such water, or this water.

[Lev 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#035.md)

Every vessel also became unclean, upon which the body of such an animal
fell: such as תּנּוּר, the earthen baking-pot (see [Lev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004).md), and כּירים, the covered pan or
pot. כּיר, a boiling or roasting vessel ([Sa1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#014).md), can only signify, when used in
the dual, a vessel consisting of two parts, i.e., a pan or pot with a
lid.

[Lev 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#036.md)

Springs and wells were not defiled, because the uncleanness would be
removed at once by the fresh supply of water. But whoever touched the
body of the animal, to remove it, became unclean.

[Lev 11:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#037.md)

All seed-corn that was intended to be sown remained clean, namely,
because the uncleanness attaching to it externally would be absorbed by
the earth. But if water had been put upon the seed, i.e., if the grain
had been softened by water, it was to be unclean, because in that case
the uncleanness would penetrate the softened grains and defile the
substance of the seed, which would therefore produce uncleanness in the
fruit.

[Leviticus 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">lev 11:39</span></span>

Lastly, contact with edible animals, if they had not been slaughtered,
but had died a natural death, and had become carrion in consequence, is
also said to defile (cf. [Lev 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#039.md),
[Lev 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#040.md) with [Lev
11:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024).md). This was the case, too,
with the eating of the swarming land animals, whether they went upon the
belly,

(Note: The large ו in גּחון ([Lev
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#042).md) shows that this vav is the
middle letter of the Pentateuch.)

as snakes and worms, or upon four feet, as rats, mice, weasels, etc., or
upon many feet, like the insects ([Lev
11:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#041).md). Lastly ([Lev
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044.md), [Lev
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#045).md), the whole law is enforced by
an appeal to the calling of the Israelites, as a holy nation, to be holy
as Jehovah their God, who had brought them out of Egypt to be a God to
them, was holy ([Exo 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#007.md); [Exo
29:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#045).md).

[Leviticus 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">lev 11:46</span></span>

[Lev 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#046.md), [Lev
11:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#047.md) contain the concluding formula
to the whole of this law. If we take a survey, in closing, of the
animals that are enumerated as unclean and not suitable for food, we
shall find that among the larger land animals they were chiefly beasts
of prey, that seize upon other living creatures and devour them in their
blood; among the water animals, all snake-like fishes and slimy
shell-fish; among birds, the birds of prey, which watch for the life of
other animals and kill them, the marsh-birds, which live on worms,
carrion, and all kinds of impurities, and such mongrel creatures as the
ostrich, which lives in the desert, and the bat, which flies about in
the dark; and lastly, all the smaller animals, with the exception of a
few graminivorous locusts, but more especially the snake-like lizards, -
partly because they called to mind the old serpent, partly because they
crawled in the dust, seeking their food in mire and filth, and suggested
the thought of corruption by the slimy nature of their bodies. They
comprised, in fact, all such animals as exhibited more or less the
darker type of sin, death, and corruption; and it was on this ethical
ground alone, and not for all kinds of sanitary reasons, or even from
political motives, that the nation of Israel, which was called to
sanctification, was forbidden to eat them. It is true there are several
animals mentioned as unclean, e.g., the ass, the camel, and others, in
which we can no longer recognise this type. But we must bear in mind,
that the distinction between clean animals and unclean goes back to the
very earliest times ([Gen 7:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#002).md), and
that in relation to the large land animals, as well as to the fishes,
the Mosaic law followed the marks laid down by tradition, which took its
rise in the primeval age, whose childlike mind, acute perception, and
deep intuitive insight into nature generally, discerned more truly and
essentially the real nature of the animal creation than we shall ever be
able to do, with thoughts and perceptions disturbed as ours are by the
influences of unnatural and ungodly culture.

(Note: "In its direct and deep insight into the entire nexus of the
physical, psychical, and spiritual world, into the secret
correspondences of the cosmos and nomos, this sense for nature
anticipated discoveries which we shall never make with our ways of
thinking, but which a purified humanity, when looking back from the new
earth, will fully understand, and will no longer only 'see through a
glass darkly.'" - Leyrer, Herzog's Cycl.)
