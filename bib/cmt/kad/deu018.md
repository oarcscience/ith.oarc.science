### [Deuteronomy Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 18:1</span></span>

In addition to the judicial order and the future king, it was necessary
that the position of the priests and Levites, whose duties and rights
had been regulated by previous laws, should at least be mentioned
briefly and finally established ([Deu
18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001).md), and also that the prophetic
order should be fully accredited by the side of the other state
authorities, and its operations regulated by a definite law ([Deu
18:9-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009).md).

[Deu 18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md)

The Rights of the Priests and Levites. - With reference to these, Moses
repeats verbatim from [Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md), [Num
18:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#023.md), the essential part of the
rule laid down in Num 18: "The priests the Levites, the whole tribe of
Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel." "All the tribe of
Levi" includes the priests and Levites. They were to eat the "firings of
Jehovah and His inheritance," as described in detail in Num 18. The
inheritance of Jehovah consisted of the holy gifts as well as the
sacrifices, i.e., the tithes, firstlings, and first-fruits. Moses felt
it to be superfluous to enumerate these gifts one by one from the
previous laws, and also to describe the mode of their application, or
define how much belonged to the priests and how much to the Levites.
However true it may be that the author assigns all these gifts to the
Levites generally, the conclusion drawn from this, viz., that he was not
acquainted with any distinction between priests and Levites, but placed
the Levites entirely on a par with the priests, is quite a false one.
For, apart from the evident distinction between the priests and Levites
in [Deu 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md), where there would be no
meaning in the clause, "all the tribe of Levi," if the Levites were
identical with the priests, the distinction is recognised and asserted
as clearly as possible in what follows, when a portion of the
slain-offerings is allotted to the priests in [Deu
18:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003.md), whilst in [Deu
18:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#006.md) the Levite is allowed to join
in eating the altar gifts, if he come to the place of the sanctuary and
perform service there. The repetition in [Deu
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#002.md) is an emphatic confirmation: "As
He hath said unto them:" as in [Deu
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009.md).

[Deu 18:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003.md)

"This shall be the right of the priests on the part of the people, on
the part of those who slaughter slain-offerings, whether ox or sheep; he
(the offerer) shall give the priest the shoulder, the cheek, and the
stomach." הזּרע, the shoulder, i.e., the front leg; see [Num
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#019.md). הקּבה, the rough stomach, τὸ
ἤνιστρον (lxx), i.e., the fourth stomach of ruminant animals, in which
the digestion of the food is completed; Lat. omasus or abomasus, though
the Vulgate has ventriculus here. On the choice of these three pieces in
particular, Mnster and Fagius observe that "the sheep possesses three
principal parts, the head, the feet, and the trunk; and of each of these
some portion was to be given to the priest who officiated" "Of each of
these three principal parts of the animal," says Schultz, "some valuable
piece was to be presented: the shoulder at least, and the stomach, which
was regarded as particularly fat, are seen at once to have been
especially good." That this arrangement is not at variance with the
command in [Lev 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#032.md)., to give the
wave-breast and heave-leg of the peace-offerings to the Lord for the
priests, but simply enjoins a further gift to the priests on the part of
the people, in addition to those portions which were to be given to the
Lord for His servants, is sufficiently evident from the context, since
the heave-leg and wave-breast belonged to the firings of Jehovah
mentioned in [Deu 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md), which the
priests had received as an inheritance from the Lord, that is to say, to
the tenuphoth of the children of Israel, which the priests might eat
with their sons and daughters, though only with such members of their
house as were levitically clean ([Num
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#011).md); and also from the words of the
present command, viz., that the portions mentioned were to be a right of
the priests on the part of the people, on the part of those who
slaughtered slain-offerings, i.e., to be paid to the priest as a right
that was due to him on the part of the people. משׁפּט was what the
priest could justly claim. This right was probably accorded to the
priests as a compensation for the falling off which would take place in
their incomes in consequence of the repeal of the law that every animal
was to be slaughtered at the sanctuary as a sacrifice (Lev 17; vid.,
[Deu 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015)..md).

The only thing that admits of dispute is, whether this gift was to be
presented from every animal that was slaughtered at home for private
use, or only from those which were slaughtered for sacrificial meals,
and therefore at the place of the sanctuary. Against the former view,
for which appeal is made to Philo, Josephus (Ant. iv. 4, 4), and the
Talmud, we may adduce not only "the difficulty of carrying out such a
plan" (was every Israelite who slaughtered an ox, a sheep, or a goat to
carry the pieces mentioned to the priests' town, which might be many
miles away, or were the priests to appoint persons to collect them?),
but the general use of the words זבח זבח. The noun זבח always signifies
either slaughtering for a sacrificial meal or a slain sacrifice, and the
verb זבח is never applied to ordinary slaughtering (for which שׁחט is
the verb used), except in [Deu 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md)
and [Deu 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#021.md) in connection with the
repeal of the law that every slaughtering was to be a שׁלמים זבח ([Lev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#005).md); and there the use of the word
זבח, instead of שׁחט, may be accounted for from the allusion to this
particular law. At the same time, the Jewish tradition is probably
right, when it understands by the הזּבח זבחי in this verse, κατ' ̓͂ ́ ̓́ ̔́
(Josephus), or ἔξω τοῦ βωμοῦ θυομένοις ἕνεκα κρεωφαγίας (Philo), or, as
in the Mishnah Chol. (x. 1), refers the gift prescribed in this passage
to the חולין, profana, and not to the מוקדשׁרן, consecrata, that is to
say, places it in the same category with the first-fruits, the tithe of
tithes, and other less holy gifts, which might be consumed outside the
court of the temple and the holy city (compare Reland, Antiqq. ss. P.
ii. c. 4, 11, with P. ii. c. 8, 10). In all probability, the reference
is to the slaughtering of oxen, sheep, or goats which were not intended
for shelamim in the more limited sense, i.e., for one of the three
species of peace-offerings ([Lev
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015).md), but for festal meals in the
broader sense, which were held in connection with the sacrificial meals
prepared from the shelamim. For it is evident that the meals held by the
people at the annual feasts when they had to appear before the Lord were
not all shelamim meals, but that other festal meals were held in
connection with these, in which the priests and Levites were to share,
from the laws laid down with reference to the so-called second tithe,
which could not only be turned into money by those who lived at a great
distance from the sanctuary, such money to be applied to the purchase of
the things required for the sacrificial meals at the place of the
sanctuary, but which might also be appropriated every third year to the
preparation of love-feasts for the poor in the different towns of the
land ([Deu 14:22-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022).md). For in this case
the animals were not slaughtered or sacrificed as shelamim, at all
events not in the latter instance, because the slaughtering did not take
place at the sanctuary. If therefore we restrict the gift prescribed
here to the slaughtering of oxen and sheep or goats for such sacrificial
meals in the wider sense, not only are the difficulties connected with
the execution of this command removed, but also the objection, which
arises out of the general use of the expression זבח זבח, to the
application of this expression to every slaughtering that took place for
domestic use. And beside this, the passage in [Sa1
2:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013.md), to which Calvin calls
attention, furnishes a historical proof that the priests could claim a
portion of the flesh of the slain-offerings in addition to the heave-leg
and wave-breast, since it is there charged as a sin on the part of the
sons of Eli, not only that they took out of the cauldrons as much of the
flesh which was boiling as they could take up with three-pronged forks,
but that before the fat was burned upon the altar they asked for the
pieces which belonged to the priest, to be given to them not cooked, but
raw. From this Michaelis has drawn the correct conclusion, that even at
that time the priests had a right to claim that, in addition to the
portions of the sacrifices appointed by Moses in [Lev
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034.md), a further portion of the
thank-offerings should be given to them; though he does not regard the
passage as referring to the law before us, since he supposes this to
relate to every slaughtered animal which was not placed upon the altar.

[Deu 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#004.md)

In [Deu 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#004.md), Moses repeats the law
concerning the first-fruits in [Num
18:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012.md) (cf. [Exo
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028).md), for the purpose of extending
it to the first produce of the sheep-shearing.

[Deu 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#005.md)

The reason for the right accorded to the priests was the choice of them
for the office of standing "to minister in the name of Jehovah," sc.,
for all the tribes "In the name of Jehovah," not merely by the
appointment, but also in the power of the Lord, as mediators of His
grace. The words "he and his sons" point back quite to the Mosaic times,
in which Aaron and his sons held the priest's office.

[Deu 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#006.md)

As the priests were to be remembered for their service on the part of
the people ([Deu 18:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003).md), so the
Levite also, who came from one of the towns of the land with all the
desire of his soul to the place of the sanctuary, to minister there in
the name of the Lord, was to eat a similar portion to all his Levitical
brethren who stood there in service before the Lord. The verb גּוּר
(sojourned) does not presuppose that the Levites were houseless, but
simply that they had no hereditary possession in the land as the other
tribes had, and merely lived like sojourners among the Israelites in the
towns which were given up to them by the other tribes (see at [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012).md). "All his brethren the Levites"
are the priests and those Levites who officiated at the sanctuary as
assistants to the priests. It is assumed, therefore, that only a part of
the Levites were engaged at the sanctuary, and the others lived in their
towns. The apodosis follows in [Deu
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#008.md), "part like part shall they eat,"
sc., the new-comer and those already there. The former was to have the
same share to eat as the latter, and to be maintained from the revenues
of the sanctuary. These revenues are supposed to be already apportioned
by the previous laws, so that they by no means abolish the distinction
between priests and Levites. We are not to think of those portions of
the sacrifices and first-fruits only which fell to the lot of the
priests, nor of the tithe alone, or of the property which flowed into
the sanctuary through vows or free-will offerings, or in any other way,
and was kept in the treasury and storehouse, but of tithes, sacrificial
portions, and free-will offerings generally, which were not set apart
exclusively for the priests. וגו ממכּריו לבד, "beside his sold with the
fathers," i.e., independently of what he receives from the sale of his
patrimony. ממכּר, the sale, then the thing sold, and the price or
produce of what is sold, like מכר in [Num
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#019.md). לבד is unusual without מן, and
Knobel would read ממּכריו, from מכריו and מן, in consequence. האבות על
stands for בּית־אבות על (see at [Exo
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#025); κατὰ τὴν πατρίαν, lxx.md),
according to or with the fathers' houses, i.e., the produce of the
property which he possesses according to his family descent, or which is
with his kindred. Whether על in this passage signifies "according to the
measure of," or "with," in the sense of keeping or administering, cannot
be decided. As the law in [Lev
25:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#033.md), simply forbids the sale of
the pasture grounds belonging to the Levites, but permits the sale of
their houses, a Levite who went to the sanctuary might either let his
property in the Levitical town, and draw the yearly rent, or sell the
house which belonged to him there. In any case, these words furnish a
convincing proof that there is no foundation for the assertion that the
book of Deuteronomy assumes or affirms that the Levites were absolutely
without possessions.

[Deuteronomy 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 18:9</span></span>

The Gift of Prophecy. - The Levitical priests, as the stated guardians
and promoters of the law, had to conduct all the affairs of Israel with
the Lord, not only instructing the people out of the law concerning the
will of God, but sustaining and promoting the living fellowship with the
Lord both of individuals and of the whole congregation, by the offering
of sacrifices and service at the altar. But if the covenant fellowship
with Himself and His grace, in which Jehovah had placed Israel as His
people of possession, was to be manifested and preserved as a living
reality amidst all changes in the political development of the nation
and in the circumstances of private life, it would not do for the
revelations from God to cease with the giving of the law and the death
of Moses. For, as Schultz observes, "however the revelation of the law
might aim at completeness, and even have regard to the more remote
circumstances of the future, as, for example, where the king is referred
to; yet in the transition from extraordinary circumstances into a more
settled condition, which it foretells in [Deu
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014.md), and which actually took place
under Samuel when the nation grew older ([Deu
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#025).md), and in the decline and apostasy
which certainly awaited it according to [Deu
31:16-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016.md), when false prophets should
arise, by whom they were in danger of being led astray ([Deu
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#002.md) and [Deu
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020).md), as well as in the restoration
which would follow after the infliction of punishment ([Deu
4:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029.md); [Deu
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001)..md); in all these great changes
which awaited Israel from inward necessity, the revelation of the will
of the Lord which they possessed in the law would nevertheless be
insufficient." The priesthood, with its ordinances, would not suffice
for that. As the promise of direct communications from God through the
Urim and Thummim of the high priest was restricted to the single
circumstance of the right of the whole congregation being endangered,
and did not extend to the satisfaction of the religious necessities of
individuals, it could afford no godly satisfaction to that desire for
supernatural knowledge which arose at times in the hearts of
individuals, and for which the heathen oracles made such ample provision
in ungodly ways. If Israel therefore was to be preserved in faithfulness
towards God, and attain the end of its calling as the congregation of
the Lord, it was necessary that the Lord should make known His counsel
and will at the proper time through the medium of prophets, and bestow
upon it in sure prophetic words what the heathen nations endeavoured to
discover and secure by means of augury and soothsaying. This is the
point of view from which Moses promises the sending of prophets in [Deu
18:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md), and lays down in [Deu
18:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#019.md) the criteria for
distinguishing between true and false prophets, as we may clearly see
from the fact that in [Deu 18:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009.md) he
introduces this promise with a warning against resorting to heathen
augury, soothsaying, and witchcraft.

[Deu 18:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009.md)

When Israel came into the land of Canaan, it was "not to learn to do
like the abominations of these nations" (the Canaanites or heathen).
There was not to be found in it any who caused his son or his daughter
to pass through the fire, i.e., any worshipper of Moloch (see at [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021).md), or one who practised
soothsaying (see at [Num 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023).md), or a
wizard (see at [Lev 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026).md), or a
snake-charmer (see at [Lev 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026).md), or
a conjurer, or one who pronounced a ban (חבר חבר, probably referring to
the custom of binding or banning by magical knots), a necromancer and
wise man (see at [Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031).md), or one
who asked the dead, i.e., who sought oracles from the dead. Moses groups
together all the words which the language contained for the different
modes of exploring the future and discovering the will of God, for the
purpose of forbidding every description of soothsaying, and places the
prohibition of Moloch-worship at the head, to show the inward connection
between soothsaying and idolatry, possibly because februation, or
passing children through the fire in the worship of Moloch, was more
intimately connected with soothsaying and magic than and other
description of idolatry.

[Deu 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#012.md)

Whoever did this was an abomination to the Lord, and it was because of
this abomination that He rooted out the Canaanites before Israel (cf.
[Lev 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024)..md).

[Deu 18:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#013.md)

Israel, on the other hand, was to be blameless with Jehovah (עם, in its
intercourse with the Lord). Though the heathen whom they exterminated
before them hearkened to conjurers and soothsayers, Jehovah their God
had not allowed anything of the kind to them. ואתּה is placed first as a
nominative absolute, for the sake of emphasis: "but thou, so far as thou
art concerned, not so." כּן, thus, just so, such things (cf. [Exo
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#014).md). נתן, to grant, to allow (as in
[Gen 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#006), etc..md).

[Deu 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md)

"A prophet out of the midst of thee, out of thy brethren, as I am, will
Jehovah thy God raise up to thee; to him shall ye hearken." When Moses
thus attaches to the prohibition against hearkening to soothsayers and
practising soothsaying, the promise that Jehovah would raise up a
prophet, etc., and contrasts what the Lord would do for His people with
what He did not allow, it is perfectly evident from this simple
connection alone, apart from the further context of the passage, in
which Moses treats of the temporal and spiritual rulers of Israel (ch.
17 and 18), that the promise neither relates to one particular prophet,
nor directly and exclusively to the Messiah, but treats of the sending
of prophets generally. And this is also confirmed by what follows with
reference to true and false prophets, which presupposes the rise of a
plurality of prophets, and shows most incontrovertibly that it is not
one prophet only, nor the Messiah exclusively, who is promised here. It
by no means follows from the use of the singular, "a prophet," that
Moses is speaking of one particular prophet only; but the idea expressed
is this, that at any time when the people stood in need of a mediator
with God like Moses, God would invariably send a prophet. The words,
"out of the midst of thee, of thy brethren," imply that there would be
no necessity for Israel to turn to heathen soothsayers or prophets, but
that it would find the men within itself who would make known the word
of the Lord. The expression, "like unto me," is explained by what
follows in [Deu 18:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#016.md) with regard
to the circumstances, under which the Lord had given the promise that He
would send a prophet. It was at Sinai; when the people were filled with
mortal alarm, after hearing the ten words which God addressed to them
out of the fire, and entreated Moses to act as mediator between the Lord
and themselves, that God might not speak directly to them any more. At
that time the Lord gave the promise that He would raise up a prophet,
and put His words into his mouth, that he might speak to the people all
that the Lord commanded (cf. [Deu
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#020)..md). The promised prophet,
therefore, was to resemble Moses in this respect, that he would act as
mediator between Jehovah and the people, and make known the words or the
will of the Lord. Consequently the meaning contained in the expression
"like unto me" was not that the future prophet would resemble Moses in
all respect, - a meaning which has been introduced into it through an
unwarrantable use of [Num 12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md); [Deu
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010.md), and [Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002.md), [Heb
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005.md), for the purpose of proving the
direct application of the promise to the Messiah alone, to the exclusion
of the prophets of the Old Testament. If the resemblance of the future
prophet to Moses, expressed in the words "like unto me," be understood
as indicating the precise form in which God revealed Himself to Moses,
speaking with him mouth to mouth, and not in a dream or vision, a
discrepancy is introduced between this expression and the words which
follow in [Deu 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md), "I will put My
words in his mouth;" since this expresses not the particular mode in
which Moses received the revelations from God, in contrast with the rest
of the prophets, but simply that form of divine communication or
inspiration which was common to all the prophets (vid., [Jer
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#009.md); [Jer
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014).md).

But whilst we are obliged to give up the direct and exclusive reference
of this promise to the Messiah, which was the prevailing opinion in the
early Church, and has been revived by Kurtz, Auberlen, and Tholuck, as
not in accordance with the context or the words themselves, we cannot,
on the other hand, agree with v. Hoffmann, Baur, and Knobel, in
restricting the passage to the Old Testament prophets, to the exclusion
of the Messiah. There is no warrant for this limitation of the word
"prophet," since the expectation of the Messiah was not unknown to Moses
and the Israel of his time, but was actually expressed in the promise of
the seed of the woman, and Jacob's prophecy concerning Shiloh; so that
O. v. Gerlach is perfectly right in observing, that "this is a
prediction of Christ as the true Prophet, precisely like that of the
seed of the woman in [Gen 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md)." The
occasion, also, on which Moses received the promise of the "prophet"
from the Lord, which he here communicated to the people, - namely, when
the people desired a mediator between themselves and the Lord at Sinai,
and this desire on their part was pleasing to the Lord, - shows that the
promise should be understood in the full sense of the words, without any
limitation whatever; that is to say, that Christ, in whom the prophetic
character culminated and was completed, is to be included. Even Ewald
admits, that "the prophet like unto Moses, whom God would raise up out
of Israel and for Israel, can only be the true prophet generally;" and
Baur also allows, that "historical exposition will not mistake the
anticipatory reference of this expression to Christ, which is involved
in the expectation that, in the future completion of the plan of
salvation, the prophetic gift would form an essential element." And
lastly, the comparison instituted between the promised prophet and
Moses, compels us to regard the words as referring to the Messiah. The
words, "like unto me," "like unto thee," no more warrant us in excluding
the Messiah on the one hand, than in excluding the Old Testament
prophets on the other, since it is unquestionably affirmed that the
prophet of the future would be as perfectly equal to his calling as
Moses was to his,

(Note: Let any one paraphrase the passage thus: "A prophet inferior
indeed to me, but yet the channel of divine revelations," and he will
soon feel how unsuitable it is" (Hengstenberg).)

\- that He would carry out the mediation between the Lord and the people
in the manner and the power of Moses. In this respect not one of the Old
Testament prophets was fully equal to Moses, as is distinctly stated in
[Deu 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010.md). All the prophets of the
Old Testament stood within the sphere of the economy of the law, which
was founded through the mediatorial office of Moses; and even in their
predictions of the future, they simply continued to build upon the
foundation which was laid by Moses, and therefore prophesied of the
coming of the servant of the Lord, who, as the Prophet of all prophets,
would restore Jacob, and carry out the law and right of the Lord to the
nations, even to the end of the world (Isa 42; 49; 40; [Isa
61:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md). This prophecy, therefore, is
very properly referred to Jesus Christ in the New Testament, as having
been fulfilled in Him. Not only had Philip this passage in his mind when
he said to Nathanael, "We have found Him of whom Moses in the law did
write, Jesus of Nazareth," whilst Stephen saw the promise of the prophet
like unto Moses fulfilled in Christ ([Act
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#037).md); but Peter also expressly quotes
it in [Act 3:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022.md), as referring to
Christ; and even the Lord applies it to Himself in [Joh
5:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045.md), when He says to the Jews,
"Moses, in whom ye trust, will accuse you; for if ye believed Moses, ye
would also believe Me: for Moses wrote of Me." In [Joh
12:48-50](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#048.md), again, the reference to [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md) and [Deu
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#019.md) of this chapter is quite
unmistakeable; and in the words, "hear ye Him" which were uttered from
the cloud at the transfiguration of Jesus ([Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005).md), the expression in [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md), "unto Him shall ye hearken," is
used verbatim with reference to Christ. Even the Samaritans founded
their expectation of the Messiah ([Joh
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#025).md) upon these words of Moses.

(Note: On the history of the exposition of this passage, see
Hengstenberg's Christology.)

[Deu 18:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#016.md)

With this assurance the Lord had fully granted the request of the
people, "according to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God;" and
Israel, therefore, was all the more bound to hearken to the prophets,
whom God would raise up from the midst of itself, and not to resort to
heathen soothsayers. (On the fact itself, comp. [Deu
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#020.md). with [Exo
20:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#015)..md) "In the day of the
assembly," as in [Deu 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#010.md); [Deu
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#004.md). - The instructions as to their
behaviour towards the prophets are given by Moses ([Deu
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#019.md), [Deu
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020).md) in the name of the Lord, for
the purpose of enforcing obedience with all the greater emphasis.
Whoever did not hearken to the words of the prophet who spoke in the
name of the Lord, of him the Lord would require it, i.e., visit the
disobedience with punishment (cf. [Psa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004.md), [Psa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013).md). On the other hand, the prophet
who spoke in the name of the Lord what the Lord had not commanded him,
i.e., proclaimed the thoughts of his own heart as divine revelations
(cf. [Num 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#028).md), should die, like the
prophet who spoke in the name of other gods. With וּמת, the predicate is
introduced in the form of an apodosis.

[Deu 18:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#021.md)

The false prophet was to be discovered by the fact, that the word
proclaimed by him did not follow or come to pass, i.e., that his
prophecy was not fulfilled. Of him they were not to be afraid. By this
injunction the occurrence of what had been predicted is made the
criterion of true prophecy, and not signs and wonders, which false
prophets could also perform (cf. [Deu
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#002)..md).
