Devastation of Edom, and Restoration of the Land of Israel - Ezekiel
35:1-36:15

The two sections, [Eze 35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md) and
[Eze 36:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md), form a connected
prophecy. This is apparent not only from their formal arrangement, both
of them being placed together under the introductory formula, "And the
word of Jehovah came to me, saying," but also from their contents, the
promise in relation to the mountains of Israel being so opposed to the
threat against the mountains of Seir ([Eze
35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001).md) as to form the obverse and
completion of the latter; whilst allusion is evidently made to it in the
form of expression employed (compare [Eze
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#004.md), [Eze
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#006.md), with [Eze
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#008.md); and [Eze
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005.md) with [Eze
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015).md). The contents are the
following: The mountains of Seir shall be laid waste ([Eze
35:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001).md), because Edom cherishes
eternal enmity and bloody hatred towards Israel ([Eze
35:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005).md), and because it has coveted
the land of Israel and blasphemed Jehovah ([Eze
35:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010).md). On the other hand, the
mountain-land of Israel, which the heathen have despised on account of
its devastation, and have appropriated to themselves as booty ([Eze
36:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001).md), shall be inhabited by Israel
again, and shall be cultivated and no longer bear the disgrace of the
heathen ([Eze 35:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#008).md). This closing
thought ([Eze 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015).md) points back to
[Eze 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#029.md), and shows that our
prophecy is intended as a further expansion of that conclusion; and at
the same time, that in the devastation of Edom the overthrow of the
heathen world as a whole, with its enmity against God, is predicted, and
in the restoration of the land of Israel the re-erection of the fallen
kingdom of God.

[Ezekiel 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md)

The Devastation of Edom

[Eze 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#002.md). Son of
man, set thy face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, [Eze
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#003.md). And say to it, Thus saith the
Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with thee, Mount Seir, and will
stretch out my hand against thee, and make thee waste and devastation.
[Eze 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#004.md). Thy cities will I make into
ruins, and thou wilt become a waste, and shalt know that I am Jehovah.
[Eze 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md). Because thou cherishest
eternal enmity, and gavest up the sons of Israel to the sword at the
time of their distress, at the time of the final transgression, [Eze
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#006.md). Therefore, as truly as I live,
is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, I will make thee blood, and blood
shall pursue thee; since thou hast not hated blood, therefore blood
shall pursue thee. [Eze 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#007.md). I will
make Mount Seir devastation and waste, and cut off therefrom him that
goeth away and him that returneth, [Eze
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#008.md). And fill his mountains with his
slain; upon thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy low places,
those pierced with the sword shall fall. [Eze
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#009.md). I will make thee eternal wastes,
and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am
Jehovah. [Eze 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010.md). Because thou
sayest, The two nations and the two lands they shall be mine, and we
will take possession of it, when Jehovah was there; [Eze
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#011.md). Therefore, as truly as I live,
is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thy wrath and
thine envy, as thou hast done because of thy hatred, and will make
myself known among them, as I shall judge thee. [Eze
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#012.md). And thou shalt know that I,
Jehovah, have heard all thy reproaches which thou hast uttered against
the mountains of Israel, saying, "they are laid waste, they are given to
us for food." [Eze 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#013.md). Ye have
magnified against me with your mouth, and heaped up your sayings against
me; I have heard it. [Eze 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#014.md). Thus
saith the Lord Jehovah, When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will prepare
devastation for thee. [Eze 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015.md). As
thou hadst thy delight in the inheritance of the house of Israel,
because it was laid waste, so will I do to thee; thou shalt become a
waste, Mount Seir and all Edom together; and they shall know that I am
Jehovah.

The theme of this prophecy, viz., "Edom and its cities are to become a
desert" ([Eze 35:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#002).md), is vindicated
and earnestly elaborated in two strophes, commencing with 'יען וגו ([Eze
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md) and [Eze
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010).md), and closing, like the
announcement of the theme itself ([Eze
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#004)), with 'כּי אני (וידעוּ.md) וידעתּם,
by a distinct statement of the sins of Edom. - Already, in Ezekiel 25,
Edom has been named among the hostile border nations which are
threatened with destruction ([Eze
35:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#012).md). The earlier prophecy
applied to the Edomites, according to their historical relation to the
people of Israel and the kingdom of Judah. In the present word of God,
on the contrary, Edom comes into consideration, on the ground of its
hostile attitude towards the covenant people, as the representative of
the world and of mankind in its hostility to the people and kingdom of
God, as in Isa 34 and [Isa 63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md).
This is apparent from the fact that devastation is to be prepared for
Edom, when the whole earth rejoices ([Eze
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#014).md), which does not apply to Edom
as a small and solitary nation, and still more clearly from the
circumstance that, in the promise of salvation in Ezekiel 36, not all
Edom alone ([Eze 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005).md), but the
remnant of the heathen nations generally ([Eze
36:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003.md) and [Eze
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#015).md), are mentioned as the enemies
from whose disgrace and oppression Israel is to be delivered. For [Eze
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#002.md), compare [Eze
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md). הר is the name given to the
mountainous district inhabited by the Edomites, between the Dead Sea and
the Elanitic Gulf (see the comm. on [Gen
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#009).md). The prophecy is directed
against the land; but it also applies to the nation, which brings upon
itself the desolation of its land by its hostility to Israel. For [Eze
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#003.md), compare [Eze
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014.md), etc. חרבּה, destruction. The sin
of Edom mentioned in [Eze 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md) is
eternal enmity toward Israel, which has also been imputed to the
Philistines in [Eze 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015.md), but which
struck deeper root, in the case of Edom, in the hostile attitude of Esau
toward Jacob ([Gen 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#022.md). and [Gen
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#037).md), and was manifested, as Amos
([Amo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011).md) has already said, in the
constant retention of its malignity toward the covenant nation, so that
Edom embraced every opportunity to effect its destruction, and according
to the charge brought against it by Ezekiel, gave up the sons of Israel
to the sword when the kingdom of Judah fell. הנּיר על , lit., to pour
upon ( - into) the hands of the sword, i.e., to deliver up to the power
of the sword (cf. [Psa 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#011.md); [Jer
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021).md). בּעת recalls to mind בּיום
אידם in [Oba 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#013.md); but here it is more
precisely defined by בּעת עון , and limited to the time of the overthrow
of the Israelites, when Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by the
Chaldeans. בּעת עון קץ, as in [Eze
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#030.md). On account of this display of
its hostility, the Lord will make Edom blood ([Eze
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#006).md). This expression is probably
chosen for the play upon the words דּם and אדם. Edom shall become what
its name suggests. Making it blood does not mean merely filling it with
bloodshed, or reddening the soil with blood (Hitzig); but, as in [Eze
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#038.md), turning it as it were into
blood, or causing it to vanish therein. Blood shall pursue thee, "as
blood-guiltiness invariably pursues a murderer, cries for vengeance, and
so delivers him up to punishment" (Hvernick). אם לא cannot be the
particle employed in swearing, and dependent upon חי־אני, since this
particle introduces an affirmative declaration, which would be
unsuitable here, inasmuch as דּם in this connection cannot possibly
signify blood-relationship. אם לא means "if not," in which the
conditional meaning of אם coincides with the causal, "if" being
equivalent to "since." The unusual separation of the לא from the verb is
occasioned by the fact that דּם is placed before the verb to avoid
collision with ודּם. To hate blood is the same as to have a horror of
bloodshed or murder. This threat is carried out still further in [Eze
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#007.md) and [Eze
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#008.md). The land of Edom is to become a
complete and perpetual devastation; its inhabitants are to be
exterminated by war. The form שׁממה stands for שׁמּמה, and is not to be
changed into משׁמּה. Considering the frequency with which משׁמּה occurs,
the supposition that we have here a copyist's error is by no means a
probable one, and still less probable is the perpetuation of such an
error. עבר ושׁב, as in [Zac 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md). For
[Eze 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#008.md) compare [Eze
32:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#005.md) and [Eze
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md). The Chetib תּישׁבנה is scriptio
plena for תּשׁבנה, the imperfect Kal of ישׁב in the intransitive sense
to be inhabited. The Keri תּשׁבנה, from שׁוּב, is a needless and
unsuitable correction, since שׁוּב does not mean restitui.

In the second strophe, [Eze 35:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010.md),
the additional reason assigned for the desolation of Edom is its longing
for the possession of Israel and its land, of which it desired to take
forcible possession, although it knew that they belonged to Jehovah,
whereby the hatred of Edom toward Israel became contempt of Jehovah. The
two peoples and the two lands are Israel and Judah with their lands, and
therefore the whole of the holy people and land. את is the sign of the
accusative: as for the two peoples, they are mine. The suffix appended
to ירשׁנוּה is neuter, and is to be taken as referring generally to what
has gone before. ויהוה שׁם היה is a circumstantial clause, through which
the desire of Edom is placed in the right light, and characterized as an
attack upon Jehovah Himself. Jehovah was there - namely, in the land of
which Edom wished to take possession. Kliefoth's rendering, "and yet
Jehovah is there," is opposed to Hebrew usage, by changing the preterite
היה into a present; and the objection which he offers to the only
rendering that is grammatically admissible, viz., "when Jehovah was
there," to the effect "that it attributes to Ezekiel the thought that
the Holy Land had once been the land and dwelling-place of God, but was
so no longer," calls in question the actual historical condition of
things without the slightest reason. For Jehovah had really forsaken His
dwelling-place in Canaan before the destruction of the temple, but
without thereby renouncing His right to the land; since it was only for
the sins of Israel that He had given up the temple, city, and land to be
laid waste by the heathen. "But Edom had acted as if Israel existed
among the nations without God, and Jehovah had departed from it for
ever" (Hvernick); or rather as if Jehovah were a powerless and useless
Deity, who had not been able to defend His people against the might of
the heathen nations. The Lord will requite Edom for this, in a manner
answering to its anger and envy, which had both sprung from hatred.
נודעתּי בם, "I will make myself known among them (the Israelites) when I
judge thee;" i.e., by the fact that He punishes Edom for its sin, He
will prove to Israel that He is a God who does not suffer His people and
His possession to be attacked with impunity. From this shall Edom learn
that He is Jehovah, the omniscient God, who has heard the revilings of
His enemies ([Eze 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#012.md), [Eze
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#013).md), and the almighty God, who
rewards those who utter such proud sayings according to their deeds
([Eze 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#014.md) and [Eze
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015).md). נאצות has retained the Kametz
on account of the guttural in the first tone, in contrast with נאצות in
[Neh 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#018.md), [Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026) (cf. Ewald, 69b.md). - The
expression "mountains of Israel," for the land of Israel, in [Eze
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#012.md) and [Eze
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md), is occasioned by the antithesis
"mountain (mountain-range) of Seir." The Chetib hmmhs is to be
pronounced שׁממה, and to be retained in spite of the Keri. The singular
of the neuter gender is used with emphasis in a broken and emotional
address, and is to be taken as referring ad sensum to the land. הגדּיל
בּפה, to magnify or boast with the mouth, i.e., to utter proud sayings
against God, in other words, actually to deride God (compare הגדּיל פּה
in [Oba 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012.md), which has a kindred
meaning). העתיר, used here according to Aramean usage for העשׁיר, to
multiply, or heap up. In כּשׂמה, in [Eze
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#014.md), כּ is a particle of time, as it
frequently is before infinitives (e.g., [Jos
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#020).md), when all the earth rejoices,
not "over thy desolation" (Hitzig), which does not yield any rational
thought, but when joy is prepared for all the world, I will prepare
devastation for thee. Through this antithesis כּל־הארץ is limited to the
world, with the exception of Edom, i.e., to that portion of the human
race which stood in a different relation to God and His people from that
of Edom; in other words, which acknowledged the Lord as the true God. It
follows from this, that Edom represents the world at enmity against God.
In כּשׂמחתך ([Eze 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015).md) כ is a
particle of comparison; and the meaning of [Eze
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015.md) is: as thou didst rejoice over
the desolation of the inheritance of the house of Israel, so will I
cause others to rejoice over thy desolation. In [Eze
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015.md) we agree with the lxx, Vulgate,
Syriac, and others, in taking תּהיה as the second person, not as the
third. כּל־אדום כּלּהּ serves to strengthen הר־שׂעיר (compare [Eze
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#015.md) and [Eze
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#010).md).
