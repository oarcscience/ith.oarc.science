Prayer for Jahve's Vine

With the words We are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture, [Psa
79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md) closes; and Psalms 80 begins
with a cry to the Shepherd of Israel. Concerning the inscription of the
Psalm: To be practised after the "Lilies, the testimony...," by Asaph, a
Psalm, vid., on [Psa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md), supra, p.
45f. The lxx renders, εἰς τὸ τέλος (unto the end), ὑπὲρ τῶν
ἀλλοιωθησομένων (which is unintelligible and ungrammatical =
אל־שׁשּׂנים), μαρτύριον τῷ Ἀσάφ (as the accentuation also unites these
words closely by Tarcha), ψαλμός ὑπὲρ τοῦ Ἀσσυρίου (cf. [Psa
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001).md), perhaps a translation of
אל־אשׁור, an inscribed note which took the "boar out of the forest" as
an emblem of Assyria. This hint is important. It solves the riddle why
Joseph represents all Israel in [Psa
80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002.md), and why the tribes of Joseph in
particular are mentioned in [Psa 80:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#003.md),
and why in the midst of these Benjamin, whom like descent from Rachel
and chagrin, never entirely overcome, on account of the loss of the
kingship drew towards the brother-tribes of Joseph. Moreover the tribe
of Benjamin had only partially remained to the house of David since the
division of the kingdom,

(Note: It is true we read that Benjamin stood on the side of Rehoboam
with Judah after the division of the kingdom ([Kg1
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021).md), Judah and Benjamin appear as
parts of the kingdom of Judah ([Ch2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#003.md), [Ch2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023.md); [Ch2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008)., and frequently.md); but if,
according to [Kg1 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#013.md), [Kg1
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#032.md), [Kg1
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036.md), only שׁבט אחד remains to the
house of David, this is Judah, inasmuch as Benjamin did not remain
entirely under the Davidic sceptre, and Simeon is to be left out of
account (cf. Genesis, S. 603); the Benjamitish cities of Bethel, Gilgal,
and Jericho belonged to the northern kingdom, but, as in the case of
Rama ([Kg1 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021)..md), not without being
contested (cf. e.g., [Ch2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019).md); the
boundaries were therefore fluctuating, vid., Ewald, Geschichte des
Volkes Israel (3rd ed.), S. 439-441.)

so that this triad is to be regarded as an expansion of the "Joseph" (v.
20. After the northern kingdom had exhausted its resources in endless
feuds with Damascene Syria, it succumbed to the world-wide dominion of
Assyria in the sixth year of Hezekiah, in consequence of the heavy
visitations which are closely associated with the names of the Assyrian
kings Pul, Tiglath-pileser, and Shalmaneser. The psalmist, as it seems,
prays in a time in which the oppression of Assyria rested heavily upon
the kingdom of Ephraim, and Judah saw itself threatened with ruin when
this bulwark should have fallen. We must not, however, let it pass
without notice that our Psalm has this designation of the nation
according to the tribes of Joseph in common with other pre-exilic Psalms
of Asaph ([Psa 77:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016.md); [Psa
78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009.md); [Psa
81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006).md). It is a characteristic
belonging in common to this whole group of Psalms. Was Asaph, the
founder of this circle of songs, a native, perhaps, of one of the Levite
cities of the province of the tribe of Ephraim or Manasseh?

The Psalm consists of five eight-line strophes, of which the first,
second, and fifth close with the refrain, "Elohim, restore us, let Thy
countenance shine forth, then shall we be helped!" This prayer grows in
earnestness. The refrain begins the first time with Elohim, the second
time with Elohim Tsebaôth, and the third time with a threefold Jahve
Elohim Tsebaôth, with which the second strophe ([Psa
80:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#005).md) also opens.

[Psalms 80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 80:1</span></span>

The first strophe contains nothing but petition. First of all the nation
is called Israel as springing from Jacob; then, as in [Psa
81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006.md), Joseph, which, where it is
distinct from Jacob or Judah, is the name of the kingdom of the ten
tribes (vid., Caspari on [Oba 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018).md),
or at least of the northern tribes ([Psa
77:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016.md); [Psa
78:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067)..md). [Psa
80:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#003.md) shows that it is also these that
are pre-eminently intended here. The fact that in the blessing of
Joseph, Jacob calls God a Shepherd (רעה), [Gen
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015.md); [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md), perhaps has somewhat to do with
the choice of the first two names. In the third, the sitting enthroned
in the sanctuary here below and in the heaven above blend together; for
the Old Testament is conscious of a mutual relationship between the
earthly and the heavenly temple (היכל) until the one merges entirely in
the other. The cher׫bim, which God enthrones, i.e., upon which He sits
enthroned, are the bearers of the chariot (מרכבה) of the Ruler of the
world (vid., [Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011).md). With הופיעה
(from יפע, Arab. yf‛, eminere, emicare, as in the Asaph [Psa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002).md) the poet prays that He would
appear in His splendour of light, i.e., in His fiery bright, judging,
and rescuing doxa, whether as directly visible, or even as only
recognisable by its operation. Both the comparison, "after the manner of
a flock" and the verb נהג are Asaphic, [Psa
78:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#052.md), cf. [Psa
26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md). Just so also the names given
to the nation. The designation of Israel after the tribes of Ephraim and
Manasseh attaches itself to the name Joseph; and the two take the
brother after the flesh into their midst, of whom the beloved Rachel was
the mother as well as of Joseph, the father of Ephraim and Manasseh. In
Num. 2 also, these three are not separated, but have their camp on the
west side of the Tabernacle. May God again put into activity - which is
the meaning of עורר (excitare) in distinction from חעיר (expergefacere)
- His גבורה, the need for the energetic intervention of which now makes
itself felt, before these three tribes, i.e., by becoming their
victorious leader. לכה is a summoning imperative.

(Note: Not a pronoun: to Thee it belongs to be for salvation for us, as
the Talmud, Midrash, and Masora (vid., Norzi) take it; wherefore in J.
Succa 54c it is straightway written לך. Such a לכה = לך is called in the
language of the Masora, and even in the Midrash (Exod. Rabba, fol. 121),
לכה ודאית (vid., Buxtorf, Tiberias, p. 245).)

Concerning ישׁעתה vid., on [Psa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md);
the construction with Lamed says as little against the accusative
adverbial rendering of the ah set forth there as does the Beth of
בּחרשׁה (in the wood) in [Sa1 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#015.md),
vid., Bttcher's Neue Aehrenlese, Nos. 221, 384, 449. It is not a
bringing back out of the Exile that is prayed for by השׁתבנוּ, for,
according to the whole impression conveyed by the Psalm, the people are
still on the soil of their fatherland; but in their present feebleness
they are no longer like themselves, they stand in need of divine
intervention in order again to attain a condition that is in harmony
with the promises, in order to become themselves again. May God then
cause His long hidden countenance to brighten and shine upon them, then
shall they be helped as they desire (ונוּשׁעה).

[Psalms 80:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 80:4</span></span>

In the second strophe there issues forth bitter complaint concerning the
form of wrath which the present assumes, and, thus confirmed, the
petition rises anew. The transferring of the smoking (עשׁן) of God's
nostrils = the hard breathing of anger ([Psa
74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md), [Deu
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#019).md), to God Himself is bold, but in
keeping with the spirit of the Biblical view of the wrath of God (vid.,
on [Psa 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009).md), so that there is no
need to avoid the expression by calling in the aid of the Syriac word
עשׁן, to be strong, powerful (why art Thou hard, why dost Thou harden
Thyself...). The perfect after עד־מתי has the sense of a present with a
retrospective glance, as in [Exo 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#003.md),
cf. עד־אנה, to be understood after the analogy of חרה בּ (to kindle = to
be angry against any one), for the prayer of the people is not an object
of wrath, but only not a means of turning it aside. While the prayer is
being presented, God veils Himself in the smoke of wrath, through which
it is not able to penetrate. The lxx translators have read בתפלת עבדיך,
for they render ἐπὶ τὴν προσευχήν τῶν δούλων σου (for which the common
reading is τοῦ δούλου σου). Bread of tears is, according to [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md), bread consisting of tears;
tears, running down in streams upon the lips of the praying and fasting
one, are his meat and his drink. השׁקה with an accusative signifies to
give something to drink, and followed by Beth, to give to drink by means
of something, but it is not to be translated: potitandum das eis cum
lacrymis trientem (De Dieu, von Ortenberg, and Hitzig). שׁלישׁ
(Talmudic, a third part) is the accusative of more precise definition
(Vatablus, Gesenius, Olshausen, and Hupfeld): by thirds (lxx ἐν μέτρῳ,
Symmachus μέτρῳ); for a third of an ephah is certainly a very small
measure for the dust of the earth ([Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012).md), but a large one for tears. The
neighbours are the neighbouring nations, to whom Israel is become מדון,
an object, a butt of contention. In למו is expressed the pleasure which
the mocking gives them.

[Psalms 80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 80:8</span></span>

The complaint now assumes a detailing character in this strophe,
inasmuch as it contrasts the former days with the present; and the ever
more and more importunate prayer moulds itself in accordance therewith.
The retrospective description begins, as is rarely the case, with the
second modus, inasmuch as "the speaker thinks more of the bare nature of
the act than of the time" (Ew. 136, b). As in the blessing of Jacob
([Gen 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022).md) Joseph is compared to the
layer (בּן) of a fruitful growth (פּרת), whose shoots (בּנות) climb over
the wall: so here Israel is compared to a vine ([Gen
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022.md); גּפן פּריּח, [Psa
128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003).md), which has become great in
Egypt and been transplanted thence into the Land of Promise. הסּיע, lxx
μεταίρειν, as in [Job 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#010.md), perhaps
with an allusion to the מסעים of the people journeying to Canaan ([Psa
78:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#052).md).

(Note: Exod. Rabba, ch. 44, with reference to this passage, says: "When
husbandmen seek to improve a vine, what do they do? They root (עוקרין)
it out of its place and plant (שׁותלין) it in another." And Levit.
Rabba, ch. 36, says: "As one does not plant a vine in a place where
there are great, rough stones, but examines the ground and then plants
it, so didst Thou drive out peoples and didst plant it," etc.)

Here God made His vine a way and a place (פּנּהּ, to clear, from פּנה,
to turn, turn aside, Arabic fanija, to disappear, pass away; root פן, to
urge forward), and after He had secured to it a free soil and unchecked
possibility of extension, it (the vine) rooted its roots, i.e., struck
them ever deeper and wider, and filled the earth round about (cf. the
antitype in the final days, [Isa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006).md). The Israelitish kingdom of God
extended itself on every side in accordance with the promise. תּשׁלּח
(cf. [Eze 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006.md), and vegetable שׁלח, a
shoot) also has the vine as its subject, like תּשׁרשׁ. [Psa
80:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#011.md) state this in a continued
allegory, by the "mountains" pointing to the southern boundary, by the
"cedars" to the northern, by the "sea" to the western, and by the
"river" (Euphrates) to the eastern boundary of the country (vid., [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024) and other passages.md). צלּהּ and
ענפיה are accusatives of the so-called more remote object (Ges. 143, 1).
קציר is a cutting = a branch; יונקת, a (vegetable) sucker = a young,
tender shoot; ארזי־אל, the cedars of Lebanon as being living monuments
of the creative might of God. The allegory exceeds the measure of the
reality of nature, inasmuch as this is obliged to be extended according
to the reality of that which is typified and historical. But how unlike
to the former times is the present! The poet asks "wherefore?" for the
present state of things is a riddle to him. The surroundings of the vine
are torn down; all who come in contact with it pluck it (ארה, to pick
off, pluck off, Talmudic of the gathering of figs); the boar out of the
wood (מיער with עין תלויה, Ajin)

(Note: According to Kiddushin, 30a, because this Ajin is the middle
letter of the Psalter as the Waw of גחון, [Lev
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#042.md), is the middle letter of the
Tra. One would hardly like to be at the pains of proving the correctness
of this statement; nevertheless in the seventeenth century there lived
one Laymarius, a clergyman, who was not afraid of this trouble, and
found the calculations of the Masora (e.g., that אדני ה occurs 222
times) in part inaccurate; vid., Monatliche Unterredungen, 1691, S. 467,
and besides, Geiger, Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel, S. 258f.))

cuts it off (כּרסם, formed out of כּסם = גּזם

(Note: Saadia appropriately renders it Arab. yqrḍhâ, by referring, as
does Dunash also, to the Talmudic קרסם, which occurs of ants, like Arab.
qrḍ, of rodents. So Peah ii. 7, Menachoth 71b, on which Rashi observes,
"the locust (חגב) is accustomed to eat from above, the ant tears off the
corn-stalk from below." Elsewhere קירסם denotes the breaking off of dry
branches from the tree, as זרד the removal of green branches.))

viz., with its tusks; and that which moves about the fields (vid.,
concerning זיז, [Psa 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#011).md), i.e., the
untractable, lively wild beast, devours it. Without doubt the poet
associates a distinct nation with the wild boar in his mind; for animals
are also in other instances the emblems of nations, as e.g., the
leviathan, the water-serpent, the behemoth ([Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006).md), and flies ([Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018).md) are emblems of Egypt. The
Midrash interprets it of Ser-Edom, and זיז שׂדי, according to [Gen
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012.md), of the nomadic Arabs.

In [Psa 80:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#015.md) the prayer begins for
the third time with threefold urgency, supplicating for the vine renewed
divine providence, and a renewal of the care of divine grace. We have
divided the verse differently from the accentuation, since שׁוּב־נא הבּט
is to be understood according to Ges. 142. The junction by means of ו is
at once opposed to the supposition that וכּנּה in [Psa
80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md) signifies a slip or plant,
plantam (Targum, Syriac, Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, and others), and that
consequently the whole of [Psa 80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md)
is governed by וּפקד. Nor can it mean its (the vine's) stand or base,
כּן (Bttcher), since one does not plant a "stand." The lxx renders וכנה:
καὶ κατάρτισαι, which is imper. aor. 1. med., therefore in the sense of
כּוננה.

(Note: Perhaps the Caph majusculum is the result of an erasure that
required to be made, vid., Geiger, Urschrift, S. 295. Accordingly the
Ajin suspensum might also be the result of a later inserted correction,
for there is a Phoenician inscription that has יר (wood, forest); vid.,
Levy, Phnizisches Wrterbuch, S. 22.)

But the alternation of על (cf. [Pro
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#011), and Arab. jn ‛lâ, to cover over.md)
with the accusative of the object makes it more natural to derive כנה,
not from כּנן = כּוּן, but from כּנן Arab. kanna = גּנן, to cover,
conceal, protect (whence Arab. kinn, a covering, shelter, hiding-place):
and protect him whom...or: protect what Thy right hand has planted. The
pointing certainly seems to take כנה as the feminine of כּן (lxx, [Dan
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007), φυτόν.md); for an imperat. paragog.
Kal of the form כּנּה does not occur elsewhere, although it might have
been regarded by the punctuists as possible from the form גּל, volve,
[Psa 119:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#022.md). If it is regarded as
impossible, then one might read כנּה. At any rate the word is
imperative, as the following אשׁר, eum quem, also shows, instead of
which, if כנה were a substantive, one would expect to find a relative
clause without אשׁר, as in [Psa 80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md).
Moreover [Psa 80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md) requires this,
since פּקד על can only be used of visiting with punishment. And who then
would the slip (branch) and the son of man be in distinction from the
vine? If we take בנה as imperative, then, as one might expect, the vine
and the son of man are both the people of God. The Targum renders [Psa
80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md) thus: "and upon the King
Messiah, whom Thou hast established for Thyself," after [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md) and [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md); but, as in the latter passage,
it is not the Christ Himself, but the nation out of which He is to
proceed, that is meant. אמּץ has the sense of firm appropriation, as in
[Isa 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#014.md), inasmuch as the notion of
making fast passes over into that of laying firm hold of, of seizure.
Rosenmller well renders it: quem adoptatum tot nexibus tibi
adstrinxisti.

The figure of the vine, which rules all the language here, is also still
continued in [Psa 80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md); for the
partt. fem. refer to גּפן ot refer, - the verb, however, may take the
plural form, because those of Israel are this "vine," which combusta
igne, succisa (as in [Isa 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#012.md);
Aramaic, be cut off, tear off, in [Psa
80:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#013.md) the Targum word for ארה; Arabic,
ksḥ, to clear away, peel off), is just perishing, or hangs in danger of
destruction (יאבדוּ) before the threatening of the wrathful countenance
of God. The absence of anything to denote the subject, and the form of
expression, which still keeps within the circle of the figure of the
vine, forbid us to understand this [Psa
80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md) of the extirpation of the foes.
According to the sense תּהי־ידך על

(Note: The תהי has Gaja, like שׂאו־זמרה ([Psa
81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003).md), בני־נכר ([Psa
144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007).md), and the like. This Gaja beside
the Sheb (instead of beside the following vowel) belongs to the
peculiarities of the metrical books, which in general, on account of
their more melodious mode of delivery, have many such a Gaja beside
Sheb, which does not occur in the prose books. Thus, e.g., יהוה and
אלהים always have Gaja beside the Sheb when they have Rebia magnum
without a conjunctive, probably because Rebia and Dech had such a
fulness of tone that a first stroke fell even upon the Sheb-letters.)

coincides with the supplicatory כנה על. It is Israel that is called בּן
in [Psa 80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md), as being the son whom
Jahve has called into being in Egypt, and then called out of Egypt to
Himself and solemnly declared to be His son on Sinai ([Exo
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md), and who is now, with a play
upon the name of Benjamin in [Psa 80:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#003.md)
(cf. [Psa 80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016).md), called אישׁ ימינך,
as being the people which Jahve has preferred before others, and has
placed at His right hand

(Note: Pinsker punctuates thus: Let Thy hand be upon the man, Thy right
hand upon the son of man, whom, etc.; but the impression that ימינך and
אמצתה לך coincide is so strong, that no one of the old interpreters
(from the lxx and Targum onwards) has been able to free himself from
it.)

for the carrying out of His work of salvation; who is called, however,
at the same time בּן־אדם, because belonging to a humanity that is feeble
in itself, and thoroughly conditioned and dependent. It is not the more
precise designation of the "son of man" that is carried forward by
ולא־נסוג, "and who has not drawn back from Thee" (Hupfeld, Hitzig, and
others), but it is, as the same relation which is repeated in [Psa
80:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#019.md) shows, the apodosis of the
preceding petition: then shall we never depart from Thee; נסוג being not
a participle, as in [Psa 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md), but a
plene written voluntative: recedamus, vowing new obedience as
thanksgiving of the divine preservation. To the prayer in [Psa
80:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#018.md) corresponds, then, the prayer
תּחיּנוּ, which is expressed as future (which can rarely be avoided, Ew.
229), with a vow of thanksgiving likewise following: then will we call
with Thy name, i.e., make it the medium and matter of solemn
proclamation. In v. 20 the refrain of this Psalm, which is laid out as a
trilogy, is repeated for the third time. The name of God is here
threefold.
