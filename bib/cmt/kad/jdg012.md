### [Judges Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001)

[Judges 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 12:5</span></span>

When the Gileadites had beaten the Ephraimites, they took the fords of
the Jordan before the Ephraimites (or towards Ephraim: see [Jdg
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#028); [Jdg
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#024)), to cut off their retreat and
prevent their return to their homes. And "when fugitives of Ephraim
wanted to cross, the men of Gilead asked them, Art thou Ephrathi," i.e.,
an Ephraimite? And if he said no, they made him pronounce the word
Shibboleth (a stream or flood, as in [Psa
69:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003), [Psa
69:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#016); not an ear of corn, which is
quite unsuitable here); "and if he said, Sibboleth, not taking care to
pronounce it correctly, they laid hold of him and put him to death at
the fords of the Jordan." In this manner there fell at that time, i.e.,
during the whole war, 42,000 Ephraimites. The "fugitives of Ephraim"
were the Ephraimites who had escaped from the battle and wished to
return home. The expression is used here in its ordinary sense, and not
with the contemptuous sense in which the Ephraimites had used it in [Jdg
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004). From this history we learn quite
casually that the Ephraimites generally pronounced sh (shin) like s
(samech). הכין is used elliptically for לב הכין, to direct his heart to
anything, pay heed (compare [Sa1
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#022); [Ch1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002), with [Ch2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#014); [Ch2
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#019)).

[Judges 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 12:7</span></span>

Jephthah judged Israel six years, though most probably only the tribes
on the east of the Jordan. When he died, he was buried in one of the
towns of Gilead. The plural גלעד בּערי is used quite indefinitely, as in
[Gen 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#012); [Neh
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#002), etc. (see Ges. Lehrgeb. p. 665),
simply because the historian did not know the exact town.

[Judges 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 12:8</span></span>

Of these three judges no particular deeds are related, just as in the
case of Tola and Jair (see the remarks on [Jdg
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001)). But it certainly follows from
the expression אחריו ויּשׁפּט ([Jdg
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008), [Jdg
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#011), [Jdg
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#013)) that they were one after
another successors of Jephthah, and therefore that their office of judge
also extended simply over the tribes on the east of the Jordan, and
perhaps the northern tribes on this side.

[Jdg 12:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008)

Ibzan sprang from Bethlehem,-hardly, however, the town of that name in
the tribe of Judah, as Josephus affirms (Ant. v. 7, 13), for that is
generally distinguished either as Bethlehem "of Judah" ([Jdg
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#007), [Jdg
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#009); [Rut
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#002); [Sa1
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012)), or Bethlehem Ephratah ([Mic
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001)), but probably Bethlehem in the
tribe of Zebulun ([Jos 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#015)). He had
thirty sons and thirty daughters, the latter of whom he sent away החוּצה
(out of his house), i.e., gave them in marriage, and brought home thirty
women in their places from abroad as wives for his sons. He judged
Israel seven years, and was buried in Bethlehem.

[Jdg 12:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#011)

His successor was Elon the Zebulunite, who died after filling the office
of judge for ten years, and was buried at Aijalon, in the land of
Zebulun. This Aijalon has probably been preserved in the ruins of Jaln,
about four hours' journey to the east of Akka, and half an hour to the
S.S.W. of Mejdel Kerun (see V. de Velde, Mem. p. 283).

[Jdg 12:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#013)

He was followed by the judge Abdon, the son of Hillel of Pirathon. This
place, where Abdon died and was buried after holding the office of judge
for eight years, was in the land of Ephraim, on the mountains of the
Amalekites ([Jdg 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#015)). It is
mentioned in [Sa2 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#030) and [Ch1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#031) as the home of Benaiah the hero;
it is the same as Φαραθώ (read Φαραθόν) in 1 Macc. 9:50, and Joseph.
Ant. xiii. 1, 3, and has been preserved in the village of Ferta, about
two hours and a half to the S.S.W. of Nabulus (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p.
134, and V. de Velde, Mem. p. 340). On the riding of his sons and
daughters upon asses, see at [Jdg
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004).

[Judges 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 12:1</span></span>

Jephthah's War with the Ephraimites, and Office of Judge. - [Jdg
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001). The jealousy of the tribe of
Ephraim, which was striving after the leadership, had already shown
itself in the time of Gideon in such a way that nothing but the
moderation of that judge averted open hostilities. And now that the
tribes on the east of the Jordan had conquered the Ammonites under the
command of Jephthah without the co-operation of the Ephraimites, Ephraim
thought it necessary to assert its claim to take the lead in Israel in a
very forcible manner. The Ephraimites gathered themselves together, and
went over צפונה. This is generally regarded as an appellative noun
(northward); but in all probability it is a proper name, "to Zaphon,"
the city of the Gadites in the Jordan valley, which is mentioned in [Jos
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027) along with Succoth, that is to
say, according to a statement of the Gemara, though of a very uncertain
character no doubt, Ἀμαθοῦς (Joseph. Ant. xiii. 13, 5, xiv. 5, 4; Bell.
Judg. i. 4, 2, Reland, Pal. pp. 308 and 559-60), the modern ruins of
Amata on the Wady Rajb or Ajlun, the situation of which would suit this
passage very well. They then threatened Jephthah, because he had made
war upon the Ammonites without them, and said, "We will burn thy house
over thee with fire." Their arrogance and threat Jephthah opposed most
energetically. He replied ([Jdg 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#002),
[Jdg 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003)), "A man of strife have I
been, I and my people on the one hand, and the children of Ammon on the
other, very greatly," i.e., I and my people had a severe conflict with
the Ammonites. "Then I called you, but ye did not deliver me out of
their hand; and when I saw that thou (Ephraim) didst not help me, I put
my life in my hand" (i.e., I risked my own life: see [Sa1
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#005); [Sa1
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#021); [Job
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014). The Kethibh אישׂמה comes from
ישׂם: cf. [Gen 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#033)), "and I went
against the Ammonites, and Jehovah gave them into my hand." Jephthah's
appeal to the Ephraimites to fight against the Ammonites it not
mentioned in Judg 11, probably for no other reason than because it was
without effect. The Ephraimites, however, had very likely refused their
co-operation simply because the Gileadites had appointed Jephthah as
commander without consulting them. Consequently the Ephraimites had no
ground whatever for rising up against Jephthah and the Gileadites in
this haughty and hostile manner; and Jephthah had a perfect right not
only to ask them, "Wherefore are ye come up against me now (lit. 'this
day'), to fight against me?" but to resist such conduct with the sword.

[Judges 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 12:4</span></span>

He therefore gathered together all the men (men of war) of Gilead and
smote the Ephraimites, because they had said, "Ye Gileadites are
fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh." The meaning
of these obscure words is probably the following: Ye Gileadites are a
mob gathered together from Ephraimites that have run away; "ye are an
obscure set of men, men of no name, dwelling in the midst of two most
noble and illustrious tribes" (Rosenmller). This contemptuous speech did
not apply to the tribes of Reuben and Gad as such, but simply to the
warriors whom Jephthah had gathered together out of Gilead. For the
words are not to be rendered erepti Ephraim, "the rescued of Ephraim,"
as they are by Seb. Schmidt and Stud., or to be understood as referring
to the fact that the Gileadites had found refuge with the Ephraimites
during the eighteen years of oppression on the part of the Ammonites,
since such an explanation is at variance with the use of the word פּליט,
which simply denotes a fugitive who has escaped from danger, and not one
who has sought and found protection with another. The Ephraimites had to
pay for this insult offered to their brethren by a terrible defeat.
