### [Jeremiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 37:1</span></span>

The account of what befell Jeremiah and what he did during the last
siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, until the taking of the city, is
introduced, [Jer 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md) and [Jer
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#002.md), with the general remark that
Zedekiah - whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had made king in the
land of Judah in place of Coniah (on which name see on [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024).md) - when he became king, did not
listen to the words of the Lord through Jeremiah, neither himself, nor
his servants (officers), nor the people of the land (the population of
Judah). Then follows, [Jer 37:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md), a
declaration of the prophet regarding the issue of the siege, which he
sent to the king by the messengers who were to beseech him for his
intercession with the Lord. [Jer
37:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md). The occasion of this
declaration was the following: Zedekiah sent to Jeremiah two of his
chief officers, Jehucal the son of Shelemiah (see on [Jer
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001).md), and Zephaniah the son of
Maaseiah, the priest (see [Jer 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md)
and [Jer 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025).md), with this charge:
"Pray now for us to Jahveh our God." This message was sent to Jeremiah
while he still went in and out among the people, and had not yet been
put in prison (כּליא, [Jer 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#004.md) and
[Jer 52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031.md), an unusual form for כּלא,
[Jer 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015.md) and [Jer
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#018.md), for which the Qeri would have
us in both instances read כּלוּא); the army of Pharaoh (Hophra, [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030).md), too, had marched out of Egypt
to oppose the Chaldeans; and the latter, when they heard the report of
them (שׁמעם, the news of their approach), had withdrawn from Jerusalem
(עלה מעל, see on [Jer 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002).md), viz., in
order to repulse the Egyptians. Both of these circumstances are
mentioned for the purpose of giving a clear view of the state of things:
(a) Jeremiah's freedom to go in and out, not to prepare us for his
imprisonment afterwards, but to explain the reason why the king sent two
chief officers of the realm to him, whereas, after his imprisonment, he
caused him to be brought (cf. [Jer
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#017.md) with [Jer
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014)); and (b.md) the approach of the
Egyptians joined with the raising of the siege, because this event
seemed to afford some hope that the city would be saved. - This
occurrence, consequently, falls within a later period than that
mentioned in [Jer 21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md).

[Jeremiah 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 37:6</span></span>

Then came the word of the Lord to this effect: [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md). "Thus saith Jahveh, the God of
Israel: Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah who hath sent you to me
to ask at me, Behold, the army of Pharaoh, which marched out to your
help, will return to Egypt, their own land. [Jer
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#008.md). And the Chaldeans shall return
and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire. [Jer
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#009.md). Thus saith Jahveh: Do not
deceive yourselves by thinking, The Chaldeans will quite withdraw from
us; for they will not withdraw. [Jer
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#010.md). For, even though he had beaten
the whole army of the Chaldeans who are fighting with you, and there
remained of them only some who had been pierced through and through, yet
they would rise up, every man in his tent, and burn this city with
fire." In order to cut off every hope, the prophet announces that the
Egyptians will bring no help, but withdraw to their own land before the
Chaldeans who went out to meet them, without having accomplished their
object; but then the Chaldeans will return, continue the siege, take the
city and burn it. To assure them of this, he adds: "Ye must not deceive
yourselves with the vain hope that the Chaldeans may possibly be
defeated and driven back by the Egyptians. The destruction of Jerusalem
is so certain that, even supposing you were actually to defeat and
repulse the Chaldeans, and only some few grievously wounded ones
remained in the tents, these would rise up and burn the city." In הלוך
ילכוּ the inf. abs. is to be observed, as strengthening the idea
contained in the verb: "to depart wholly or completely;" הלך is here to
"depart, withdraw." אנשׁים in contrast with חיל are separate
individuals. מדקּר, pierced through by sword or lance, i.e., grievously,
mortally wounded.

[Jeremiah 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 37:11</span></span>

The imprisonment of Jeremiah. - During the time when the Chaldeans, on
account of the advancing army of pharaoh, had withdrawn from Jerusalem
and raised the siege, "Jeremiah went out of the city to go to the land
of Benjamin, in order to bring thence his portion among the people."
והיה, in accordance with later usage, for ויהי, as in [Jer
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009.md); cf. Ewald, 345, b. לחלק is
explained in various ways. לחלק for להחליק can scarcely have any other
meaning than to share, receive a share; and in connection with משּׁם,
"to receive a portion thence," not, to receive an inheritance (Syr.,
Chald., Vulg.), for משּׁם does not suit this meaning. The lxx render τοῦ
ἀγοράσαι ἐκεῖθεν, which Theodoret explains by πρίασθαι ἄρτους. All other
explanations have still less in their favour. We must connect בּתוך העם
with 'ללכת וגו, since it is unsuitable for לחלק משּׁם.

[Jeremiah 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 37:13</span></span>

When he was entering the gate of Benjamin, where Jeriah the son of
Shelemiah kept watch, the latter seized him, saying, "Thou desirest to
go over to the Chaldeans" (נפל אל־, see on [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009).md). The gate of Benjamin ([Jer
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#007.md); [Jer
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#010).md) was the north gate of the city,
through which ran the road to Benjamin and Ephraim; hence it was also
called the gate of Ephraim, [Kg2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md); [Neh
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#016.md). בּעל, "holder of the oversight,"
he who kept the watch, or commander of the watch at the gate. "The
accusation was founded on the well-known views and opinions of Jeremiah
([Jer 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009).md); but it was mere
sophistry, for the simple reason that the Chaldeans were no longer lying
before the city" (Hitzig).

[Jeremiah 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 37:14</span></span>

Jeremiah replied: "A lie \[= not true; cf. [Kg2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#012.md)\]; I am not going over to the
Chaldeans. But he gave no heed to him; so Jeriah seized Jeremiah, and
brought him to the princes. [Jer
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015.md). And the princes were angry
against Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison, in the house of
Jonathan the scribe; for they had made it the prison," - probably
because it contained apartments suitable for the purpose. From [Jer
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md) we perceive that they were
subterranean prisons and vaults into which the prisoners were thrust;
and from v. 28 and [Jer 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#026.md), it is
clear that Jeremiah was in a confinement much more severe and dangerous
to his life. There he sat many days, i.e., a pretty long time.

[Jeremiah 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 37:16</span></span>

Examination of the prophet by the king, and alleviation of his
confinement. - [Jer 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md). "When
Jeremiah had got into the dungeon and into the vaults, and had sat there
many days, then Zedekiah the king sent and fetched him, and questioned
him in his own house (palace) secretly," etc. [Jer
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md) is by most interpreters joined
with the foregoing, but the words כּי בּא do not properly permit of
this. For if we take the verse as a further confirmation of ויּקצפוּ
השׂרים, "the princes vented their wrath on Jeremiah, beat him," etc.,
"for Jeremiah came...," then it must be acknowledged that the account
would be very long and lumbering. כּי בּא is too widely separated from
יקצפוּ. But the passages, [Sa1 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021.md),
where כּי פּקד is supposed to stand for ויּפקד, and [Isa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md), where ויּשׁמע is thought to have
arisen out of כּי, [Kg2 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md), are not
very strong proofs, since there, as here, no error in writing is marked.
The Vulgate has itaque ingressus; many therefore would change כּי into
כּן; but this also is quite arbitrary. Accordingly, with Rosenmller, we
connect [Jer 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md) with the following,
and take כּי as a temporal particle; in this, the most we miss is ו
copulative, or ויהי. In the preceding sentence the prison of the prophet
is somewhat minutely described, in order to prepare us for the request
that follows in [Jer 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#020.md). Jeremiah
was in a בּית־בּור, "house of a pit," cf. [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md), i.e., a subterranean prison,
and in החניּות. This word only occurs here; but in the kindred dialects
it means vaults, stalls, shops; hence it possibly signifies here
subterranean prison-cells, so that אל־החניּות more exactly determines
what בּית־הבּור is. This meaning of the word is, at any rate, more
certain than that given by Eb. Scheid in Rosenmller, who renders חניות
by flexa, curvata; then, supplying ligna, he thinks of the stocks to
which the prisoners were fastened. - The king questioned him בּסּתר, "in
secret," namely, through fear of his ministers and court-officers, who
were prejudiced against the prophet, perhaps also in the hope of
receiving in a private interview a message from God of more favourable
import. To the question of the king, "Is there any word from Jahveh?"
Jeremiah replies in the affirmative; but the word of God is this, "Thou
shalt be given into the hand of the king of Babylon," just as Jeremiah
had previously announced to him; cf. [Jer
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#004.md); [Jer
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003.md). - Jeremiah took this opportunity
of complaining about his imprisonment, saying, [Jer
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#018.md), "In what have I sinned against
thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put
me in prison? [Jer 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#019.md). And where
are your prophets, who prophesied to you, The king of Babylon shall not
come against you, nor against this land?" Jeremiah appeals to his
perfect innocence ([Jer 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#018).md), and to
the confirmation of his prediction by its event. The interview with the
king took place when the Chaldeans, after driving the Egyptians out of
the country, had recommenced the siege of Jerusalem, and, as is evident
from [Jer 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021.md), were pressing the
city very hard. The Kethib איו is to be read איּו, formed from איּה with
the suffix וׁ; the idea of the suffix has gradually become obscured, so
that it stands here before a noun in the plural. The Qeri requires איּה.
The question, Where are your prophets? means, Let these prophets come
forward and vindicate their lying prophecies. Not what these men had
prophesied, but what Jeremiah had declared had come to pass; his
imprisonment, accordingly, was unjust. - Besides thus appealing to his
innocence, Jeremiah, [Jer 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#020.md),
entreats the king, "Let my supplication come before thee, and do not
send me back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I may not die
there." For 'תּפּל־נא ת see on [Jer
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md). The king granted this request.
"He commanded, and they put Jeremiah into the court of the watch \[of
the royal palace, see on [Jer 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002.md)\],
and gave him a loaf of bread daily out of the bakers' street, till all
the bread in the city was consumed;" cf. [Jer
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006.md). The king did not give him his
liberty, because Jeremiah held to his views, that were so distasteful to
the king (see on [Jer 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003).md). "So
Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard."
