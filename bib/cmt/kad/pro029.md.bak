### [Proverbs Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 29:1</span></span>

A general ethical proverb here follows:

A man often corrected who hardeneth his neck,

Shall suddenly go to ruin without remedy.

Line second = [Pro 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#015.md). The
connection אישׁ תּוכחות must make the nearest impression on a reader of
the Book of Proverbs that they mean a censurer (reprehender), but which
is set aside by what follows, for the genit. after אישׁ is, [Pro
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#029.md); [Pro
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#021.md); [Pro
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#010.md); [Pro
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020.md), the designation of that which
proceeds from the subject treated. And since תּוכחות, [Psa
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#015.md); [Job
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#004.md), denotes counter evidence, and
generally rejoinders, thus in the first line a reasoner is designated
who lets nothing be said to him, and nothing be shown to him, but
contradicts all and every one. Thus e.g., Fleischer: vir qui correptus
contradicit et cervicem obdurat. But this interpolated correptus gives
involuntary testimony of this, that the nearest lying impression of the
'אישׁ תו suffers a change by מקשׁה ערף: if we read הקשׁה (לב) ערף with
'תו, the latter then designates the correptio, over against which is
placed obstinate boldness (Syr., Targ., Jerome, Luther), and 'תו shows
itself thus to be gen. objecti, and we have to compare the gen.
connection of אישׁ, as at [Pro 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#023.md);
[Pro 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#017.md), or rather at [Kg1
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#042.md) and [Jer
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010.md). But it is unnecessary, with
Hitzig, to limit 'תו to divine infliction of punishment, and after [Hos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009.md); [Isa
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#003.md), to read תוכחות \[punishment\],
which occurs, [Psa 149:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#007.md), in the sense
of punishment inflicted by man.

(Note: Vid., Zunz, "Regarding the Idea and the Use of Tokhecha," in
Steinschneider's Heb. Bibliographia, entitled המחכיר, 1871, p. 70f.)

Besides, we must think first not of actual punishment, but of
chastening, reproving words; and the man to whom are spoken the
reproving words is one whose conduct merits more and more severe
censure, and continually receives correction from those who are
concerned for his welfare. Hitzig regards the first line as a
conditional clause: "Is a man of punishment stiff-necked?".... This is
syntactically impossible. Only מקשׁה ערף could have such force: a man of
punishment, if he.... But why then did not the author rather write the
words והוא מקשׁה ערף? Why then could not מקשׁה ערף be a co-ordinated
further description of the man? Cf. e.g., Ex. 17:21. The door of
penitence, to which earnest, well-meant admonition calls a man, does not
always remain open. He who with stiff-necked persistence in sin and in
self-delusion sets himself in opposition to all endeavours to save his
soul, shall one day suddenly, and without the prospect and possibility
of restoration (cf. [Jer 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011).md),
become a wreck. Audi doctrinam si vis vitare ruinam.

[Proverbs 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 29:2</span></span>

The general ethical proverb is here followed by one that is political:

2 When the righteous increase, the people rejoice;

And when a godless man ruleth, the people mourn.

Regarding 'בּרבות צדּ (Aquila rightly, ἐν τῷ πληθῦναι δικαίους), vid.,
at [Pro 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#028.md). If the righteous form
the majority, or are in such numbers that they are the party that give
the tone, that form the predominant power among the people (Fleischer,
cum incrementa capiunt justi), then the condition of the people is a
happy one, and their voice joyful ([Pro
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#010).md); if, on the contrary, a godless
man or (after [Pro 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001).md) godless men
rule, the people are made to sigh (יאנח עם, with the Gaja, according to
rule). "There is reason," as Hitzig remarks, "why עם should be placed
first with, and then without, the article." In the first case it denotes
the people as those among whom there is such an increase of the
righteous; in the second case, the article is wanting, because it is not
generally used in poetry; and, besides, its absence makes the second
line consist of nine syllables, like the first.

[Proverbs 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 29:3</span></span>

This political proverb is now followed by one of general ethics:

3 A man who loveth wisdom delighteth his father;

And he who keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.

Line first is a variation of [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md). אישׁ־אהב has, according to rule,
the Metheg, cf. 9a. אישׁ is man, without distinction of age, from
childhood ([Gen 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001).md) up to ripe old
age ([Isa 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#013).md); love and dutiful
relation towards father and mother never cease. Line second reminds of
[Pro 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#007.md) (cf. [Pro
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#020).md).

[Proverbs 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 29:4</span></span>

A series of six proverb follows, beginning with a proverb of the king:

4 A king by righteousness bringeth the land to a good condition;

But a man of taxes bringeth it down.

The Hiph. חעמיד signifies to make it so that a person or matter comes to
stand erect and stand fast (e.g., [Kg1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004).md); הרס, to tear down, is the
contrary of building up and extending ([Psa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005).md), cf. נהרס, opp. רוּם, of the
state, [Pro 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#011.md). By 'אישׁ תּר is
meant the king, or a man of this kind; but it is questionable whether as
a man of gifts, i.e., one who lets gifts be made to him (Grotius,
Fleischer, Ewald, Bertheau, Zckler), or as a man of taxes, i.e., who
imposes them (Midrash, Aben Ezra, Ralbag, Rosenmller, Hitzig). Both
interpretations are possible, for 'תר means tax (lifting, raising =
dedicating), free-will offerings, as well as gifts that are obligatory
and required by the laws of nature. Since the word, in the only other
place where it occurs, [Eze 45:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013.md),
is used of the relation of the people to the prince, and denotes a
legally-imposed tax, so it appears also here, in passing over from the
religious sphere to the secular, to be meant of taxes, and that
according to its fundamental conception of gifts, i.e., such taxes as
are given on account of anything, such as the produce of the soil,
manufactures, heritages. Thus also is to be understood Aquila's and
Theodotion's ἀνὴρ ἀφαιρεμάτων, and the rendering also of the Venet.
ἐράνων. A man on the throne, covetous of such gifts, brings the land to
ruin by exacting contributions; on the contrary, a king helps the land
to a good position, and an enduring prosperity, by the exercise of
right, and that in appointing a well-proportioned and fit measure of
taxation.

[Proverbs 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 29:5</span></span>

5 A man who flattereth his neighbour

Spreadeth a net for his steps.

Fleischer, as Bertheau: vir qui alterum blanditiis circumvenit; but in
the על there does not lie in itself a hostile tendency, an intention to
do injury; it interchanges with אל, [Psa
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#003.md), and what is expressed in line
second happens also, without any intention on the part of the flatterer:
the web of the flatterer before the eyes of a neighbour becomes, if he
is caught thereby, a net for him in which he is entangled to his own
destruction (Hitzig). החליק signifies also, without any external object,
[Pro 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#023.md); [Pro
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md), as internally transitive: to
utter that which is smooth, i.e., flattering. פּעמיו is, as [Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md) = רגליו, for which it is the
usual Phoenician word.

[Proverbs 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 29:6</span></span>

6 In the transgression of the wicked man lies a snare;

But the righteous rejoiceth jubelt and is glad.

Thus the first line is to be translated according to the sequence of the
accents, Mahpach, Munach, Munach, Athnach, for the second Munach is the
transformation of Dechi; אישׁ רע thus, like אנשׁי־רע, [Pro
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#005.md), go together, although the
connection is not, like this, genitival, but adjectival. But there is
also this sequence of the accents, Munach, Dechi, Munach, Athnach, which
separates רע and אישׁ. According to this, Ewald translates: "in the
transgression of one lies an evil snare;" but in that case the word
ought to have been מוקשׁ רע, as at [Pro
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013.md); for although the numeral רבים
sometimes precedes its substantive, yet no other adjective ever does;
passages such as [Isa 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021.md) and [Isa
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030.md) do not show the possibility of
this position of the words. In this sequence of accents the explanation
must be: in the wickedness of a man is the evil of a snare, i.e., evil
is the snare laid therein (Bttcher); but a reason why the author did not
write מוקשׁ רע would also not be seen there, and thus we must abide by
the accentuation אישׁ רע. The righteous also may fall, yet he is again
raised by means of repentance and pardon; but in the wickedness of a bad
man lies a snare into which having once fallen, he cannot again release
himself from it, [Pro 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016.md). In the
second line, the form ירוּן, for ירן, is defended by the same
metaplastic forms as ישׁוּד, [Psa
91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006.md); ירוּץ, [Isa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md); and also that the order of the
words is not ישׂמח ורנּן (lxx ἐν χαρᾷ καὶ ἐν εὐθροσύνῃ; Luther: frewet
sich und hat wonne \[rejoices and has pleasure\]), is supported by the
same sequence of ideas, [Zac 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md)
:14, cf. [Jer 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#007.md) : the Jubeln is the
momentary outburst of gladness; the Freude gladness, however, is a
continuous feeling of happiness. To the question as to what the
righteous rejoiceth over \[jubelt\] and is glad \[greuet\] because of,
the answer is not: because of his happy release from danger (Zckler),
but: because of the prosperity which his virtue procures for him
(Fleischer). But the contrast between the first and second lines is not
clear and strong. One misses the expression of the object or ground of
the joy. Cocceius introduces into the second line a si lapsus fuerit.
Schultens translates, justus vel succumbens triumphabit, after the Arab.
rân f. o., which, however, does not mean succumbere, but subigere (vid.,
under [Psa 78:65](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#065).md). Hitzig compares
Arab. raym f. i., discedere, relinquere, and translates: "but the
righteous passeth through and rejoiceth." Bttcher is inclined to read
יראה ושׂמח, he sees it (what?) and rejoiceth. All these devices,
however, stand in the background compared with Pinsker's proposal
(Babylon.-Heb. Punktationssystem, p. 156):

"On the footsteps of the wicked man lie snares,

But the righteous runneth and is glad,"

i.e., he runneth joyfully (like the sun, [Psa
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006).md) on the divinely-appointed way
([Psa 119:132](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#132).md), on which he knows
himself threatened by no danger. The change of בפשׁע into בפשׂע has [Pro
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013.md) against it; but ירוץ may be
regarded, after [Pro 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#012.md), cf. [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md), as the original from which ירון
is corrupted.

[Proverbs 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 29:7</span></span>

7 The righteous knoweth the cause of the poor,

But the godless understandeth no knowledge.

The righteous knoweth and recogniseth the righteous claims of people of
low estate, i.e., what is due to them as men, and in particular cases;
but the godless has no knowledge from which such recognition may go
forth (cf. as to the expression, [Pro
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025).md). The proverb begins like [Pro
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010.md), which commends the just man's
compassion to his cattle; this commends his sympathy with those who are
often treated as cattle, and worse even than cattle. The lxx translates
7b twice: the second time reading רשׁ instead of רשׁע, it makes nonsense
of it.

[Proverbs 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 29:8</span></span>

8 Men of derision set the city in an uproar,

But wise men allay anger.

Isa. 28 shows what we are to understand by אנשׁי לצון: men to whom
nothing is holy, and who despise all authority. The Hiphil יפיחוּ does
not signify irretiunt, from פּחח (Venet. παγιδιοῦσι, after Kimchi, Aben
Ezra, and others), but sufflant, from פוח (Rashi: ילהיבו): they stir up
or excite the city, i.e., its inhabitants, so that they begin to burn as
with flames, i.e., by the dissolution of the bonds of mutual respect and
of piety, by the letting loose of passion, they disturb the peace and
excite the classes of the community and individuals against each other;
but the wise bring it about that the breathings of anger that has broken
forth, or is in the act of breaking forth, are allayed. The anger is not
that of God, as it is rendered by Jerome and Luther, and as יפיחו freely
translated might mean. The Aram. err in regard to יפיחו in passages such
as [Pro 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019.md).

[Proverbs 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 29:9</span></span>

9 If a wise man has to contend with a fool,

He the fool rageth and laugheth, and hath no rest.

Among the old translators, Jerome and Luther take the "wise man" as
subject even of the second line, and that in all its three members: vir
sapiens si cum stulto contenderit, sive irascatur sive reideat, non
inveniet requiem. Thus Schultens, C. B. Michaelis, Umbreit, Ewald,
Elster, and also Fleischer: "The doubled Vav is correlative, as at [Exo
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#016.md); [Lev
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#003.md), and expresses the perfect
sameness in respect of the effect, here of the want of effect. If the
wise man, when he disputes with a fool, becomes angry, or jests, he will
have no rest, i.e., he will never bring it to pass that the fool shall
cease to reply; he yields the right to him, and thus makes it possible
for him to end the strife." But the angry passion, and the bursts of
laughter alternating therewith, are not appropriate to the wise man
affirming his right; and since, after [Ecc
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#017.md), the words of the wise are heard
בּנחח, the ואין נחת \[and there is no rest\] will cause us to think of
the fool as the logical subject. So far correctly, but in other respects
inappropriately, the lxx ἀνὴρ σοφὸς κρινεῖ ἔθνη (after the expression
עם, i.e., עם, instead of את), ἀνὴρ δὲ φαῦλος (which אישׁ אויל does not
mean) ὀργιζόμενος καταγελᾶται καὶ οὐ καταπτήσσει (as if the words were
ולא יחת).

(Note: According to this the Targum ולא מתתּבר (he remains obstinate),
according to which the ולא מתתפיר (he does not lose his wits) of the
Peshito is perhaps to be corrected. The distribution of the subjects is
obscure.)

The syntactical relation would be simpler if נשׁפּט in 9a were vocalized
as a hypothetical perfect. But we read for it the past נשׁפּט. Ewald
designates 9a as a conditional clause, and Hitzig remarks that the Lat.
viro sapiente disceptante cum stulto corresponds therewith. It marks,
like [Sa1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013.md); [Job
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016.md), the situation from which there
is a departure then with perf. consec.: if a wise man in the right is in
contact with a fool, he starts up, and laughs, and keeps not quiet
(supply לּו as at [Pro 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#027).md), or
(without לו): there is no keeping quiet, there is no rest. The figure is
in accordance with experience. If a wise man has any controversy with a
fool, which is to be decided by reasonable and moral arguments, then he
becomes boisterous and laughs, and shows himself incapable of quietly
listening to his opponent, and of appreciating his arguments.

[Proverbs 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 29:10</span></span>

We now group together [Pro 29:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#010.md).
Of these, [Pro 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#010.md) and [Pro
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#011.md) are alike in respect of the
tense used; [Pro 29:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012.md) have in
common the pronoun pointing back to the first member.

10 Men of blood hate the guiltless

And the upright; they attempt the life of such

The nearest lying translation of the second line would certainly be: the
upright seek his soul (that of the guiltless). In accordance with the
contrasted ישׂנאו, the Aram. understand the seeking of earnest
benevolent seeking, but disregarding the נפשׁ in לנפשׁו;

(Note: The Targum translates תם, guiltlessness, and the Venet. (μισοῦσι)
γνῶσιν, turning to [Pro 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022)..md)

Symmachus (ἐπιζητήσουσι), Jerome (quaerunt), and Luther thus also
understand the sentence; and Rashi remarks that the phrase is here לשׁון
חבּה, for he rests; but mistrusting himself, refers to [Sa1
21:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md) :23. Ahron b. Josef glosses:
to enter into friendship with him. Thus, on account of the contrast,
most moderns, interpreting the phrase sensu bono, also Fleischer: probi
autem vitam ejus conservare student. The thought is, as [Pro
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#006.md) shows, correct; but the usus loq.
protests against this rendering, which can rest only on [Psa
142:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005.md), where, however, the poet does
not say אין דּורשׁ נפשׁי, but, as here also the usus loq. requires,
לנפשׁי. There are only three possible explanations which Aben Ezra
enumerates: (1) they seek his, the bloody man's, soul, i.e., they
attempt his life, to take vengeance against him, according to the
meaning of the expressions as generally elsewhere, used, e.g., at [Psa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010); (2.md) they revenge his, the
guiltless man's, life (lxx ἐκζητήσουσιν), which has fallen a victim,
after the meaning in which elsewhere only בּקּשׁ דּם and דּרשׁ נפשׁ,
[Gen 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005.md), occur. This second meaning
also is thus not in accordance with the usage of the words, and against
both meanings it is to be said that it is not in the spirit of the Book
of Proverbs to think of the ישׁרים \[the upright, righteous\] as
executors of the sentences of the penal judicature. There thus remains

(Note: For εὐθεῖς δὲ συνάξουσιν (will bring away?) τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτῶν,
understood after [Jer 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005.md), lies
linguistically yet further off.)

the interpretation (3): the upright - they (the bloody men) seek the
soul of such an one. The transition from the plur. to the sing. is
individualizing, and thus the arrangement of the words is like [Gen
47:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#021.md) : "And the people (as regards
them), he removed them to the cities," Gesen. 145. 2. This last
explanation recommends itself by the consideration that תם and ישׁרים
are cognate as to the ideas they represents-let one call to mind the
common expression תּם וישׁר \[perfect and upright, e.g., [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md); [Job
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003.md)\], - that the same persons are
meant thereby, and it is rendered necessary by this, that the thought,
"bloody men hate the guiltless," is incomplete; for the same thing may
also be said of the godless in general. One expects to hear that just
against the guiltless, i.e., men walking in their innocence, the
bloody-mindedness of such men is specially directed, and 10b says the
same thing; this second clause first brings the contrast to the point
aimed at. Lutz is right in seeking to confute Hitzig, but he does so on
striking grounds.

[Proverbs 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 29:11</span></span>

11 All his wrath the fool poureth out;

But the wise man husheth it up in the background.

That רוּחו is not meant here of his spirit (Luther) in the sense of
quaecunque in mente habet (thus e.g., Fleischer) the contrast shows, for
ישׁבּחנּה does not signify cohibet, for which יחשׁכנּה (lxx ταμιεύεται)
would be the proper word: רוּח thus is not here used of passionate
emotion, such as at [Pro 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#031.md); [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md); [Isa
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011.md). שׁבּח is not here equivalent to
Arab. sabbah, αἰνεῖν (Imman., Venet., and Heidenheim), which does not
supply an admissible sense, but is equivalent to Arab. sabbakh, to quiet
(Ahron b. Josef: קטפיאון = καταπαύειν), the former going back to the
root-idea of extending (amplificare), the latter to that of going to a
distance, putting away: sabbakh, procul recessit, distitit, hence שׁבּח,
[Psa 89:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010.md), and here properly to drive
off into the background, synon. השׁיב (Fleischer). But בּאחור (only here
with ב) is ambiguous. One might with Rashi explain: but the wise man
finally, or afterwards (Symmachus, ἐπ ̓ ἐσχάτων; Venet. κατόπιν =
κατόπισθε), appeaseth the anger which the fool lets loose; i.e., if the
latter gives vent to his anger, the former appeases, subdues, mitigates
it (cf. בּאחרנה, לאחור, [Isa 42:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#023).md).
But it lies still nearer to refer the antithesis to the anger of the
wise man himself; he does not give to it unbridled course, but husheth
it in the background, viz., in his heart. Thus Syr. and Targ. reading
בּרעינא, the former, besides יחשּׁבנּה (reputat eam), so also Aben Ezra:
in the heart as the background of the organ of speech. Others explain:
in the background, afterward, retrorsum, e.g., Nolde, but to which
compescit would be more appropriate than sedat. Hitzig's objection, that
in other cases the expression would be בּקרבּו, is answered by this,
that with באחור the idea of pressing back (of אחוּר) is connected. The
order of the words also is in favour of the meaning in recessu (cordis).
Irae dilatio mentis pacatio (according to an old proverb).

[Proverbs 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 29:12</span></span>

12 A ruler who listens to deceitful words,

All his servants are godless.

They are so because they deceive him, and they become so; for instead of
saying the truth which the ruler does not wish to hear, they seek to
gain his favour by deceitful flatteries, misrepresentations,
exaggerations, falsehoods. Audita rex quae praecipit lex. He does not do
this, as the saying is, sicut rex ita grex (Sir. 10:2), in the sense of
this proverb of Solomon.

[Proverbs 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 29:13</span></span>

13 The poor man and the usurer meet together -

Jahve lighteneth the eyes of both.

A variation of [Pro 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002.md), according to
which the proverb is to be understood in both of its parts. That אישׁ
תּככים is the contrast of רשׁ, is rightly supposed in Temura 16b; but
Rashi, who brings out here a man of moderate learning, and Saadia, a man
of a moderate condition (thus also the Targ. גּברא מצעיא, after Buxtorf,
homo mediocris fortunae), err by connecting the word with תּוך. The lxx
δανειστοῦ καὶ χρεωφειλέτου (ἀλλήλοις συνελθόντων), which would be more
correct inverted, for אישׁ תככים is a man who makes oppressive taxes,
high previous payments of interest; the verbal stem תּכך, Arab. tak, is
a secondary to R. wak, which has the meanings of pressing together, and
pressing firm (whence also the middle is named; cf. Arab. samym âlaklab,
the solid = the middle point of the heart). תּך, with the plur. תככים,
scarcely in itself denotes interest, τόκος; the designation אישׁ תככים
includes in it a sensible reproach (Syr. afflictor), and a rentier
cannot be so called (Hitzig). Luther: Reiche \[rich men\], with the
marginal note: "who can practise usury as they then generally all do?"
Therefore Lwenstein understands the second line after [Sa1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#007.md) : God enlighteneth their eyes by
raising the lowly and humbling the proud. But this line, after [Pro
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002.md), only means that the poor as well
as the rich owe the light of life ([Psa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004).md) to God, the creator and ruler of
all things - a fact which has also its moral side: both are conditioned
by Him, stand under His control, and have to give to Him an account; or
otherwise rendered: God maketh His sun to rise on the low and the high,
the evil and the good (cf. [Mat 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045).md)
- an all-embracing love full of typical moral motive.

(Note: מאיר has, by Lwenstein, Mehuppach Legarmeh, but incorrectly,
since after Legarmeh two conjunctives cannot occur. Also Norzi with
Mehuppach Mercha is irregular, since Ben-Asher recognises only two
examples of this double accentuation to which this מאיר does not belong;
vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 12. That the penultima toning מאיר in several
editions is false scarcely needs to be remarked. Jablonski rightly
points with Mehuppach on the ult., and Zinnorith on the preceding open
syllable.)

[Proverbs 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 29:14</span></span>

14 A king who judgeth the poor with truth,

His throne shall stand for ever.

בּאמת, as at [Isa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#005.md) (synon. באמונה,
במישׁרים, במישׁור), is equivalent to fidelity to duty, or a complete,
full accomplishment of his duty as a ruler with reference to the
dispensing of justice; in other words: after the norm of actual fact,
and of the law, and of his duty proceeding from both together. מלך has
in Codd., e.g., Jaman., and in the Venetian 1517, 21, rightly Rebia. In
that which follows, שׁופט באמת are more closely related than באמת דלים,
for of two conjunctives standing together the first always connects more
than the second. מלך שׁופט באמת דלים is the truest representation of the
logical grammatical relation. To 14b compare the proverb of the king,
[Pro 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012.md); [Pro
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#005.md).

[Proverbs 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 29:15</span></span>

A proverb with שׁבט, [Pro 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#015.md), is
placed next to one with שׁופט, but it begins a group of proverbs
regarding discipline in the house and among the people:

15 The rod and reproof give wisdom;

But an undisciplined son is a shame to his mother.

With שׁבט \[a rod\], which [Pro 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015.md)
also commends as salutary, תּוכחת refers to discipline by means of
words, which must accompany bodily discipline, and without them is also
necessary; the construction of the first line follows in number and
gender the scheme [Pro 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#009.md), [Zac
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007.md); Ewald, 339c. In the second line
the mother is named, whose tender love often degenerates into a fond
indulgence; such a darling, such a mother's son, becomes a disgrace to
his mother. Our "ausgelassen," by which Hitzig translates משׁלּח, is
used of joyfulness unbridled and without self-restraint, and is in the
passage before us too feeble a word; שׁלּח is used of animals pasturing
at liberty, wandering in freedom ([Job
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005.md); [Isa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#002).md); נער משׁלח is accordingly a
child who is kept in by no restraint and no punishment, one left to
himself, and thus undisciplined (Luther, Gesenius, Fleischer, and
others).

[Proverbs 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 29:16</span></span>

16 When the godless increase, wickedness increaseth;

But the righteous shall see their fall.

The lxx translation is not bad: πολλῶν ὄντων ἀσεβῶν πολλαὶ γίνονται
ἁμαρτίαι (vid., regarding רבה, [Pro
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#002.md), [Pro
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#028).md); but in the main it is only a
Binsenwahrheit, as they say in Swabia, i.e., a trivial saying. The
proverb means, that if among a people the party of the godless increases
in number, and at the same time in power, wickedness, i.e., a falling
away into sins of thought and conduct, and therewith wickedness,
prevails. When irreligion and the destruction of morals thus increase,
the righteous are troubled; but the conduct of the godless carries the
judgment in itself, and the righteous shall with joy perceive, in the
righteous retribution of God, that the godless man will be cast down
from his power and influence. This proverb is like a motto to [Psa
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md).

[Proverbs 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 29:17</span></span>

17 Correct thy son, and he will give thee delight,

And afford pleasure to thy soul.

The lxx well translates ויניחך by καὶ ἀναπαύσει σε;

(Note: Their translation of [Pro 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#017.md)
and [Pro 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018.md) here is found, in a
marred and mutilated form, after [Pro
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#017.md). At that place the words are καὶ
ἀγαπήσει σε.)

הניח denotes rest properly, a breathing again, ἀνάψυξις; and then, with
an obliteration of the idea of restraint so far, generally (like the
Arab. araḥ, compared by Fleischer) to afford pleasure or delight. The
post.-bibl. language uses for this the words נחת רוּח, and says of the
pious that he makes נחת רוח to his Creator, Berachoth 17a; and of God,
that He grants the same to them that fear Him, Berach. 29b; in the
morning prayer of the heavenly spirits, that they hallow their Creator
בנחת רוח (with inward delight). Write with Codd. (also Jaman.) and older
editions ויניחך, not ויניחךּ; for, except in verbs 'ה'ל, the suffix of
this Hiphil form is not dageshed, e.g., אמיתך, [Kg1
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026.md); cf. also [Kg1
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#016.md) and [Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md). מעדנּים the lxx understands,
after [Sa2 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#024.md) (עם־עדנים, μετὰ
κόσμου), also here, of ornament; but the word signifies dainty dishes -
here, high spiritual enjoyment. As in [Pro
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#015.md) and [Pro
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#016.md) a transition was made from the
house to the people, so there now follows the proverb of the discipline
of children, a proverb of the education of the people:

[Proverbs 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 29:18</span></span>

18 Without a revelation a people becomes ungovernable;

But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.

Regarding the importance of this proverb for estimating the relation of
the Chokma to prophecy, vid., vol. i. p. 41. חזון is, according to the
sense, equivalent to נבוּאה, the prophetic revelation in itself, and as
the contents of that which is proclaimed. Without spiritual preaching,
proceeding from spiritual experience, a people is unrestrained (יפּרע,
vid., regarding the punctuation at [Pro
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025.md), and regarding the fundamental
meaning, at [Pro 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#025).md); it becomes
פּרע, disorderly, [Exo 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025.md); wild und
wst, as Luther translates. But in the second line, according to the
unity of the antithesis, the words are spoken of the people, not of
individuals. It is therefore not to be explained, with Hitzig: but
whoever, in such a time, nevertheless holds to the law, it is well with
him! Without doubt this proverb was coined at a time when the preaching
of the prophets was in vogue; and therefore this, "but whoever,
notwithstanding," is untenable; such a thought at that time could not at
all arise; and besides this, תורה is in the Book of Proverbs a moveable
conception, which is covered at least by the law in contradistinction to
prophecy. Tôra denotes divine teaching, the word of God; whether that of
the Sinaitic or that of the prophetic law ([Ch2
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003.md), cf. e.g., [Isa
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010).md). While, on the one hand, a
people is in a dissolute condition when the voice of the preacher,
speaking from divine revelation, and enlightening their actions and
sufferings by God's word, is silent amongst them ([Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md), cf. [Amo
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#012).md); on the other hand, that same
people are to be praised as happy when they show due reverence and
fidelity to the word of God, both as written and as preached. That the
word of God is preached among a people belongs to their condition of
life; and they are only truly happy when they earnestly and willingly
subordinate themselves to the word of God which they possess and have
the opportunity of hearing. אשׁרהוּ (defective for אשׁריהוּ) is the
older, and here the poetic kindred form to אשׁריו, [Pro
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021.md); [Pro
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#020.md).

[Proverbs 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 29:19</span></span>

From the discipline of the people this series of proverbs again returns
to the discipline of home:

19 With words a servant will not let himself be bettered;

For he understandeth them, but conformeth not thereto.

The Niph. נוסר becomes a so-called tolerative, for it connects with the
idea of happening that of reaching its object: to become truly bettered
(taught in wisdom, corrected), and thus to let himself be bettered. With
mere words this is not reached; the unreasonable servant needs, in order
to be set right, a more radical means of deliverance. This assertion
demands confirmation; therefore is the view of von Hofmann (Schriftbew.
ii. 2. 404) improbable, that 19b has in view a better-disposed servant:
supposing that he is intelligent, in which case he is admonished without
cause, then the words are also lost: he will let them pass over him in
silence without any reply. This attempted explanation is occasioned by
this, that מענה can signify nothing else than a response in words. If
this were correct, then without doubt its fundamental meaning would
correspond with כּי; for one explains, with Lwenstein, "for he perceives
it, and may not answer," i.e., this, that a reply cut off frustrates the
moral impression. Or also: for he understands it, but is silent - in
praefractum se silentium configit (Schultens); and thus it is with the
ancients (Rashi). But why should not ואין מענה itself be the expression
of this want of any consequences? מענה cannot certainly mean humiliation

(Note: The Syr. and Targ. also think on ענה, for they translate: "for he
knows that he receives no strokes.")

(Meri, after [Exo 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#003), הכנעה.md), but
why as an answer in words and not also a response by act (Stuart: a
practical answer)? Thus the lxx ἐὰν γὰρ καὶ νοήσῃ, ἀλλ ̓ οὐχ
ὑπακούσεται, according to which Luther: for although he at once
understands it, he does not yet take it to himself. That מענה tahT . may
mean obedience, the Aram. so understood, also at [Pro
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004.md). It denoted a reply in the most
comprehensive meaning of the word, vid., at [Pro
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001.md). The thought, besides, is the
same as if one were to explain: for he understands it, and is silent,
i.e., lets thee speak; or: he understands it, but that which he
perceives finds no practical echo.

[Proverbs 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 29:20</span></span>

20 Seest thou a man hasty in his words?

The fool hath more hope than he.

Cf. [Pro 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012.md). Such an one has
blocked up against himself the path to wisdom, which to the fool, i.e.,
to the ingenuous, stands open; the former is perfect, of the latter
something may yet be made. In this passage the contrast is yet more
precise, for the fool is thought of as the dull, which is the proper
meaning of כּסיל, vid., under [Pro
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#024.md). There is more hope for the fool
than for him, although he may be no fool in himself, who overthrows
himself by his words. "The προπετὴς ἐν λόγῳ αὐτοῦ (Sir. 9:18) has, in
the existing case, already overleaped the thought; the כסיל has it still
before him, and comes at length, perhaps with his slow conception, to
it" (Hitzig); for the ass, according to the fable, comes at last farther
than the greyhound. Hence, in words as well as in acts, the proverb
holds good, "Eile mit Weile" \[= festina lente\]. Every word, as well as
act, can only be matured by being thought out, and thought over. From
this proverb, which finds its practical application to the affairs of a
house, and particularly also to the relation to domestics, the group
returns to the subject of instruction, which is its ground-tone.

[Proverbs 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 29:21</span></span>

21 If one pampers his servant from youth up,

He will finally reach the place of a child.

The lxx had no answer to the question as to the meaning of מנון. On the
other hand, for פּנּק, the meaning to fondle; delicatius enutrire, is
perfectly warranted by the Aram. and Arab. The Talmud, Succa 52b,
resorts to the alphabet בח''אט in order to reach a meaning for מנון. How
the Targ. comes to translate the word by מנסּח (outrooted) is not clear;
the rendering of Jerome: postea sentiet eum contumacem, is perhaps
mediated by the ἔσται γογγυσμός of Symmachus, who combines נון with לון,
Niph. γογγύζειν. The ὀθυνηθήσεται of the lxx, with the Syr., von Hofmann
has sought to justify (Schriftbew. ii. 2. 404), for he derives מנון =
מנהון from נהה. We must then punctuate מנּון; but perhaps the lxx
derived the word from אנן = מאנון, whether they pronounced it מנון (cf.
מסרת = מאסרת) or מנּון. To follow them is not wise, for the formation of
the word is precarious; one does not see with the speaker of this
proverb, to whom the language presented a fulness of synonyms for the
idea of complaint, meant by using this peculiar word. Linguistically
these meanings are impossible: of Jerome, dominus = ממנּה (Ahron b.
Josef, Meri, and others); or: the oppressed = מוּנה, from ינה (Johlson);
or: one who is sick = מונה (Euchel). and Ewald's "undankbar"
\[unthankful\], derived from the Arabic, is a mere fancy, since (Arab.)
manuwan does not mean one who is unthankful, but, on the contrary, one
who upbraids good deeds shown.

(Note: In Jahrb. xi. p. 10f. Ewald compares, in an expressive way, the
Ethiopic mannána (Piel) to scorn; menûn, a reprobate; and mannânı̂, one
who is despised; according to which מנון hcih could certainly designate
"a man despising scornfully his own benefactors, or an unthankful man."
But this verbal stem is peculiarly Ethiop., and is certainly not once
found in Arab. For minnat (which Ewald compares) denotes benefaction,
and the duty laid on one thereby, the dependence thereby produced. The
verb (Arab.) minn (= מנן) signifies to divide; and particularly, partly
to confer benefaction, partly to attribute benefaction, reckon to,
enumerate, and thereby to bring out the sense of obligation. Thus
nothing is to be derived from this verbal stem for מנון.)

The ancients are in the right track, who explain מנון after the verb
נוּן, [Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017.md) = נין = בּן; the
Venet., herein following Kimchi, also adopts the nominal form, for it
translates (but without perceptible meaning) γόνωσις. Luther's
translation is fortunate:

"If a servant is tenderly treated from youth up,

He will accordingly become a Junker \[squire\]."

The ideas represented in modern Jewish translations: that of a son
(e.g., Solomon: he will at last be the son) and that of a master (Zunz),
are here united. But how the idea of a son (from the verb נון), at the
same time that of a master, may arise, is not to be perceived in the
same way as with Junker and the Spanish infante and hidalgo; rather with
מנון, as the ironical naming of the son (little son), the idea of a
weakling (de Wette) may be connected. The state of the matter appears as
follows: - the Verb נוּן has the meanings of luxuriant growth, numerous
propagation; the fish has from this the Aram. name of נוּן, like the
Heb. דּג, from דּגה, which also means luxuriant, exuberant increase
(vid., at [Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017).md). From this is
derived נין, which designates the offspring as a component part of a
kindred, as well as מנון, which, according as the מ is interpreted
infin. or local, means either this, that it sprouts up luxuriantly, the
abundant growth, or also the place of luxuriant sprouting, wanton
growing, abundant and quick multiplication: thus the place of hatching,
spawning. The subject in יהיה might be the fondled one; but it lies
nearer, however, to take him who fondles as the subject, as in 21a.
אחריתו is either adv. accus. for באחריתו, or, as we preferred at [Pro
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#032.md), it is the subj. introducing,
after the manner of a substantival clause, the following sentence as its
virtual predicate: "one has fondled his servant from his youth up, and
his (that of the one who fondles) end is: he will become a place of
increase." The master of the house is thought of along with his house;
and the servant as one who, having become a man, presents his master
with ילידי בּית, who are spoilt scapegraces, as he himself has become by
the pampering of his master. There was used in the language of the
people, נין for בּן, in the sense on which we name a degenerate son a
"Schnes Frchtchen" \[pretty little fruit\]; and מנון is a place (house)
where many נינים are; and a man (master of a house) who has many of them
is one whose family has increased over his head. One reaches the same
meaning if מנון is rendered more immediately as the place or state of
growing, increasing, luxuriating. The sense is in any case: he will not
be able, in the end, any more to defend himself against the crowd which
grows up to him from this his darling, but will be merely a passive part
of it.

[Proverbs 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 29:22</span></span>

The following group begins with a proverb which rhymes by מדון, with
מנון of the foregoing, and extends on to the end of this Hezekiah
collection:

22 A man of anger stirreth up strife;

And a passionate man aboundeth in transgression.

Line first is a variation of [Pro
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#018.md) and [Pro
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025.md). אישׁ and בּעל as here, but in
the reverse order at [Pro 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024.md).

(Note: For אישׁ־אף (Lwenstein after Norzi) is to be written, with Baer
(Thorath Emeth, p. 19), אישׁ אף ,)91. Thus also in Cod. Jaman.)

אף here means anger, not the nose, viz., the expanded nostrils
(Schultens). In רב־פּשׁע the פשׁע is, after [Pro
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029.md); [Pro
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016.md); [Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md), the governed genitive; Hitzig
construes it in the sense of פשׁע רב, [Psa
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002.md), with יגרה, but one does not say
גּרה פשׁע; and that which is true of רבּים, that, after the manner of a
numeral, it can precede its substantive (vid., under Ps. 7:26; [Psa
89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051).md), cannot be said of רב. Much
(great) in wickedness denotes one who heaps up many wicked actions, and
burdens himself with greater guilt (cf. פשׁע, [Pro
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#016).md). The wrathful man stirreth up
(vid., under [Pro 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#018).md) strife, for
he breaks through the mutual relations of men, which rest on mutual
esteem and love, and by means of his passionate conduct he makes enemies
of those against whom he thinks that he has reason for being angry; that
on account of which he is angry can be settled without producing such
hostility, but passion impels him on, and misrepresents the matter; it
embitters hearts, and tears them asunder. The lxx has, instead of רב,
ἐξώρυξεν, of dreaming, כרה ([Pro
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#027).md).

[Proverbs 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 29:23</span></span>

[Pro 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#023.md) passes from anger to
haughtiness:

A man's pride will bring him low;

But the lowly attaineth to honour.

Thus we translate תּתמך כּבוד (Lat. honorem obtinet) in accord with [Pro
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#016.md), and שׁפל־רוּח with [Pro
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#019.md), where, however, שׁפל is not
adj. as here, but inf. The haughty man obscures the honour which he has
by this, that he boasts immeasurably of it, and aspires yet more after
it; the lowly man, on the other hand, obtains honour without his seeking
it, honour before God and before men, which would be of no worth were it
not connected with the honour before God. The lxx: τοὺς δὲ ταπεινόφρονας
ἐπείδει δόξῃ κύριους. This κύριους is indeed not contrary to the sense,
but it is opposed to the style. Why the 24th verse should now follow is,
as regards the contents and the expression, hard to say; but one
observes that [Pro 29:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022.md) follow
each other, beginning with the successive letters of the alphabet א (ב),
ג, ח, ח, ר, ת (ת).

24 He that taketh part with a thief hateth himself;

He heareth the oath and confesseth not.

Hitzig renders the first member as the pred. of the second: "he who does
not bring to light such sins as require an atonement ([Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001)..md), but shares the secret of them
with the sinner, is not better than one who is a partner with a thief,
who hateth himself." The construction of the verse, he remarks, is not
understood by any interpreter. It is not, however, so cross, - for,
understood as Hitzig thinks it ought to be, the author should have
expressed the subject by שׁמע אלה ולא יגיד, - but is simple as the order
of the words and the verbal form require it. The oath is, after [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md), that of the judge who adjures the
partner of the thief by God to tell the truth; but he conceals it, and
burdens his soul with a crime worthy of death, for from a concealer he
becomes in addition a perjured man.

[Proverbs 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#025.md)

25 Fear of man bringeth a snare with it;

But he that trusteth in Jahve is advanced.

It sounds strange, Hitzig remarks, that here in the Book of an Oriental
author one should be warned against the fear of man. It is enough, in
reply to this, to point to [Isa 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012.md).
One of the two translations in the lxx (cf. Jerome and Luther) has found
this "strange" thought not so strange as not to render it, and that in
the gnomic aorist: φοβηθέντες καὶ αἰσχυνθέντες ἀνθρώπους ὑπεσκελίσθησαν.
And why should not חרדּת אדם be able to mean the fear of man
(cowardice)? Perhaps not so that אדם is the gen. objecti, but so that
חרדת אדם means to frighten men, as in [Sa1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015.md). חרדת אלהים, a trembling of God;
cf. [Psa 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#002.md); פחד איב, the fear
occasioned by the enemy, although this connection, after [Deu
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025.md), can also mean fear of the enemy
(gen. objecti). To יתּן, occasioned = brings as a consequence with it,
cf. [Pro 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010.md); [Pro
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015.md); the synallage generis is as at
[Pro 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#025.md) : it is at least strange
with fem. infinit. and infinitival nouns, [Pro
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#016.md); [Pro
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#014.md); [Psa
73:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#028); but חרדּה (trembling.md) is such a
nom. actionis, Ewald, 238a. Regarding ישׂגּב (for which the lxx.1
σωθήσεται, and lxx2 εὐφρανθήσεται = ישׂמח), vid., at [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md). He who is put into a terror by
a danger with which men threaten him, so as to do from the fear of man
what is wrong, and to conceal the truth, falls thereby into a snare laid
by himself - it does not help him that by this means he has delivered
himself from the danger, for he brands himself as a coward, and sins
against God, and falls into an agony of conscience (reproach and anguish
of heart) which is yet worse to bear than the evil wherewith he was
threatened. It is only confidence in God that truly saves. The fear of
man plunges him into yet greater suffering than that from which he would
escape; confidence in God, on the other hand, lifts a man internally,
and at last externally, above all his troubles.

[Proverbs 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 29:26</span></span>

A similar gen. connection to that between חרדת אדם exists between
משׁפט־אישׁ:

Many seek the countenance of the ruler;

Yet from Jahve cometh the judgment of men.

Line first is a variation of [Pro
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006.md), cf. [Kg1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#024.md). It lies near to interpret אישׁ
as gen. obj.: the judgment regarding any one, i.e., the estimating of
the man, the decision regarding him; and it is also possible, for
משׁפּטי, [Psa 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002.md), may be understood
of the judgment which I have, as well as of the judgment pronounced
regarding me (cf. [Lam 3:59](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#059).md). But the
usage appears to think of the genit. after משׁפט always as subjective,
e.g., [Pro 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033.md), of the decision
which the lot brings, [Job 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#006.md), the
right to which the poor have a claim; so that thus in the passage before
us משׁפט־אשׁ means the right of a man, as that which is proper or
fitting to him, the judgment of a man, as that to which as appropriate
he has a claim (lxx τὸ δίκαιον ἀνδρί). Whether the genit. be rendered in
the one way or the other, the meaning remains the same: it is not the
ruler who finally decides the fate and determines the worth of a man, as
they appear to think who with eye-service court his favour and fawn upon
him.

[Proverbs 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 29:27</span></span>

27 An abomination to a righteous man is a villanous man;

And an abomination to the godless is he who walketh uprightly.

In all the other proverbs which begin with תועבת, e.g., [Pro
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#020.md), יהוה follows as genit., here
צדּיקים, whose judgment is like that of God. אישׁ עול is an abhorrence
to them, not as a man, but just as of such a character; עול is the
direct contrast to ישׁר. The righteous sees in the villanous man, who
boldly does that which is opposed to morality and to honour, an
adversary of his God; on the other hand, the godless sees in the man
that walketh uprightly (ישׁר־דּרך, as at [Psa
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#014).md) his adversary, and the
condemnation of himself.

With this doubled ת the Book of Proverbs, prepared by the men of
Hezekiah, comes to an end. It closes, in accordance with its intention
announced at the beginning, with a proverb concerning the king, and a
proverb of the great moral contrasts which are found in all circles of
society up to the very throne itself.
