### [Proverbs Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 5:1</span></span>

Here a fourth rule of life follows the three already given, [Pro
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024.md), [Pro
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#025.md), [Pro
4:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026.md) :

1 My son, attend unto my wisdom,

And incline thine ear to my prudence,

2 To observe discretion,

And that thy lips preserve knowledge.

3 For the lips of the adulteress distil honey,

And smoother than oil is her mouth;

4 But her end is bitter like wormwood,

Sharper than a two-edged sword.

5 Her feet go down to death,

Her steps cleave to Hades.

6 She is far removed from entering the way of life,

Her steps wander without her observing it.

Wisdom and understanding increase with the age of those who earnestly
seek after them. It is the father of the youth who here requests a
willing ear to his wisdom of life, gained in the way of many years'
experience and observation. In [Pro
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002.md) the inf. of the object is
continued in the finitum, as in [Pro
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#002.md), [Pro
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#008.md). מזמּות (vid., on its etymon under
[Pro 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004).md) are plans, projects,
designs, for the most part in a bad sense, intrigues and artifices
(vid., [Pro 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008).md), but also used of
well-considered resolutions toward what is good, and hence of the
purposes of God, [Jer 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#020.md). This
noble sense of the word מזמּה, with its plur., is peculiar to the
introductory portion (chap. 1-9) of the Book of Proverbs. The plur.
means here and at [Pro 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#012.md) (placing
itself with חכמות and תּבוּנות, vid., p. 68) the reflection and
deliberation which is the presupposition of well-considered action, and
שׁמר is thus not otherwise than at [Pro
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008.md), and everywhere so meant, where
it has that which is obligatory as its object: the youth is summoned to
careful observation and persevering exemplification of the quidquid
agas, prudenter agas et respice finem. In 2b the Rebia Mugrash forbids
the genitive connection of the two words דּעתו שׂפתיך; we translate: et
ut scientiam labia tua tueantur. Lips which preserve knowledge are such
as permit nothing to escape from them ([Psa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003).md) which proceeds not from the
knowledge of God, and in Him of that which is good and right, and aims
at the working out of this knowledge; vid., Khler on [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md). שׂפתיך (from שׂפה, Arab. shafat,
edge, lip, properly that against which one rubs, and that which rubs
itself) is fem., but the usage of the language presents the word in two
genders (cf. 3a with [Pro 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#023).md).
Regarding the pausal ינצרוּ for יצּרוּ, vid., under [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md); [Mal
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#011.md). The lips which distil the honey
of enticement stand opposite to the lips which distil knowledge; the
object of the admonition is to furnish a protection against the
honey-lips.

[Pro 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md)

זרה denotes the wife who belongs to another, or who does not belong to
him to whom she gives herself or who goes after her (vid., [Pro
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016).md). She appears here as the
betrayer of youth. The poet paints the love and amiableness which she
feigns with colours from the Song of Songs, [Sol
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011.md), cf. [Sol
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016.md). נפת denotes the honey flowing of
itself from the combs (צוּפים), thus the purest and sweetest; its
root-word is not נוּף, which means to shake, vibrate, and only mediately
(when the object is a fluid) to scatter, sprinkle, but, as Schultens has
observed, as verb נפת = Arab. nafat, to bubble, to spring up, nafath, to
blow, to spit out, to pour out. Parchon places the word rightly under
נפת (while Kimchi places it under נוּף after the form בּשׁת), and
explained it by חלות דבשׁ היצאים מי הכוורת קודם ריסוק (the words דבשׁ
היוצא should have been used): the honey which flows from the cells
before they are broken (the so-called virgin honey). The mouth, חך =
Arab. ḥink (from חנך, Arab. hanak, imbuere, e.g., after the manner of
Beduins, the mouth of the newly-born infant with date-honey), comes into
view here, as at [Pro 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#007.md), etc., as
the instrument of speech: smoother than oil (cf. [Psa
55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022).md), it shows itself when it gives
forth amiable, gentle, impressive words ([Pro
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md), [Pro
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024).md); also our "schmeicheln" (= to
flatter, caress) is equivalent to to make smooth and fair; in the
language of weavers it means to smooth the warp.

[Pro 5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004.md)

In [Pro 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004.md) the reverse of the sweet
and smooth external is placed opposite to the attraction of the seducer,
by whose influence the inconsiderate permits himself to be carried away:
her end, i.e., the last that is experienced of her, the final
consequence of intercourse with her (cf. [Pro
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#032).md), is bitter as wormwood, sharp
as a two-edged sword. The O.T. language regards bitterness and poison as
related both in meaning and in reality; the word לענה (Aq. ἀψίνθιον =
wormwood) means in Arab. the curse. חרב פּיּות is translated by Jerome
after the lxx, gladius biceps; but פּיפיּות means double-edged, and חרב
שׁני פיות ([Jdg 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#016).md) means a
doubled-edged sword. Here the plur. will thus poetically strengthen the
meaning, like ξίφος πολύστομον, that which devours, as if it had three
or four edges (Fl.). The end in which the disguised seduction terminates
is bitter as the bitterest, and cutting as that which cuts the most:
self-condemnation and a feeling of divine anger, anguish of heart, and
destructive judgment. The feet of the adulteress go downward to death.
In Hebr. this descendentes ad mortem is expressed by the genitive of
connection; מות is the genitive, as in יורדי בור, [Pro
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012.md); elsewhere the author uses יורדות
אל, [Pro 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027.md); [Pro
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md). Death, מות (so named from the
stretching of the corpse after the stiffness of death), denotes the
condition of departure from this side as a punishment, with which is
associated the idea of divine wrath. In שׁאול (sinking, abyss, from
שׁאל, R. של, χαλᾶν, vid., under [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014).md), lie the ideas of the grave as a
place of corruption, and of the under-world as the place of incorporeal
shadow-life. Her steps hold fast to Hades is equivalent to, they strive
after Hades and go straight to it; similar to this is the Arab.
expression, hdhâ âldrb yâkhdh âly âlbld: this way leads straight forward
to the town (Fl.).

[Pro 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006.md)

If we try to connect the clause beginning with פּן with 5b as its
principal sentence: she goes straight to the abyss, so that by no means
does she ever tread the way of life (thus e.g., Schultens), or better,
with 6b: never more to walk in the way of life, her paths fluctuate
hither and thither (as Gr. Venet. and Kamphausen in Bunsen's Bibelwerk,
after Bertheau and Ewald, translate); then in the former case more than
in the latter the difference of the subject opposes itself, and in the
latter, in addition, the לא תדע, only disturbing in this negative
clause. Also by the arrangement of the words, 6a appears as an
independent thought. But with Jewish expositors (Rashi, Aben-Ezra,
Ralbag, Malbim, etc.) to interpret תּפּלּס, after the Talmud (b. Mod
katan 9a) and Midrash, as an address is impracticable; the warning: do
not weigh the path of life, affords no meaning suitable to this
connection - for we must, with Cartwright and J. H. Michaelis, regard 6a
as the antecedent to 6b: ne forte semitam vitae ad sequendum eligas, te
per varios deceptionum meandros abripit ut non noveris, ubi locorum sis;
but then the continuation of the address is to be expected in 6b. No,
the subject to תפלם is the adulteress, and פּן is an intensified לא.
Thus the lxx, Jerome, Syr., Targ., Luther, Geier, Nolde, and among
Jewish interpreters Heidenheim, who first broke with the tradition
sanctioned by the Talmud and the Midrash, for he interpreted 6a as a
negative clause spoken in the tone of a question. But פּן is not
suitable for a question, but for a call. Accordingly, Bttcher explains:
viam vitae ne illa complanare studeat! (פּלּס in the meaning complanando
operam dare). But the adulteress as such, and the striving to come to
the way of life, stand in contradiction: an effort to return must be
meant, which, because the power of sin over her is too great, fails; but
the words do not denote that, they affirm the direct contrary, viz.,
that it does not happen to the adulteress ever to walk in the way of
life. As in the warning the independent פּן may be equivalent to cave ne
([Job 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#013).md), so also in the
declaration it may be equivalent to absit ut, for פּן (from פּנה, after
the forms בּן = Arab. banj. עץ = Arab. 'aṣj) means turning away,
removal. Thus: Far from taking the course of the way of life (which has
life as its goal and reward) - for פּלּס, to open, to open a road ([Psa
78:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#050).md), has here the meaning of the
open road itself - much rather do her steps wilfully stagger ([Jer
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#010).md) hither and thither, they go
without order and without aim, at one time hither, at another time
thither, without her observing it; i.e., without her being concerned at
this, that she thereby runs into the danger of falling headlong into the
yawning abyss. The unconsciousness which the clause לא תדע esu
expresses, has as its object not the falling ([Psa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008).md), of which there is here nothing
directly said, but just this staggering, vacillation, the danger of
which she does not watch against. נעו has Mercha under the ע with
Zinnorith preceding; it is Milra \[an oxytone\] (Michlol 111b); the
punctuation varies in the accentuations of the form without evident
reason: Olsh. 233, p. 285. The old Jewish interpreters (and recently
also Malbim) here, as also at [Pro
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md), by the זרה \[strange woman\]
understand heresy (מינות), or the philosophy that is hostile to
revelation; the ancient Christian interpreters understood by it folly
(Origen), or sensuality (Procopius), or heresy (Olympiodorus), or false
doctrine (Polychronios). The lxx, which translates, [Pro
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#005.md), רגליה by τῆς ἀφροσύνης οἱ πόδες,
looks toward this allegorical interpretation. But this is unnecessary,
and it is proved to be false from [Pro
5:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md), where the זרה is contrasted
with the married wife.

[Proverbs 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 5:7</span></span>

The eighth discourse springs out of the conclusion of the seventh, and
connects itself by its reflective מעליה so closely with it that it
appears as its continuation; but the new beginning and its contents
included in it, referring only to social life, secures its relative
independence. The poet derives the warning against intercourse with the
adulteress from the preceding discourse, and grounds it on the
destructive consequences.

7 And now, ye sons, hearken unto me,

And depart not from the words of my mouth.

8 Hold thy path far from her neighbourhood,

And come not to the door of her house!

9 That thou mayest not give the freshness of thy youth to another,

Nor thy years to the cruel one;

10 That strangers may not sate themselves with thy possessions,

And the fruit of thy toils come into the house of a stranger,

11 And thou groanest at the end,

When thy flesh and thy body are consumed.

Neither here nor in the further stages of this discourse is there any
reference to the criminal punishment inflicted on the adulterer, which,
according to [Lev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md), consisted in
death, according to [Eze 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#040.md), cf.
John. [Pro 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#005.md), in stoning, and
according to a later traditional law, in strangulation (חנק). Ewald
finds in [Pro 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#014.md) a play on this
punishment of adultery prescribed by law, and reads from [Pro
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009.md). that the adulterer who is caught
by the injured husband was reduced to the state of a slave, and was
usually deprived of his manhood. But that any one should find pleasure
in making the destroyer of his wife his slave is a far-fetched idea, and
neither the law nor the history of Israel contains any evidence for this
punishment by slavery or the mutilation of the adulterer, for which
Ewald refers to Grimm's Deutsche Rechtsaltertmer. The figure which is
here sketched by the poet is very different. He who goes into the net of
the wanton woman loses his health and his goods. She stands not alone,
but has her party with her, who wholly plunder the simpleton who goes
into her trap. Nowhere is there any reference to the husband of the
adulteress. The poet does not at all think on a married woman. And the
word chosen directs our attention rather to a foreigner than to an
Israelitish woman, although the author may look upon harlotry as such as
heathenish rather than Israelitish, and designate it accordingly. The
party of those who make prostitutes of themselves consists of their
relations and their older favourites, the companions of their gain, who
being in league with her exhaust the life-strength and the resources of
the befooled youth (Fl.). This discourse begins with ועתּה, for it is
connected by this concluding application (cf. [Pro
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#024).md) with the preceding.

[Pro 5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#008.md)

In [Pro 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#008.md), one must think on such as
make a gain of their impurity. מעל, Schultens remarks, with reference to
[Eze 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#018.md), crebrum in rescisso omni
commercio: מן denotes the departure, and על the nearness, from which one
must remove himself to a distance. Regarding הוד gn ([Pro
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009).md), which primarily, like our Pracht
(bracht from brechen = to break) pomp, magnificence, appears to mean
fulness of sound, and then fulness of splendour, see under [Job
39:20](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#020.md); here there is a reference to
the freshness or the bloom of youth, as well as the years, against the
sacrifice of which the warning is addressed - in a pregnant sense they
are the fairest years, the years of youthful fulness of strength. Along
with אחרים the singulare-tantum אכזרי (vid., [Jer
50:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#042).md) has a collective sense;
regarding the root-meaning, vid., under [Isa
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md). It is the adj. relat. of אכזר
after the form אכזב, which is formed not from אך זר, but from an unknown
verb כּזר. The ancients referred it to death and the devil; but the
אכזרי belongs to the covetous society, which impels ever anew to sin,
which is their profit, him who has once fallen into it, and thus brings
bodily ruin upon him; they are the people who stand far aloof from this
their sacrifice, and among them are barbarous, rude, inexorably cruel
monsters (Unmenschen) (Graecus Venetus, τῷ ἀπανθρώπῳ), who rest not till
their victim is laid prostrate on the ground and ruined both bodily and
financially.

[Pro 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#010.md)

This other side of the ruin [Pro 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#010.md)
presents as an image of terror. For הוד refers to the person in his
stately appearance, but כּח to his possessions in money and goods; for
this word, as well as in the strikingly similar passage [Hos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009.md), is used as the synonym of חיל
([Gen 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#029), etc..md), in the sense of
ability, estate. This meaning is probably mediated by means of a
metonymy, as [Gen 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#012.md); [Job
31:39](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#039.md), where the idea of the
capability of producing is passed over into that of the produce
conformable to it; so here the idea of work-power passes over into that
of the gain resulting therefrom. ועצביך (and thy toils) is not, like
כּחך, the accusative governed by ישׂבּעוּ; the carrying over of this
verb disturbs the parallelism, and the statement in the passage besides
does not accord therewith, which, interpreted as a virtual predicate,
presents 10b as an independent prohibitive clause: neve sint labores tui
in domo peregrini, not peregrina; at least נכרי according to the usage
of the language is always personal, so that בּית נכרי (cf. [Lam
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#002).md), like מלבושׁ נכרי, [Zep
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#008.md), is to be explained after עיר
נכרי, [Jdg 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#012.md). עצב (from עצב, Arab.
'aṣab, to bind fast, to tie together, then to make effort, ποιεῖν,
laborare) is difficult work ([Pro
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022).md), and that which is obtained by
it; Fleischer compares the Ital. i miei sudori, and the French mes
sueurs.

[Pro 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#011.md)

The fut. ישׂבּעוּ and the יהיוּ needed to complete 10b are continued in
[Pro 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#011.md) in the consec. perf. נהם,
elsewhere of the hollow roaring of the sea, [Isa
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#030.md), the growling of the lion, [Pro
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015.md), here, as also [Eze
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#023.md), of the hollow groaning of men;
a word which echoes the natural sound, like הוּם, המה. The lxx, with the
versions derived from it, has καὶ μεταμεληθήσῃ, i.e., ונחמתּ (the Niph.
נחם, to experience the sorrow of repentance, also an echo-word which
imitates the sound of deep breathing) - a happy quid pro quo, as if one
interchanged the Arab. naham, fremere, anhelare, and nadam, poenitere.
That wherein the end consists to which the deluded youth is brought, and
the sorrowful sound of despair extorted from him, is stated in 11b: his
flesh is consumed away, for sensuality and vexation have worked together
to undermine his health. The author here connects together two synonyms
to strengthen the conception, as if one said: All thy tears and thy
weeping help thee nothing (Fl.); he loves this heaping together of
synonyms, as we have shown at p. 33. When the blood-relation of any one
is called שׁאר בּשׂרו, [Lev 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006.md); [Lev
25:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#049.md), these two synonyms show
themselves in subordination, as here in close relation. שׁאר appears to
be closely connected with שׁרירים, muscles and sinews, and with שׁר, the
umbilical cord, and thus to denote the flesh with respect to its
muscular nature adhering to the bones ([Mic
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002).md), as בּשׂר denotes it with respect
to its tangible outside clothed with skin (vid., under Isaiah, p. 418).

[Proverbs 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 5:12</span></span>

The poet now tells those whom he warns to hear how the voluptuary,
looking back on his life-course, passes sentence against himself.

12 And thou sayest, "Why have I then hated correction,

And my heart despised instruction!

13 And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers,

Nor lent mine ear to my instructors?

14 I had almost fallen into every vice

In the midst of the assembly and the congregation!"

The question 12a (here more an exclamation than a question) is the
combination of two: How has it become possible for me? How could it ever
come to it that.... Thus also one says in Arab.: Kyf f'alat hadhâ (Fl.).
The regimen of איך in 12b is becoming faint, and in 13b has disappeared.
The Kal נאץ (as [Pro 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#030.md); [Pro
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#005).md) signifies to despise; the Piel
intensively, to contemn and reject (R. נץ, pungere).

[Pro 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#013.md)

שׁמע בּ signifies to cleave to anything in hearing, as ראה ב is to do so
in seeing; שׁמע ל yet more closely corresponds with the classic
ἐπακούειν, obedire, e.g., [Psa 81:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#009.md);
שׁמע בּקול is the usual phrase for "hearken!"

[Pro 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#014.md)

כּמעט with the perf. following is equivalent to: it wanted but a little
that this or that should happen, e.g., [Gen
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#010.md). It is now for the most part
thus explained: it wanted but a little, and led astray by that wicked
companionship I would have been drawn away into crime, for which I would
then have been subjected to open punishment (Fl.). Ewald understands רע
directly of punishment in its extreme form, stoning; and Hitzig explains
כל־רע by "the totality of evil," in so far as the disgraceful death of
the criminal comprehends in it all other evils that are less. But
בּכל־רע means, either, into every evil, misfortune, or into every
wickedness; and since רע, in contradistinction to לב (Hitzig compares
[Eze 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005).md), is a conception of a
species, then the meaning is equivalent to in omni genere mali. The
reference to the death-punishment of the adulteress is excluded thereby,
though it cannot be denied that it might be thought of at the same time,
if he who too late comes to consider his ways were distinctly designated
in the preceding statements as an adulterer. But it is on the whole a
question whether בכל־רע is meant of the evil which follows sin as its
consequence. The usage of the language permits this, cf. [Sa2
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#008.md); [Exo
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#019.md); [Ch1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#023.md); [Psa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006.md), but no less the reference to
that which is morally bad, cf. [Exo
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#022.md) (where Keil rightly compares
with [Jo1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019).md); and הייתי (for which
in the first case one expected נפלתּי, I fell into, vid., [Pro
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017.md); [Pro
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020.md); [Pro
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014).md) is even more favourable to the
latter reference. Also בּתוך קהל ועדה (cf. on the heaping together of
synonyms under 11b), this paraphrase of the palam ac publice, with its
בּתוך (cf. [Psa 111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md); [Ch2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014).md), looks rather to a heightening
of the moral self-accusation. He found himself in all wickedness, living
and moving therein in the midst of the congregation, and thereby giving
offence to it, for he took part in the external worship and in the
practices of the congregation, branding himself thereby as a hypocrite.
That by the one name the congregation is meant in its civil aspect, and
by the other in its ecclesiastical aspect, is not to be supposed: in the
congregation of the people of the revealed law, the political and the
religious sides are not so distinguished. It is called without
distinction קהל and עדה (from יעד). Rather we would say that קהל is the
whole ecclesia, and עדה the whole of its representatives; but also the
great general council bears sometimes the one name ([Exo
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003), cf. 21.md) and sometimes the other
([Deu 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#030), cf. 28.md) - the placing of
them together serves thus only to strengthen the conception.

[Proverbs 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 5:15</span></span>

The commendation of true conjugal love in the form of an invitation to a
participation in it, is now presented along with the warning against
non-conjugal intercourse, heightened by a reference to its evil
consequences.

15 Drink water from thine own cistern,

And flowing streams from thine own fountain.

16 Shall thy streams flow abroad,

The water-brooks in the streets!

17 Let them belong to thyself alone,

And not to strangers with thee.

One drinks water to quench his thirst; here drinking is a figure of the
satisfaction of conjugal love, of which Paul says, [Co1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md), κρεῖσσόν ἐστι γαμῆσαι ἢ
πυροῦσθαι, and this comes into view here, in conformity with the
prevailing character of the O.T., only as a created inborn natural
impulse, without reference to the poisoning of it by sin, which also
within the sphere of married life makes government, moderation, and
restraint a duty. Warning against this degeneracy of the natural impulse
to the πάθος ἐπιθυμίας authorized within divinely prescribed limits, the
apostle calls the wife of any one τὸ ἑαυτοῦ σκεῦος (cf. [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007).md). So here the wife, who is his by
covenant ([Pro 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017).md), is called
"cistern" (בור)

(Note: The lxx translate ἀπὸ σῶν ἀγγείων, i.e., מכּוריך (vid.,
Lagarde).)

and "fountain" (בּאר) of the husband to whom she is married. The figure
corresponds to the sexual nature of the wife, the expression for which
is נקבה; but [Isa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md) holds to the
natural side of the figure, for according to it the wife is a pit, and
the children are brought out of it into the light of day. Aben-Ezra on
[Lev 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#036.md) rightly distinguishes
between בור and באר: the former catches the rain, the latter wells out
from within. In the former, as Rashi in Erubin ii. 4 remarks, there are
מים מכונסים, in the latter חיים מים. The post-biblical Hebrew observes
this distinction less closely (vid., Kimchi's Book of Roots), but the
biblical throughout; so far the Kerı̂, [Jer
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007.md), rightly changes בור into the form
בּיר, corresponding to the Arab. byar. Therefore בור is the cistern, for
the making of which חצב, [Jer 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md),
and באר the well, for the formation of which חפר, [Gen
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#030.md), and כרה, [Gen
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025.md), are the respective words
usually employed (vid., Malbim, Sifra 117b). The poet shows that he also
is aware of this distinction, for he calls the water which one drinks
from the בור by the name מים, but on the other hand that out of the באר
by the name נוזלים, running waters, fluenta; by this we are at once
reminded of [Sol 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#015.md), cf. 12. The בור
offers only stagnant water (according to the Sohar, the בור has no water
of its own, but only that which is received into it), although coming
down into it from above; but the באר has living water, which wells up
out of its interior (מתּוך, 15b, intentionally for the mere מן), and is
fresh as the streams from Lebanon (נזל, properly labi, to run down, cf.
אזל, placide ire, and generally ire; Arab. zâl, loco cedere, desinere;
Arab. zll, IV, to cause to glide back, deglutire, of the gourmand). What
a valuable possession a well of water is for nomads the history of the
patriarchs makes evident, and a cistern is one of the most valuable
possessions belonging to every well-furnished house. The figure of the
cistern is here surpassed by that of the fountain, but both refer to the
seeking and finding satisfaction (cf. the opposite passage, [Pro
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027).md) with the wife, and that, as the
expressive possessive suffixes denote, with his legitimate wife.

[Pro 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016.md)

Here we meet with two other synonyms standing in a similar relation of
progression. As עין denotes the fountain as to its point of outflow, so
מעין (n. loci) means water flowing above on the surface, which in its
course increases and divides itself into several courses; such a brook
is called, with reference to the water dividing itself from the point of
outflow, or to the way in which it divides, פּלג (from פּלג, [Job
38:25](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#025).md), Arab. falaj (as also the
Ethiop.) or falj, which is explained by nahar ṣaghayr (Fl.).

(Note: The latter idea (vid., under [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003).md) lies nearer, after [Job
38:25](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#025.md) : the brook as dividing channels
for itself, or as divided into such; falj (falaj) signifies, according
to the representation [Isa 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008.md), also
like fajr, the morning-light (as breaking forth from a cleft).)

We cannot in this double figure think of any reference to the generative
power in the sperma; similar figures are the waters of Judah, [Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md), and the waters of Israel flowing
forth as if from a bucket, [Num 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007.md),
where זרעו is the parallel word to מים, cf. also the proper name מואב
(from מו = מוי from מוה, diffluere), aqua h.e. semen patris, and שׁגל,
[Deu 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030.md), = Arab. sajal (whence sajl
= דּלי, situla), which is set aside by the Kerı̂. Many interpreters have
by חוּצה and בּרחבות been here led into the error of pressing into the
text the exhortation not to waste the creative power in sinful lust. The
lxx translates יפצוּ by ὑπερεκχείσθω; but Origen, and also Clemens
Alexandrinus, used the phrase μὴ ὑπερεκχείσθω, which is found in the
Complut., Ald., and several codd., and is regarded by Lagarde, as also
Cappellus, as original: the three Gttingen theologians (Ewald, Bertheau,
and Elster) accordingly make the emendation אל־יפצוּ. But that μή of the
lxx was not added till a later period; the original expression, which
the Syro-Hexapl. authorizes, was ὑπερεκχείσθω without μή, as also in the
version of Aquila, διασκορπιζέσθωσαν without μή (vid., Field). The
Hebrew text also does not need אל. Clericus, and recently Hitzig,
Zckler, Kamphausen, avoid this remedy, for they understand this verse
interrogatively - an expedient which is for the most part and also here
unavailing; for why should not the author have written אם יפצו?
Schultens rightly remarks: nec negationi nec interrogationi ullus hic
locus, for (with Fleischer and von Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, ii. 2, 402)
he regards [Pro 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016.md) as a conclusion:
tunc exundabunt; so that he strengthens the summons of [Pro
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md) by the promise of numerous
descendants from unviolated marriage. But to be so understood, the
author ought to have written ויפצו. So, according to the text, יפצו as
jussive continues the imper. שׁתה (15a), and the full meaning according
to the connection is this: that within the marriage relation the
generative power shall act freely and unrestrained. חוּץ and רחבות
denote ([Pro 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020).md) the space free from
houses, and the ways and places which lead towards and stretch between
them; חוּץ (from חוּץ, Arab. khass, to split, seorsim ponere) is a very
relative conception, according as one thinks of that which is without as
the contrast of the house, the city, or the country. Here חוץ is the
contrast of the person, and thus that which is anywhere without it,
whereto the exercise of its manly power shall extend. The two figurative
expressions are the description of the libero flumine, and the contrast,
that restriction of self which the marriage relation, according to [Co1
7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#003.md), condemns.

[Pro 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#017.md)

That such matters as there are thought of, is manifest from this verse.
As זרע comprehends with the cause (sperma) the effect (posterity), so,
in [Pro 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016.md), with the effusio roboris
virilis is connected the idea of the beginnings of life. For the
subjects of [Pro 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#017.md) are the
effusiones seminis named in [Pro 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016.md).
These in their effects ([Pro 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#017).md) may
belong to thee alone, viz., to thee alone (לבדּך, properly in thy
separateness) within thy married relation, not, as thou hast fellowship
with other women, to different family circles, Aben-Ezra rightly regards
as the subject, for he glosses thus: הפלגים שׁהם הבנים הבשׁרים, and
Immanuel well explains יהיוּ־לך by יתיחסו לך. The child born out of
wedlock belongs not to the father alone, he knows not to whom it
belongs; its father must for the sake of his honour deny it before the
world. Thus, as Grotius remarks: ibi sere ubi prolem metas. In ואין the
יהיו is continued. It is not thus used adverbially for לא, as in the old
classic Arabic lyas for l' (Fl.), but it carries in it the force of a
verb, so that יהיו, according to rule, in the sense of ולא היו = ולא
יהיו, continues it.

[Proverbs 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 5:18</span></span>

With [Pro 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018.md) is introduced anew the
praise of conjugal love. These three verses, [Pro
5:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018.md), have the same course of
thought as [Pro 5:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md).

18 Let thy fountain be blessed,

And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.

19 The lovely hind and the graceful gazelle -

May her bosom always charm thee;

In her love mayest thou delight thyself evermore.

20 But why wilt thou be fascinated with a stranger,

And embrace the bosom of a foreign woman?

Like בור and באר, מקור is also a figure of the wife; the root-word is
קוּר, from קר, כר, the meanings of which, to dig and make round, come
together in the primary conception of the round digging out or boring
out, not קוּר = קרר, the Hiph. of which means ([Jer
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007)) to well out cold (water.md). It is
the fountain of the birth that is meant (cf. מקור of the female ערוה,
e.g., [Lev 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018).md), not the procreation
(lxx, ἡ σὴ φλέψ, viz., φλὲψ γονίμη); the blessing wished for by him is
the blessing of children, which בּרוּך so much the more distinctly
denotes if בּרך, Arab. barak, means to spread out, and בּרך thus to
cause a spreading out. The מן, 18b, explains itself from the idea of
drawing (water), given with the figure of a fountain; the word בּאשׁת
found in certain codices is, on the contrary, prosaic (Fl.). Whilst שׂמח
מן is found elsewhere ([Ecc 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020.md); [Ch2
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#027).md) as meaning almost the same as
שׂמח בּ; the former means rejoicing from some place, the latter in
something. In the genitive connection, "wife of thy youth" (cf. [Pro
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017).md), both of these significations
lie: thy youthful wife, and she who was chosen by thee in thy youth,
according as we refer the suffix to the whole idea or only to the second
member of the chain of words.

[Pro 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019.md)

The subject, 19a, set forth as a theme courts love for her who is to be
loved, for she presents herself as lovely. איּלת is the female of the
stag, which may derive its name איּל from the weapon-power of its horns,
and יעלה (from יעל, Arab. w'al, to climb), that of the wild-goat (יעל);
and thus properly, not the gazelle, which is called צבי on account of
its elegance, but the chamois. These animals are commonly used in
Semitic poetry as figures of female beauty on account of the delicate
beauty of their limbs and their sprightly black eyes. אהבים signifies
always sensual love, and is interchanged in this erotic meaning ([Pro
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#018).md) with דּודים. In 19b the
predicate follows the subject. The Graec. Venet. translates as if the
word were דודיה, and the Syr. as if it were דרכיה, but Aquila rightly
translates τίτθοι αὐτῆς. As τίτθος is derived (vid., Curtius, Griech.
Etymologie, Nr. 307) from dhâ, to suck (causative, with anu, to put to
sucking), so דּד, שׁד, תּד, Arab. thady (commonly in dual thadjein),
from שׁדה, Arab. thdy, rigare, after which also the verb ירוּוּך is
chosen: she may plentifully give thee to drink; figuratively equivalent
to, refresh or (what the Aram. רוּי precisely means) fascinate

(Note: Many editions have here בּכל־; but this Dagesh, which is contrary
to rule, is to be effaced.)

thee, satisfy thee with love. דּדּים also is an erotic word, which
besides in this place is found only in Ezekiel ([Eze
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003.md), [Eze
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#008.md), [Eze
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#021).md). The lxx obliterates the strong
sensual colouring of this line. In 19c it changes תּשׁגּה into תשׂגה,
πολλοστὸς ἔσῃ, perhaps also because the former appeared to be too
sensual. Moses ha-Darshan (in Rashi) proposes to explain it after the
Arab. sjy, to cover, to cast over, to come over anything (III = עסק, to
employ oneself with something): engage thyself with her love, i.e., be
always devoted to her in love. And Immanuel himself, the author of a
Hebrew Divan expatiating with unparalleled freedom in erotic
representations, remarks, while he rightly understands תשׁגה of the
fascination of love: קורא התמדת חשׁקו אפילו באשׁתו שׁגגה, he calls the
husband's continual caressing of the wife an error. But this moral
side-glance lies here at a distance from the poet. He speaks here of a
morally permissible love-ecstasy, or rather, since תמיד excludes that
which is extraordinary, of an intensity of love connected with the
feeling of superabundant happiness. שׁגה properly signifies to err from
the way, therefore figuratively, with ב of a matter, like delirare ea,
to be wholly captivated by her, so that one is no longer in his own
power, can no longer restrain himself - the usual word for the
intoxication of love and of wine, [Pro
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001) (Fl..md).

[Pro 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#020.md)

The answer to the Why? in this verse is: no reasonable cause - only
beastly sensuality, only flagitious blindness can mislead thee. The ב of
בזרה is, as 19b and [Isa 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md), that of
the object through which one is betrayed into intoxication. חק (thus,
according to the Masora, four times in the O.T. for חיק) properly means
an incision or deepening, as Arab. hujr (from hjr, cohibere), the front
of the body, the part between the arms or the female breasts, thus the
bosom, [Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md) (with the swelling
part of the clothing, sinus vestis, which the Arabs call jayb), and the
lap; חבּק (as [Pro 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#008).md), to embrace,
corresponds here more closely with the former of these meanings; also
elsewhere the wife of any one is called אשת חיקו or השׁכבת בחיקו, as she
who rests on his breast. The ancients, also J. H. Michaelis, interpret
[Pro 5:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md) allegorically, but
without thereby removing sensual traces from the elevated N.T.
consciousness of pollution, striving against all that is fleshly; for
the castum cum Sapientia conjugium would still be always represented
under the figure of husband and wife dwelling together. Besides, though
זרה might be, as the contrast of חכמה, the personified lust of the world
and of the flesh, yet 19a is certainly not the חכמה, but a woman
composed of flesh and blood. Thus the poet means the married life, not
in a figurative sense, but in its reality - he designedly describes it
thus attractively and purely, because it bears in itself the
preservative against promiscuous fleshly lust.

[Proverbs 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 5:21</span></span>

That the intercourse of the sexes out of the married relationship is the
commencement of the ruin of a fool is now proved.

21 For the ways of every one are before the eyes of Jahve,

And all his paths He marketh out.

22 His own sins lay hold of him, the evil-doer,

And in the bands of his sins is he held fast.

23 He dies for the want of correction,

And in the fulness of his folly he staggers to ruin.

It is unnecessary to interpret נכח as an adverbial accusative: straight
before Jahve's eyes; it may be the nominative of the predicate; the ways
of man (for אישׁ is here an individual, whether man or woman) are an
object (properly, fixing) of the eyes of Jahve. With this the thought
would suitably connect itself: et onmes orbitas ejus ad amussim
examinat; but פּלּס, as the denom. of פּלס, [Psa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003.md), is not connected with all the
places where the verb is united with the obj. of the way, and [Psa
78:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#050.md) shows that it has there the
meaning to break though, to open a way (from פל, to split, cf. Talmudic
מפלּשׁ, opened, accessible, from פלשׁ, Syriac pelaa, perfodere, fodiendo
viam, aditum sibi aperire). The opening of the way is here not, as at
[Isa 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007.md), conceived of as the setting
aside of the hindrances in the way of him who walks, but generally as
making walking in the way possible: man can take no step in any
direction without God; and that not only does not exempt him from moral
responsibility, but the consciousness of this is rather for the first
time rightly quickened by the consciousness of being encompassed on
every side by the knowledge and the power of God. The dissuasion of [Pro
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#020.md) is thus in [Pro
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021.md) grounded in the fact, that man at
every stage and step of his journey is observed and encompassed by God:
it is impossible for him to escape from the knowledge of God or from
dependence on Him. Thus opening all the paths of man, He has also
appointed to the way of sin the punishment with which it corrects
itself: "his sins lay hold of him, the evil-doer." The suffix יו does
not refer to אישׁ of [Pro 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021.md), where
every one without exception and without distinction is meant, but it
relates to the obj. following, the evil-doer, namely, as the explanatory
permutative annexed to the "him" according to the scheme, [Exo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006.md); the permutative is distinguished
from the apposition by this, that the latter is a forethought
explanation which heightens the understanding of the subject, while the
former is an explanation afterwards brought in which guards against a
misunderstanding. The same construction, [Pro
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013.md), belonging to the syntaxis
ornata in the old Hebrew, has become common in the Aramaic and in the
modern Hebrew. Instead of ילכּדוּהוּ ([Pro
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#022).md), the poet uses poetically
ילכּדנו; the interposed נ may belong to the emphatic ground-form
ילכּדוּן, but is epenthetic if one compares forms such as קבנו (R. קב),
[Num 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013) (cf. p. 73.md). The חמּאתו
governed by חבלי, laquei (חבלי, tormina), is either gen. exeg.: bands
which consist in his sin, or gen. subj.: bands which his sin unites, or
better, gen. possess.: bands which his sin brings with it. By these
bands he will be held fast, and so will die: he (הוּא referring to the
person described) will die in insubordination (Symm. δι ̓ ἀπαιδευσίαν),
or better, since אין and רב are placed in contrast: in want of
correction. With the ישׁגּה ([Pro
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023).md), repeated purposely from [Pro
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#020.md), there is connected the idea of
the overthrow which is certain to overtake the infatuated man. In [Pro
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#020.md) the sense of moral error began
already to connect itself with this verb. אוּלת is the right name of
unrestrained lust of the flesh. אולת is connected with אוּל, the belly;
אול, Arab. âl, to draw together, to condense, to thicken (Isaiah, p.
424). Dummheit (stupidity) and the Old-Norse dumba, darkness, are in
their roots related to each other. Also in the Semitic the words for
blackness and darkness are derived from roots meaning condensation. אויל
is the mind made thick, darkened, and become like crude matter.
