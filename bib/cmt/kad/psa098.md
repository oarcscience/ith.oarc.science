[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 98:0</span></span>

Greeting to Him Who Is Become Known in Righteousness and Salvation

This is the only Psalm which is inscribed מזמור without further
addition, whence it is called in B. Aboda Zara, 24b, מזמורא יתומא (the
orphan Psalm). The Peshמto Syriac inscribes it De redemtione populi ex
Aegypto; the "new song," however, is not the song of Moses, but the
counterpart of this, cf. [Rev 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md).
There "the Lord reigneth" resounded for the first time, at the sea; here
the completion of the beginning there commenced is sung, viz., the final
glory of the divine kingdom, which through judgment breaks through to
its full reality. The beginning and end are taken from [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md). Almost all that lies between
is taken from the second part of Isaiah. This book of consolation for
the exiles is become as it were a Castalian spring for the religious
lyric.

[Psalms 98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 98:1</span></span>

[Psa 98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md) we have already read in [Psa
96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md). What follows in [Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md) is taken from [Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md); [Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md), cf. [Psa
98:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#007.md), [Psa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#016.md), cf. [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md). The primary passage, [Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md), shows that the Athnach of [Psa
98:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#002.md) is correctly placed. לעיני is the
opposite of hearsay (cf. Arab. l-l-‛yn, from one's own observation, opp.
Arab. l-l-chbr, from the narrative of another person). The dative לבית
ישראל depends upon ויּזכּר, according to [Psa
106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045.md), cf. [Luk
1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054.md).

[Psalms 98:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 98:4</span></span>

The call in [Psa 98:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004.md) demands some
joyful manifestation of the mouth, which can be done in many ways; in
[Psa 98:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#005.md) the union of song and the
music of stringed instruments, as of the Levites; and in [Psa
98:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#006.md) the sound of wind instruments, as
of the priests. On [Psa 98:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004.md) cf. [Isa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023.md); [Isa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013.md); [Isa
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#009.md), together with [Isa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007.md) (inasmuch as פּצחוּ ורננוּ is
equivalent to פּצחוּ רנּה). קול זמרה is found also in [Isa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 98:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 98:7</span></span>

Here, too, it is all an echo of the earlier language of Psalms and
prophets: [Psa 98:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#007.md) = [Psa
96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md); [Psa
98:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#007.md) like [Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md); [Psa
98:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#008.md) after [Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md) (where we find מחא כּף instead
of the otherwise customary תּקע כּף, [Psa
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md); or הכּה כּף, [Kg2
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012.md), is said of the trees of the
field); [Psa 98:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#009.md) - [Psa
96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md), cf. [Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010.md). In the bringing in of nature to
participate in the joy of mankind, the clapping rivers (נהרות) are
original to this Psalm: the rivers cast up high waves, which flow into
one another like clapping hands;

(Note: Luther renders: "the water-floods exult" (frohlocken); and
Eychman's Vocabularius predicantium explains plaudere by "to exult
(frohlocken) for joy, to smite the hands together prae gaudio;" cf.
Luther's version of [Eze 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017)..md)

cf. [Hab 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md), where the abyss of the
sea lifts up its hands on high, i.e., causes its waves to run
mountain-high.
