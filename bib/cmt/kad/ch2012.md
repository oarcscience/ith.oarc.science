### [2 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 12:1</span></span>

Rehoboam's defection from the Lord, and his humiliation by the Egyptian
king Shishak. - [Ch2 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001). The
infinitive כּהכין, "at the time of the establishing," with an indefinite
subject, may be expressed in English by the passive: when Rehoboam's
royal power was established. The words refer back to [Ch2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017). כּחזקתו, "when he had become
strong" (חזקה is a nomen verbale: the becoming strong; cf. [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016); [Ch2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#002)), he forsook the Lord, and all
Israel with him. The inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah are here called
Israel, to hint at the contrast between the actual conduct of the people
in their defection from the Lord, and the destiny of Israel, the people
of God. The forsaking of the law of Jahve is in substance the fall into
idolatry, as we find it stated more definitely in [Kg1
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#022).

[2 Chronicles 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 12:2</span></span>

In punishment of this defection (בי מעלוּ כּי, because they had acted
faithlessly to Jahve), Shishak, the king of Egypt, marched with a great
host against Jerusalem. This hostile invasion is also briefly narrated
in [Kg1 14:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025). Shishak (Sisak) is,
as we have remarked on 1 Kings 14, Sesonchis or Sechonchosis, the first
king of the 22nd dynasty, who has celebrated his victory in a relief at
Karnak. In this sculpture the names of the cities captured are recorded
on shields, and a considerable number have been deciphered with some
certainty, and by them our account is completely confirmed. According to
[Ch2 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003), Shishak's host consisted of
1200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen-numbers which, of course, are founded
only upon a rough estimate-and an innumerable multitude of footmen,
among whom were לוּבים, Libyans, probably the Libyaegyptii of the
ancients (see on [Gen 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013)); סכּיּים,
according to the lxx and Vulg. Troglodytes, probably the Ethiopian
Troglodytes, who dwelt in the mountains on the west coast of the Arabian
Gulf; and Cushites, i.e., Ethiopians. The Libyans and Cushites are
mentioned in [Nah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#009) also as
auxiliaries of the Egyptians.

[2 Chronicles 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 12:4</span></span>

After the capture of the fenced cities of Judah, he marched against
Jerusalem. - [Ch2 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005). Then the
prophet Shemaiah announced to the king and the princes, who had retired
to Jerusalem before Shishak, that the Lord had given them into the power
of Shishak because they had forsaken Him. בּיד עזב, forsaken and given
over into the hand of Shishak. When the king and the priests immediately
humbled themselves before God, acknowledging the righteousness of the
Lord, the prophet announced to them further that the Lord would not
destroy them since they had humbled themselves, but would give them
deliverance in a little space. כּמעט, according to a little, i.e., in a
short time. פּליטה is accusative after ונתתּי. My anger shall not pour
itself out upon Jerusalem. The pouring out of anger is the designation
of an exterminating judgment; cf. [Ch2
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#025).

[2 Chronicles 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 12:8</span></span>

But (כּי after a negative clause) they shall be his servants, sc. for a
short time (see [Ch2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#007)), "that they
may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries"
(cf. [Ch1 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#030)); i.e., that they may
learn to know by experience the difference between the rule of God and
that of the heathen kings, and that God's rule was not so oppressive as
that of the rulers of the world.

[2 Chronicles 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 12:9</span></span>

With [Ch2 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#009) the account of the war
is taken up again and continued by the repetition of the words, "Then
marched Shishak ... against Jerusalem" ([Ch2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#004)). Shishak plundered the treasures
of the temple and the palace; he had consequently captured Jerusalem.
The golden shields also which had been placed in the house of the forest
of Lebanon, i.e., the palace built by Solomon in Jerusalem, which
Solomon had caused to be made (cf. [Ch2
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#016)), Shishak took away, and in their
place Rehoboam caused brazen shields to be prepared; see on [Kg1
14:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026). - In [Ch2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#012) the author of the Chronicle
concludes the account of this event with the didactic remark, "Because
he (Rehoboam) humbled himself, the anger of Jahve was turned away from
him." להשׁחית ולא, and it was not to extermination utterly (לכלה,
properly to destruction, i.e., completely; cf. [Eze
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#013)). And also in Judah were good
things. This is the other motive which caused the Lord to turn away His
wrath. Good things are proofs of piety and fear of God, cf. [Ch2
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#003).

[2 Chronicles 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 12:13</span></span>

The length of Rehoboam's reign, his mother, and the judgment about him.
Cf. [Kg1 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021) and [Kg1
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#022). ויּתחזּק here, as in [Ch2
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#021), can, in its connection with
what precedes, be only understood to mean that Rehoboam, after his
humiliation at the hands of Shishak, by which his kingdom was utterly
weakened and almost destroyed, again gained strength and power. Cf. also
[Ch2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001), where יתחזּק is used of
Solomon in the beginning of his reign, after he overcame Adonijah, the
pretender to the crown, and his party. - As to the age of Rehoboam,
etc., see on [Kg1 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021). הרע ויּעשׂ,
[Ch2 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#014), is defined by the
addition, "for he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord." For the
expression cf. [Ch2 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#003); [Ch2
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#019); [Ezr
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#010).

[2 Chronicles 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 12:15</span></span>

Close of his reign. On the authorities, see the Introduction, and in
reference to the other statements, the commentary on [Kg1
14:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#029). מלחמות, wars, i.e., a state
of hostility, was between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all days, can only be
understood of the hostile attitude of the two rulers to each other, like
מלחמה in Kings; for we have no narrative of wars between them after
Rehoboam had abandoned, at the instance of the prophet, his proposed war
with the Israelites at the commencement of his reign.
