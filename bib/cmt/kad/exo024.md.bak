### [Exodus Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 24:1</span></span>

These two verses form part of the address of God in Ex 20:22-23:33; for
אמר משׁה ואל ("but to Moses He said") cannot be the commencement of a
fresh address, which would necessarily require מ אל ויּאמר (cf. [Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012.md); [Exo
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#021.md); [Exo
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022).md). The turn given to the
expression מ ואל presupposes that God had already spoken to others, or
that what had been said before related not to Moses himself, but to
other persons. But this cannot be affirmed of the decalogue, which
applied to Moses quite as much as to the entire nation (a sufficient
refutation of Knobel's assertion, that these verses are a continuation
of [Exo 19:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#020.md), and are linked on to
the decalogue), but only of the address concerning the mishpatim, or
"rights," which commences with [Exo
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022.md), and, according to [Exo
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022.md) and [Exo
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001.md), was intended for the nation, and
addressed to it, even though it was through the medium of Moses. What
God said to the people as establishing its rights, is here followed by
what He said to Moses himself, namely, that he was to go up to Jehovah,
along with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders. At the same time, it
is of course implied that Moses, who had ascended the mountain with
Aaron alone ([Exo 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#021).md), was first of
all to go down again and repeat to the people the "rights" which God had
communicated to him, and only when this had been done, to ascend again
with the persons named. According to [Exo
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003.md) and [Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012) (? 9.md), this is what Moses really
did. But Moses alone was to go near to Jehovah: the others were to
worship afar off, and the people were not to come up at all.

[Exodus 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 24:3</span></span>

The ceremony described in [Exo 24:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003.md)
is called "the covenant which Jehovah made with Israel" ([Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008).md). It was opened by Moses, who
recited to the people "all the words of Jehovah" (i.e., not the
decalogue, for the people had heard this directly from the mouth of God
Himself, but the words in [Exo
20:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022).md), and "all the rights" (ch.
21-23); whereupon the people answered unanimously (אחד קול), "All the
words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do." This constituted the
preparation for the conclusion of the covenant. It was necessary that
the people should not only know what the Lord imposed upon them in the
covenant about to be made with them, and what He promised them, but that
they should also declare their willingness to perform what was imposed
upon them. The covenant itself was commenced by Moses writing all the
words of Jehovah in "the book of the covenant" ([Exo
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#004.md) and [Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007).md), for the purpose of preserving
them in an official record. The next day, early in the morning, he built
an altar at the foot of the mountain, and erected twelve boundary-stones
or pillars for the twelve tribes, most likely round about the altar and
at some distance from it, so as to prepare the soil upon which Jehovah
was about to enter into union with the twelve tribes. As the altar
indicated the presence of Jehovah, being the place where the Lord would
come to His people to bless them ([Exo
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024).md), so the twelve pillars, or
boundary-stones, did not serve as mere memorials of the conclusion of
the covenant, but were to indicate the place of the twelve tribes, and
represent their presence also.

[Exodus 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 24:5</span></span>

After the foundation and soil had been thus prepared in the place of
sacrifice, for the fellowship which Jehovah was about to establish with
His people; Moses sent young men of the children of Israel to prepare
the sacrifices, and directed them to offer burnt-offering and sacrifice
slain-offerings, viz., שׁלמים, "peace-offerings (see at [Lev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001).md) for Jehovah," for which purpose
פּרים, bullocks, or young oxen, were used. The young men were not
first-born sons, who had officiated as priests previous to the
institution of the Levitical priesthood, according to the natural right
of primogeniture, as Onkelos supposes; nor were they the sons of Aaron,
as Augustine maintains: they simply acted as servants of Moses; and the
priestly duty of sprinkling the blood was performed by him as the
mediator of the covenant. It is merely as young men, therefore, i.e., as
strong and active, that they are introduced in this place, and not as
representatives of the nation, "by whom the sacrifice was presented, and
whose attitude resembled that of a youth just ready to enter upon his
course" (Kurtz, O. C. iii. 143). For, as Oehler says, "this was not a
sacrifice presented by the nation on its own account. The primary object
was to establish that fellowship, by virtue of which it could draw near
to Jehovah in sacrifice. Moreover, according to [Exo
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md) and [Exo
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009.md), the nation possessed its proper
representatives in the seventy elders" (Herzog's Cyclopaedia). But even
though these sacrifices were not offered by the representatives of the
nation, and for this very reason Moses selected young men from among the
people to act as servants at this ceremony, they had so far a
substitutionary position, that in their persons the nation was received
into fellowship with God by means of the sprinkling of the blood, which
was performed in a peculiar manner, to suit the unique design of this
sacrificial ceremony.

[Exodus 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 24:6</span></span>

The blood was divided into two parts. One half was swung by Moses upon
the altar (זרק to swing, shake, or pour out of the vessel, in
distinction from הזּה to sprinkle) the other half he put into basins,
and after he had read the book of the covenant to the people, and they
had promised to do and follow all the words of Jehovah, he sprinkled it
upon the people with these words: "Behold the blood of the covenant,
which Jehovah has made with you over all these words." As several
animals were slaughtered, and all of them young oxen, there must have
been a considerable quantity of blood obtained, so that the one half
would fill several basins, and many persons might be sprinkled with it
as it was being swung about. The division of the blood had reference to
the two parties to the covenant, who were to be brought by the covenant
into a living unity; but it had no connection whatever with the heathen
customs adduced by Bhr and Knobel, in which the parties to a treaty
mixed their own blood together. For this was not a mixture of different
kinds of blood, but it was a division of one blood, and that sacrificial
blood, in which animal life was offered instead of human life, making
expiation as a pure life for sinful man, and by virtue of this expiation
restoring the fellowship between God and man which had been destroyed by
sin. But the sacrificial blood itself only acquired this signification
through the sprinkling or swinging upon the altar, by virtue of which
the human soul was received, in the soul of the animal sacrificed for
man, into the fellowship of the divine grace manifested upon the altar,
in order that, through the power of this sin-forgiving and
sin-destroying grace, it might be sanctified to a new and holy life. In
this way the sacrificial blood acquired the signification of a vital
principle endued with the power of divine grace; and this was
communicated to the people by means of the sprinkling of the blood. As
the only reason for dividing the sacrificial blood into two parts was,
that the blood sprinkled upon the altar could not be taken off again and
sprinkled upon the people; the two halves of the blood are to be
regarded as one blood, which was first of all sprinkled upon the altar,
and then upon the people. In the blood sprinkled upon the altar, the
natural life of the people was given up to God, as a life that had
passed through death, to be pervaded by His grace; and then through the
sprinkling upon the people it was restored to them again, as a life
renewed by the grace of God. In this way the blood not only became a
bond of union between Jehovah and His people, but as the blood of the
covenant, it became a vital power, holy and divine, uniting Israel and
its God; and the sprinkling of the people with this blood was an actual
renewal of life, a transposition of Israel into the kingdom of God, in
which it was filled with the powers of God's spirit of grace, and
sanctified into a kingdom of priests, a holy nation of Jehovah ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006).md). And this covenant was made
"upon all the words" which Jehovah had spoken, and the people had
promised to observe. Consequently it had for its foundation the divine
law and right, as the rule of life for Israel.

[Exodus 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 24:9</span></span>

Through their consecration with the blood of the covenant, the
Israelites were qualified to ascend the mountain, and there behold the
God of Israel and celebrate the covenant meal; of course, not the whole
of the people, for that would have been impracticable on physical
grounds, but the nation in the persons of its representatives, viz., the
seventy elders, with Aaron and his two eldest sons. The fact that the
latter were summoned along with the elders had reference to their future
election to the priesthood, the bearers of which were to occupy the
position of mediators between Jehovah and the nation, an office for
which this was a preparation. The reason for choosing seventy out of the
whole body of elders ([Exo 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003).md) is to
be found in the historical and symbolical significance of this number.
"They saw the God of Israel." This title is very appropriately given to
Jehovah here, because He, the God of the fathers, had become in truth
the God of Israel through the covenant just made. We must not go beyond
the limits drawn in [Exo 33:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md) in
our conceptions of what constituted the sight (חזה [Exo
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#011).md) of God; at the same time we
must regard it as a vision of God in some form of manifestation which
rendered the divine nature discernible to the human eye. Nothing is said
as to the form in which God manifested Himself. This silence, however,
is not intended "to indicate the imperfection of their sight of God," as
Baumgarten affirms, nor is it to be explained, as Hoffmann supposes, on
the ground that "what they saw differed from what the people had
constantly before their eyes simply in this respect, that after they had
entered the darkness, which enveloped the mountain that burned as it
were with fire at its summit, the fiery sign separated from the cloud,
and assumed a shape, beneath which it was bright and clear, as an image
of untroubled bliss." The words are evidently intended to affirm
something more than, that they saw the fiery form in which God
manifested Himself to the people, and that whilst the fire was
ordinarily enveloped in a cloud, they saw it upon the mountain without
the cloud. For, since Moses saw the form (תּמוּנה) of Jehovah ([Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008).md), we may fairly conclude,
notwithstanding the fact that, according to [Exo
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#002.md), the representatives of the
nation were not to draw near to Jehovah, and without any danger of
contradicting [Deu 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#012.md) and [Deu
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015.md), that they also saw a form of
God. Only this form is not described, in order that no encouragement
might be given to the inclination of the people to make likenesses of
Jehovah. Thus we find that Isaiah gives no description of the form in
which he saw the Lord sitting upon a high and lofty throne ([Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md). Ezekiel is the first to describe
the form of Jehovah which he saw in the vision, "as the appearance of a
man" ([Eze 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md); compare [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md) and [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013).md). "And there was under His feet
as it were work of clear sapphire (לבנת, from לבנה whiteness, clearness,
not from לבנה a brick),

(Note: This is the derivation adopted by the English translators in
their rendering "paved work." - Tr.)

and as the material (עצם body, substance) of heaven in brilliancy," - to
indicate that the God of Israel was enthroned above the heaven in
super-terrestrial glory and undisturbed blessedness. And God was willing
that His people should share in this blessedness, for "He laid not His
hand upon the nobles of Israel," i.e., did not attack them. "They saw
God, and did eat and drink," i.e., they celebrated thus near to Him the
sacrificial meal of the peace-offerings, which had been sacrificed at
the conclusion of the covenant, and received in this covenant meal a
foretaste of the precious and glorious gifts with which God would endow
and refresh His redeemed people in His kingdom. As the promise in [Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md), with which God opened the way
for the covenant at Sinai, set clearly before the nation that had been
rescued from Egypt the ultimate goal of its divine calling; so this
termination of the ceremony was intended to give to the nation, in the
persons of its representatives, a tangible pledge of the glory of the
goal that was set before it. The sight of the God of Israel was a
foretaste of the blessedness of the sight of God in eternity, and the
covenant meal upon the mountain before the face of God was a type of the
marriage supper of the Lamb, to which the Lord will call, and at which
He will present His perfected Church in the day of the full revelation
of His glory ([Rev 19:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007).md).

[Exodus 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 24:12</span></span>

[Exo 24:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012.md) prepare the way for the
subsequent revelation recorded in ch. 25-31, which Moses received
concerning the erection of the sanctuary. At the conclusion of the
covenant meal, the representatives of the nation left the mountain along
with Moses. This is not expressly stated, indeed; since it followed as a
matter of course that they returned to the camp, when the festival for
which God had called them up was concluded. A command was then issued
again to Moses to ascend the mountain, and remain there (והיה־שׁם), for
He was about to give him the tables of stone, with (ו as in [Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024).md) the law and commandments, which
He had written for their instruction (cf. [Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018).md).

[Exo 24:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#013.md)

When Moses was preparing to ascend the mountain with his servant Joshua
(vid., [Jos 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#009).md), he ordered the
elders to remain in the camp (בּזה i.e., where they were) till their
return, and appointed Aaron and Hur (vid., [Exo
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#010).md) as administrators of justice in
case of any disputes occurring among the people. דּברים מי־בעל whoever
has matters, matters of dispute (on this meaning of בּעל see [Gen
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#019).md).

[Exo 24:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#015.md)

When he ascended the mountain, upon which the glory of Jehovah dwelt, it
was covered for six days with the cloud, and the glory itself appeared
to the Israelites in the camp below like devouring fire (cf. [Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016).md); and on the seventh day He
called Moses into the cloud. Whether Joshua followed him we are not
told; but it is evident from [Exo
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#017.md) that he was with him on the
mountain, though, judging from [Exo
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#002.md) and [Exo
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011.md), he would not go into the
immediate presence of God.

[Exo 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#018.md)

"And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights," including
the six days of waiting, - the whole time without eating and drinking
([Deu 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#009).md). The number forty was
certainly significant, since it was not only repeated on the occasion of
his second protracted stay upon Mount Sinai ([Exo
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028.md); [Deu
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#018).md), but occurred again in the forty
days of Elijah's journey to Horeb the mount of God in the strength of
the food received from the angel ([Kg1
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#008).md), and in the fasting of Jesus at
the time of His temptation ([Mat 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002.md);
[Luk 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#002).md), and even appears to have
been significant in the forty years of Israel's wandering in the desert
([Deu 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002).md). In all these cases the
number refers to a period of temptation, of the trial of faith, as well
as to a period of the strengthening of faith through the miraculous
support bestowed by God.
