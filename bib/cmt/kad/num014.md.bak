### [Numbers Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 14:1</span></span>

Uproar among the People. - [Num
14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md). This appalling description of
Canaan had so depressing an influence upon the whole congregation (cf.
[Deu 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028.md) : they "made their heart
melt," i.e., threw them into utter despair), that they raised a loud
cry, and wept in the night in consequence. The whole nation murmured
against Moses and Aaron their two leaders, saying "Would that we had
died in Egypt or in this wilderness! Why will Jehovah bring us into this
land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should
become a prey (be made slaves by the enemy; cf. [Deu
1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#027).md)? Let us rather return into
Egypt! We will appoint a captain, they said one to another, and go back
to Egypt."

[Numbers 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 14:5</span></span>

At this murmuring, which was growing into open rebellion, Moses and
Aaron fell upon their faces before the whole of the assembled
congregation, namely, to pour out their distress before the Lord, and
move Him to interpose; that is to say, after they had made an
unsuccessful attempt, as we may supply from [Deu
1:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#029.md), to cheer up the people, by
pointing them to the help they had thus far received from God. "In such
distress, nothing remained but to pour out their desires before God;
offering their prayer in public, however, and in the sight of all the
people, in the hope of turning their minds" (Calvin). Joshua and Caleb,
who had gone with the others to explore the land, also rent their
clothes, as a sign of their deep distress at the rebellious attitude of
the people (see at [Lev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006).md), and
tried to convince them of the goodness and glory of the land they had
travelled through, and to incite them to trust in the Lord. "If Jehovah
take pleasure in us,"; they said, "He will bring us into this land. Only
rebel not ye against Jehovah, neither fear ye that people of the land;
for they are our food;" i.e., we can and shall swallow them up, or
easily destroy them (cf. [Num 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004.md);
[Num 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md); [Deu
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#016.md); [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004).md). "Their shadow is departed from
them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not!" "Their shadow" is the
shelter and protection of God (cf. Ps 91; [Psa
121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005).md). The shadow, which defends from
the burning heat of the sun, was a very natural figure in the sultry
East, to describe defence from injury, a refuge from danger and
destruction ([Isa 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002).md). The
protection of God had departed from the Canaanites, because God had
determined to destroy them when the measure of their iniquity was full
([Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md); cf. [Exo
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#024.md); [Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md); [Lev
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#023).md). But the excited people
resolved to stone them, when Jehovah interposed with His judgment, and
His glory appeared in the tabernacle to all the Israelites; that is to
say, the majesty of God flashed out before the eyes of the people in a
light which suddenly burst forth from the tabernacle (see at [Exo
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#010).md).

[Numbers 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 14:11</span></span>

Intercession of Moses. - [Num 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011.md),
[Num 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012.md). Jehovah resented the
conduct of the people as base contempt of His deity, and as utter
mistrust of Him, notwithstanding all the signs which He had wrought in
the midst of the nation; and declared that He would smite the rebellious
people with pestilence, and destroy them, and make of Moses a greater
and still mightier people. This was just what He had done before, when
the rebellion took place at Sinai ([Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010).md). But Moses, as a servant who
was faithful over the whole house of God, and therefore sought not his
own honour, but the honour of his God alone, stood in the breach on this
occasion also ([Psa 106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023).md), with a
similar intercessory prayer to that which he had presented at Horeb,
except that on this occasion he pleaded the honour of God among the
heathen, and the glorious revelation of the divine nature with which he
had been favoured at Sinai, as a motive for sparing the rebellious
nation ([Num 14:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md); cf. [Exo
32:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md), and [Exo
34:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).md). The first he expressed in
these words ([Num 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013)..md): "Not only
have the Egyptians heard that Thou hast brought out this people from
among them with Thy might; they have also told it to the inhabitants of
this land. They (the Egyptians and the other nations) have heard that
Thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of this people; that Thou, Jehovah,
appearest eye to eye, and Thy cloud stands over them, and Thou goest
before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
Now, if Thou shouldst slay this people as one man, the nations which
have heard the tidings of Thee would say, Because Jehovah was not able
to bring this people into the land which He sware to them, He has slain
them in the desert." In that case God would be regarded by the heathen
as powerless, and His honour would be impaired (cf. [Deu
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027.md); [Jos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#009).md). It was for the sake of His own
honour that God, at a later time, did not allow the Israelites to perish
in exile (cf. [Isa 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md), [Isa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md); [Isa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md); [Eze
36:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022).md). - ואמרוּ...ושׁמעוּ ([Num
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md), [Num
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014).md), et audierunt et dixerunt; ו -
ו = et - et, both - and. The inhabitants of this land ([Num
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013).md) were not merely the Arabians,
but, according to [Exo 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014.md)., the
tribes dwelling in and round Arabia, the Philistines, Edomites,
Moabites, and Canaanites, to whom the tidings had been brought of the
miracles of God in Egypt and at the Dead Sea. שׁמעוּ, in [Num
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014.md), can neither stand for שׁמעוּ
כּי (dixerunt) se audivisse, nor for שׁמעוּ אשׁר, qui audierunt. They
are neither of them grammatically admissible, as the relative pronoun
cannot be readily omitted in prose; and neither of them would give a
really suitable meaning. It is rather a rhetorical resumption of the
שׁמעוּ in [Num 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md), and the subject
of the verb is not only "the Egyptians," but also "the inhabitants of
this land" who held communication with the Egyptians, or "the nations"
who had heard the report of Jehovah ([Num
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#015).md), i.e., all that God had
hitherto done for and among the Israelites in Egypt, and on the journey
through the desert. "Eye to eye:" i.e., Thou hast appeared to them in
the closest proximity. On the pillar of cloud and fire, see at [Exo
13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md). "As one man," equivalent to
"with a stroke" ([Jdg 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#016).md). - In [Num
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#017.md), [Num
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#018.md), Moses adduces a second
argument, viz., the word in which God Himself had revealed His inmost
being to him at Sinai ([Exo 34:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).md).
The words, "Let the power be great," equivalent to "show Thyself great
in power," are not to be connected with what precedes, but with what
follows; viz., "show Thyself mighty by verifying Thy word, 'Jehovah,
long-suffering and great in mercy,' etc.; forgive, I beseech Thee, this
people according to the greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast
forgiven this people from Egypt even until now." נשׁא ([Num
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#019).md) = עון נשׁא ([Num
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#018).md).

[Numbers 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 14:20</span></span>

In answer to this importunate prayer, the Lord promised forgiveness,
namely, the preservation of the nation, but not the remission of the
well-merited punishment. At the rebellion at Sinai, He had postponed the
punishment "till the day of His visitation" ([Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034).md). And that day had now arrived,
as the people had carried their continued rebellion against the Lord to
the furthest extreme, even to an open declaration of their intention to
depose Moses, and return to Egypt under another leader, and thus had
filled up the measure of their sins. "Nevertheless," added the Lord
([Num 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md), [Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022).md), "as truly as I live, and the
glory of Jehovah will fill the whole earth, all the men who have seen My
glory and My miracles...shall not see the land which I sware unto their
fathers." The clause, "all the earth," etc., forms an apposition to "as
I live." Jehovah proves Himself to be living, by the fact that His glory
fills the whole earth. But this was to take place, not, as Knobel, who
mistakes the true connection of the different clauses, erroneously
supposes, by the destruction of the whole of that generation, which
would be talked of by all the world, but rather by the fact that,
notwithstanding the sin and opposition of these men, He would still
carry out His work of salvation to a glorious victory. The כּי in [Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022.md) introduces the substance of the
oath, as in [Isa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md); [Sa1
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#039.md); [Sa1
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#003.md); and according to the ordinary
form of an oath, אם in [Num 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023.md)
signifies "not." - "They have tempted Me now ten times." Ten is used as
the number of completeness and full measure; and this answered to the
actual fact, if we follow the Rabbins, and add to the murmuring (1) at
the Red Sea, [Exo 14:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011); (2.md) at
Marah, [Exo 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#023); (3.md) in the
wilderness of Sin, [Exo 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#002); (4.md) at
Rephidim, [Exo 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001); (5.md) at Horeb, Ex
32; (6) at Tabeerah, [Num 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001); (7.md) at
the graves of lust, [Num 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004.md).; and
(8) here again at Kadesh, the twofold rebellion of certain individuals
against the commandments of God at the giving of the manna ([Exo
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#020.md) and [Exo
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#027).md). The despisers of God should
none of them see the promised land.

[Numbers 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 14:24</span></span>

But because there was another spirit in Caleb, - i.e., not the
unbelieving, despairing, yet proud and rebellious spirit of the great
mass of the people, but the spirit of obedience and believing trust, so
that "he followed Jehovah fully" (lit., "fulfilled to walk behind
Jehovah"), followed Him with unwavering fidelity, - God would bring him
into the land into which he had gone, and his seed should possess it.
(אחרי מלּא here, and at [Num 32:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#011.md);
[Deu 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#036.md); [Jos
14:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#008.md); [Kg1
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#006.md), is a constructio praegnans for
אחרי ללכת מלּא; cf. [Ch2 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#031)..md)
According to the context, the reference is not to Hebron particularly,
but to Canaan generally, which God had sworn unto the fathers ([Num
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023.md), and [Deu
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#036.md), comp. with [Deu
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#035).md); although, when the land was
divided, Caleb received Hebron for his possession, because, according to
his own statement in [Jos 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md)., Moses
had sworn that he would give it to him. But this is not mentioned here;
just as Joshua also is not mentioned in this place, as he is at [Num
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030.md) and [Num
14:38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#038.md), but Caleb only, who opposed the
exaggerated accounts of the other spies at the very first, and
endeavoured to quiet the excitement of the people by declaring that they
were well able to overcome the Canaanites ([Num
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030).md). This first revelation of God
to Moses is restricted to the main fact; the particulars are given
afterwards in the sentence of God, as intended for communication to the
people ([Num 14:26-38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#026).md).

[Numbers 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 14:25</span></span>

The divine reply to the intercession of Moses terminated with a command
to the people to turn on the morrow, and go to the wilderness to the Red
Sea, as the Amalekites and Canaanites dwelt in the valley. "The
Amalekites," etc.: this clause furnishes the reason for the command
which follows. On the Amalekites, see at [Gen
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012.md), and [Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md). The term Canaanites is a general
epithet applied to all the inhabitants of Canaan, instead of the
Amorites mentioned in [Deu 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md), who
held the southern mountains of Canaan. "The valley" is no doubt the
broad Wady Murreh (see at [Num 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021).md),
including a portion of the Negeb, in which the Amalekites led a nomad
life, whilst the Canaanites really dwelt upon the mountains ([Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045).md), close up to the Wady Murreh.

[Numbers 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 14:26</span></span>

Sentence upon the Murmuring Congregation. - After the Lord had thus
declared to Moses in general terms His resolution to punish the
incorrigible people, and not suffer them to come to Canaan, He proceeded
to tell him what announcement he was to make to the people.

[Num 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#027.md)

This announcement commences in a tone of anger, with an aposiopesis,
"How long this evil congregation" (sc., "shall I forgive it," the
simplest plan being to supply אשּׂא, as Rosenmller suggests, from [Num
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#018).md), "that they murmur against Me?"

[Num 14:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028.md)

Jehovah swore that it should happen to the murmurers as they had spoken.
Their corpses should fall in the desert, even all who had been numbered,
from twenty years old and upwards: they should not see the land into
which Jehovah had lifted up His hand (see at [Exo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#008).md) to lead them, with the sole
exception of Caleb and Joshua. But their children, who, as they said,
would be a prey ([Num 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003).md), them
Jehovah would bring, and they should learn to know the land which the
others had despised.

[Num 14:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#032.md)

"As for you, your carcases will fall in this wilderness. But your sons
will be pasturing (i.e., will lead a restless shepherd life) in the
desert forty years, and bear your whoredom (i.e., endure the
consequences of your faithless apostasy; see [Exo
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#016).md), until your corpses are
finished in the desert," i.e., till you have all passed away.

[Num 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#034.md)

"After the number of the forty days that he have searched the land,
shall ye bear your iniquity, (reckoning) a day for a year, and know My
turning away from you," or תּנוּאה, abalienatio, from נוא ([Num
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#007).md).

[Num 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#035.md)

As surely as Jehovah had spoken this, would He do it to that evil
congregation, to those who had allied themselves against Him (נועד, to
bind themselves together, to conspire; [Num
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#011.md); [Num
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#003).md). There is no ground whatever for
questioning the correctness of the statement, that the spies had
travelled through Canaan for forty days, or regarding this as a
so-called round number - that is to say, as unhistorical. And if this
number is firmly established, there is also no ground for disputing the
forty years' sojourn of the people in the wilderness, although the
period during which the rebellious generation, consisting of those who
were numbered at Sinai, died out, was actually thirty-eight years,
reaching from the autumn of the second year after their departure from
Egypt to the middle of the fortieth year of their wanderings, and
terminating with the fresh numbering (ch. 26) that was undertaken after
the death of Aaron, and took place on the first of the fifth month of
the fortieth year ([Num 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#023.md).,
compared with [Num 33:38](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#038).md). Instead of
these thirty-eight years, the forty years of the sojourn in the desert
are placed in connection with the forty days of the spies, because the
people had frequently fallen away from God, and been punished in
consequence, even during the year and a half before their rejection; and
in this respect the year and a half could be combined with the
thirty-eight years which followed into one continuous period, during
which they bore their iniquity, to set distinctly before the minds of
the disobedient people the contrast between that peaceful dwelling in
the promised land which they had forfeited, and the restless wandering
in the desert, which had been imposed upon them as a punishment, and to
impress upon them the causal connection between sin and suffering.
"Every year that passed, and was deducted from the forty years of
punishment, was a new and solemn exhortation to repent, as it called to
mind the occasion of their rejection" (Kurtz). When Knobel observes, on
the other hand, that "it is utterly improbable that all who came out of
Egypt (that is to say, all who were twenty years old and upward when
they came out) should have fallen in the desert, with the exception of
two, and that there should have been no men found among the Israelites
when they entered Canaan who were more than sixty years of age," the
express statement, that on the second numbering there was not a man
among those that were numbered who had been included in the numbering at
Sinai, except Joshua and Caleb ([Num
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064)..md), is amply sufficient to
overthrow this "improbability" as an unfounded fancy. Nor is this
statement rendered at all questionable by the fact, that "Aaron's son
Eleazar, who entered Canaan with Joshua" ([Jos
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001), etc..md), was most likely more than
twenty years old at the time of his consecration at Sinai, as the
Levites were not qualified for service till their thirtieth or
twenty-fifth year. For, in the first place, the regulation concerning
the Levites' age of service is not to be applied without reserve to the
priests also, so that we could infer from this that the sons of Aaron
must have been at least twenty-five or thirty years old when they were
consecrated; and besides this, the priests do not enter into the
question at all, for the tribe of Levi was excepted from the numbering
in ch. 1, and therefore Aaron's sons were not included among the persons
numbered, who were sentenced to die in the wilderness. Still less does
it follow from [Jos 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#007.md) and [Jdg
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#007.md), where it is stated that, after
the conquest of Canaan, there were many still alive who had been
eye-witnesses of the wonders of God in Egypt, that they must have been
more than twenty years old when they came out of Egypt; for youths from
ten to nineteen years of age would certainly have been able to remember
such miracles as these, even after the lapse of forty or fifty years.

[Num 14:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#036.md)

But for the purpose of giving to the whole congregation a practical
proof of the solemnity of the divine threatening of punishment, the
spies who had induced the congregation to revolt, through their evil
report concerning the inhabitants of Canaan, were smitten by a "stroke
before Jehovah," i.e., by a sudden death, which proceeded in a visible
manner from Jehovah Himself, whilst Joshua and Caleb remained alive.

[Numbers 14:39](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 14:39</span></span>

(cf. [Deu 1:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#041).md). The announcement
of the sentence plunged the people into deep mourning. But instead of
bending penitentially under the judgment of God, they resolved to atone
for their error, by preparing the next morning to go to the top of the
mountain and press forward into Canaan. And they would not even suffer
themselves to be dissuaded from their enterprise by the entreaties of
Moses, who denounced it as a transgression of the word of God which
could not succeed, and predicted their overthrow before their enemies,
but went presumptuously (לעלות יעפּלוּ) up without the ark of the
covenant and without Moses, who did not depart out of the midst of the
camp, and were smitten by the Amalekites and Canaanites, who drove them
back as far as Hormah. Whereas at first they had refused to enter upon
the conflict with the Canaanites, through their unbelief in the might of
the promise of God, now, through unbelief in the severity of the
judgment of God, they resolved to engage in this conflict by their own
power, and without the help of God, and to cancel the old sin of
unbelieving despair through the new sin of presumptuous self-confidence,
- an attempt which could never succeed, but was sure to plunge deeper
and deeper into misery. Where "the top (or height) of the mountain" to
which the Israelites advanced was, cannot be precisely determined, as we
have no minute information concerning the nature of the ground in the
neighbourhood of Kadesh. No doubt the allusion is to some plateau on the
northern border of the valley mentioned in [Num
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025.md), viz., the Wady Murreh, which
formed the southernmost spur of the mountains of the Amorites, from
which the Canaanites and Amalekites came against them, and drove them
back. In [Deu 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md), Moses mentions the
Amorites instead of the Amalekites and Canaanites, using the name in a
broader sense for all the Canaanites, and contenting himself with naming
the leading foes with whom the Amalekites who wandered about in the
Negeb had allied themselves, as Bedouins thirsting for booty. These
tribes came down ([Num 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045).md) from the
height of the mountain to the lower plateau or saddle, which the
Israelites had ascended, and smote them and יכּתוּם (from כּתת, with the
reduplication of the second radical anticipated in the first: see Ewald,
193, c.), "discomfited them, as far as Hormah," or as Moses expressed it
in [Deu 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md), They "chased you, as
bees do" (which pursue with great ferocity any one who attacks or
disturbs them), "and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah." There is
not sufficient ground for altering "in Seir" into "from Seir," as the
lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate have done. But בּשׂעיר might signify "into
Seir, as far as Hormah." As the Edomites had extended their territory at
that time across the Arabah towards the west, and taken possession of a
portion of the mountainous country which bounded the desert of Paran
towards the north (see at [Num 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003).md),
the Israelites, when driven back by them, might easily be chased into
the territory of the Edomites. Hormah (i.e., the ban-place) is used here
proleptically (see at [Num 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#003).md).
