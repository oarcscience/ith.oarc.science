### [Psalms Chapter 109](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 109:0</span></span>

Imprecation upon the Curser Who Prefers the Curse to the Blessing

The אודה, corresponding like an echo to the הודו of Ps 107, is also
found here in [Psa 109:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#030.md). But Psalms
109 is most closely related to Ps 69. Anger concerning the ungodly who
requite love with ingratitude, who persecute innocence and desire the
curse instead of the blessing, has here reached its utmost bound. The
imprecations are not, however, directed against a multitude as in Ps 69,
but their whole current is turned against one person. Is this Doeg the
Edomite, or Cush the Benjamite? We do not know. The marks of Jeremiah's
hand, which raised a doubt about the לדוד of Ps 69, are wanting here;
and if the development of the thoughts appears too diffuse and
overloaded to be suited to David, and also many expressions (as the
inflected מעט in [Psa 109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008.md), the נכאה,
which is explained by the Syriac, in [Psa
109:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#016.md), and the half-passive חלל in
[Psa 109:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#022).md) look as though they
belong to the later period of the language, yet we feel on the other
hand the absence of any certain echoes of older models. For in the
parallels [Psa 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md), cf. [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md), and [Psa
109:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#018.md), [Psa
109:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#029.md), cf. [Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md), it is surely not the mutual
relationship but the priority that is doubtful; [Psa
109:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#022.md), however, in relation to [Psa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#005.md) (cf. [Psa
109:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004.md) with [Psa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#005).md) is a variation such as is also
allowable in one and the same poet (e.g., in the refrains). The
anathemas that are here poured forth more extensively than anywhere else
speak in favour of David, or at least of his situation. They are
explained by the depth of David's consciousness that he is the anointed
of Jahve, and by his contemplation of himself in Christ. The persecution
of David was a sin not only against David himself, but also against the
Christ in him; and because Christ is in David, the outbursts of the Old
Testament wrathful spirit take the prophetic form, so that this Psalm
also, like Ps 22 and Ps 69, is a typically prophetic Psalm, inasmuch as
the utterance of the type concerning himself is carried by the Spirit of
prophecy beyond himself, and thus the ara' is raised to the προφητεία ἐν
εἴδει ἀρᾶς (Chrysostom). These imprecations are not, however,
appropriate in the mouth of the suffering Saviour. It is not the spirit
of Zion but of Sinai which here speaks out of the mouth of David; the
spirit of Elias, which, according to [Luk
9:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055.md), is not the spirit of the New
Testament. This wrathful spirit is overpowered in the New Testament by
the spirit of love. But these anathemas are still not on this account so
many beatings of the air. There is in them a divine energy, as in the
blessing and cursing of every man who is united to God, and more
especially of a man whose temper of mind is such as David's. They
possess the same power as the prophetical threatenings, and in this
sense they are regarded in the New Testament as fulfilled in the son of
perdition ([Joh 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012).md). To the
generation of the time of Jesus they were a deterrent warning not to
offend against the Holy One of God, and this Psalmus Ischarioticus ([Act
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020).md) will ever be such a mirror of
warning to the enemies and persecutors of Christ and His Church.

[Psalms 109:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 109:1</span></span>

A sign for help and complaints of ungrateful persecutors form the
beginning of the Psalm. "God of my praise" is equivalent to God, who art
my praise, [Jer 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014.md), cf. [Deu
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021.md). The God whom the Psalmist has
hitherto had reason to praise will also now show Himself to him as
worthy to be praised. Upon this faith he bases the prayer: be not silent
([Psa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md); [Psa
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#022).md)! A mouth such as belongs to the
"wicked," a mouth out of which comes "deceit," have they opened against
him; they have spoken with him a tongue (accusative, vid., on [Psa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006).md), i.e., a language, of falsehood.
דּברי of things and utterances as in [Psa
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020.md). It would be capricious to take
the suffix of אהבתי in [Psa 109:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004.md) as
genit. object. (love which they owe me), and in [Psa
109:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#005.md) as genit. subject.; from [Psa
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#021.md) it may be seen that the love
which he has shown to them is also meant in [Psa
109:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004.md). The assertion that he is
"prayer" is intended to say that he, repudiating all revenges of
himself, takes refuge in God in prayer and commits his cause into His
hands. They have loaded him with evil for good, and hatred for the love
he has shown to them. Twice he lays emphasis on the fact that it is love
which they have requited to him with its opposite. Perfects alternate
with aorists: it is no enmity of yesterday; the imprecations that follow
presuppose an inflexible obduracy on the side of the enemies.

[Psalms 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 109:6</span></span>

The writer now turns to one among the many, and in the angry zealous
fervour of despised love calls down God's judgment upon him. To call
down a higher power, more particularly for punishment, upon any one is
expressed by על (הפקיד) פּקד, [Jer
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003.md); [Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md). The tormentor of innocence
shall find a superior executor who will bring him before the tribunal
(which is expressed in Latin by legis actio per manus injectionem). The
judgment scene in [Psa 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md), [Psa
109:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#007.md) shows that this is what is
intended in [Psa 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md): At the right
hand is the place of the accuser, who in this instance will not rest
before the damnatus es has been pronounced. He is called שׂטן, which is
not to be understood here after [Sa1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004.md); [Sa2
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#022.md), but after [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md); [Ch1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001.md), if not directly of Satan, still
of a superhuman (cf. [Num 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022).md) being
which opposes him, by appearing before God as his κατήγωρ; for according
to [Psa 109:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#007.md) the שׂטן is to be
thought of as accuser, and according to [Psa
109:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#007.md) God as Judge. רשׁע has the sense
of reus, and יצא refers to the publication of the sentence. [Psa
109:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#007.md) wishes that his prayer, viz.,
that by which he would wish to avert the divine sentence of
condemnation, may become לחטאה, not: a missing of the mark, i.e.,
ineffectual (Thenius), but, according to the usual signification of the
word: a sin, viz., because it proceeds from despair, not from true
penitence. In [Psa 109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008.md) the
incorrigible one is wished an untimely death (מעטּים as in one other
instance, only, [Ecc 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001).md) and the loss
of his office. The lxx renders: τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ λάβοι ἕτερος. פּקדּה
really signifies the office of overseer, oversight, office, and the one
individual must have held a prominent position among the enemies of the
psalmist. Having died off from this position before his time, he shall
leave behind him a family deeply reduced in circumstances, whose former
dwelling - place-he was therefore wealthy - becomes "ruins." His
children wander up and down far from these ruins (מן as e.g., in [Jdg
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#011.md); [Job
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004).md) and beg (דּרשׁ, like προσαιτεῖν
ἐπαιτεῖν, Sir. 40:28 = לחם בּקּשׁ, [Psa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025).md). Instead of ודרשׁוּ the reading
ודרשׁוּ is also found. A Poel is now and then formed from the strong
verbs also,

(Note: In connection with the strong verb it frequently represents the
Piel which does not occur, as with דּרשׁ, לשׁן, שׁפט, or even represents
the Piel which, as in the case of שׁרשׁ, is already made use of in
another signification (Piel, to root out; Poel, to take root).)

in the inflexion of which the Cholem is sometimes shortened to Kametz
chatuph; vid., the forms of לשׁן, to slander, in [Psa
101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005.md), תּאר, to sketch, mark out in
outline, [Isa 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#013.md), cf. also [Job
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026) (תּאכלהוּ.md) and [Isa
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#009.md) (according to the reading
מאספיו). To read the Kametz in these instances as ā, and to regard these
forms as resolved Piels, is, in connection with the absence of the
Metheg, contrary to the meaning of the pointing; on purpose to guard
against this way of reading it, correct codices have ודרשׁוּ (cf. [Psa
69:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#019).md), which Baer has adopted.

[Psalms 109:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 109:11</span></span>

The Piel נקּשׁ properly signifies to catch in snares; here, like the
Arabic Arab. nqš, II, IV, corresponding to the Latin obligare (as
referring to the creditor's right of claim); nosheh is the name of the
creditor as he who gives time for payment, gives credit (vid., [Isa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002).md). In [Psa
109:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#012.md) משׁך חסד, to draw out mercy, is
equivalent to causing it to continue and last, [Psa
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011.md), cf. [Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003.md). אחריתו, [Psa
109:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#013.md), does not signify his future,
but as [Psa 109:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#013.md) (cf. [Psa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#038).md) shows: his posterity. יהי
להכרית is not merely exscindatur, but exscindenda sit ([Eze
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#016.md), cf. [Jos
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#006).md), just as in other instances חיה ל
corresponds to the active fut. periphrasticum, e.g., [Gen
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md); [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026.md). With reference to ימּח instead
of ימּח (contracted from ימּחה), vid., Ges. 75, rem. 8. A Jewish
acrostic interpretation of the name ישׁוּ runs: ימּח שׁמו וזכרו. This
curse shall overtake the family of the υἱὸς τῆς ἀπωλείας. All the sins
of his parents and ancestors shall remain indelible above before God the
Judge, and here below the race, equally guilty, shall be rooted out even
to its memory, i.e., to the last trace of it.

[Psalms 109:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 109:16</span></span>

He whom he persecuted with a thirst for blood, was, apart from this, a
great sufferer, bowed down and poor and נכאה לבב, of terrified,
confounded heart. lxx κατανενυγμένον (Jerome, compunctum); but the
stem-word is not נכא (נכה), root נך, but כּאה, Syriac bā'ā', cogn. כּהה,
to cause to come near, to meet. The verb, and more especially in Niph.,
is proved to be Hebrew by [Dan 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md).
Such an one who without anything else is of a terrified heart, inasmuch
as he has been made to feel the wrath of God most keenly, this man has
persecuted with a deadly hatred. He had experienced kindness (חסד) in a
high degree, but he blotted out of his memory that which he had
experienced, not for an instant imagining that he too on his part had to
exercise חסד. The Poel מותת instead of המית points to the agonizing
death ([Isa 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md), cf. [Eze
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#010) מותי.md) to which he exposes God's
anointed. The fate of the shedder of blood is not expressed after the
manner of a wish in [Psa 109:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#016.md),
but in the historical form, as being the result that followed of inward
necessity from the matter of fact of the course which he had himself
determined upon. The verb בּוא seq. acc. signifies to surprise, suddenly
attack any one, as in [Isa 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md). The
three figures in [Psa 109:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#018.md) are
climactic: he has clothed himself in cursing, he has drunk it in like
water ([Job 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016.md); [Job
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007).md), it has penetrated even to the
marrow of his bones, like the oily preparations which are rubbed in and
penetrate to the bones.n In [Psa
109:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#019.md) the emphasis rests upon יעטּה
and upon תּמיד. The summarizing [Psa
109:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#020.md) is the close of a strophe.
פּעלּה, an earned reward, here punishment incurred, is especially
frequent in [Isa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md), e.g., [Psa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004.md); [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md); it also occurs once even in the
Tra, [Lev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#013.md). Those who answer the
loving acts of the righteous with such malevolence in word and in deed
commit a satanic sin for which there is no forgiveness. The curse is the
fruit of their own choice and deed. Arnobius: Nota ex arbitrio evenisse
ut nollet, propter haeresim, quae dicit Deum alios praedestinasse ad
benedictionem, alios ad maledictionem.

[Psalms 109:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 109:21</span></span>

The thunder and lightning are now as it were followed by a shower of
tears of deep sorrowful complaint. Ps 109 here just as strikingly
accords with Ps 69, as Ps 69 does with Ps 22 in the last strophe but
one. The twofold name Jahve Adonaj (vid., Symbolae, p. 16) corresponds
to the deep-breathed complaint. עשׂה אתּי, deal with me, i.e.,
succouring me, does not greatly differ from לי in [Sa1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006.md). The confirmation, [Psa
109:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021.md), runs like [Psa
69:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#017.md) : Thy loving-kindness is טּוב,
absolutely good, the ground of everything that is good and the end of
all evil. Hitzig conjectures, as in [Psa
69:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#017.md), חסדך כּטוב, "according to the
goodness of Thy loving-kindness;" but this formula is without example:
"for Thy loving-kindness is good" is a statement of the motive placed
first and corresponding to the "for thy Name's sake." In [Psa
109:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#022.md) (a variation of [Psa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#005).md) חלל, not חלל, is traditional;
this חלל, as being verb. denom. from חלל, signifies to be pierced, and
is therefore equivalent to חולל (cf. [Luk
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035).md). The metaphor of the shadow in
[Psa 109:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#023.md) is as in [Psa
102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md). When the day declines, the
shadow lengthens, it becomes longer and longer (Virgil, majoresque
cadunt altis de montibus umbrae), till it vanishes in the universal
darkness. Thus does the life of the sufferer pass away. The poet
intentionally uses the Niph. נהלכתּי (another reading is נהלכתּי); it is
a power rushing upon him from without that drives him away thus after
the manner of a shadow into the night. The locust or grasshopper (apart
from the plague of the locusts) is proverbial as being a defenceless,
inoffensive little creature that is soon driven away, [Job
39:20](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#020.md). ננער, to be shaken out or off
(cf. Arabic na‛ûra, a water-wheel that fills its clay-vessels in the
river and empties them out above, and הנּער, [Zac
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#016.md), where Hitzig wishes to read
הנּער, dispulsio = dispulsi). The fasting in [Psa
109:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#024.md) is the result of the loathing
of all food which sets in with deep grief. כּחשׁ משּׁמן signifies to
waste away so that there is no more fat left.

(Note: The verbal group כחשׁ, כחד, Arab. ḥajda, kaḥuṭa, etc. has the
primary signification of withdrawal and taking away or decrease; to deny
is the same as to withdraw from agreement, and he becomes thin from whom
the fat withdraws, goes away. Saadia compares on this passage (פרה) בהמה
כחושׁה, a lean cow, Berachoth 32a. In like manner Targum II renders [Gen
41:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#027) תּורתא כהישׁתא, the lean kine..md)

In [Psa 109:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#025.md) אני is designedly
rendered prominent: in this the form of his affliction he is the butt of
their reproaching, and they shake their heads doubtfully, looking upon
him as one who is punished of God beyond all hope, and giving him up for
lost. It is to be interpreted thus after [Psa
69:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011.md).

[Psalms 109:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 109:26</span></span>

The cry for help is renewed in the closing strophe, and the Psalm draws
to a close very similarly to Ps 69 and Ps 22, with a joyful prospect of
the end of the affliction. In [Psa
109:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#027.md) the hand of God stands in
contrast to accident, the work of men, and his own efforts. All and each
one will undeniably perceive, when God at length interposes, that it is
His hand which here does that which was impossible in the eyes of men,
and that it is His work which has been accomplished in this affliction
and in the issue of it. He blesses him whom men curse: they arise
without attaining their object, whereas His servant can rejoice in the
end of his affliction. The futures in [Psa
109:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#029.md) are not now again imprecations,
but an expression of believingly confident hope. In correct texts כּמעיל
has Mem raphatum. The "many" are the "congregation" (vid., [Psa
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#023).md). In the case of the marvellous
deliverance of this sufferer the congregation or church has the pledge
of its own deliverance, and a bright mirror of the loving-kindness of
its God. The sum of the praise and thanksgiving follows in [Psa
109:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#031.md), where כּי signifies quod, and
is therefore allied to the ὅτι recitativum (cf. [Psa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025).md). The three Good Friday Psalms
all sum up the comfort that springs from David's affliction for all
suffering ones in just such a pithy sentence ([Psa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025.md); [Psa
69:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#034).md). Jahve comes forward at the
right hand of the poor, contending for him (cf. [Psa
110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005)), to save (him.md) from those who
judge ([Psa 37:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#033).md), i.e., condemn, his
soul. The contrast between this closing thought and [Psa
109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006.md). is unmistakeable. At the right
hand of the tormentor stands Satan as an accuser, at the right hand of
the tormented one stands God as his vindicator; he who delivered him
over to human judges is condemned, and he who was delivered up is "taken
away out of distress and from judgment" ([Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008).md) by the Judge of the judges, in
order that, as we now hear in the following Psalm, he may sit at the
right hand of the heavenly King. Ἐδικαιώθη ἐν πνεύματι...ἀνελήμφθη ἐν
δόξῃ! ([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016).md).
