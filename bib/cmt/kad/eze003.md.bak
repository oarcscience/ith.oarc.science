[Ezekiel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 3:1</span></span>

After the Lord had pointed out to the prophet the difficulties of the
call laid upon him, He prepared him for the performance of his office,
by inspiring him with the divine word which he is to announce. - [Eze
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008.md). And thou, son of man, hear what I
say to thee, Be not stiff-necked like the stiff-necked race; open thy
mouth, and eat what I give unto thee. [Eze
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009.md). Then I saw, and, lo, a hand
outstretched towards me; and, lo, in the same a roll of a book. [Eze
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010.md). And He spread it out before me;
the same was written upon the front and back: and there were written
upon it lamentations, and sighing, and woe. [Eze
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md). And He said to me: Son of man,
what thou findest eat; eat the roll, and go and speak to the house of
Israel. [Eze 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#002.md). Then opened I my
mouth, and He gave me this roll to eat. [Eze
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003.md). And said to me: Son of man, feed
thy belly, and fill thy body with this roll which I give thee. And I ate
it, and it was in my mouth as honey and sweetness. - The prophet is to
announce to the people of Israel only that which the Lord inspires him
to announce. This thought is embodied in symbol, in such a way that an
outstretched hand reaches to him a book, which he is to swallow, and
which also, at God's command, he does swallow; cf. [Rev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009.md). This roll was inscribed on both
sides with lamentations, sighing, and woe (הי is either abbreviated from
נהי, not = אי, or as Ewald, 101c, thinks, is only a more distinct form
of הוי or הו). The meaning is not, that upon the roll was inscribed a
multitude of mournful expressions of every kind, but that there was
written upon it all that the prophet was to announce, and what we now
read in his book. These contents were of a mournful nature, for they
related to the destruction of the kingdom, the destruction of Jerusalem
and of the temple. That Ezekiel may look over the contents, the roll is
spread out before his eyes, and then handed to him to be eaten, with the
words, "Go and speak to the children of Israel," i.e., announce to the
children of Israel what you have received into yourself, or as it is
termed in [Eze 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#004.md), דּברי, "my words."
The words in [Eze 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003.md) were spoken by
God while handing to the prophet the roll to be eaten. He is not merely
to eat, i.e., take it into his mouth, but he is to fill his body and
belly therewith, i.e., he is to receive into his innermost being the
word of God presented to him, to change it, as it were, into sap and
blood. Whilst eating it, it was sweet in his mouth. The sweet taste must
not, with Kliefoth, be explained away into a sweet "after-taste," and
made to bear this reference, that the destruction of Jerusalem would be
followed by a more glorious restoration. The roll, inscribed with
lamentation, sorrow, and woe, tasted to him sweetly, because its
contents was God's word, which sufficed for the joy and gladness of his
heart ([Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016).md); for it is
"infinitely sweet and lovely to be the organ and spokesman of the
Omnipotent," and even the most painful of divine truths possess to a
spiritually-minded man a joyful and quickening side (Hengstenberg on
[Rev 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009).md). To this it is added, that
the divine penal judgments reveal not only the holiness and
righteousness of God, but also prepare the way for the revelation of
salvation, and minister to the saving of the soul.

[Ezekiel 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 3:22</span></span>

Introduction to the first prophetic announcement. - [Eze
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md). And there came upon me there the
hand of Jehovah, and He said to me, Up! go into the valley, there will I
speak to thee. [Eze 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023.md). And I arose,
and went into the valley: and, lo, there stood the glory of Jehovah,
like the glory which I had seen at the river Chebar: and I fell upon my
face. [Eze 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024.md). And spirit came into
me, and placed me on my feet, and He spake with me, and said to me, Go,
and shut thyself in thy house. - הבּקעה is, without doubt, the valley
situated near Tel-abib. Ezekiel is to go out from the midst of the
exiles - where, according to [Eze
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015.md), he had found himself-into the
valley, because God will reveal Himself to him only in solitude. When he
had complied with this command, there appears to him there the glory of
Jehovah, in the same form in which it had appeared to him at the
Chaboras (Ezekiel 1:4-28); before it he falls, a second time, on his
face; but is also, as on the first occasion, again raised to his feet,
cf. 1:28-2:2. Hereupon the Lord commands him to shut himself up in his
house - which doubtless he inhabited in Tel-Abib - not probably "as a
sign of his future destiny," as a realistic explanation of the words,
"Thou canst not walk in their midst ([Eze
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025).md); they will prevent thee by force
from freely exercising thy vocation in the midst of the people." For in
that case the "shutting of himself up in the house" would be an
arbitrary identification with the "binding with fetters" ([Eze
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025).md); and besides, the significance
of the address ואתּה בן אדם, and its repetition in [Eze
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md) and [Eze
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001.md), would be misconceived. For as in
[Eze 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md) and [Eze
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001.md) there are introduced with this
address the principal parts of the duty which Ezekiel was to perform, so
the proper divine instruction may also first begin with the same in [Eze
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025.md); consequently the command "to
shut himself up in his house" can only have the significance of a
preliminary divine injunction, without possessing any significance in
itself; but only "serve as a means for carrying out what the prophet is
commissioned to do in the following chapters" (Kliefoth), i.e., can only
mean that he is to perform in his own house what is commanded him in
Ezekiel 4 and 5, or that he is not to leave his house during their
performance. More can hardly be sought in this injunction, nor can it at
all be taken to mean that, having shut himself up from others in his
house, he is to allow no one to approach him; but only that he is not to
leave his dwelling. For, according to [Eze
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003.md), the symbolical representation of
the siege of Jerusalem is to be a sign for the house of Israel; and
according to [Eze 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#012.md), Ezekiel is,
during this symbolical action, to bake his bread before their eyes. From
this it is seen that his contemporaries might come to him and observe
his proceedings.

[Eze 3:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025.md)

The general divine instructions. - [Eze
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025.md). And thou, son of man, lo, they
will lay cords upon thee, and bind thee therewith, so that thou canst
not go out into their midst. [Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md). And I shall make thy tongue
cleave to thy palate, that thou mayest be dumb, and mayest not serve
them as a reprover: for they are a stiff-necked generation. [Eze
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027.md). But when I speak to thee, I will
open thy mouth, that thou mayest say to them, Thus sayeth the Lord
Jehovah, Let him who wishes to hear, hear, and let him who neglects,
neglect (to hear): for they are a stiff necked generation. - The meaning
of this general injunction depends upon the determination of the subject
in נתנוּ, [Eze 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025.md). Most expositors
think of the prophet's countrymen, who are to bind him with cords so
that he shall not be able to leave his house. The words ולא תצא appear
to support this, as the suffix in בּתוכם indisputably refers to his
countrymen. But this circumstance is by no means decisive; while against
this view is the twofold difficulty - firstly, that a binding of the
prophet with cords by his countrymen is scarcely reconcilable with what
he performs in Ezekiel 4 and 5; secondly, of hostile attacks by the
exiles upon the prophet there is not a trace to be discovered in the
entire remainder of the book. The house of Israel is indeed repeatedly
described as a stiff-necked race, as hardened and obdurate towards God's
word; but any embitterment of feeling against the prophet, which should
have risen so far as to bind him, or even to make direct attempts to
prevent him from exercising his prophetic calling, can, after what is
related in [Eze 33:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030.md) regarding the
position of the people towards him, hardly be imagined. Further, the
binding and fettering of the prophet is to be regarded as of the same
kind with the cleaving of his tongue to his jaws, so that he should be
silent and not speak ([Eze 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026).md). It
is God, however, who suspends this dumbness over him; and according to
[Eze 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008.md), it is also God who binds him
with cords, so that he cannot stir from one side to the other. The
demonstrative power of the latter passage is not to be weakened by the
objection that it is a passage of an altogether different kind, and the
connection altogether different (Hvernick). For the complete difference
between the two passages would first have to be proved. The object,
indeed, of the binding of the prophet in [Eze
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008.md) is different from that in our
verse. Here it is to render it impossible for the prophet to go out of
the house; in [Eze 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008.md), it is to
prevent him from moving from one side to the other. But the one object
does not exclude the other; both statements coincide, rather, in the
general thought that the prophet must adapt himself entirely to the
divine will - not only not leave the house, but lie also for 390 days
upon one side without turning. - We might rather, with Kliefoth,
understand [Eze 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008.md) to mean that God
accomplished the binding of the prophet by human instruments - viz. that
He caused him to be bound by foreigners ([Eze
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025).md). But this supposition also would
only be justified, if either the sense of the words in [Eze
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025.md), or other good reasons,
pronounced in favour of the view that it was the exiles who had bound
the prophet. But as this is not the case, so we are not at liberty to
explain the definite נתתּי, "I lay on" ([Eze
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008).md), according to the indefinite
נתנוּ, "they lay on," or "one lays on" ([Eze
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025).md); but must, on the contrary,
understand our verse in accordance with [Eze
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008), and (with Hitzig.md) think of
heavenly powers as the subject to נתנוּ - as in [Job
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003.md); [Dan
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#028.md); [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md) - without, in so doing,
completely identifying the declaration in our verse with that in [Luk
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#008.md), as if in the latter passage only
that was brought to completion which had been here ([Luk
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#025).md) predicted. If, however, the
binding of the prophet proceeds from invisible powers, the expression is
not to be understood literally - of a binding with material cords; - but
God binds him by a spiritual power, so that he can neither leave his
house nor go forth to his countrymen, nor, at a later time ([Eze
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008).md), change the position prescribed
to him. This is done, however, not to prevent the exercise of his
vocation, but, on the contrary, to make him fitted for the successful
performance of the work commanded him. He is not to quit his house, nor
enter into fellowship and intercourse with his exiled countrymen, that
he may show himself, by separation from them, to be a prophet and organ
of the Lord. On the same grounds he is also ([Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md), [Eze
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027).md) to keep silence, and not even
correct them with words, but only to speak when God opens his mount for
that purpose; to remain, moreover, unconcerned whether they listen to
his words or not (cf. [Eze 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#004.md), [Eze
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007).md). He is to do both of these
things, because his contemporaries are a stiff-necked race; cf. [Eze
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009.md) and [Eze
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005.md), [Eze
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007.md). That he may not speak from any
impulse of his own, God will cause his tongue to cleave to his jaws, so
that he cannot speak; cf. [Psa 137:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#006.md).
"That the prophet is to refrain from all speech - even from the
utterance of the words given him by God - will, on the one hand, make
the divine words which he utters appear the more distinctly as such;
while, on the other, be an evidence to his hearers of the silent sorrow
with which he is filled by the contents of the divine word, and with
which they also ought justly to be filled" (Kliefoth).

This state of silence, according to which he is only then to speak when
God opened his mouth for the utterance of words which were to be given
him, is, indeed, at first imposed upon the prophet - as follows from the
relation of [Eze 3:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025.md) to Ezekiel 4
and 5 - only for the duration of the period [Eze
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025.md) to [Eze
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#017.md), or rather [Eze
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027.md). But the divine injunction
extends, as Kliefoth has rightly recognised, still further on - over the
whole period up to the fulfilment of his prophecies of threatening by
the destruction of Jerusalem. This appears especially from this, that in
[Eze 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027.md) and [Eze
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022.md) there is an undeniable reference
to the silence imposed upon him in our verse, and with reference to
which it is said, that when the messenger should bring back the news of
the fall of Jerusalem, his mouth should be opened and he should be no
longer dumb. The reference in [Eze
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027.md) and in [Eze
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022.md) to the verse before us has been
observed by most expositors; but several of them would limit the silence
of the prophet merely to the time which lies between Ezekiel 24 and [Eze
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021.md). This is quite arbitrary, as
neither in Ezekiel 24 nor in Ezekiel 33 is silence imposed upon him; but
in both chapters it is only stated that he should no longer be dumb
after the receipt of the intelligence that Jerusalem had been destroyed
by the Chaldeans. The supposition of Schmieder, moreover, is untenable,
that the injunction of [Eze 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025.md)
refers to the turning-point in the prophet's office, which commenced on
the day when the siege of Jerusalem actually began. For although this
day forms a turning-point in the prophetic activity of Ezekiel, in so
far as he on it announced to the people for the last time the
destruction of Jerusalem, and then spake no more to Israel until the
occurrence of this event, yet it is not said in [Eze
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027.md) that he was then to be dumb from
that day onwards. The hypothesis then only remains, that what was
imposed and enjoined on the prophet, in [Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md) and [Eze
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027.md), should remain in force for the
whole period from the commencement of his prophetic activity to the
receipt of the news of the fall of Jerusalem, by the arrival of a
messenger on the banks of the Chaboras. Therewith is also connected the
position of this injunction at the head of the first prophecy delivered
to him (not at his call), if only the contents and importance of this
oracle be understood and recognised, that it embraces not merely the
siege of Jerusalem, but also the capture and destruction of the city,
and the dispersion of the people among the heathen - consequently
contains in nuce all that Ezekiel had to announce to the people down to
the occurrence of this calamity, and which, in all the divine words from
[Eze 6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md) to Ezekiel 24, he had
again and again, though only in different ways, actually announced. If
all the discourses down to Ezekiel 24 are only further expositions and
attestations of the revelation of God in Ezekiel 4 and 5, then the
behaviour which was enjoined on him at the time of this announcement was
to be maintained during all following discourses of similar contents.
Besides, for a correct appreciation of the divine precept in [Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md) and [Eze
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027.md), it is also to be noticed that
the prophet is not to keep entire silence, except when God inspires him
to speak; but that his keeping silence is explained to men, that he is
to be to his contemporaries no אישׁ, "no reprover," and consequently
will place their sins before them to no greater extent, and in no other
way, than God expressly directs him. Understood in this way, the silence
is in contradiction neither with the words of God communicated in [Eze
6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md) to 24, nor with the predictions
directed against foreign nations in Ezekiel 25-33, several of which fall
within the time of the siege of Jerusalem. Cf. with this the remark upon
[Eze 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027.md) and [Eze
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022.md).
