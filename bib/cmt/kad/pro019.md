### [Proverbs Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001)

[Proverbs 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 19:1</span></span>

The plur. רעים, [Pro 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024), is
emphatic and equivalent to רעים רבּים. The group [Pro
19:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001) closes with a proverb which
contains this catchword. The first proverb of the group comes by שׂפתיו
into contact with [Pro 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#020), the
first proverb of the preceding group.

1 Better a poor man walking in his innocence,

Than one with perverse lips, and so a fool.

The contrast, [Pro 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006), is much
clearer. But to correct this proverb in conformity with that, as Hitzig
does, is unwarrantable. The Syr., indeed, translates here as there; but
the Chald. assimilates this translation to the Heb. text, which
Theodotion, and after him the Syro-Hexapl., renders by ὑπὲρ
στρεβλόχειλον ἄφρονα. But does 1a form a contrast to 1b? Fleischer
remarks: "From the contrast it appears that he who is designated in 1b
must be thought of as עשׁיר" \[rich\]; and Ewald, "Thus early the ideas
of a rich man and of a fool, or a despiser of God, are connected
together." Saadia understands כסיל \[a fool\], after [Job
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024), of one who makes riches his
כּסל \[confidence\]. Euchel accordingly translates: the false man,
although he builds himself greatly up, viz., on his riches. But כסיל
designates the intellectually slothful, in whom the flesh overweighs the
mind. And the representation of the rich, which, for 1b certainly arises
out of 1a, does not amalgamate with כסיל htiw , but with עקּשׁ שׂפתיו.
Arama is on the right track, for he translates: the rich who distorts
his mouth, for he gives to the poor suppliant a rude refusal. Better
Zckler: a proud man of perverse lips and haughty demeanour. If one with
haughty, scornful lips is opposed to the poor, then it is manifestly one
not poor who thinks to raise himself above the poor, and haughtily looks
down on him. And if it is said that, in spite of this proud demeanour,
he is a fool, then this presents the figure of one proud of his wealth,
who, in spite of his emptiness and nequitia, imagines that he possesses
a greatness of knowledge, culture, and worth corresponding to the
greatness of his riches. How much better is a poor man than such an one
who walketh (vid., on תּם, vol. i, p. 79) in his innocence and
simplicity, with his pure mind wholly devoted to God and to that which
is good! - his poverty keeps him in humility which is capable of no
malicious conduct; and this pious blameless life is of more worth than
the pride of wisdom of the distinguished fool. There is in contrast to
עקּשׁוּת a simplicity, ἁπλότης, of high moral worth; but, on the other
side, there is also a simplicity which is worthless. This is the
connecting thought which introduces the next verse.

[Proverbs 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 19:2</span></span>

2 The not-knowing of the soul is also not good,

And he who hasteneth with the legs after it goeth astray.

Fleischer renders נפשׁ as the subj. and לא־טוב as neut. pred.: in and of
itself sensual desire is not good, but yet more so if it is without
foresight and reflection. With this explanation the words must be
otherwise accentuated. Hitzig, in conformity with the accentuation,
before us: if desire is without reflection, it is also without success.
But where נפשׁ denotes desire or sensuality, it is always shown by the
connection, as e.g., [Pro 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#002); here
דּעת, referring to the soul as knowing (cf. [Psa
139:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014)), excludes this meaning. But
נפשׁ is certainly gen. subjecti; Luzzatto's "self-knowledge" is
untenable, for this would require דעת נפשׁו; Meri rightly glosses נפשׁ
דעת by שׂכל. After this Zckler puts Hitzig's translation right in the
following manner: where there is no consideration of the soul, there is
no prosperity. But that also is incorrect, for it would require אין־טוב;
לא־טוב is always pred., not a substantival clause. Thus the proverb
states that בלא־דעת נפשׁ is not good, and that is equivalent to היות
בלא־דעת נפשׁ (for the subject to לא־טוב is frequently, as e.g., [Pro
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026); [Pro
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005), an infinitive); or also: בלא־דעת
נפשׁ is a virtual noun in the sense of the not-knowing of the soul; for
to say לא־דעת was syntactically inadmissible, but the expression is
בלא־דעת, not בּלי דעת (בּבלי), because this is used in the sense
unintentionally or unexpectedly. The גּם which begins the proverb is
difficult. If we lay the principal accent in the translation given above
on "not good," then the placing of גם first is a hyperbaton similar to
that in [Pro 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026); [Pro
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#011); cf. אך, [Pro
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#011); רק, [Pro
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010), as if the words were: if the
soul is without knowledge, then also (eo ipso) it is destitute of
anything good. But if we lay the principal accent on the "also," then
the meaning of the poet is, that ignorance of the soul is, like many
other things, not good; or (which we prefer without on that account
maintaining

(Note: The old interpreters and also the best Jewish interpreters mar
the understanding and interpretation of the text, on the one side, by
distinguishing between a nearest and a deeper meaning of Scripture (דרך
נגלה and דרך נסתר); on the other by this, that they suppose an inward
connection of all the proverbs, and expend useless ingenuity in
searching after the connection. The former is the method especially
adopted by Immanuel and Meri, the latter has most of all been used by
Arama.)

the original connection of [Pro 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001)
and [Pro 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002)), that as on the one
side the pride of wisdom, so on the other ignorance is not good. In this
case גם belongs more to the subject than to the predicate, but in
reality to the whole sentence at the beginning of which it stands. To
hasten with the legs (אץ, as [Pro
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#020)) means now in this connection to
set the body in violent agitation, without direction and guidance
proceeding from the knowledge possessed by the soul. He who thus hastens
after it without being intellectually or morally clear as to the goal
and the way, makes a false step, goes astray, fails (vid., [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036), where חטאי is the contrast to
מצאי).

[Proverbs 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 19:3</span></span>

3 The foolishness of a man overturneth his way,

And his heart is angry against Jahve.

Regarding סלף, vid., at [Pro 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003);
also the Arab. signification "to go before" proceeds from the root
conception pervertere, for first a letting precede, or preceding (e.g.,
of the paying before the delivery of that which is paid for: salaf, a
pre-numbering, and then also: advanced money), consisting in the
reversal of the natural order, is meant. The way is here the way of
life, the walking: the folly of a man overturns, i.e., destroys, his
life's-course; but although he is himself the fabricator of his own
ruin, yet the ill-humour (זעף, aestuare, vid., at [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006)) of his heart turns itself
against God, and he blames (lxx essentially correct: αἰτιᾶται) God
instead of himself, viz., his own madness, whereby he has turned the
grace of God into lasciviousness, cast to the winds the instruction
which lay in His providences, and frustrated the will of God desiring
his good. A beautiful paraphrase of this parable is found at Sir.
15:11-20; cf. [Lam 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039).

[Proverbs 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 19:4</span></span>

4 Wealth bringeth many friends;

But the reduced - his friend separateth himself.

The very same contrast, though otherwise expressed, we had at [Pro
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020). Regarding הון, vid., vol. i, p.
63. דל is the tottering, or he who has fallen into a tottering
condition, who has no resources, possesses no means. The accentuation
gives Mugrash to the word (according to which the Targ. translates), for
it is not the subject of יפּרד: the reduced is separated (pass. Niph.)
by his misfortunes, or must separate himself (reflex. Niph.) from his
friend (מרעהוּ, as [Ecc 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004), prae
socio suo); but subject of the virtual pred. מרעהוּ יפּרד: the reduced -
his friend (מרעהו, as [Pro 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007))
separates himself, i.e., (according to the nature of the Semitic
substantival clause) he is such (of such a fate) that his friend sets
himself free, whereby ממּנּוּ may be omitted as self-obvious; נפרד means
one who separates himself, [Pro 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001).
If we make דל the subject of the separatur, then the initiative of the
separation from the friend is not expressed.

[Proverbs 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 19:5</span></span>

In [Pro 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005) and [Pro
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009) we have the introductory proverb
of two groups, the former of which, in its close as well as its
beginning, cannot be mistaken.

5 A lying witness remaineth not unpunished;

And he who breathes out lies escapeth not.

Regarding יפיח, vid., vol. i, p. 148: as here we read it of false
witness at [Pro 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019); [Pro
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005), [Pro
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025). לא ינּקה occurs four times
before, the last of which is at [Pro
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005). The lxx elsewhere translates
יפיח כזבים by ἐκκαίειν ψευδῆ, to kindle lies; but here by ὁ δὲ ἐκαλῶν
ἀδίκως, and at [Pro 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009) by ὃς δ ̓ ἂν
ἐκκαύσῃ κακίαν, both times changing only because ψευδής goes before, and
instead of ψευδῆ, the choice of a different rendering commended itself.

[Proverbs 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 19:6</span></span>

6 Many stroke the cheeks of the noble;

And the mass of friends belongeth to him who gives.

The phrase 'חלּות פּני פל signifies to stroke the face of any one, from
the fundamental meaning of the verb חלה, to rub, to stroke, Arab. khala,
with which the Heb., meaning to be sick, weak (viribus attritum esse),
and the Arabic: to be sweet (properly laevem et politum, glabrum esse,
or palatum demulcere, leniter stringere, contrast asperum esse ad
gustum), are connected (Fl.). The object of such insinuating, humble
suing for favour is the נדיב (from נדב, instigare), the noble, he who is
easily incited to noble actions, particularly to noble-mindedness in
bestowing gifts and in doing good, or who feels himself naturally
impelled thereto, and spontaneously practises those things; cf. the
Arab. krym, nobilis and liberalis (Fl.), and at [Job
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#028); parall. אישׁ מתּן, a man who
gives willingly, as אישׁ חמה, [Pro
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#018), one who is easily kindled into
anger. Many (רבּים, as [Job 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#019))
stroke the face of the liberal (Lat. caput mulcent or demulcent); and to
him who gives willingly and richly belongs כל־הרע, the mass (the
totality) of good friends, cf. [Pro
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#017); there the art. of הרע,
according to the manner of expression of the Arab. grammarians, stood
for "the exhaustion of the characteristic properties of the genus": the
friend who corresponds to the nature (the idea) of such an one; here it
stands for "the comprehension of the individuals of the genus;" all that
is only always friend. It lies near with Ewald and Hitzig to read וכלּה
רע (and every one is friend...) (כלּה = כלּו, as [Jer
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010), etc.); but why could not כל־הרע
be used as well as כל־האדם, perhaps with the sarcastic appearance which
the above translation seeks to express? The lxx also had וכל הרע in
view, which it incorrectly translates πᾶς δὲ ὁ κακός, whereby the Syr.
and the Targ. are led into error; but מתּן is not one and the same with
שׂחד, vid., [Pro 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006). On the
contrary, there certainly lies before us in [Pro
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007) a mutilated text. The tristich
is, as we have shown, vol. i, p. 15, open to suspicion; and the violence
which its interpretation needs in order to comprehend it, as a formal
part of 7ab, places it beyond a doubt, and the lxx confirms it that 7c
is the remainder of a distich, the half of which is lost.

[Proverbs 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 19:7</span></span>

7ab. We thus first confine our attention to these two lines -

All the brethren of the poor hate him;

How much more do his friends withdraw themselves from him?

Regarding אף כּי, quanto magis, vid., at [Pro
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031); [Pro
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011); [Pro
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007). In a similar connection [Pro
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020) spake of hatred, i.e., the
cooling of love, and the manifesting of this coldness. The brethren who
thus show themselves here, unlike the friend who has become a brother,
according to [Pro 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017), are
brothers-german, including kindred by blood relation. כּל has Mercha,
and is thus without the Makkeph, as at [Psa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010) (vid., the Masora in Baer's
Liber Psalmorum, 1861, p. 133). Kimchi (Michlol 205a), Norzi, and others
think that cāl (with קמץ רחב) is to be read as at [Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012), where כּלו is a verb. But that
is incorrect. The case is the same as with את, [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012); [Psa
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005); [Psa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002). As here ě with Mercha remains,
so ǒ with Mercha in that twice occurring כּלו; that which is exceptional
is this, that the accentuated כל is written thus twice, not as the usual
כּל, but as כּל with the Makkeph. The ground of the exception lies, as
with other peculiarities, in the special character of metrical
accentuation; the Mercha represents the place of the Makkeph, and ā thus
remains in the unchanged force of a Kametz-Chatuph. The plur. רחקוּ does
not stamp מרעהוּ as the defectively written plur.; the suffix ēhu is
always sing., and the sing. is thus, like הרע, 6b, meant collectively,
or better: generally (in the sense of kind), which is the linguistic
usage of these two words, [Sa1 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026);
[Job 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010). But it is worthy of notice
that the Masoretic form here is not מרעהוּ, but mמרעהוּ, with Sheva. The
Masora adds to it the remark לית, and accordingly the word is thus
written with Sheva by Kimchi (Michlol 202a and Lex. under the word רעה),
in Codd., and older editions. The Venet., translating by ἀπὸ τοῦ φίλου
αὐτοῦ, has not noticed that. But how? Does the punctuation מרעהו mean
that the word is here to be derived from מרע, maleficus? Thus
understood, it does not harmonize with the line of thought. From this it
is much more seen that the punctuation of the inflected מרע, amicus,
fluctuates. This word מרע is a formation so difficult of comprehension,
that one might almost, with Olshausen, 210; Bttcher, 794; and Lagarde,
regard the מ as the partitive מן, like the French des amis (cf. Eurip.
Med. 560: πένητα φεύγει πᾶς τις ἐκποδὼν φίλος), or: something of friend,
a piece of friend, while Ewald and others regard it as possible that מרע
is abbreviated from מרעה. The punctuation, since it treats the Tsere in
מרעהו, 4b

(Note: In vol. i. p. 266, we have acknowledged מרעהו, from מרע, friend,
only for [Pro 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007), but at [Pro
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#004) we have also found amicus ejus
more probable than ab amico suo (= מן רעהו).) and elsewhere, as
unchangeable, and here in מרעהו as changeable, affords proof that in it
also the manner of the formation of the word was incomprehensible.

Seeking after words which are vain.

7c. If now this line belongs to this proverb, then מרדּף must be used of
the poor, and לא־המּה, or לו־המּה (vid., regarding the 15 Kers, לּו for
לא, at [Psa 100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003)), must be the
attributively nearer designation of the אמרים. The meaning of the Kerı̂
would be: he (the poor man) hunts after mere words, which - but no
actions corresponding to them - are for a portion to him. This is
doubtful, for the principal matter, that which is not a portion to him,
remains unexpressed, and the לו־המּה eht \[to him they belong\] affords
only the service of guarding one against understanding by the אמרים the
proper words of the poor. This service is not in the same way afforded
by לא המּה they are not; but this expression characterizes the words as
vain, so that it is to be interpreted according to such parallels as
[Hos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002) : words which are not, i.e.,
which have nothing in reality corresponding to them, verba nihili, i.e.,
the empty assurances and promises of his brethren and friends (Fl.). The
old translators all

(Note: Lagarde erroneously calls Theodotion's ῥήσεις οὐκ αὐτῷ a
translation of the Kerı̂; οὐκ is, however, לא, and instead of αὐτῷ the
expression αὐτῶν, which is the translation of המה, is also found.)

read לא, and the Syr. and Targ. translate not badly: מלּוי לא שׁריר;
Symmachus, ῥήσεσιν ἀνυπάρκτοις. The expression is not to be rejected: לא
היה sometimes means to come to לא, i.e., to nothing, [Job
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021); [Eze
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032), cf. [Isa
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006); and לא הוּא, he is not = has no
reality, [Jer 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012), אמרים לא־המה, may
thus mean words which are nothing (vain). But how can it be said of the
poor whom everything forsakes, that one dismisses him with words behind
which there is nothing, and now also that he pursues such words? The
former supposes always a sympathy, though it be a feigned one, which is
excluded by שׂנאהוּ \[they hate him\] and רחקוּ \[withdraw themselves\];
and the latter, spoken of the poor, would be unnatural, for his purposed
endeavour goes not out after empty talk, but after real assistance. So
7c: pursuing after words which (are) nothing, although in itself not
falling under critical suspicion, yet only of necessity is connected
with this proverb regarding the poor. The lxx, however, has not merely
one, but even four lines, and thus two proverbs following 7b. The former
of these distichs is: Ἔννοια ἀγαθὴ τοῖς εἰδόσιν αὐτὴν ἐγγιεῖ, ἀνὴρ δὲ
φρόνιμος εὑρήσει αὐτήν; it is translated from the Hebr. (ἔννοια ἀγαθή,
[Pro 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002) = מזמּות), but it has a
meaning complete in itself, and thus has nothing to do with the fragment
7c. The second distich is: Ὁ πολλὰ κακοποιῶν τελεσιουργεῖ κακίαν, ὃ δὲ
ἐρεθίζει λόγους οὐ σωθήσεται. This ὃς δὲ ἐρεθίζει λόγους is, without
doubt, a translation of מרדף אמרים (7c); λόγους is probably a corruption
of λόγοις (thus the Complut.), not, he who pursueth words, but he who
incites by words, as Homer (Il. iv. 5f.) uses the expression ἐρεθιζέμεν
ἐπέεσσι. The concluding words, οὐ σωθήσεται, are a repetition of the
Heb. לא ימלט (cf. lxx 19:5 with 28:26), perhaps only a conjectural
emendation of the unintelligible לא המה. Thus we have before us in that
ὁ πολλὰ κακοποιῶν, κ.τ.λ., the line lost from the Heb. text; but it is
difficult to restore it to the Heb. We have attempted it, vol. i, p. 15.
Supposing that the lxx had before them לא המה, then the proverb is -

"He that hath many friends is rewarded with evil,

Hunting after words which are nothing;"

i.e., since this his courting the friendship of as many as possible is a
hunting after words which have nothing after them and come to nothing.

[Proverbs 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 19:8</span></span>

8 He that getteth understanding loveth his soul,

And he that values reasonableness will acquire good;

or, more closely, since this would be the translation of ימצא טוב, [Pro
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#020); [Pro
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020) : so it happens, or it comes to
this, that he acquires good (= היה למצא); the inf. with ל is here, as at
[Pro 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024), the expression of a fut.
periphrasticum, as in the Lat. consecturus est. Regarding קנה־לּב, vid.,
[Pro 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#032), and שׁמר תּבוּנה vol. i.
p. 119. That the deportment of men is either care for the soul, or the
contrary of that, is a thought which runs through the Book of Proverbs.

[Proverbs 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 19:9</span></span>

The group of proverbs ([Pro 19:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009))
now following begins and closes in the same way as the preceding.

9 A lying witness doth not remain unpunished,

And one who breathes out lies perisheth,

or goeth to ruin, for אבד (R. בד, to divide, separate) signifies to lose
oneself in the place of the separated, the dead (Arab. in the infinite).
In [Pro 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005), instead of this
ἀπολεῖται (lxx), the negative οὐ σωθήσεται is used, or as the lxx there
more accurately renders it, οὐ διαφεύξεται.

[Proverbs 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 19:10</span></span>

10 Luxury becometh not a fool;

How much less a servant to rule over princes.

Thus also with לא נאוה (3 p. Pil. non decet, cf. the adj. [Pro
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001)) [Pro
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007) begins. אף כּי rises here, as at
[Pro 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007), a minori ad majus: how much
more is it unbecoming = how much less is it seemly. The contrast in the
last case is, however, more rugged, and the expression harsher. "A fool
cannot bear luxury: he becomes by it yet more foolish; one who was
previously a humble slave, but who has attained by good fortune a place
of prominence and power, from being something good, becomes at once
something bad: an insolent sceleratus" (Fl.). Agur, xxx. 22f., describes
such a homo novus as an unbearable calamity; and the author of the Book
of Ecclesiastes, written in the time of the Persian domination, speaks,
[Ecc 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#007), of such. The lxx
translates, καὶ ἐὰν οἰκέτης ἄρξηται μεθ ̓ ὕβρεως δυναστεύειν, rendering
the phrase כּשׂרים by μεθ ̓ ὕβρεως, but all other translators had
בּשׂרים before them.

11 The discretion of a man maketh him long-suffering,

And it is a glory for him to be forbearing toward transgression.

The Syr., Targum, Aquila, and Theodotion translate האריך אפו by
μακροθυμία, and thus read האריך; but Rashi, Kimchi, and others remark
that האריך is here only another vocalization for האריך, which is
impossible. The Venet. also translates: Νοῦς ἀνθρώπου μηκυνεῖ τὸν θυμὸν
ἑαυτοῦ; the correct word would be αὐτοῦ: the discretion (intellectus or
intelligentia; vid., regarding שׂכל, [Pro
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004)) of a man extends his anger, i.e.,
brings it about that it continues long before it breaks out (vid., [Pro
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029)). One does not stumble at the
perf. in view of [Pro 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007), [Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008); [Pro
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#026), and the like; in the proverbial
style the fut. or the particip. is more common. In the synonymous
parallel member, תפארתּו points to man as such: it is an honour to him
to pass by a transgression (particularly that which affects himself), to
let it go aside, i.e., to forbear revenge or punishment (cf. Arab. tjâwz
'aly); thus also the divine πάρεσις ([Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025)) is designated by [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018); and in [Amo
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#008); [Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002), עבד stands absol. for the divine
remission or passing by, i.e., unavenging of sin.

[Proverbs 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 19:12</span></span>

12 A murmuring as of a lion is the wrath of the king,

And as dew on plants is his favour.

Line 1 is a variation of [Pro 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002);
line 2a of [Pro 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015). זעף is not the
being irritated against another, but generally ill-humour, fretfulness,
bad humour; the murmuring or growling in which this state of mind
expresses itself is compared to that of a lion which, growling, prepares
and sets itself to fall upon its prey (vid., [Isa
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#029), cf. [Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004)). Opposed to the זעף stands the
beneficial effect of the רצון, i.e., of the pleasure, the delight, the
satisfaction, the disposition which shows kindness (lxx τὸ ἱλαρὸν
αὐτοῦ). In the former case all are afraid; in the latter, everything
lives, as when the refreshing dew falls upon the herbs of the field. The
proverb presents a fact, but that the king may mirror himself in it.

[Proverbs 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 19:13</span></span>

13 A foolish son is destruction for his father,

And a continual dropping are the contentions of a wife.

Regarding הוּת, vid., at [Pro 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#004),
cf. [Pro 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003). Line 2a is expanded,
[Pro 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015), into a distich. The
dropping is טרד, properly striking (cf. Arab. tirad, from tarad III,
hostile assault) when it pours itself forth, stroke (drop) after stroke
= constantly, or with unbroken continuity. Lightning-flashes are called
(Jer Berachoth, p. 114, Shitomir's ed.) טורדין, opp. מפסיקין, when they
do not follow in intervals, but constantly flash; and b. Bechoroth 44a;
דומעות, weeping eyes, דולפות, dropping eyes, and טורדות, eyes always
flowing, are distinguished. An old interpreter (vid., R. Ascher in
Pesachim II No. 21) explains דלף טרד by: "which drops, and drops, and
always drops." An Arab proverb which I once heard from Wetzstein, says
that there are three things which make our house intolerable: âlṭaḳḳ (=
âldhalf), the trickling through of rain; âlnaḳḳ, the contention of the
wife; and âlbaḳḳ, bugs.

[Proverbs 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 19:14</span></span>

14 House and riches are a paternal inheritance,

But from Jahve cometh a prudent wife.

House and riches (opulentia), which in themselves do not make men happy,
one may receive according to the law of inheritance; but a prudent wife
is God's gracious gift, [Pro 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022).
There is not a more suitable word than משׂכּלת (fem. of משׂכּיל) to
characterize a wife as a divine gift, making her husband happy. שׂכל
(השׂכּל) is the property which says: "I am named modesty, which wears
the crown of all virtues."

(Note: The lxx translates: παρὰ δὲ ἁρμόζεται γυνὴ ἀνδοί. Here as often
(vid., my Jesurun) The Arab. usus loquendi makes itself felt in the
idiom of the lxx, for shâkl means ἁρμόζειν.)

[Proverbs 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 19:15</span></span>

15 Slothfulness sinketh into deep sleep,

And an idle soul must hunger.

Regarding תּרדּמה and its root-word רדם, vid., at [Pro
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005). הפּיל, to befall, to make to
get, is to be understood after [Gen
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021); the obj. על־האדם, viz., העצל, is
naturally to be supplied. In 15b the fut. denotes that which will
certainly happen, the inevitable. In both of its members the proverb is
perfectly clear; Hitzig, however, corrects 15a, and brings out of it the
meaning, "slothfulness gives tasteless herbs to eat." The lxx has two
translations of this proverb, here and at [Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008). That it should translate רמיה by
ἀνδρόγυνος was necessary, as Lagarde remarks, for the exposition of the
"works of a Hebrew Sotades." But the Hebrew literature never sunk to
such works, wallowing in the mire of sensuality, and ἀνδρόγυνος is not
at all thus enigmatical; the Greek word was also used of an effeminate
man, a man devoid of manliness, a weakling, and was, as the lxx shows,
more current in the Alexandrine Greek than elsewhere.

[Proverbs 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 19:16</span></span>

16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul;

He that taketh no heed to his ways dies.

As at [Pro 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023), cf. [Ecc
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005), מצוה is here the commandment of
God, and thus obligatory, which directs man in every case to do that
which is right, and warns him against that which is wrong. And בּוזה
דּרכיו (according to the Masora with Tsere, as in Codd. and old
editions, not בוזה) is the antithesis of נצר דּרכּו, [Pro
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#017). To despise one's own way is
equivalent to, to regard it as worth no consideration, as no question of
conscience whether one should enter upon this way or that. Hitzig's
reading, פּוזר, "he that scattereth his ways," lets himself be drawn by
the manifold objects of sensuality sometimes in one direction and
sometimes in another, is supported by [Jer
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013), according to which it must be
מפזּר; the conj. is not in the style of the Book of Proverbs, and
besides is superfluous. The lxx, which is fond of a quid pro quo - it
makes, 13b, a courtesan offering a sacrifice she had vowed of the wages
of sin of the quarrelsome woman - has here, as the Heb. text: ὁ
καταφρονῶν τῶν ἑαυτοῦ ὁδῶν. Thus after the Kerı̂ ימת, as also the Targ.,
Syro-Hexap., and Luther; on the contrary, the Syr., Jerome, the Venet.
adopt the Chethı̂b יוּמת: he will become dead, i.e., dies no natural
death. The Kerı̂ is more in the spirit and style of the Book of Proverbs
([Pro 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#010); [Pro
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013); [Pro
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021)).

[Proverbs 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 19:17</span></span>

These verses we take together. But we have no other reason for making a
pause at [Pro 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021), than that [Pro
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#022) is analogous to [Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017), and thus presents itself to us
as an initial verse.

[Pro 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017)

17 He lendeth to Jahve who is compassionate to the lowly,

And his bounty He requites to him.

As at [Pro 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031), חונן is part. Kal.
The Masoretically exact form of the word is חונן (as ואוזל, [Pro
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#014)) with Mercha on the first
syllable, on which the tone is thrown back, and the העמדה on the second.
The Roman legal phrase, mutui datione contrahitur obligatio, serves to
explain the fundamental conception of לוה, mutuo accipere, and הלוה,
mutuum dare (vid., [Pro 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#007)). The
construction, [Exo 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#024), "to make any
one bound as a debtor, obligare," lies at the foundation of the genitive
connection 'מלוה ה (not מלוה). With 17b cf. [Pro
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014), where the subject of ישׁיב
(Kerı̂) remains in the background. גמלו (not גמלּו) is here his work done
in the sense of good exhibited. "Love," Hedinger once said, "is an
imperishable capital, which always bears interest." And the Archbishop
Walther: nam Deo dat qui dat inopibus, ipse Deus est in pauperibus. Dr.
Jonas, as Dchsel relates, once gave to a poor man, and said, "Who knows
when God restores it!" There Luther interposed: "As if God had not long
ago given it beforehand!" This answer of Luther meets the abuse of this
beautiful proverb by the covetous.

[Pro 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#018)

This proverb brings to view once more the pedagogic character of this
Older Book of Proverbs:

Correct thy son, for yet there is hope;

But go not too far to kill him.

That כּי tahT is meant relatively, as at [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015), is seen from [Job
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018); [Job
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007); [Jer
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#016).; כּי־ישׁ תּקוה is the usual
expression for etemin spes est. Though a son show obstinacy, and
manifest a bad disposition, yet there is hope in the training of the
youth of being able to break his self-will, and to wean him from his bad
disposition; therefore his education should be carried forward with
rigorous exactness, but in such a way that wisdom and love regulate the
measure and limits of correction: ad eum interficiendum animam ne tollas
(animum ne inducas). נפשׁך is not the subject, for in that case the word
would have been תּשּׁאך ([Kg2 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#010)).
It is the object: To raise the soul to something is equivalent to, to
direct his desire to it, to take delight in it. The teacher should not
seek correction as the object, but only as the means; he who has a
desire after it, to put the child to death in the case of his guilt,
changes correction into revenge, permits himself to be driven by passion
from the proper end of correction, and to be pushed beyond its limits.
The lxx translates freely εἰς δὲ ὕβρις, for ὕβρις is unrestrained abuse,
מוסר אכזרי as Immanuel glosses. Besides, all the ancients and also the
Venet. translate המיתו as the inf. of המית. But Oetinger (for he
translates: lift not thy soul to his cry, for which Euchel: let not his
complaining move thy compassion) follows the derivation from המה
suggested by Kimchi, Meri, and Immanuel, and preferred by Ralbag, so
that המיתו after the from בּכית is equivalent to המיתו. But leaving out
of view that המה means strepere, not lamentari, and that נשׂא נפשׁו
means attention, not desire, [Pro
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#013) points out to us a better
interpretation.

[Pro 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019)

Another proverb with נשׂא:

A man of excessive wrath must suffer punishment;

For if thou layest hold of it, hindering it, thou makest it only worse.

The lxx, Syr., and Targ. translate as if the words were גּבר חמה (as
בּעל חמה, [Pro 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#022)). Theodotion, the
Venet., and Luther render the Kerı̂ גּדל־; Jerome's impatiens is
colourless. The Chethı̂b גרל gives no appropriate meaning. The Arab.
jaril means lapidosus (whence גּורל, cf. Aram. פּסּא = ψῆφος), and
Schultens translates accordingly aspere scruposus iracundiae, which is
altogether after the manner of his own heavy style. Ewald translates
גּרל as derived from the Arab jazyl, largus, grandis; but the
possibility of the passing over of ר into ז, as maintained by Ewald and
also by Hitzig, or the reverse, is physiologically undemonstrable, and
is confirmed by no example worthy of mention. Rather it may be possible
that the Heb. had an adj. גּרל or גּרל in the sense of stony,
gravel-like, hard as gravel, but tow rather than gravel would be
appropriate to חמה. Hitzig corrects גּמל חמה, "who acts in anger;" but
he says שׁלּם חמה, to recompense anger, [Isa
59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018); גמל חמה is without support.
This correction, however, is incomparably more feasible than Bttcher's,
"moderate inheritance bears expiation;" חמה = חמאה must mean not only
thick \[curdled\] milk, but also moderation, and Bttcher finds this
"sound." From all these instances one sees that גרל is an error in
transcription; the Kerı̂ גּדל־חמה rightly improves it, a man is thus
designated whose peculiarity it is to fall into a high degree of
passionate anger (חמה גדולה, [Dan
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#044)): such an one has to bear ענשׁ,
a fine, i.e., to compensate, for he has to pay compensation or
smart-money for the injury suffered, as e.g., he who in strife with
another pushes against a woman with child, so that injury befalls her,
[Exo 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#022). If we compare this passage
with [Sa2 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#006), there appears for
תּצּיל the meaning of taking away of the object (whether a person or a
thing) against which the passionate hothead directs himself. Therewith
the meaning of ועוד תּוסף accords. The meaning is not that, הצּיל, once
is not enough, but much rather must be repeated, and yet is without
effect; but that one only increases and heightens the חמה thereby. It is
in vain to seek to spare such a violent person the punishment into which
he obstinately runs; much more advisable is it to let him rage till he
ceases; violent opposition only makes the evil the greater. With כּי אם,
"denn wenn" \[for then\], cf. [Pro
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#003), "ja wenn" \[yea if\], and with
ועוד in the conclusion, [Job 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007) (a
parallelism syntactically more appropriate than [Psa
139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018)).

[Pro 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#020)

20 Hearken to counsel, and receive instruction,

That thou mayest become wise afterwards.

The rule of morals, [Pro 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#015),
receives here the paraenetic tone which is the keynote of the
introduction chap. 1-9. Lwenstein translates: that thou mayest finally
become wise. But בּאחריתך corresponds rather to our "hinfort"
\[posthac\] than to "endlich" \[finally\]. He to whom the warning is
directed must break with the self-willed, undisciplined ראשׁית beginning
of his life, and for the future (τὸν ἐπίλοιπον ἐν σαρκὶ χρόνον, [Pe1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002)) become wise. The relative
contrast between the two periods of life is the same as at [Job
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#007).

[Pro 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021)

21 Many are the thoughts in a man's heart;

But Jahve's counsel, that stands.

In תּקוּם lies, as at [Isa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008), both:
that the counsel of God (His plan of the world and of salvation) is
accomplished and comes into actual fact, and that it continues. This
counsel is the true reality elevated above the checkered manifoldness of
human purposes, aims, and subjectivities, which penetrates and works
itself out in history. The thoughts of a man thus gain unity, substance,
endurance, only in so far as he subjects himself to this counsel, and
makes his thoughts and actions conformable and subordinate to this
counsel.

[Proverbs 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 19:22</span></span>

The series makes a new departure with a proverb regarding the poor (cf.
[Pro 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017)):

A man's delight is his beneficence;

And better is a poor man than a liar.

The right interpretation will be that which presses upon תּאות no
strange meaning, and which places the two parts of the verse in an inner
mutual relation ethically right. In any case it lies nearer to interpret
תאות, in relation to man, actively than passively: that which makes man
worthy of desire (Rashi), adorns and distinguishes him (Kimchi,
Aben-Ezra); or, that which is desired by man, is above all things sought
for (Luzzatto); and, in like manner, the Heb. meaning for חסדּו lies
nearer than the Aram. (vid., [Pro
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034)): the pleasure of a man is his
disgrace (Ralbag). Thus Bertheau's translation: the desire of a man is
his charitas, must mean: that which brings to a man true joy is to act
amiably. But is that, thus generally expressed, true? And if this were
the thought, how much more correctly and distinctly would it be
expressed by שׂמחה לאדם עשׂות חסד (cf. [Pro
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#015))! Hitzig so rightly reminded by
חסדו of the Pharisee who thanks God that he is not as other men; the
word ought to have been חסד to remove every trace of self-satisfaction.
Hitzig therefore proposes from the lxx and the Vulgate the
text-correction מתּבוּאת no, and translates, "from the revenue of a man
is his kind gift;" and Ewald, who is satisfied with תּבוּאת, "the gain
of a man is his pious love." The latter is more judicious: חסד (love)
distributed is in reality gain (according to [Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017)); but 22b corresponds rather
with the former: "better is he who from want does not give תבואה, than
he who could give and says he has nothing." But was there then need for
that καρπός of the lxx? If a poor man is better than a lord given to
lying - for אישׁ with רשׁ is a man of means and position - i.e., a poor
man who would give willingly, but has nothing, than that man who will
not give, and therefore lies, saying that he has nothing; then 22a means
that the will of a man (cf. תאות, [Pro
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#023)) is his doing good (vid.,
regarding חסד, ad [Pro 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003)), i.e., is
its soul and very essence. Euchel, who accordingly translates: the
philanthropy of a man consists properly in his goodwill, rightly
compares the Rabbinical proverb, אחד המרבה ואחד הממעיט ובלבד שׁיתבוון,
i.e., one may give more or less, it all depends on the intention, the
disposition.

[Proverbs 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 19:23</span></span>

23 The fear of Jahve tendeth to life;

Satisfied, one spendeth the night, not visited by evil.

The first line is a variation of [Pro
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027). How the fear of God thus
reacheth to life, i.e., helps to a life that is enduring, free from care
and happy, 23b says: the promises are fulfilled to the God-fearing, [Deu
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#015) and [Lev
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#006); he does not go hungry to bed,
and needs fear no awakening in terror out of his soft slumber ([Pro
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#024)). With ו explic., 23a is
explained. לין שׂבע means to spend the night (the long night) hungry. as
לין ערוּם, [Job 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#007), to pass the
night in nakedness (cold). נפקד, of visitation of punishment, we read
also at [Isa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006), and instead of
בּרע, as it might be according to this passage, we have here the accus.
of the manner placing the meaning of the Niph. beyond a doubt (cf. [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015), רע, in an evil manner). All is
in harmony with the matter, and is good Heb.; on the contrary, Hitzig's
ingenuity introduces, instead of שׂבעו, an unheard of word, ושׂרע, "and
he stretches himself." One of the Greeks excellently translates: καὶ
ἐμπλησθεὶς αὐλισθήσεται ἄνευ ἐπισκοπῆς πονηρᾶς. The lxx, which instead
of רע, γνῶσις, translates thus, דּע, discredits itself. The Midrash -
Lagarde says of its translation - varies in colour like an opal. In
other words, it handles the text like wax, and forms it according to its
own taste, like the Midrash with its "read not so, but so."

[Proverbs 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 19:24</span></span>

24 The slothful hath thrust his hand into the dish;

He bringeth it not again to his mouth.

This proverb is repeated in a different form, [Pro
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#015). The figure appears, thus
understood, an hyperbole, on which account the lxx understand by צלחת
the bosom or lap, κόλπον; Aquila and Symmachus understand by it the
arm-pit, μασχάλην or μάλην; and the Jewish interpreters gloss it by חיק
(Kimchi) or קרע החלוק, the slit (Ita. fenditura) of the shirt. But the
domestic figure, [Kg2 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013), places
before us a dish which, when it is empty, is wiped and turned upside
down;

(Note: While צפּחת, ṣaḥfat, in the sense of dish, is etymologically
clear, for צלּחת, neither ṣalaḥ (to be good for), nor salakh (to be
deaf, mangy), offers an appropriate verbal meaning. The Arab. zuluh
(large dishes) stands under zalah (to taste, of the tasting of good),
but is scarcely a derivative from it. Only צלח, which in the meaning of
good for, proceeding from the idea of penetrating through, has retained
the root-meaning of cleft, furnishes for צלּחת and צלוחית a root-word in
some measure useful.)

and that the slothful when he eats appears too slothful to bring his
hand, e.g., with the rice or the piece of bread he has taken out of the
dish, again to his mouth, is true to nature: we say of such a man that
he almost sleeps when he eats. The fut. after the perf. here denotes
that which is not done after the former thing, i.e., that which is
scarcely and only with difficulty done; לּו ... גּם may have the meaning
of "yet not," as at [Psa 129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002); but
the sense of "not once" = ne ... quidem, lies here nearer [Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003).

[Proverbs 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 19:25</span></span>

25 The scorner thou smitest, and the simple is prudent;

And if one reprove the man of understanding, he gaineth knowledge

Hitzig translates in a way that is syntactically inexact: smite the
scorner, so the simple becomes prudent; that would have required at
least the word ויערם: fut. and fut. connected by ו is one of many modes
of expression for the simultaneous, discussed by me at [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010). The meaning of the proverb has a
complete commentary at [Pro 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011),
where its two parts are otherwise expressed with perfect identity of
thought. In regard to the לץ, with whom denunciation and threatening
bear no fruit ([Pro 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001); [Pro
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#012)), and perhaps even produce the
contrary effect to that intended ([Pro
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007)), there remains nothing else than
to vindicate the injured truths by means of the private justice of
corporal punishment. Such words, if spoken to the right man, in the
right spirit, at the right time, may affect him with wholesome terrors;
but even though he is not made better thereby, yet the simple, who
listens to the mockeries of such not without injury, will thereby become
prudent (gain הערים = ערמה, prudence, as at [Pro
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#005)), i.e., either arrive at the
knowledge that the mockery of religion is wicked, or guard himself
against incurring the same repressive measures. In 25b והוכח is neither
inf. (Umbreit), which after [Pro 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011)
must be וּבהוכח, nor impr. (Targ., Ewald), which according to rule is
הוכח, but the hypothetic perf. (Syr.) with the most general subject
(Merc., Hitzig): if one impart instruction to the (dat. obj. as [Pro
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007); [Pro
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002)) man of understanding (vid., [Pro
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#021)), then he acquires knowledge,
i.e., gains an insight into the nature and value of that which one
wishes to bring him to the knowledge of (הבין דּעת, as [Pro
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#007); cf. [Pro
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#005)). That which the deterring lesson
of exemplary punishment approximately effects with the wavering, is, in
the case of the man of understanding, perfectly attained by an
instructive word.

We have now reached the close of the third chief section of the older
Book of Proverbs. All the three sections begin with בּן חכם, [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001); [Pro
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#001); [Pro
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#020). The Introduction, chap. 1-9,
dedicates this collection of Solomonic proverbs to youth, and the three
beginnings accordingly relate to the relative duties of a son to his
father and mother. We are now no longer far from the end, for [Pro
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017) resumes the tone of the
Introduction. The third principal part would be disproportionately large
if it extended from [Pro 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001) to [Pro
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015). But there does not again occur
a proverb beginning with the words "son of man." We can therefore
scarcely go wrong if we take [Pro
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026) as the commencement of a fourth
principal part. The Masora divides the whole Mishle into eight sedarim,
which exhibit so little knowledge of the true division, that the
parashas (sections) [Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001); [Pro
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017) do not at all find their right
place.

(Note: The 915 verses of the Mishle, according to the Masora, fall into
eight sedarim, beginning as follows: [Pro
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001); [Pro
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018); [Pro
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012); [Pro
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004); [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010); [Pro
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022); [Pro
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013); [Pro
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016).)

The MSS, however, contain evidences that this Hagiograph was also
anciently divided into parashas, which were designated partly by spaces
between the lines (sethumoth) and partly by breaks in the lines
(phethucoth). In Baer's Cod. Jamanensis,

(Note: Vid., the Prefatio to the Masoretico-Critical Edition of Isaiah
by Baer and myself; Leipzig, 1872.)

after [Pro 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019), there is the letter פ
written on the margin as the mark of such a break. With [Pro
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020) (vid., l.c.) there indeed
commences a new part of the introductory Mashal discourses. But,
besides, we only seldom meet with

30:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#033); [Pro
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#009).)

coincidences with the division and grouping which have commended
themselves to us. In the MS of the Graecus Venetus, [Pro
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011), [Pro
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#016), and [Pro
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019) have their initial letters
coloured red; but why only these verses, is not manifest. A comparison
of the series of proverbs distinguished by such initials with the Cod.
Jaman. and Cod. II of the Leipzig City Library, makes it more than
probable that it gives a traditional division of the Mishle, which may
perhaps yet be discovered by a comparison of MSS.

(Note: Vid., Gebhardt's Prolegomena to his new edition of the Versio
Veneta.)

But this much is clear, that a historico-literary reconstruction of the
Mishle, and of its several parts, can derive no help from this
comparison.

[Proverbs 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 19:26</span></span>

With [Pro 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026) there thus begins the
fourth principal part of the Solomonic collection of proverbs introduced
by chap. 1-9.

He that doeth violence to his father and chaseth his mother,

Is a son that bringeth shame and disgrace.

The right name is given in the second line to him who acts as is
described in the first. שׁדּד means properly to barricade \[obstruere\],
and then in general to do violence to, here: to ruin one both as to life
and property. The part., which has the force of an attributive clause,
is continued in the finite: qui matrem fugat; this is the rule of the
Heb. style, which is not filome'tochos, Gesen. 134, Anm. 2. Regarding
מבישׁ, vid., at [Pro 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005); regarding
the placing together of הבישׁ והחפּיר, vid., [Pro
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#005), where for הבישׁ, to make shame,
to be scandalous, the word הבאישׁ, which is radically different, meaning
to bring into bad odour, is used. The putting to shame is in בּושׁ ni si
(kindred with Arab. bâth) thought of as disturbatio (cf. σύγχυσις) (cf.
at Ps. 6:11), in חפר (khfr) as opertio (cf. Cicero's Cluent. 20: infamia
et dedecore opertus), not, as I formerly thought, with Frst, as
reddening, blushing (vid., [Psa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006)).
Putting to shame would in this connection be too weak a meaning for
מחפּיר. The paedagogic stamp which [Pro
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026) impresses on this fourth
principal part is made yet further distinct in the verse that now
follows.

[Proverbs 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 19:27</span></span>

27 Cease, my son, to hear instruction,

To depart from the words of knowledge.

Oetinger correctly: cease from hearing instruction if thou wilt make no
other use of it than to depart, etc., i.e., cease to learn wisdom and
afterwards to misuse it. The proverb is, as Ewald says, as "bloody
irony;" but it is a dissuasive from hypocrisy, a warning against the
self-deception of which [Jam 1:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022)
speaks, against heightening one's own condemnation, which is the case of
that servant who knows his lord's will and does it not, [Luk
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047). חדל, in the meaning to leave
off doing something further, is more frequently construed with ל seq.
infin. than with מן (cf. e.g., [Gen
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#008) with [Kg1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021)); but if we mean the omission of
a thing which has not yet been begun, then the construction is with ל,
[Num 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#013), Instead of לשׁגּות, there
might have been also used מלּשׁגּות (omit rather ... than...), and למען
שׁגות would be more distinct; but as the proverb is expressed, לשׁגות is
not to be mistaken as the subord. infin. of purpose. The lxx, Syr.,
Targ., and Jerome do violence to the proverb. Luther, after the example
of older interpreters: instruction, that which leads away from prudent
learning; but musar always means either discipline weaning from evil, or
education leading to good.

[Proverbs 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 19:28</span></span>

28 A worthless witness scoffeth at right;

And the mouth of the godless swalloweth up mischief.

The Mosaic law does not know the oath of witnesses; but the adjuring of
witnesses to speak the truth, [Lev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001), places a false statement almost
in the rank of perjury. The משׁפּט, which legally and morally binds
witnesses, is just their duty to state the matter in accordance with
truth, and without deceitful and malicious reservation; but a worthless
witness (vid., regarding בּליּעל, [Pro
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012)) despiseth what is right (יליץ
with accus.-obj. like [Pro 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009)),
i.e., scornfully disregards this duty. Under 28b Hitzig remarks that בלע
only in Kal means to devour, but in Piel, on the contrary, to absorb =
annihilate; therefore he reads with the lxx and Syr. דּין justice
instead of און mischief: the mouth of the wicked murders that which is
right, properly, swallows down his feeling of right. But בּלּע
interchanges with בּלע in the sense of swallowing only, without the
connected idea of annihilation; cf. כּבלּע for the continuance
\[duration\] of a gulp = for a moment, [Num
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#020) with Job 7:29; and one can thus
understand 28b without any alteration of the text after [Job
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016); cf. [Pro
20:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#012), as well as with the text
altered after [Isa 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012), by no means
so that one makes און the subject: mischief swallows up, i.e., destroys,
the mouth of the wicked (Rashi); for when "mouth" and "to swallow" stand
connected, the mouth is naturally that which swallows, not that which is
swallowed (cf. [Ecc 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#012) : the mouth
of the fool swallows, i.e., destroys, him). Thus 28b means that
wickedness, i.e., that which is morally perverse, is a delicious morsel
for the mouth of the godless, which he eagerly devours; to practise evil
is for him, as we say, "ein wahrer Genuss" \[a true enjoyment\].

[Proverbs 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 19:29</span></span>

29 Judgments are prepared for scorners,

And stripes for the backs of fools.

שׁפמים never means punishment which a court of justice inflicts, but is
always used of the judgments of God, even although they are inflicted by
human instrumentality (vid., [Ch2
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#024)); the singular, which nowhere
occurs, is the segolate n. act. שׁפט = שׁפוט, [Ch2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#009), plur. שׁפוּטים. Hitzig's remark:
"the judgment may, after [Pro 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025),
consist in stripes," is misleading; the stroke, הכּות, there is such as
when, e.g., a stroke on the ear is applied to one who despises that
which is holy, which, under the circumstances, may be salutary; but it
does not fall under the category of shephuthim, nor properly under that
of מהלמות. The former are providential chastisements with which history
itself, or God in history, visits the despiser of religion; the latter
are strokes which are laid on the backs of fools by one who is
instructing them, in order, if possible, to bring them to thought and
understanding. נכון, here inflected as Niph., is used, as [Job
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#023), as meaning to be placed in
readiness, and thus to be surely imminent. Regarding mahalǔmoth, vid.,
at [Pro 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006).
