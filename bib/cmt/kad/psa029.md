The Psalm of the Seven Thunders

The occasion of this Psalm is a thunderstorm; it is not, however,
limited to the outward natural phenomena, but therein is perceived the
self-attestation of the God of the redemptive history. Just as in the
second part of [Psa 19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001) the God of
the revelation of salvation is called יהוה seven times in distinction
from the God revealed in nature, so in this Psalm of thunders, קול ה is
repeated seven times, so that it may be called the Psalm of the hepta'
brontai' ([Rev 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003).). During the time
of the second Temple, as the addition to the inscription by the lxx
ἐξοδίου (ἐξόδου) σκηνῆς (= σκηνοπηγίας) seems to imply,

(Note: The שׁיר of the Temple liturgy of the Shemini Azereth is not
stated in the Talmud (vid., Tosefoth to B. Succa 47a, where, according
to Sofrim xix. 2 and a statement of the Jerusalem Talmud, [Psa
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001), or 12, it guessed at). We only
know, that [Psa 29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001) belongs to the
Psalm-portions fore the intervening days of the feast of tabernacles,
which are comprehended in the vox memorialis בהיהום (Succa 55a, cf.
Rashi on Joma 3a), viz., [Psa 29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001)
()ה; [Psa 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016) ()ו; [Psa
94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016) ()מ; [Psa
94:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008) ()ב; [Psa
81:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#007) ()ה; [Psa
82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005) ()י. Besides this the treatise
Sofrim xviii. 3 mentions [Psa 29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001)
as the Psalm for the festival of Pentecost and the tradition of the
synagogue which prevails even at the present day recognises it only as a
festival Psalm of the first day of Shabuoth Pentecost; the Psalm for
Shemini Azereth is the 65th. The only confirmation of the statement of
the lxx is to be found in the Sohar; for there (section )צ [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001) is referred to the pouring
forth of the water on the seventh day of the feast of the tabernacles
(Hosianna rabba), since it is said, that by means of the seven קולות
(corresponding to the seven compassings of the altar) seven of the
Sephiroth open the flood-gates of heaven.)

it was sung on the Shemini Azereth, the last day (ἐξόδιον, [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036)) of the feast of tabernacles.
Between two tetrastichs, in each of which the name יהוה occurs four
times, lie three pentastichs, which, in their sevenfold קול ה, represent
the peals of thunder which follow in rapid succession as the storm
increases in its fury.

[Psalms 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 29:1</span></span>

The opening strophe calls upon the celestial spirits to praise Jahve;
for a revelation of divine glory is in preparation, which, in its first
movements, they are accounted worthy to behold, for the roots of
everything that takes place in this world are in the invisible world. It
is not the mighty of the earth, who are called in [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006) בּני עליון, but the angels, who
are elsewhere called בּני אלהים (e.g., [Job
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001)), that are here, as in [Psa
89:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#007), called בּני אלים. Since אלים
never means God, like אלהים (so that it could be rendered sons of the
deity), but gods, [Exo 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011), Dan.
9:36, the expression בּני אלים must be translated as a double plural
from בּן־אל, after the analogy of בּתּי כלאים, [Isa
42:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#022), from בּית כּלא (Ges. 108, 3),
"sons of God," not "sons of gods." They, the God-begotten, i.e., created
in the image of God, who form with God their Father as it were one
family (vid., Genesis S. 1212), are here called upon to give unto God
glory and might (the primary passage is [Deu
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#003)), i.e., to render back to Him
cheerfully and joyously in a laudatory recognition, as it were by an
echo, His glory and might, which are revealed and to be revealed in the
created world, and to give unto Him the glory of His name, i.e., to
praise His glorious name ([Psa 72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019))
according its deserts. הבוּ in all three instances has the accent on the
ultima according to rule (cf. on the other hand, [Job
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#022)). הדרת קדשׁ is holy vestments,
splendid festal attire, [Ch2 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021),
cf. [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003).

(Note: The reading proposed in B. Berachoth 30b בּחרדּת (with holy
trembling) has never been a various reading; nor has בּחצרת, after which
the lxx renders it ἐν αὐλῇ ἁγίᾳ αὐτοῦ.)

A revelation of the power of God is near at hand. The heavenly spirits
are to prepare themselves for it with all the outward display of which
they are capable. If [Psa 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002) were a
summons to the church on earth, or, as in [Psa
96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009), to the dwellers upon the earth,
then there ought to be some expression to indicate the change in the
parties addressed; it is, therefore, in [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002) as in [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001), directed to the priests of the
heavenly היכל. In the Apocalypse, also, the songs of praise and
trumpeting of the angels precede the judgments of God.

[Psalms 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 29:3</span></span>

Now follows the description of the revelation of God's power, which is
the ground of the summons, and is to be the subject-matter of their
praise. The All-glorious One makes Himself heard in the language ([Rev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003).) of the thunder, and reveals
Himself in the storm. There are fifteen lines, which naturally arrange
themselves into three five-line strophes. The chief matter with the
poet, however, is the sevenfold קול ה. Although קול is sometimes used
almost as an ejaculatory "Hark!" ([Gen
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010); [Isa
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008)), this must not, with Ewald (286,
f), be applied to the קול ה of the Psalm before us, the theme of which
is the voice of God, who announced Himself from heaven - a voice which
moves the world. The dull sounding קול serves not merely to denote the
thunder of the storm, but even the thunder of the earthquake, the roar
of the tempest, and in general, every low, dull, rumbling sound, by
which God makes Himself audible to the world, and more especially from
the wrathful side of His doxa. The waters in [Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003) are not the lower waters. Then
the question arises what are they? Were the waters of the Mediterranean
intended, they would be more definitely denoted in such a vivid
description. It is, however, far more appropriate to the commencement of
this description to understand them to mean the mass of water gathered
together in the thick, black storm-clouds (vid., [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012); [Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013)). The rumbling

(Note: The simple rendering of קול by "voice" has been retained in the
text of the Psalm, as in the Authorised Version. The word, however,
which Dr. Delitzsch uses is Gedrhn, the best English equivalent of which
is a "rumbling." - Tr.)

of Jahve is, as the poet himself explains in [Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003), the thunder produced on high by
the אל הכּבוד (cf. מלך הכבוד, [Psa
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007).), which rolls over the sea of
waters floating above the earth in the sky. [Psa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004) and [Psa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004), just like [Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003) and [Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003), are independent substantival
clauses. The rumbling of Jahve is, issues forth, or passes by; ב with
the abstract article as in [Psa 77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014);
[Pro 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#005) (cf. [Pro
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#008); [Luk
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#032), ἐν ἰσχύΐ [Rev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002)), is the ב of the distinctive
attribute. In [Psa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003) the first
peals of thunder are heard; in [Psa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004) the storm is coming nearer, and
the peals become stronger, and now it bursts forth with its full
violence: [Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005) describes this in
a general form, and [Psa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005)
expresses by the fut. consec., as it were inferentially, that which is
at present taking place: amidst the rolling of the thunder the
descending lightning flashes rive the cedars of Lebanon (as is
well-known, the lightning takes the outermost points). The suffix in
[Psa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006) does not refer proleptically
to the mountains mentioned afterwards, but naturally to the cedars
(Hengst., Hupf., Hitz.), which bend down before the storm and quickly
rise up again. The skipping of Lebanon and Sirion, however, is not to be
referred to the fact, that their wooded summits bend down and rise
again, but, according to [Psa 114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004),
to their being shaken by the crash of the thunder-a feature in the
picture which certainly does not rest upon what is actually true in
nature, but figuratively describes the apparent quaking of the earth
during a heavy thunderstorm. שריון, according to [Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009), is the Sidonian name of Hermon,
and therefore side by side with Lebanon it represents Anti-Lebanon. The
word, according to the Masora, has ש sinistrum, and consequently is
isriyown, wherefore Hitzig correctly derives it from Arab. srâ, fut. i.,
to gleam, sparkle, cf. the passage from an Arab poet at [Psa
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003). The lightning makes these
mountains bound (Luther, lecken, i.e., according to his explanation: to
spring, skip) like young antelopes. ראם,

(Note: On Arab. r'm vid., Seetzen's Reisen iii. 339 and also iv. 496.)

like βούβαλος, βούβαλις, is a generic name of the antelope, and of the
buffalo that roams in herds through the forests beyond the Jordan even
at the present day; for there are antelopes that resemble the buffalo
and also (except in the formation of the head and the cloven hoofs)
those that resemble the horse, the lxx renders: ὡς υἱὸς μονοκερώτων.
Does this mean the unicorn Germ. one-horn depicted on Persian and
African monuments? Is this unicorn distinct from the one horned
antelope? Neither an unicorn nor an one horned antelope have been seen
to the present day by any traveller. Both animals, and consequently also
their relation to one another, are up to the present time still
undefinable from a scientific point of view.

(Note: By ראם Ludolf in opposition to Bochart understands the
rhinoceros; but this animal, belonging to the swine tribe, is certainly
not meant, or even merely associated with it. Moreover, the rhinoceros
Germ. nose-horn is called in Egypt charnin (from Arab. chrn = qrn), but
the unicorn, charnit. "In the year 1862 the French archaeologist, M.
Waddington, was with me in Damascus when an antiquary brought me an
ancient vessel on which a number of animals were engraved, their names
being written on their bellies. Among the well known animals there was
also an unicorn, exactly like a zebra or a horse, but with a long horn
standing out upon its forehead; on its body was the word Arab. chrnı̂t.
M. Waddington wished to have the vessel and I gave it up to him; and he
took it with him to Paris. We talked a good deal about this unicorn, and
felt obliged to come to the conclusion that the form of the fabulous
animal might have become known to the Arabs at the time of the crusades,
when the English coat of arms came to Syria." - Wetzstein.)

Each peal of thunder is immediately followed by a flash of lightning;
Jahve's thunder cleaveth flames of fire, i.e., forms (as it were
λατομεῖ) the fire-matter of the storm-clouds into cloven flames of fire,
into lightnings that pass swiftly along; in connection with which it
must be remembered that קול ה denotes not merely the thunder as a
phenomenon, but at the same time it denotes the omnipotence of God
expressing itself therein. The brevity and threefold division of [Psa
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007) depicts the incessant, zigzag,
quivering movement of the lightning (tela trisulca, ignes trisulci, in
Ovid). From the northern mountains the storm sweeps on towards the south
of Palestine into the Arabian desert, viz., as we are told in [Psa
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008) (cf. [Psa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005), according to the schema of
"parallelism by reservation"), the wilderness region of Kadesh (Kadesh
Barnea), which, however we may define its position, must certainly have
lain near the steep western slope of the mountains of Edom toward the
Arabah. Jahve's thunder, viz., the thunderstorm, puts this desert in a
state of whirl, inasmuch as it drives the sand (חול) before it in
whirlwinds; and among the mountains it, viz., the strong lightning and
thundering, makes the hinds to writhe, inasmuch as from fright they
bring forth prematurely. both the Hiph. יהיל and the Pil. יחולל are used
with a causative meaning (root חו, חי, to move in a circle, to
encircle). The poet continues with ויּחשׂף, since he makes one effect of
the storm to develope from another, merging as it were out of its
chrysalis state. יערות is a poetical plural form; and חשׂף describes the
effect of the storm which "shells" the woods, inasmuch as it beats down
the branches of the trees, both the tops and the foliage. While Jahve
thus reveals Himself from heaven upon the earth in all His irresistible
power, בּהיכלו, in His heavenly palace ([Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004); [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007)), כּלּו (note how בהיכלו resolves
this כלו out of itself), i.e., each of the beings therein, says: כבוד.
That which the poet, in [Psa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001), has
called upon them to do, now takes place. Jahve receives back His glory,
which is immanent in the universe, in the thousand-voiced echo of
adoration.

[Psalms 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 29:10</span></span>

Luther renders it: "The Lord sitteth to prepare a Flood," thus putting
meaning into the unintelligible rendering of the Vulgate and lxx; and in
fact a meaning that accords with the language - for ישׁב ל is most
certainly intended to be understood after the analogy of ישׁב למשׁפט,
[Psa 122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005), cf. [Psa
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008) - just as much as with the
context; for the poet has not thus far expressly referred to the
torrents of rain, in which the storm empties itself. Engelhardt also
(Lutherische Zeitschrift, 1861, 216f.), Kurtz (Bibel und Astronomie, S.
568, Aufl. 4), Riehm (Liter. - Blatt of the Allgem. Kirchen-Zeit., 1864,
S. 110), and others understand by מבול the quasi-flood of the torrent of
rain accompanying the lightning and thunder. But the word is not למבול,
but למּבול, and המּבּוּל (Syr. momûl) occurs exclusively in Gen 6-11 as
the name of the great Flood. Every tempest, however, calls to mind this
judgment and its merciful issue, for it comes before us in sacred
history as the first appearance of rain with lightning and thunder, and
of the bow in the clouds speaking its message of peace (Genesis, S.
276). The retrospective reference to this event is also still further
confirmed by the aorist ויּשׁב which follows the perfect ישׁב (Hofmann,
Schriftbeweis i. 208). Jahve - says the poet - sat (upon His throne) at
the Flood (to execute it), and sits (enthroned) in consequence thereof,
or since that time, as this present revelation of Him in the tempest
shows, as King for ever, inasmuch as He rules down here upon earth from
His throne in the heavens ([Psa
115:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016)) in wrath and in mercy, judging
and dispensing blessing. Here upon earth He has a people, whom from
above He endows with a share of His own might and blesses with peace,
while the tempests of His wrath burst over their foes. How expressive is
בּשּׁלום as the closing word of this particular Psalm! It spans the
Psalm like a rain-bow. The opening of the Psalm shows us the heavens
opened and the throne of God in the midst of the angelic songs of
praise, and the close of the Psalm shows us, on earth, His people
victorious and blessed with peace (בּ as in [Gen
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#001)

(Note: The Holy One, blessed be He-says the Mishna, Uksin iii. 12, with
reference to this passage in the Psalms-has not found any other vessel
(כלי) to hold the blessing specially allotted to Israel but peace.))

in the midst of Jahve's voice of anger, which shakes all things. Gloria
in excelsis is its beginning, and pax in terris its conclusion.
