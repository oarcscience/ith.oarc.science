### [Ezekiel Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 21:1</span></span>

The Sword of the Lord and Its Disastrous Effects

[Eze 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001.md). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#002.md). Son of
man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and trickle over the holy places,
and prophesy over the land of Israel, [Eze
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003.md). And say to the land of Israel,
Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with thee, and will draw my
sword out of its scabbard, and cut off from thee the righteous and the
wicked. [Eze 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#004.md). Because I will cut
off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword to
go forth from its scabbard against all flesh from south to north. [Eze
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#005.md). And all flesh shall know that I,
Jehovah, have drawn my sword out of its scabbard: it shall not return
again. [Eze 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#006.md). And thou, son of
man, sigh! so that the hips break; and with bitter pain sigh before
their eyes! [Eze 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007.md). And when they
say to thee, Wherefore dost thou sigh? say, Because of a report that it
is coming; and every heart will sink, and all hands become powerless,
and every spirit will become dull, and all knees turn into water:
Behold, it cometh, and will happen, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. -
In the preceding parable, the expression "forest of the field in the
south," or "forest of the south-land," was enigmatical. This is
explained to signify Jerusalem with its holy places (מקדּשׁים, see comm.
on [Eze 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#024).md), and the land of Israel,
i.e., the kingdom of Judah. In accordance with this, the fire kindled by
the Lord is interpreted as being the sword of the Lord. It is true that
this is a figurative expression; but it is commonly used for war, which
brings with it devastation and death, and would be generally
intelligible. The sword will cut off both righteous and wicked. This
applies to the outer side of the judgment, inasmuch as both good and bad
fall in war. This is the only aspect brought into prominence here, since
the great purpose was to alarm the sinners, who were boasting of their
security; but the distinction between the two, as described in [Eze
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md)., is not therefore to be regarded
as no longer existing. This sword will not return, sc. into the
scabbard, till it has accomplished the result predicted in [Eze
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003.md) (cf. [Sa2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022.md); [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011).md). As Tremellius has aptly
observed upon this passage, "the last slaughter is contrasted with the
former ones, in which, after the people had been chastened fore a time,
the sword was returned to its scabbard again." In order to depict the
terrors of this judgment before the eyes of the people, the prophet is
commanded to groan before their eyes in the most painful way possible
([Eze 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#006)..md). בּשׁברון מתנים, with
breaking of the hips, i.e., with pain sufficient to break the hips, the
seat of strength in man (compare [Nah
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011.md); [Isa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003).md). מרירוּת, bitterness, i.e.,
bitter anguish. The reason which he is to assign to the questioners for
this sighing is "on account of the report that is coming," - an
antiptosis for "on account of the coming report" (cf. [Gen
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004), etc..md). the report comes when the
substance of it is realized. The reference is to the report of the sword
of the Lord, - that is to say, of the approach of the Chaldeans to
destroy Jerusalem and the kingdom of Judah. The impression which this
disclosure will make upon the hearers will be perfectly paralyzing ([Eze
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007).md). All courage and strength for
offering resistance will be crippled and broken. נמס כּל־לב (cf. [Nah
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011).md) is strengthened by כּהתה, every
spirit will become dull, so that no one will know what counsel to give.
'כּל־בּרכּים תּלכנה וגו corresponds to רפוּ כּל־ידים (cf. [Eze
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#017).md). The threat is strengthened by
the words, "behold, it cometh, and will take place." The subject is
שׁמוּעה, the report, i.e., the substance of the report. - This threat is
more fully expanded in [Eze 21:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#008.md);
[Eze 21:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#008.md) corresponding to [Eze
21:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001.md), and [Eze
21:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014.md) to [Eze
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#006.md), [Eze
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007.md).

[Ezekiel 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 21:8</span></span>

The Sword is Sharpened for Slaying

[Eze 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#008.md). And the word of Jehovah
came to me, saying, [Eze 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009.md). Son of
man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, A sword, a sword sharpened
and also polished: [Eze 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#010.md). That it
may effect a slaughter is it sharpened; that it may flash is it
polished: or shall we rejoice (saying), the sceptre of my son despiseth
all wood? [Eze 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#011.md). But it has been
given to be polished, to take it in the hand; it is sharpened, the
sword, and it is polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. [Eze
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012.md). Cry and howl, son of man, for
it goeth over my people, it goeth over all the princes of Israel: they
have fallen by the sword along with my people: therefore smite upon the
thigh. [Eze 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#013.md). For the trial is
made, and what if the despising sceptre shall not come? is the saying of
the Lord Jehovah. [Eze 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014.md). And
thou, son of man, prophesy and smite the hands together, and the sword
shall double itself into threefold, the sword of the pierced: it is the
sword of a pierced one, of the great one, which encircles them. [Eze
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#015.md). That the heart may be
dissolved, and stumbling-blocks may be multiplied, I have set the
drawing of the sword against all their gates: Alas! it is made into
flashing, drawn for slaying. [Eze
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#016.md). Gather thyself up to the right
hand, turn to the left, whithersoever thine edge is intended. [Eze
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017.md). And I also will smite my hands
together, and quiet my wrath: I, Jehovah, have spoken it. - The
description of the sword is thrown into a lyrical form ([Eze
21:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#008).md), - a kind of sword-song,
commemorating the terrible devastation to be effected by the sword of
the Lord. The repetition of חרב in [Eze
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009.md) is emphatic. הוּחדּה is the
perfect Hophal of חדד, to sharpen. מרוּטה is the passive participle of
מרט, to polish; מרטּה ([Eze 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#010).md),
the participle Pual, with מ dropped, and Dagesh euphon. היה, a rare form
of the infinitive for היות. The polishing gives to the sword a flashing
brilliancy, which renders the sharpness of its edge still more terrible.
The very obscure words, 'או נשׂישׂ וגו, I agree with Schmieder and
Kliefoth in regarding as a protest, interposed by the prophet in the
name of the people against the divine threat of the sword of vengeance,
on the ground of the promises which had been given to the tribe of
Judah. או, or perhaps; introducing an opposite case, or an exception to
what has been said. The words 'שׁבט are to be taken as an objection, so
that לאמר is to be supplied in thought. The objection is taken from the
promise given in Jacob's blessing to the tribe of Judah: "the sceptre
will not depart from Judah" ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md). שׁבט בּני points
unquestionably to this. בּני is taken from [Eze
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009.md), where the patriarch addresses
Judah, whom he compares to a young lion, as בּני. Consequently the
sceptre of my son is the command which the patriarch holds out to view
before the tribe of Judah. This sceptre despises all wood, i.e., every
other ruler's staff, as bad wood. This view is not rendered a doubtful
one by the fact that שׁבט is construed as a feminine here, whereas it is
construed as a masculine in every other case; for this construction is
unquestionable in [Eze 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007) (12.md), and
has many analogies in its favour. All the other explanations that have
been proposed are hardly worth mentioning, to say nothing of refuting,
as they amount to nothing more than arbitrary conjectures; whereas the
assumption that the words are to be explained from [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md) is naturally suggested by the
unquestionable allusion to the prophecy in that passage, which we find
in [Eze 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027.md) of the present chapter.
ויּתּן in [Eze 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#011.md) is to be taken
adversatively, "but he gave it (the sword) to be sharpened." The subject
to ויּתּן is not Jehovah, but is indefinite, "one" (man, Angl. they),
although it is actually God who has prepared the sword for the slaughter
of Israel. The train of thought is the following: Do not think we have
no reason to fear the sharply-ground sword of Jehovah, because Judah has
received the promise that the sceptre shall not depart from it; and this
promise will certainly be fulfilled, and Judah be victorious over every
hostile power. The promise will not help you in this instance. The sword
is given to be ground, not that it may be put into the scabbard, but
that it may be taken in the hand by a slayer, and smite all the people
and all its princes. In the phrase היא הוּחדּה חרב, חרב is in apposition
to the subject היא, and is introduced to give emphasis to the words. It
is not till [Eze 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#019.md) that it is
stated who the slayer is; but the hearers of the prophecy could be in no
doubt. Consequently - this is the connection with [Eze
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012.md) - there is no ground for
rejoicing from a felling of security and pride, but rather an occasion
for painful lamentation.

This is the meaning contained in the command to the prophet to cry and
howl. For the sword will come upon the nation and its princes. It is the
simplest rendering to take היא as referring to הרב, היה ב, to be at a
person, to fasten to him, to come upon him, as in [Sa1
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#014.md); [Sa2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017.md). מגוּרי, not from גּוּר, but the
passive participle of מגר in the Pual, to overthrow, cast down ([Psa
89:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#045).md): "fallen by the sword have they
(the princes) become, along with my people." The perfects are prophetic,
representing that which will speedily take place as having already
occurred. - Smiting upon the thigh is a sign of alarm and horror ([Jer
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019).md). בּחן, perfect Pual, is used
impersonally: the trial is made. The words allude to the victories
gained already by Nebuchadnezzar, which have furnished tests of the
sharpness of his sword. The question which follows וּמה contains an
aposiopesis: and what? Even if the despising sceptre shall not come,
what will be the case then? שׁבט מאסת, according to [Eze
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#010.md), is the sceptre of Judah, which
despises all other sceptres as bad wood. יהיה, in this instance, is not
"to be," in the sense of to remain, but to become, to happen, to come
(come to pass), to enter. The meaning is, if the sceptre of Judah shall
not display, or prove itself to possess, the strength expected of it. -
With [Eze 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014.md) the address takes a
new start, for the purpose of depicting still further the operations of
the sword. Smiting the hands together (smiting hand in hand) is a
gesture expressive of violent emotion (cf. [Eze
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011.md); [Num
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010).md). The sword is to double, i.e.,
multiply itself, into threefold (שׁלישׁתה, adverbial), namely, in its
strength, or its edge. Of course this is not to be taken arithmetically,
as it has been by Hitzig, but is a bold paradoxical statement concerning
the terrible effect produced by the sword. It is not even to be
understood as referring to three attacks made at different times by the
Chaldeans upon Jerusalem, as many of the commentators suppose. The sword
is called חבב חללים, sword of pierced ones, because it produces the
pierced or slain. The following words are rendered by Hitzig and
Kliefoth: the great sword of the slain. But apart from the tautology
which this occasions, the rendering can hardly be defended on
grammatical grounds. For, in the first place, we cannot see why the
singular חלל should have been chosen, when the expression was repeated,
instead of the plural חללים; and secondly, חגּדול cannot be an adjective
agreeing with חרב, for חרב is a noun of the feminine gender, and is
construed here as a feminine, as החדרת clearly shows. הגּדול is in
apposition to חלל, "sword of a pierced man, the great one;" and the
great man pierced is the king, as Ewald admits, in agreement with
Hengstenberg and Hvernick. The words therefore affirm that the sword
will not only slay the mass of the people, but pierce the king himself.
(See also the comm. on [Eze 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025)..md) -
[Eze 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#015.md) is not dependent upon what
precedes, but introduces a new thought, viz., for what purpose the sword
is sharpened. God has placed the flashing sword before all the gates of
the Israelites, in order that (למען, pleonastic for למען) the heart may
dissolve, the inhabitants may lose all their courage for defence, and to
multiply offendicula, i.e., occasions to fall by the sword. The ἁπ. λεγ.
אבחת signifies the rapid motion or turning about of the sword (cf. [Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024).md); אבח, related to הפך, in the
Mishna אפך. The ἁπ. λεγ. מעטּה, fem. of מעט, does not mean smooth, i.e.,
sharpened, synonymous with מרט, but, according to the Arabic m̀t, eduxit
e vagina gladium, drawn (from the scabbard). In [Eze
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#016.md) the sword is addressed, and
commanded to smite right and left. התאחדי, gather thyself up, i.e., turn
with all thy might toward the right (Tanchum). To the verb השׂימוּ it is
easy to supply פּניך, from the context, "direct thine edge toward the
left." אנה, whither, without an interrogative, as in [Jos
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#005.md) and [Neh
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#016.md). מעדות, from יעד, intended,
ordered; not, directed, turned. The feminine form may be accounted for
from a construction ad sensum, the gender regulating itself according to
the חרב addressed in פּניך. The command to the sword is strengthened by
the explanation given by Jehovah in [Eze
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017.md), that He also (like the prophet,
[Eze 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014).md) will smite His hands
together and cool His wrath upon them (cf. [Eze
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013).md).

[Ezekiel 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 21:18</span></span>

The sword of the king of Babylon will smite Jerusalem, and then the
Ammonites also. - [Eze 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#018.md). And the
word of Jehovah came to me, saying, [Eze
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#019.md). And thou, son of man, make to
thyself two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come by
them; out of one land shall they both come forth, and draw a hand, at
the cross road of the city do thou draw it. [Eze
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#020.md). Make a way that the sword may
come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah into fortified
Jerusalem. [Eze 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021.md). For the king of
Babylon is stopping at the cross road, at the parting of the two ways,
to practise divination. He is shaking the arrows, inquiring of the
teraphim, looking at the liver. [Eze
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#022.md). The divination falls to his
right: Jerusalem, to set battering-rams, to open the mouth with a
death-cry, to lift up the voice with a war-cry, to set battering-rams at
the gates, to heap up a rampart, to build siege towers. - After the
picture of the terrible devastation which the sword of the Lord will
produce, the last word of God in this prophecy answers the questions, in
whose hand Jehovah will place His sword, and whom it will smite. The
slayer into whose hand the sharpened sword is given ([Eze
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#011).md) is the king of Babylon, and it
will smite not only Judah, but the Ammonites also. Jerusalem and Judah
will be the first to fall, and then the arch-enemy of the covenant
nation, namely Ammon, will succumb to the strokes of the sword of
Jehovah, in order that the embittered enemies of the Lord and His people
may learn that the fall of Jerusalem is not, as they fancy, a proof of
the impotence, but rather of the omnipotence, of its God. In this way
does our prophecy expand into a prediction of the judgment which will
fall upon the whole of the world in hostility to God. For it is only as
the arch-enemies of the kingdom of God that the Ammonites come into
consideration here. The parallel between Israel and the sons of Ammon is
carried out in such a way as to give constant prominence to the
distinction between them. Jerusalem will fall, the ancient theocracy
will be destroyed till he shall come who will restore the right ([Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md) and [Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027).md). Ammon, on the other hand, will
perish, and not a trace be left ([Eze
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#031.md), [Eze
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032).md).

This prediction is exhibited to the eye by means of a sign. The prophet
is to make two ways, i.e., to prepare a sketch representing a road
leading from a country, viz., Babylon, and dividing at a certain spot
into two roads, one of which leads to Rabbath-Ammon, the capital of the
kingdom of the Ammonites, the other to Judah, into Jerusalem. He is to
draw the ways for the coming (לבוא) of the sword of the king of Babylon.
At the fork of the road he is to engrave a hand, יד, i.e., an index.
בּרא signifies in the Piel to cut away ([Jos
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015.md), [Jos
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#018).md), to dig or hew ([Eze
23:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#047).md), here to engrave written
characters in hard material. The selection of this word shows that
Ezekiel was to sketch the ways upon some hard material, probably a brick
or tile (cf. [Eze 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001).md). יד does not
mean locus spatium, but a hand, i.e., an index. ראשׁ , the beginning of
the road, i.e., the fork of the road ([Eze
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#025).md), is explained in [Eze
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021.md), where it is called אם, mother
of the road, inasmuch as the roads start from the point of separation,
and ראשׁ שׁני הדּרכים, beginning of the two roads. דּרך עיר, the road to
a city. For Rabbath-Ammon, which is preserved in the ruins of Ammn, on
the Upper Jabbok (Nahr Ammn), see the comm. on [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md). The road to Judah is still more
precisely defined by בּירוּשׁלים בּצוּרה, into fortified Jerusalem,
because the conquest of Jerusalem was the purpose of Nebuchadnezzar's
expedition. The omission of the article before בּצוּרה may be explained
from the nature of the participle, in which, even in prose, the article
may be left out after a definite noun (cf. Ewald, 335a). The drawing is
explained in [Eze 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021.md) and [Eze
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#022.md). The king of Babylon is halting
(עמד, to stand still, stop) to consult his oracles, and inquire which of
the two roads he is to take. קסם, to take in hand, or practise
divination. In order that he may proceed safely, he avails himself of
all the means of divination at his command. He shakes the arrows (more
strictly, the quiver with the arrows). On the practice itself Jerome
writes as follows: "He consults the oracle according to the custom of
his nation, putting his arrows into a quiver, and mixing them together,
with the names of individuals inscribed or stamped upon them, to see
whose arrow will come out, and which state shall be first attacked."

(Note: The arrow-lot (Belomantie) of the ancient Greeks (Homer, Il. iii.
324, vii. 182, 183) was similar to this; also that of the ancient Arabs
(vid., Pococke, Specim. hist. Arab. pp. 327ff., and the passages from
Nuweiri quoted by Reiske, Samml. einiger Arab. Sprichwrter von den
Stecken oder Stben, p. 21). Another kind, in which the lot was obtained
by shooting off the arrows, was common according to the Fihrist el Ulum
of En-Nedm among the Hananian Ssabians (see Chwolsohn, Ssabier, ii. pp.
26 and 119, 200).)

He consults the Teraphim, or Penates, worshipped as oracular deities and
gods of good fortune (see the comm. on [Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md) and my Biblical Archaeology,
90). Nothing is known concerning the way in which these deities were
consulted and gave their oracles. He examines the liver. The practice of
ἡπατοσκοπία, extispicium, in which signs of good or bad luck, of the
success or failure of any enterprise, were obtained from the peculiar
condition of the liver of the sacrificial animals, was a species of
divination to which great importance was attached by both the
Babylonians (vid., Diod. Sic. ii. 29) and the Romans (Cicero, de divin.
vi. 13), and of which traces were found, according to Barhebr. Chron. p.
125, as late as the eighth century of the Christian era among the
Ssabians of Haran.

The divination resulted in a decision for Jerusalem. בּימינו היה is not
to be translated "in his right hand was," but "into his right hand there
came." היה: ἐγένετο (lxx), נפיל (Chald.), קסם does not mean lot (Ges.),
but soothsaying, divination. ירוּשׁלים is connected with this in the
form of a noun in apposition: the divination which indicated Jerusalem.
The right hand is the more important of the two. The meaning of the
words cannot be more precisely defined, because we are not acquainted
with the king of divination referred to; even if we were to take the
words as simply relating to the arrow in this sense, that an arrow with
the inscription "Jerusalem" came into his right hand, and thus furnished
the decision, which was afterwards confirmed by consulting the Teraphim
and examining the liver. But the circumstance itself, that is to say,
the fact that the divination coincided with the purpose of God, must not
be taken, as Hvernick supposes, as suggesting a point of contact between
Hebraism and the soothsaying of heathenism, which was peculiar to
Ezekiel or to the time of the captivity. All that is proved by this fact
is, that even heathenism is subject to the rule and guidance of Almighty
God, and is made subservient to the accomplishment of the plans of both
His kingdom and His salvation. In the words, to set bettering rams,
etc., the substance of the oracle obtained by Nebuchadnezzar is more
minutely given. It is a double one, showing what he is to do: viz., (1)
to set bettering rams, i.e., to proceed to the siege of Jerusalem, as
still further described in the last portion of the verse ([Eze
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002)); and (2.md) to raise the war-cry for
storming the city, that is to say, to take it by storm. The two clauses
'לפתּח וגו and 'להרים וגו are synonymous; they are not "pure tautology,"
however, as Hitzig affirms, but are chosen for the purpose of giving
greater emphasis to the thought. The expression בּרצח creates some
difficulty, inasmuch as the phrase "ut aperiat os in caede" (Vulg.), to
open the mouth in murder or ruin, i.e., to put to death or lay in ruins,
is a very striking one, and could hardly be justified as an "energetic
expression for the battle-cry" (Hvernick). ב does not mean "to," and
cannot indicate the intention, all the less because בּרצח is parallel to
בּתרוּעה, where תרועה is that in which the raising of the voice
expresses itself. There is nothing left then but to take רצח in the
sense of field-or war-cry, and to derive this meaning either from רצח
or, per metathesin, from צרח.

[Ezekiel 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 21:23</span></span>

This announcement will appear to the Judaeans, indeed, to be a deceptive
divination, but nevertheless it will be verified. - [Eze
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023.md). And it is like deceptive
divination in their eyes; sacred oaths are theirs (lit., to them); but
he brings the iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken. [Eze
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024.md). Therefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Because ye bring your iniquity to remembrance, in that your
offences are made manifest, so that your sins appear in all your deeds,
because ye are remembered ye shall be taken with the hand. [Eze
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025.md). And thou pierced one, sinner,
prince of Israel, whose day is come at the time of the final
transgression, [Eze 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md). Thus saith
the Lord Jehovah, The turban will be removed, the crown taken off. This
is not this; the low will be lifted up, and the lofty lowered. [Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027.md). Overthrown, overthrown,
overthrown will I make it; even this shall not be, till He cometh, to
whom is the right, to Him do I give it. - In [Eze
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023) (28.md), להם, which is more
precisely defined by בּעיניהם, refers to the Israelites, i.e., the
Judaeans. This also applies to the following להם, which cannot possibly
be taken as referring to a different subject, say, for example, the
Chaldeans. It is evident, therefore, that it is impossible to sustain
the rendering given in Gesenius' Thesaurus (s.v.) to the obscure words
שׁבעי שׁבעות, viz., qui juramenta jurarunt eis (sc., Chaldaeis), which
Maurer has modified and expounded thus: "they will not fear these
auguries; they will swear oaths to them (the Chaldeans), that is to say,
according to their usual custom, these truce-breakers will take fresh
oaths, hoping that the Chaldeans will be conciliated thereby." Moreover,
the thought itself is an unsuitable one, inasmuch as "the defiant
attitude of confidence with which they looked such awfully threatening
danger in the face must have had some other ground than a reliance upon
false oaths and Chaldean credulity" (Hvernick). The common explanation,
which Rosenmller and Kliefoth uphold, is, "because the Chaldeans are
sworn allies, sworn confederates of theirs;" or as Kliefoth explains it,
"on account of the oath of fealty or vassalage sworn by Zedekiah to
Nebuchadnezzar, they have sworn confederates in the Chaldeans, and
relying upon this, they are confident that they have no hostile attack
to fear from them." But this is altogether untenable, not only because
it is perfectly arbitrary to supply "the Chaldeans," but still more for
the reason adduced by Maurer. "How," he justly asks, "could the Judaeans
despise these auguries because the Chaldeans were bound to them by an
oath when they themselves had broken faith? When a treaty has been
violated by one party, is not the other released from his oath?" We
therefore adopt the same explanation as Hvernick: "oaths of oaths are
theirs (to them), i.e., the most sacred oaths are (made) to them,
namely, by God." They rely upon that which God has solemnly sworn to
them, without considering upon what this promise was conditional,
namely, upon a faithful observance on their part of the commandments of
God. For the fact itself, compare [Eze
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#042.md), and such passages as [Psa
105:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009.md)., etc. The form שׁבעי by the
side of שׁבעות may be explained in a very simple way from the relation
of the construct state, i.e., from the endeavour to secure an obvious
form for the construct state, and cannot in any case furnish a
well-founded argument against the correctness of our explanation. As
Ezekiel uses נפשׁים for נפשׁות in [Eze
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020.md), he may also have formed שׁבעים
(שׁבעי) by the side of שׁבעות. - As they rely upon the promises of God
without reflecting upon their own breach of covenant, God will bring
their sin to remembrance through His judgment. והוּא is Jehovah, upon
whose oaths they rely. עון must not be restricted to Zedekiah's breach
of covenant, since [Eze 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024.md) clearly
shows that it is the wrong-doing of Judah generally. להתּפשׂ in [Eze
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024) (29.md) is also to be understood of
the whole nation, which is to be taken and punished by the king of
Babylon. For [Eze 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024) (29.md)
introduces the reason for the statement made in the last clause of [Eze
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023) (28.md). God must put the people in
remembrance of their iniquity by inflicting punishment, because they
have called it to remembrance by sins committed without any shame, and
thereby have, so to speak, compelled God to remember them, and to cause
the sinners to be grasped by the hand of the slayer. הזכּיר עון is used
in [Eze 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024) (29.md) in a different
sense from [Eze 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023) (28.md), and is
therefore explained by 'בּהגּלות. בּכּף, which is indefinite in itself,
points back to יד הורג in [Eze 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#011.md)
(16), and receives from that its more exact definition.

With [Eze 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025.md) the address turns to
the chief sinner, the godless King Zedekiah, who was bringing the
judgment of destruction upon the kingdom by his faithless breach of
oath. The words חלל, רשׁע, and 'נשׂיא ישׂ are asyndeta, co-ordinate to
one another. חלל does not mean profane or infamous (βέβηλε, lxx), but
simply pierced, slain. This meaning is to be retained here. This is
demanded not only by the fixed usage of the language, but also by the
relation in which חלל stands both to [Eze
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014.md) and to חללי רשׁעים in [Eze
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029) (34.md). It is true that Zedekiah
was not pierced by the sword either at that time or afterwards, but was
simply blinded and led in captivity to Babylon, where he died. But all
that follows from this is, that חלל is used here in a figurative sense,
given up to the sword, i.e., to death; and Zedekiah is so designated for
the purpose of announcing in a more energetic manner the certainty of
his fate. The selection of the term חלל is the more natural, because
throughout the whole prophecy the description of the judgment takes its
character from the figure of the sword of Jehovah. As God does not
literally wield a sword, so חלל is no proof of actual slaying with the
sword. יומו .dro, his day, is the day of his destruction (cf. [Sa1
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#010).md), or of the judgment upon him.
The time of the final transgression is not the time when the
transgression reaches its end, i.e., its completion, but the time when
the wickedness brings the end, i.e., destruction (cf. [Eze
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md), and for קץ in this sense, [Eze
7:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002).md). The fact that the end, the
destruction, is come, i.e., is close at hand, is announced in [Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md) to the prince, and in his person
to the whole nation. If we understand the connection in this way, which
is naturally suggested by [Eze 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025.md),
we get rid of the objection, which led Kliefoth to question the fact
that it is the king who is addressed in [Eze
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025.md), and to take the words as
collective, "ye slaughtered sinners, princes of Israel," and to
understand them as referring to the entire body of rulers, including the
priests, - an explanation that is completely upset by the words נשׂיא...
אתּה (thou...prince), which are so entirely opposed to the collective
view. Again, the remark that "what follows in [Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md), viz., the statement to be made
to the נשׂיא, has really nothing to do with him, since the sweeping away
of the priesthood did not affect Zedekiah personally" (Kliefoth), is
neither correct nor conclusive. For [Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md) contains an announcement not
only of the abrogation of the priesthood, but also of the destruction of
the kingdom, which did affect Zedekiah both directly and personally.
Moreover, we must not isolate the king addressed, even as an individual,
from the position which he occupied, or, at any rate, which he ought to
have occupied as a theocratic monarch, so as to be able to say that the
abrogation of the priesthood did not affect him. The priesthood was one
of the fundamental pillars of the theocracy, the removal of which would
necessarily be followed by the collapse of the divine state, and
therefore by the destruction of the monarchy. Hence it is that the
abolition of the priesthood is mentioned first. The infinitives absolute
(not imperatives) הסיר and הרים are selected for the purpose of
expressing the truth in the most emphatic manner; and the verbs are
synonymous. הרים, to lift up, i.e., not to elevate, but to take away, to
abolish, as in [Isa 57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014.md); [Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md). מצנפת does not mean the royal
diadem, like צניף in [Isa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003.md), but
the tiara of the high priest, as it does in every instance in the
Pentateuch, from which Ezekiel has taken the word. העטרה, the king's
crown. The diadem of the priest and the regal crown are the insignia of
the offices of high priest and king; and consequently their removal is
the abolition of both high-priesthood and monarchy. These words contain
the sentence of death upon the theocracy, of which the Aaronic
priesthood and the Davidic monarchy constituted the foundations.

They predict not merely a temporary, but a complete abolition of both
offices and dignities; and their fulfilment took place when the kingdom
of Judah was destroyed by the king of Babylon. The earthly sovereignty
of the house of David was not restored again after the captivity; and
the high-priesthood of the restoration, like the second temple, was only
a shadowy outline of the glory and essential features of the
high-priesthood of Aaron. As the ark with the Shechinah, or the gracious
presence of God, was wanting in the temple of Zerubbabel; so were the
Urim and Thummim wanting to the high-priesthood, and these were the only
means by which the high priest could really carry out the mediation
between the Lord and the people. זאת לא זאת .el (this is not this) does
not refer to the tiara (mitre) and crown. זאת is neuter, and therefore
construed with the masculine היה. This (mitre and crown) will not be
this (היה is prophetic), i.e., it will not continue, it will be all over
with it (Hvernick, Maurer, and Kliefoth). To this there is appended the
further thought, that a general inversion of things will take place.
This is the meaning of the words - the low will be lifted up, and the
lofty lowered. הגבּהּ and השׁפּיל are infinitives, and are chosen in the
same sense as in the first hemistich. The form השּׁפלה, with ה without
the tone, is masculine; the ־ה probably serving merely to give greater
fulness to the form, and to make it correspond more nearly to הגּבהּ.

(Note: Hitzig has given a most preposterous exposition of this verse.
Taking the words הסיר and הרים as antithetical, in the sense of removing
ad exalting or sustaining in an exalted position, and regarding the
clauses as questions signifying, "Shall the high-priesthood be
abolished, and the real dignity, on the contrary, remain untouched?" he
finds the answer to these questions in the words זאת לא (this, not
this). They contain, in his opinion, as affirmation of the former and a
negation of the latter. But he does not tell us how זאת לא זאת without a
verb can possibly mean, "the former (the abrogation of the
high-priesthood) will take place, but the latter (the exaltation of the
monarchy) will not occur." And, finally, the last clause, "the low shall
be lifted up," etc., is said to contain simply a watchword, which is not
for the time being to be followed by any result. Such trifling needs no
refutation. We simply observe, therefore, that there is no ground for
the assertion, that הרים without מן cannot possibly signify to abolish.)

This general thought is expressed still more definitely in [Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027.md). עוּה, which is repeated twice
to give greater emphasis to the thought, is a noun derived from עוּה,
inversion, overthrow; and the suffix in אשׂימנּהּ points back to זאת in
[Eze 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026) (31.md). This, the existing
state, the high-priesthood and the monarch, will I make into
destruction, or utterly overthrow. But the following זאת cannot also
refer to the tiara and crown, as Kliefoth supposes, on account of the
גּם which precedes it. This shows that זאת relates to the thing last
mentioned. Even this, the overthrow, shall have no durability; or, as
Tanch. has correctly expressed it, neque haec conditio erit durabilis.
The following עד־בּא attaches itself not so much to this last clause as
to the main thought: overthrow upon overthrow will ensue. The thought is
this: "nowhere is there rest, nowhere security; all things are in a
state of flux till the coming of the great Restorer and Prince of peace"
(Hengstenberg). It is generally acknowledged that the words עד־בּא
אשׁר־לו המּשׁפּט contain an allusion to [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), עד כּי; and it is only by a
false interpretation of the preceding clauses, wrung from the words by
an arbitrary alteration of the text, that Hitzig is able to set this
connection aside. At the same time, אשׁר־לו המּשׁפּט is of course not to
be taken as a philological explanation of the word שׁילה, but is simply
a theological interpretation of the patriarchal prophecy, with direct
reference to the predicted destruction of the existing relations in
consequence of the ungodliness and unrighteousness of the leaders of the
theocracy up to that time. המּשׁפּט is not the rightful claim to the
mitre and crown, but right in an objective sense, as belonging to God
([Deu 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#017).md), and entrusted by God to
the earthly government as His representative. He then, to whom this
right belongs, and to whom God will give it, is the Messiah, of whom the
prophets from the time of David onwards have prophesied as the founder
and restorer of perfect right on earth (cf. Ps 72; [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md); [Jer
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017).md). The suffix attached to נתתּיו
is not a dative, but an accusative, referring to משׁפּט (cf. [Psa
72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001).md). There was no necessity to
mention the person again to whom God would give the right, as He had
already been designated in the previous expression אשׁר לו.

Overthrow of the Ammonites

[Eze 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md). And thou, son of man,
prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, concerning the sons of
Ammon, and concerning their scorn, sword, sword, drawn to slay,
polished, that it may devour, that it may flash! [Eze
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029.md). While they prophesy deceit to
thee, while they divine lying to thee, it shall lay thee by the necks of
the sinners slain, whose day cometh at the time of the final
transgression. [Eze 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#030.md). Put it in
its scabbard again. At the place where thou wast created, in the land of
thy birth will I judge thee, [Eze
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#031.md). And pour out my anger upon
thee, kindle the fire of my wrath against thee, and give thee into the
hand of foolish men, of smiths of destruction. [Eze
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032.md). Thou shalt be for the fire to
devour; thy blood shall remain in the midst of the land; thou shalt be
remembered no more; for I Jehovah have spoken it. - As Judah in
Jerusalem will fall by the sword of the king of Babylon, contrary to all
expectation; so will the Ammonites be punished for their scorn with
utter extermination. חרפּה is scorn at the overthrow of Israel (cf. [Eze
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md), [Eze
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006.md), and [Zep
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008).md). The sword is already drawn
against them. פּתוּחה, taken out of the scabbard, as in [Psa
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#014.md). לטבח is to be connected with
פּתוּחה, notwithstanding the accents, and להכיל להכיל with מרוּטה. This
is required by the correspondence of the clauses. הכיל is regarded as a
derivative of כּוּל by Ewald and others, in the sense of ad sustinendum,
according to capacity, i.e., as much as possible. But the adverbial
rendering it opposed to the context, and cannot be sustained from [Eze
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#032.md). Moreover, כּוּל, to contain, is
applicable enough to goblets and other vessels, but not to a sword.
Hitzig therefore explains it from the Arabic kll, to blunt (sc., the
eyes), i.e., to blind. But this is open to the objection that the form
הכיל points to the verb כּוּל rather than כּלל; and also to a still
greater one, - namely, that there is nothing in the Hebrew usage to
suggest the use of כלל in such a sense as this, and even if it were used
in the sense of blunting, it would be perfectly arbitrary to supply
עינים; and lastly, that even the flashing of the sword does not suggest
the idea of blinding, but is intended to heighten the terror occasioned
by the sharpness of the sword. We therefore adhere to the derivation of
הכיל from אכל, and regard it as a defective form for האכיל, like תּמרוּ
for תּאמרוּ in [Sa2 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#014.md), יהל as
syncopated form for יאהל ([Isa 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020).md),
and watochez ותּחז for ותּאחז in [Sa2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#009.md); literally, to cause it to eat or
devour, i.e., to make it fit for the work of devouring. למען ,
literally, for the sake of the lightning (flash) that shall issue
therefrom (cf. [Eze 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#010).md). - In [Eze
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029) (34), לתת (to lay, or place.md) is
also dependent upon חרב פּתוּחה, drawn to lay thee; so that the first
half of the verse is inserted as a parenthesis, either to indicate the
occasion for bringing the sword into the land (Hitzig), or to introduce
an attendant circumstance, according to the sense in which the ב in
בּחזות is taken. The parenthetical clause is understood by most of the
commentators as referring to deceptive oracles of Ammonitish
soothsayers, which either determined the policy of Ammon, as Hitzig
supposes (cf. [Jer 27:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009).md), or
inspired the Ammonites with confidence, that they had nothing to fear
from the Chaldeans. Kliefoth, on the other hand, refers the words to the
oracles consulted by Nebuchadnezzar, according to [Eze
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023.md). "These oracles, which directed
the king not to march against the Ammonites, but against Jerusalem,
proved themselves, according to [Eze
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029.md), to be deceptive prophesying to
the Ammonites, inasmuch as they also afterwards fell by the sword; just
as, according to [Eze 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023.md), they
proved themselves to be genuine so far as the Israelites were concerned,
inasmuch as they were really the first to be smitten." This view is a
very plausible one, if it only answered in any degree to the words. But
it is hard to believe that the words, "while it (one) prophesies
falsehood to thee," are meant to be equivalent to "while its prophecy
proves itself to be false to thee." Moreover, Nebuchadnezzar did not
give the Ammonites any oracle, either false or true, by the circumstance
that his divination at the cross-road led him to decide in favour of the
march to Jerusalem; for all that he did in consequence was to postpone
his designs upon the Ammonites, but not to relinquish them. We cannot
understand the words in any other sense, therefore, than as relating to
oracles, which the Ammonites received from soothsayers of their own.

Hitzig takes offence at the expression, "that it (the sword) may lay
thee by (to) the necks of the sinners slain," because colla cannot stand
for corpora decollata, and consequently proposes to alter אותך into
אותהּ, to put it (the sword) to the necks. But by this conjecture he
gets the not less striking thought, that the sword was to be put to the
necks of those already slain; a thing which would be perfectly
unmeaning, and is therefore not generally done. The sinners slain are
the Judaeans who have fallen. The words point back to [Eze
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025.md), the second half of which is
repeated here, and predict the same fate to the Ammonites. It is easy to
supply חרב to השׁב אל־תּערהּ: put the sword into its scabbard again.
These words can only be addressed to the Ammonites; not to the
Chaldeans, as Kliefoth imagines, for the latter does not harmonize in
any way with what follows, viz., in the place of thy birth will I judge
thee. God does not execute the judgment independently of the Chaldeans,
but through the medium of their sword. The difficulties occasioned by
taking the words as referring to the Ammonites are not so great as to
necessitate an alteration of the text (Hitzig), or to call for the
arbitrary explanation: put it now or for the present into the scabbard
(Kliefoth). The use of the masculine השׁב (with Patach for השׁב, as in
[Isa 42:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#022).md), if Ammon is addressed by
the side of the feminine אותך, may be explained in a very simple way,
from the fact that the sword is carried by men, so that here the thought
of the people, the warriors, is predominant, and the representation of
the kingdom of the Ammonites as a woman falls into the background. The
objection that the suffix in תּערהּ can only refer to the sword (of the
Chaldean) mentioned in [Eze 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md), is
more plausible than conclusive. For inasmuch as the scabbard presupposes
a sword, and every sword has a scabbard, the suffix may be fully
accounted for from the thing itself, as the words, "put the sword into
its scabbard," would lead any hearer to think at once of the sword of
the person addressed, without considering whether that particular sword
had been mentioned before or not. The meaning of the words is this:
every attempt to defend thyself with the sword and avert destruction
will be in vain. In thine own land will God judge thee. For מכרותיך, see
the comm. on [Eze 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003.md). This judgment
is still further explained in [Eze
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#031.md), where the figure of the sword
is dropped, and that of the fire of the wrath of God introduced in its
place. אפיח...בּאשׁ, we render: "the fire of my wrath I blow (kindle)
against thee," after [Isa 54:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#016.md), and
not "with the fire...do I blow, or snort, against thee," as others have
done; because blowing with the fire is an unnatural figure, and the
interpretation of the words in accordance with Isa. l.c. is all the more
natural, that in the closing words of the verse, חרשׁי משׁחית, the
allusion to that passage is indisputable, and it is only from this that
the combination of the two words can be accounted for. - Different
explanations have been given of בּערים. Some render it ardentes, and in
accordance with [Isa 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md) : burning
with wrath. But בּער is never used in this sense. Nor can the rendering
"scorching men" (Kliefoth) be sustained, for בּער, to burn, only occurs
in connection with things which are combustible, e.g., fire, pitch,
coals, etc. The word must be explained from [Psa
92:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007.md), "brutish," foolish, always
bearing in mind that the Hebrew associated the idea of godlessness with
folly, and that cruelty naturally follows in its train. - [Eze
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032.md). Thus will Ammon perish through
fire and sword, and even the memory of it be obliterated. For [Eze
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032.md) compare [Eze
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md). The words, "thy blood will be
בּתוך הארץ in the midst of the land," can hardly be understood in any
other sense than "thy blood will flow over all the land." For the
rendering proposed by Ewald, "remain in the midst of the earth, without
thy being mentioned," like that given by Kliefoth, "thy blood will the
earth drink," does not harmonize with [Eze
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#007.md), where דּמהּ בּתוכהּ היה is
affirmed of blood, which cannot penetrate into the earth, or be covered
with dust. For תּזּכרי, see [Eze
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010.md). Ammon as the enemy of the
kingdom of God will utterly perish, leaving no trace behind, and without
any such hope of restoration as that held out in [Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027.md) to the kingdom of Judah or the
people of Israel.
