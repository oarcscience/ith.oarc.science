### [Isaiah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 12:1</span></span>

As Israel, when redeemed from Egypt beyond the Red Sea, sang songs of
praise, so also will the Israel of the second redemption, when brought,
in a no less miraculous manner, across the Red Sea and the Euphrates.
"And in that day thou wilt say, I thank Thee, O Jehovah, that Thou wast
angry with me: Thine anger is turned away, and Thou hast comforted me.
Behold, the God of my salvation; I trust, and am not afraid: for Jah
Jehovah is my pride and song, and He became my salvation." The words are
addressed to the people of the future in the people of the prophet's own
time. They give thanks for the wrath experienced, inasmuch as it was
followed by all the richer consolation. The formation of the sentence
after כּי is paratactic; the principal tone falls upon 1b, where yâshōb
is written poetically for vayyâshob (cf., [Deu
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md), [Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018.md); [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md); [Hos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001).md). We hear the notes of [Psa
90:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#013.md); [Psa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md), resounding here; whilst [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002.md) is the echo of [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md) (on which [Psa
118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014) is also founded.md). עזי (to be
read ‛ozzi, and therefore also written עזי) is another form of עזּי, and
is used here to signify the proud self-consciousness associated with the
possession of power: pride, and the expression of it, viz., boasting.
Zimrath is equivalent in sense, and probably also in form, to zimrâti,
just as in Syriac zemori (my song) is regularly pronounced zemōr, with
the i of the suffix dropped (see Hupfeld on [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006).md). It is also possible, however,
that it may be only an expansion of the primary form zimrath = zimrâh,
and therefore that zimrath is only synonymous with zimrâti, as chēphetz
in [Sa2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005.md) is with chephtzi. One
thing peculiar to this echo of [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md) is the doubling of the Jah in Jâh
Jehōvâh, which answers to the surpassing of the type by the antitype.

[Isaiah 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 12:3</span></span>

[Isa 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003.md), again, contains a prophetic
promise, which points back to the commencement of [Isa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md) : "And with rapture ye will draw
water out of the wells of salvation." Just as Israel was miraculously
supplied with water in the desert, so will the God of salvation, who has
become your salvation, open many and manifold sources of salvation for
you (מעיני as it is pointed here, instead of מעיני,

(Note: The root is the same as, for example, in יעלתסּו (they rejoice)
and יעלתסּו; here, however, it is more striking, because the singular is
written מעין, and not מעין. At the same time, it is evident that the
connecting sound ay was rather preferred than avoided, as Ewald
maintains - as we may see, for example, from the repeated aychi in Ps
103.))

from which ye may draw with and according to your heart's delight. This
water of salvation, then, forms both the material for, and instigation
to, new songs of praise; and [Isa
12:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#004.md) therefore continue in the
strain of a psalm: "And ye will say in that day, Praise Jehovah,
proclaim His name, make known His doings among the nations, boast that
His name is exalted. Harp to Jehovah; for He has displayed majesty: let
this be known in all lands. Shout and be jubilant, O inhabitants of
Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee." The
first song of six lines is here followed by a second of seven lines: a
prophetic word of promise, inserted between them, separates the one from
the other. This second also commences with the well-known tones of a
psalm (compare especially [Psa 105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md);
[Ch1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#008).md). The phrase, "Call upon the
name of Jehovah," signifies, Make the name of Jehovah the medium of
invocation (Ges. 138, Anm. 3\*), i.e., invoke it, or, as here, call it
out. Gē'ūth is high, towering dignity; here it is used of God, as in
[Isa 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010.md), with ‛âsâh: to prove it
practically, just as with lābēsh in [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md), to show one's self openly
therein. Instead of the Chethib meyudda‛ath in [Isa
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#005.md), the keri substitutes the hophal
form mūda‛ath, probably because meyuddâ‛, according to the standing
usage of speech, denotes one well known, or intimate; the passive of the
hophal is certainly the more suitable. According to the preceding
appeals, the words are to be understood as expressing a desire, that the
glorious self-attestation of the God of salvation might be brought to
the consciousness of the whole of the inhabitants of the earth, i.e., of
all mankind. When God redeems His people, He has the salvation of all
the nations in view. It is the knowledge of the Holy One of Israel, made
known through the word of proclamation, that brings salvation to them
all. How well may the church on Zion rejoice, to have such a God
dwelling in the midst of it! He is great as the giver or promises, and
great in fulfilling them; great in grace, and great in judgment; great
in all His saving acts which spread from Israel to all mankind. Thus
does this second psalm of the redeemed nation close, and with it the
book of Immanuel.
