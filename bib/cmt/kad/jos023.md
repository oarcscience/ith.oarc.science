Joshua's Farewell and Death - Joshua 23-24

After the division of the land among the tribes, Joshua had withdrawn to
Timnath-serah, on the mountains of Ephraim ([Jos
19:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050)), to spend the last days of his
life there in the quiet enjoyment of his own inheritance. But when the
time of his departure from the earth was drawing near, remembering the
call which he had received from the Lord ([Jos
1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#006)), he felt constrained to gather
the people together once more in the persons of their representatives,
to warn them most earnestly of the dangers of apostasy from the Lord,
and point out the evils that would follow (Josh 23); and then after
that, in a solemn assembly of the nation at Shechem, to review the
abundant mercies which the Lord had conferred upon Israel from the
calling of Abraham to that day, that he might call upon them to remain
stedfast and faithful in the worship of their God, and then solemnly
renew the covenant with the Lord.

(Note: "The pious solicitude of Joshua furnishes an example worthy of
imitation by all who have the charge of others. For just as a father
would not be regarded as sufficiently careful it he merely thought of
the interests of his children up to the time of his own death, and did
not extend his thoughtfulness on their behalf still further, and as far
as was in his power endeavour to provide for their welfare when he
himself should be dead; so good rulers ought to look forward that they
may not only leave behind them a well-organized state, but may also
strengthen and secure its existence for a long time to come." - Calvin
(with special reference to [Pe2
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013)).)

[Joshua 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 23:1</span></span>

Exhortation to the Tribes of Israel to Remain Faithful to their Calling.
- [Jos 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001), [Jos
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#002). The introduction to the
discourse which follows is attached in its first part to [Jos
22:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#003), and thus also to [Jos
21:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043), whilst in the second part it
points back to [Jos 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001). The Lord had
given the people rest from all their enemies round about, after the land
had been subdued and divided by lot ([Jos
21:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043)). Joshua was already an old
man at the termination of the war ([Jos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001)); but since then he had advanced
still further in age, so that he may have noticed the signs of the near
approach of death. He therefore called together the representatives of
the people, either to Timnath-serah where he dwelt ([Jos
19:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050)), or to Shiloh to the
tabernacle, the central sanctuary of the whole nation, as the most
suitable place for his purpose. "All Israel" is still further defined by
the apposition, "its elders, and its heads, and its judges, and its
officers." This is not to be understood, however, as referring to four
different classes of rulers; but the term elders is the general term
used to denote all the representatives of the people, who were divided
into heads, judges, and officers. And the heads, again, were those who
stood at the head of the tribes, families, and fathers' houses, and out
of whose number the most suitable persons were chosen as judges and
officers ([Deu 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#015); see my Bibl.
Arch. ii. 143). Joshua's address to the elders of all Israel consists of
two parts, which run parallel to one another so far as the contents are
concerned, [Jos 23:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#002) and [Jos
23:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#014). In both parts Joshua
commences with a reference to his age and his approaching death, in
consequence of which he felt constrained to remind the people once more
of all the great things that the Lord had done for them, and to warn
them against falling away from their gracious covenant God. Just as
Joshua, in this the last act of his life, was merely treading in the
footsteps of Moses, who had concluded his life with the fullest
exhortations to the people to be faithful to the Lord ([Deu
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#030)), so his address consists
entirely of reminiscences from the Pentateuch, more especially from
Deuteronomy as he had nothing fresh to announce to the people, but could
only impress the old truth upon their minds once more.

[Joshua 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 23:2</span></span>

Joshua commenced his address by reminding them of the greatest
manifestations of grace which they had received from the Lord, namely,
by referring to what the Lord had done to all these nations (the
Canaanites) before them, when He fought for Israel, as Moses had
promised them ([Deu 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#030) and [Deu
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#022)).

[Jos 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#003)

"Before you," sc., smiting and driving them away.

[Jos 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#004)

He (Joshua) had now divided by lot among the tribes of Israel as their
inheritance these still remaining (Canaanitish) nations, as the Lord had
commanded ([Jos 13:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006)), "from Jordan
and further all the nations, which I have exterminated (i.e., which
Joshua had destroyed when Canaan was taken), and the great sea (for 'to
the great sea') in the west." The breadth of the land of Canaan is here
given in a peculiar manner, the terminus a quo being mentioned in the
first clause, and the terminus ad quem (though without the preposition
עד) in the second; and through the parallelism which exists between the
clauses, each clause is left to be completed from the other. So that the
whole sentence would read thus: "All these nations which remain ... from
Jordan to the great sea, also all the nations which I have cut off from
Jordan, and to the great sea westward."

[Jos 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#005)

For the Lord would drive all these still remaining nations before the
Israelites, and cut them off, and give the Israelites their land for a
possession, as He had promised ([Jos
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006); cf. [Exo
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023).). הדף, as in [Deu
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#019); [Deu
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#004); and the form יהדּפם, with
Chateph-kametz, on account of the weakness of the ה, as in [Num
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#020). ירשׁתּם, as in [Jos
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#015).

[Jos 23:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#006)

Only let them be strong, i.e., be brave, to keep the law of Moses
without fail (cf. [Jos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#007)), to enter
into no fellowship with these remaining nations (בּוא, to enter into
close intimacy with a person; see [Jos
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#012)), and not to pay reverence to
their gods in any way, but to adhere stedfastly to the Lord their God as
they had hitherto done. To make mention of the names of the idols ([Exo
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013)), to swear by them, to serve
them (by sacrifices), and to bow down to them (to invoke them in
prayer), are the four outward forms of divine worship (see [Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013); [Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020)). The concluding words, "as ye
have done unto this day," which express a reason for persevering in the
attachment they had hitherto shown to Jehovah, "do not affirm that the
Israelites had hitherto done all these things fully and perfectly; for
who does not know how few mortals there are who devote themselves to God
with all the piety and love which He justly demands? But because the
nation as a whole had kept the laws delivered to them by Moses, during
the time that the government had been in the hands of Joshua, the sins
of individual men were left out of sight on this occasion" (Masius).

[Jos 23:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#009)

For this reason the Lord had driven out great and strong nations before
the Israelites, so that no one was able to stand before them. The first
hemistich points to the fulfilment of [Deu
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#038); [Deu
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001); [Deu
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001); [Deu
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#023); the second to that of [Deu
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#024); [Deu
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#025). ואתּם is placed at the
beginning absolutely. - In [Jos 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#010),
the blessing of fidelity to the law which Israel had hitherto
experienced, is described, as in [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030), upon the basis of the promise
in [Lev 26:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#007), and [Deu
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007), and in [Jos
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#010) the thought of [Jos
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#003) is repeated. To this there is
attached, in [Jos 23:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#011), the
admonition to take heed for the sake of their souls (cf. [Deu
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015)), to love the Lord their God (on
the love of God as the sum of the fulfilment of the law, see [Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005); [Deu
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012); [Deu
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#013)). For if they turned, i.e., gave
up the faithfulness they had hitherto displayed towards Jehovah, and
attached themselves to the remnant of these nations, made marriages with
them, and entered into fellowship with them, which the Lord had
expressly forbidden ([Exo 34:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#012);
[Deu 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003)), let them know that the Lord
their God would not cut off these nations before them any more, but that
they would be a snare and destruction to them. This threat is founded
upon such passages of the law as [Exo
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#033); [Deu
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#016), and more especially [Num
33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055). The figure of a trap, which is
employed here (see [Exo 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007)), is
still further strengthened by פּח, a snare (cf. [Isa
8:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014)). Shotet, a whip or scourge,
an emphatic form of the word derived from the poel of שׁוּט, only occurs
here. "Scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes" (see [Num
33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055)). Joshua crowds his figures
together to depict the misery and oppression which would be sure to
result from fellowship with the Canaanites, because, from his knowledge
of the fickleness of the people, and the wickedness of the human heart
in its natural state, he could foresee that the apostasy of the nation
from the Lord, which Moses had foretold, would take place but too
quickly; as it actually did, according to [Jdg
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#003)., in the very next generation. The
words "until ye perish," etc., resume the threat held out by Moses in
[Deu 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017) (cf. Josh [Deu
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#021).).

[Joshua 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 23:14</span></span>

In the second part of his address, Joshua sums up briefly and concisely
the leading thoughts of the first part, giving greater prominence,
however, to the curse which would follow apostasy from the Lord.

[Jos 23:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#014)

Now that Joshua was going the way of all the earth (all the inhabitants
of the earth), i.e., going to die ([Kg1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002)), the Israelites knew with all the
heart and all the soul, i.e., were fully convinced, that of all the good
words (gracious promises) of God not one had failed, but all had come to
pass (vid., [Jos 21:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#045)). But it was
just as certain that the Lord would bring upon them every evil word that
He spake through Moses (Lev 26:14-33; Deut 28:15-68, and [Deu
29:14-28](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#014)), if they transgressed His
covenant. "The evil word" is the curse of rejection ([Deu
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001), [Deu
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015)). "Until He have destroyed:" see
[Deu 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#024), and [Deu
28:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048). The other words as in [Jos
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#013). If they went after other gods
and served them, the wrath of the Lord would burn against them, and they
would be quickly destroyed from the good land which He had given them
(vid., [Deu 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017)).
