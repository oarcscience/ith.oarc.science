Regulations as to the Right of Citizenship in the Congregation of the
Lord - Deuteronomy 23

From the sanctification of the house and the domestic relation, to which
the laws of marriage and chastity in the previous chapter pointed, Moses
proceeds to instructions concerning the sanctification of their union as
a congregation: he gives directions as to the exclusion of certain
persons from the congregation of the Lord, and the reception of others
into it ([Deu 23:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001).md); as to the
preservation of the purity of the camp in time of war ([Deu
23:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009).md); as to the reception of
foreign slaves into the land, and the removal of licentious persons out
of it ([Deu 23:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015).md); and lastly, as
to certain duties of citizenship ([Deu
23:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019).md).

[Deuteronomy 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 23:1</span></span>

The Right of Citizenship in the Congregation of the Lord. - [Deu
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md). Into the congregation of the
Lord there was not to come, i.e., not to be received, any person who was
mutilated in his sexual member. פּצוּע־דּכּה, literally wounded by
crushing, i.e., mutilated in this way; Vulg. eunuchus attritis vel
amputatis testiculis. Not only animals (see at [Lev
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#024).md), but men also, were castrated
in this way. שׁפכה כּרוּת was one whose sexual member was cut off; Vulg.
abscisso veretro. According to Mishnah Jebam. vi. 2, "contusus דּכּה est
omnis, cujus testiculi vulnerati sunt, vel certe unus eorum; exsectus
(כּרוּת), cujus membrum virile praecisum est." In the modern East,
emasculation is generally performed in this way (see Tournefort, Reise.
ii. p. 259, and Burckhardt, Nubien, pp. 450, 451). The reason for the
exclusion of emasculated persons from the congregation of Jehovah, i.e.,
not merely from office (officio et publico magistratu, Luth.) and from
marriage with an Israelitish woman (Fag., C. a Lap., and others), but
from admission into the covenant fellowship of Israel with the Lord, is
to be found in the mutilation of the nature of man as created by God,
which was irreconcilable with the character of the people of God. Nature
is not destroyed by grace, but sanctified and transformed. This law,
however, was one of the ordinances intended for the period of infancy,
and has lost its significance with the spread of the kingdom of God over
all the nations of the earth ([Isa
56:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#004).md).

[Deu 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002.md)

So also with the ממזר, i.e., not persons begotten out of wedlock,
illegitimate children generally (lxx, Vulg.), but, according to the
Talmud and the Rabbins, those who were begotten in incest or adultery
(cf. Ges. thes. p. 781). The etymology of the word is obscure. The only
other place in which it occurs is [Zac
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#006.md); and it is neither contracted from
מוּם and זר (according to the Talmud, and Hitzig on [Zac
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#006).md), nor from זר מעם (Geiger Urschr.
p. 52), but in all probability is to be derived from a root מזר,
synonymous with the Arabic word "to be corrupt, or foul." The additional
clause, "not even in the tenth generation," precludes all possibility of
their ever being received. Ten is the number of complete exclusion. In
[Deu 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md), therefore, "for ever" is
added. The reason is the same as in the case of mutilated persons,
namely, their springing from a connection opposed to the divine order of
the creation.

[Deu 23:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md)

Also no Ammonite or Moabite was to be received, not even in the tenth
generation; not, however, because their forefathers were begotten in
incest ([Gen 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030)..md), as Knobel
supposes, but on account of the hostility they had manifested to the
establishment of the kingdom of God. Not only had they failed to give
Israel a hospitable reception on its journey (see at [Deu
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#029).md), but they (viz., the king of the
Moabites) had even hired Balaam to curse Israel. In this way they had
brought upon themselves the curse which falls upon all those who curse
Israel, according to the infallible word of God ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003).md), the truth of which even Balaam
was obliged to attest in the presence of Balak ([Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009).md); although out of love to Israel
the Lord turned the curse of Balaam into a blessing (cf. Num 22-24). For
this reason Israel was never to seek their welfare and prosperity, i.e.,
to make this an object of its care ("to seek," as in [Jer
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007).md); not indeed from personal
hatred, for the purpose of repaying evil with evil, since this neither
induced Moses to publish the prohibition, nor instigated Ezra when he
put the law in force, by compelling the separation of all Ammonitish,
Moabitish, and Canaanitish wives from the newly established congregation
in Jerusalem ([Ezr 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#012).md). How far
Moses was from being influenced by such motives of personal or national
revenge is evident, apart from the prohibition in [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md) and [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md) against making war upon the
Moabites and Ammonites, from the command which follows in [Deu
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#008.md) and [Deu
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009.md) with reference to the Edomites
and Egyptians. These nations had also manifested hostility to the
Israelites. Edom had come against them when they desired to march
peaceably through his land ([Num
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#018)..md), and the Pharaohs of Egypt had
heavily oppressed them. Nevertheless, Israel as to keep the bond of
kindred sacred ("he is thy brother"), and not to forget in the case of
the Egyptians the benefits derived from their sojourn in their land.
Their children might come into the congregation of the Lord in the third
generation, i.e., the great-grandchildren of Edomites of Egyptians, who
had lived as strangers in Israel (see at [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).md). Such persons might be
incorporated into the covenant nation by circumcision.

[Deuteronomy 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 23:9</span></span>

Preservation of the Purity of the Camp in Time of War. - The bodily
appearance of the people was also to correspond to the sacredness of
Israel as the congregation of the Lord, especially when they gathered in
hosts around their God. "When thou marchest out as a camp against thine
enemies, beware of every evil thing." What is meant by an "evil thing"
is stated in [Deu 23:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#010.md), viz.,
uncleanness, and uncleanliness of the body.

[Deu 23:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#010.md)

The person who had become unclean through a nightly occurrence, was to
go out of the camp and remain there till he had cleansed himself in the
evening. On the journey through the desert, none but those who were
affected with uncleanness of a longer duration were to be removed from
the camp ([Num 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#002).md) but when they were
encamped, this law was to apply to even lighter defilements.

[Deu 23:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#012.md)

The camp of war was also not to be defiled with the dirt of excrements.
Outside the camp there was to be a space or place (יד, as in [Num
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017).md) for the necessities of nature,
and among their implements they were to have a spade, with which they
were to dig when they sat down, and then cover it up again. יתד,
generally a plug, here a tool for sticking in, i.e., for digging into
the ground.

[Deu 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#014.md)

For the camp was to be (to be kept) holy, because Jehovah walked in the
midst of it, in order that He might not see "nakedness of a thing,"
i.e., anything to be ashamed of (see at [Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001).md) in the people, "and turn away
from thee." There was nothing shameful in the excrement itself; but the
want of reverence, which the people would display through not removing
it, would offend the Lord and drive Him out of the camp of Israel.

[Deuteronomy 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 23:15</span></span>

Toleration and Non-Toleration in the Congregation of the Lord. - [Deu
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md), [Deu
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#016.md). A slave who had escaped from
his master to Israel was not to be given up, but to be allowed to dwell
in the land, wherever he might choose, and not to be oppressed. The
reference is to a slave who had fled to them from a foreign country, on
account of the harsh treatment which he had received from his heathen
master. The plural \`adoniym denotes the rule.

[Deuteronomy 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 23:17</span></span>

On the other hand, male and female prostitutes of Israelitish descent
were not to be tolerated; i.e., it was not to be allowed, that either a
male or female among the Israelites should give himself up to
prostitution as an act of religious worship. The exclusion of foreign
prostitutes was involved in the command to root out the Canaanites.
קדּשׁ and קדשׁה were persons who prostituted themselves in the worship
of the Canaanitish Astarte (see at [Gen
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#021).md). - "The wages of a prostitute
and the money of dogs shall not come into the house of the Lord on
account of (ל, for the more remote cause, Ewald, 217) any vow; for even
both these (viz., even the prostitute and dog, not merely their
dishonourable gains) are abomination unto the Lord thy God." "The hire
of a whore" is what the kedeshah was paid for giving herself up. "The
price of a dog" is not the price paid for the sale of a dog (Bochart,
Spencer, Iken, Baumgarten, etc.), but is a figurative expression used to
denote the gains of the kadesh, who was called κίναιδος by the Greeks,
and received his name from the dog-like manner in which the male kadesh
debased himself (see [Rev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md), where
the unclean are distinctly called "dogs").

[Deuteronomy 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 23:19</span></span>

Different Theocratic Rights of Citizenship. - [Deu
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md), [Deu
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#020.md). Of his brother (i.e., his
countryman), the Israelite was not to take interest for money, food, or
anything else that he lent to him; but only of strangers
(non-Israelites: cf. [Exo 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#024.md) and
[Lev 25:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036).md).

[Deuteronomy 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 23:21</span></span>

Vows vowed to the Lord were to be fulfilled without delay; but omitting
to vow was not a sin. (On vows themselves, see at Lev and [Num
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002)..md) נדבה is an accusative defining
the meaning more fully: in free will, spontaneously.

[Deuteronomy 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 23:24</span></span>

In the vineyard and cornfield of a neighbour they might eat at pleasure
to still their hunger, but they were not to put anything into a vessel,
or swing a sickle upon another's corn, that is to say, carry away any
store of grapes or ears of corn. כּנפשׁך, according to thy desire, or
appetite (cf. [Deu 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#026).md). "Pluck the
ears:" cf. [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md); [Luk
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md). - The right of hungry persons,
when passing through a field, to pluck ears of corn, and rub out the
grains and eat, is still recognised among the Arabs (vid., Rob. Pal. ii.
192).
