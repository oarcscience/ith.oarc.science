### [Exodus Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 38:21</span></span>

Estimate of the Amount of Metal Used. - [Exo
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021.md). "These are the numbered things
of the dwelling, of the dwelling of the testimony, that were numbered at
the command of Moses, through the service of the Levites, by the hand of
Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest." פּקוּדים does not mean the
numbering (equivalent to מפקד [Sa2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#009.md), or פּקדּה [Ch2
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#014.md); [Ch2
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#011).md), as Knobel supposes, but here
as elsewhere, even in [Num 26:63-64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#063.md),
it signifies "the numbered;" the only difference being, that in most
cases it refers to persons, here to things, and that the reckoning
consisted not merely in the counting and entering of the different
things, but in ascertaining their weight and estimating their worth.
Lyra has given the following correct rendering of this heading: "haec
est summa numeri ponderis eorum, quae facta sunt in tabernaculo ex auro,
argento et aere." It was apparently superfluous to enumerate the
different articles again, as this had been repeatedly done before. The
weight of the different metals, therefore, is all that is given. The
"dwelling" is still further described as "the dwelling of the
testimony," because the testimony, i.e., the decalogue written with the
finger of God upon the tables of stone, was kept in the dwelling, and
this testimony formed the base of the throne of Jehovah, and was the
material pledge that Jehovah would cause His name, His manifested
presence, to dwell there, and would thus show Himself to His people in
grace and righteousness. "That which was numbered" is an explanatory
apposition to the previous clause, "the numbering of the dwelling;" and
the words הלויּם עבדת, which follow, are an accusative construed freely
to indicate more particularly the mode of numbering (Ewald, 204 a),
viz., "through the service," or "by means of the service of the
Levites," not for their service. "By the hand of Ithamar:" who presided
over the calculations which the Levites carried out under his
superintendence.

[Exo 38:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#022.md)

The allusion to the service of the Levites under Ithamar leads the
historian to mention once more the architects of the whole building, and
the different works connected with it (cf. [Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002)..md).

[Exo 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024.md)

"(As for) all the gold that was used (העשׂוּי) for the work in every
kind of holy work, the gold of the wave-offering (the gold that was
offered as a wave-offering, see at [Exo
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022)) was (amounted to.md) 29 talents
and 730 shekels in holy shekel," that is to say, 87,370 shekels or
877,300 thalers (L.131,595), if we accept Thenius' estimate, that the
gold shekel was worth 10 thalers (L.1, 10s.), which is probably very
near the truth.

[Exo 38:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025.md)

Of the silver, all that is mentioned is the amount of atonement-money
raised from those who were numbered (see at [Exo
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012)..md) at the rate of half a shekel
for every male, without including the freewill-offerings of silver ([Exo
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#024.md), cf. [Exo
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#003).md), whether it was that they were
too insignificant, or that they were not used for the work, but were
placed with the excess mentioned in [Exo
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#007.md). The result of the numbering gave
603,550 men, every one of whom paid half a shekel. This would yield
301,775 shekels, or 100 talents and 1775 shekels, which proves by the
way that a talent contained 3000 shekels. A hundred talents of this were
used for casting 96 sockets for the 48 boards, and 4 sockets for the 4
pillars of the inner court, - one talent therefore for each socket, -
and the 1775 shekels for the hooks of the pillars that sustained the
curtains, for silvering their capitals, and "for binding the pillars,"
i.e., for making the silver connecting rods for the pillars of the court
([Exo 27:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#010.md); [Exo
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#010)..md).

[Exo 38:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#029.md)

The copper of the wave-offering amounted to 70 talents and 2400 shekels;
and of this the sockets of the pillars at the entrance of the tabernacle
([Exo 26:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#037).md), the altar of
burnt-offering with its network and vessels, the supports of the pillars
of the court, all the pegs of the dwelling and court, and, what is not
expressly mentioned here, the laver with its support ([Exo
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018).md), were made. בּ עשׂה to work in
(with) copper, i.e., to make of copper.

If this quantity of the precious metals may possibly strike some readers
as very large, and was in fact brought forward years ago as a reason for
questioning the historical credibility of our account of the building of
the tabernacle, it has been frequently urged, on the other hand, that it
looks quite small, in comparison with the quantities of gold and silver
that have been found accumulated in the East, in both ancient and modern
times. According to the account before us, the requisite amount of
silver was raised by the comparatively small payment of half a shekel,
about fifteen pence, for every male Israelite of 20 years old and
upwards. Now no tenable objection can be raised against the payment of
such a tribute, since we have no reason whatever for supposing the
Israelites to have been paupers, notwithstanding the oppression which
they endured during the closing period of their stay in Egypt. They were
settled in the most fertile part of Egypt; and coined silver was current
in western Asia even in the time of the patriarchs ([Gen
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016).md). But with reference to the
quantities of gold and copper that were delivered, we need not point to
the immense stores of gold and other metals that were kept in the
capitals of the Asiatic kingdoms of antiquity,

(Note: Thus, to mention only one or two examples, the images in the
temple of Belus, at Babylon, consisted of several thousand talents of
gold, to say nothing of the golden tables, the bedsteads, and other
articles of gold and silver (Diod. Sic. 2, 9; Herod. 1, 181, 183). In
the siege of Nineveh, Sardanapalus erected a funeral pile, upon which he
collected all his wealth, including 150 golden bedsteads, 150 golden
tables, a million talents of gold, and ten times as much silver and
other valuables, to prevent their falling into the hands of the foe
(Ctesias in Athen. 12, 28, p. 529). According to a statement in Pliny's
Hist. Nat. 33, 3, on the conquest of Asia by Cyrus, he carried off booty
to the extent of 34,000 lbs. of gold, beside the golden vessels and
500,000 talents of silver, including the goblet of Semiramis, which
alone weighed 15 talents. Alexander the Great found more than 40,000
talents of gold and silver and 9000 talents of coined gold in the royal
treasury at Susa (Diod. Sic. 17, 66), and a treasure of 120,000 talents
of gold in the citadel of Persepolis (Diod. Sic. 17, 71; Curtius, v. 6,
9). For further accounts of the enormous wealth of Asia in gold and
silver, see Bhr, Symbolik i. pp. 258ff.)

but will merely call to mind the fact, that the kings of Egypt possessed
many large gold mines on the frontiers of the country, and in the
neighbouring lands of Arabia and Ethiopia, which were worked by
criminals, prisoners of war, and others, under the harshest pressure,
and the very earliest times copper mines were discovered on the Arabian
peninsula, which were worked by a colony of labourers (Lepsius, Letters
from Egypt, p. 336). Moreover, the love of the ancient Egyptians for
valuable and elegant ornaments, gold rings, necklaces, etc., is
sufficiently known from the monuments (see Rosellini in Hengstenberg's
Egypt, p. 137). Is it not likely, then, that the Israelites should have
acquired a taste for jewellery of this kind, and should have possessed
or discovered the means of procuring all kinds of gold and silver
decorations, not to mention the gold and silver jewellery which they
received from the Egyptians on their departure? The liking for such
things even among nomad tribes is very well known. Thus, for example,
after the defeat of the Midianites, the Israelites carried off so much
gold, silver, copper, and other metals as spoil, that their princes
alone were able to offer 16,750 shekels of gold as a heave-offering to
Jehovah from the booty that had been obtained in this kind of jewellery
([Num 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050).). Diodorus Sic. (3, 44.md)
and Strabo (xvi. p. 778) bear witness to the great wealth of the
Nabateans and other Arab tribes on the Elanitic Gulf, and mention not
only a river, said to flow through the land, carrying gold dust with it,
but also gold that was dug up, and which was found, "not in the form of
sand, but of nuggets, which did not require much cleaning, and the
smallest of which were of the size of a nut, the average size being that
of a medlar, whilst the largest pieces were as big as a walnut. These
they bored, and made necklaces or bracelets by stringing them together
alternately with transparent stones. They also sold the gold very cheap
to their neighbours, giving three times the quantity for copper, and
double the quantity for iron, both on account of their inability to work
these metals, and also because of the scarcity of the metals which were
so much more necessarily for daily use" (Strabo). The Sabaeans and
Gerrhaeans are also mentioned as the richest of all the tribes of
Arabia, through their trade in incense and in cinnamon and other spices.

(Note: "They possess an immense quantity of gold and silver articles,
such as beds, tripods, bowls, and cups, in addition to the decorations
of their houses; for doors, walls, and ceilings are all wrought with
ivory, gold, silver, and precious stones" (Strabo ut sup.). In
accordance with this, Pliny (n. h. 6, 28) not only calls the Sabaeans
"ditissimos silvarum fertilitate odorifera, auri metallis, etc.," but
the tribes of Arabia in general, "in universum gentes ditissimas, ut
apud quas maximae opes Romanorum Parthorum que subsistant, vendentibus
quae e mari aut silvis capiunt, nihil invicem redimentibus.")

From the Arabs, who carried on a very extensive caravan trade through
the desert even at that time, the Israelites would be able to purchase
such spices and materials for the building of the tabernacle as they had
not brought with them from Egypt; and in Egypt itself, where all
descriptions of art and handicraft were cultivated from the very
earliest times (for proofs see Hengst. Egypt, pp. 133-139), they might
so far have acquired all the mechanical and artistic ability required
for the work, that skilled artisans could carry out all that was
prescribed, under the superintendence of the two master-builders who had
been specially inspired for the purpose.
