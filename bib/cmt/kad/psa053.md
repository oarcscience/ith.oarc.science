### [Psalms Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 53:0</span></span>

Elohimic Variation of the Jahve - [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)

[Psa 52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001) and [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001), which are most closely related
by occasion, contents, and expression, are separated by the insertion of
[Psa 53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001), in which the individual
character of [Psa 52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001), the
description of moral corruption and the announcement of the divine
curse, is generalized. [Psa 53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)
also belongs to this series according to its species of poetic
composition; for the inscription runs: To the Precentor, after
Machalath, a Maskı̂l of David. The formula על־מחלת recurs in [Psa
88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001) with the addition of לענּות.
Since Ps 88 is the gloomiest of all the Psalms, and [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001), although having a bright
border, is still also a dark picture, the signification of מחלה, laxness
(root חל, opp. מר), sickness, sorrow, which is capable of being
supported by [Exo 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026), must be
retained. על־מחלת signifies after a sad tone or manner; whether it be
that מחלת itself (with the ancient dialectic feminine termination, like
נגינת, [Psa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001)) is a name for such
an elegiac kind of melody, or that it was thereby designed to indicate
the initial word of some popular song. In the latter case מחלת is the
construct form, the standard song beginning מחלת לב or some such way.
The signification to be sweet (Aramaic) and melodious (Aethiopic), which
the root חלי obtains in the dialects, is foreign to Hebrew. It is
altogether inadmissible to combine מחלת with Arab. mahlt, ease, comfort
(Germ. Gemהchlichkeit, cf. mהchlich, easily, slowly, with mהhlich, by
degrees), as Hitzig does; since מחל, Rabbinic, to pardon, coincides more
readily with מחה, [Psa 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003), [Psa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#011). So that we may regard machalath
as equivalent to mesto, not piano or andante.

That the two texts, [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001) and
[Psa 53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001), are "vestiges of an
original identity" (Hupfeld) is not established: [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001) is a later variation of [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001). The musical designation,
common only to the earlier Psalms, at once dissuades one from coming
down beyond the time of Jehoshaphat or Hezekiah. Moreover, we have here
a manifest instance that even Psalms which are composed upon the model
of, or are variations of Davidic Psalms, were without any hesitation
inscribed לדוד.

Beside the critical problem, all that remains here for the exegesis is
merely the discussion of anything peculiar in the deviations in the form
of the text.

[Psalms 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 53:1</span></span>

The well-grounded asyndeton השׁהיתוּ התעיבוּ is here dismissed; and the
expression is rendered more bombastic by the use of עול instead of
עלילה. עול (the masculine to עולה), pravitas, is the accusative of the
object (cf. [Eze 16:52](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#052)) to both verbs,
which give it a twofold superlative attributive notion. Moreover, here
השׁחיתו is accented with Mugrash in our printed texts instead of Tarcha.
One Mugrash after another is contrary to all rule.

[Psalms 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 53:2</span></span>

In both recensions of the Psalm the name of God occurs seven times. In
[Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001) it reads three times
Elohim and four times Jahve; in the Psalm before us it is all seven
times Elohim, which in this instance is a proper name of equal dignity
with the name Jahve. Since the mingling of the two names in [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001) is perfectly intentional,
inasmuch as Elohim in [Psa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001), [Psa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002) describes God as a Being most
highly exalted and to be reverentially acknowledged, and in [Psa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005) as the Being who is present among
men in the righteous generation and who is mighty in their weakness, it
becomes clear that David himself cannot be the author of this levelling
change, which is carried out more rigidly than the Elohimic character of
the Psalm really demands.

[Psalms 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 53:3</span></span>

Instead of הכּל, the totality, we have כּלּו, which denotes each
individual of the whole, to which the suffix, that has almost vanished
([Psa 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009)) from the genius of the
language, refers. And instead of סר, the more elegant סג, without any
distinction in the meaning.

[Psalms 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 53:4</span></span>

Here in the first line the word כּל־, which, as in [Psa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006); [Psa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#009), is in its right place, is
wanting. In [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001) there then
follow, instead of two tristichs, two distichs, which are perhaps each
mutilated by the loss of a line. The writer who has retouched the Psalm
has restored the tristichic symmetry that had been lost sight of, but he
has adopted rather violent means: inasmuch as he has fused down the two
distichs into a single tristich, which is as closely as possible adapted
to the sound of their letters.

[Psalms 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 53:5</span></span>

The last two lines of this tristich are in letters so similar to the two
distichs of [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001), that they
look like an attempt at the restoration of some faded manuscript.
Nevertheless, such a close following of the sound of the letters of the
original, and such a changing of the same by means of an interchange of
letters, is also to be found elsewhere (more especially in Jeremiah, and
e.g., also in the relation of the Second Epistle of Peter to Jude). And
the two lines sound so complete in themselves and full of life, that
this way of accounting for their origin takes too low an estimate of
them. A later poet, perhaps belonging to the time of Jehoshaphat or
Hezekiah, has here adapted the Davidic Psalm to some terrible
catastrophe that has just taken place, and given a special character to
the universal announcement of judgment. The addition of לא־היה פּחד
(supply אשׁר = אשׁר שׁם, [Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004)) is
meant to imply that fear of judgment had seized upon the enemies of the
people of God, when no fear, i.e., no outward ground for fear, existed;
it was therefore חרדּת אלהים ([Sa1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015)), a God-wrought panic. Such as
the case with the host of the confederates in the days of Jehoshaphat
([Ch2 20:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022)); such also with the
army of Sennacherib before Jerusalem ([Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036)). כּי gives the proof in support
of this fright from the working of the divine power. The words are
addressed to the people of God: Elohim hath scattered the bones (so that
unburied they lie like dirt upon the plain a prey to wild beasts, [Psa
141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007); [Eze
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#005)) of thy besieger, i.e., of him who
had encamped against thee. חנך .eeht tsniaga instead of חנך = חנה עליך.

(Note: So it has been explained by Menachem; whereas Dunash wrongly
takes the ך of חנך as part of the root, overlooking the fact that with
the suffix it ought rather to have been חנך instead of חנך. It is true
that within the province of the verb âch does occur as a pausal
masculine suffix instead of écha, with the preterite ([Deu
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#017); [Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019); [Isa
55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005), and even out of pause in [Jer
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#037)), and with the infinitive ([Deu
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#024); [Eze
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#015)), but only in the passage before
us with the participle. Attached to the participle this masculine suffix
closely approximates to the Aramaic; with proper substantives there are
no examples of it found in Hebrew. Simson ha-Nakdan, in his חבור הקונים
(a MS in Leipzig University Library, fol. 29b), correctly observes that
forms like שׁמך, עמּך, are not biblical Hebrew, but Aramaic, and are
only found in the language of the Talmud, formed by a mingling of the
Hebrew and Aramaic.)

By the might of his God, who has overthrown them, the enemies of His
people, Israel has put them to shame, i.e., brought to nought in a way
most shameful to them, the project of those who were so sure of victory,
who imagined they could devour Israel as easily and comfortably as
bread. It is clear that in this connection even [Psa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005) receives a reference to the
foreign foes of Israel originally alien to the Psalm, so that
consequently [Mic 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003) is no longer a
parallel passage, but passages like [Num
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009), our bread are they (the
inhabitants of Canaan); and [Jer
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#016), all they that devour thee shall
be devoured.

[Psalms 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 53:6</span></span>

The two texts now again coincide. Instead of ישׁוּעת, we here have
ישׁעות; the expression is strengthened, the plural signifies entire,
full, and final salvation.
