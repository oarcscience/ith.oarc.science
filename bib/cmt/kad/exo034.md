### [Exodus Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 34:1</span></span>

When Moses had restored the covenant bond through his intercession ([Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014).md), he was directed by Jehovah to
hew out two stones, like the former ones which he had broken, and to
come with them the next morning up the mountain, and Jehovah would write
upon them the same words as upon the first,

(Note: Namely, the ten words in Ex 20:2-17, not the laws contained in
[Exo 34:12-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#012.md) of this chapter, as Gthe
and Hitzig suppose. See Hengstenberg, Dissertations ii. p. 319, and
Kurtz on the Old Covenant iii. 182ff.)

and thus restore the covenant record. It was also commanded, as in the
former case ([Exo 19:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012).md), that no
one should go up the mountain with him, or be seen upon it, and that not
even cattle should feed against the mountain, i.e., in the immediate
neighbourhood ([Exo 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#003).md). The first
tables of the covenant were called "tables of stone" ([Exo
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012.md); [Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018).md); the second, on the other hand,
which were hewn by Moses, are called "tables of stones" ([Exo
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001.md) and [Exo
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#004).md); and the latter expression is
applied indiscriminately to both of them in [Deu
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#013.md); [Deu
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#019.md); [Deu
9:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#009.md); [Deu
10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md). This difference does not
indicate a diversity in the records, but may be explained very simply
from the fact, that the tables prepared by Moses were hewn from two
stones, and not both from the same block; whereas all that could be said
of the former, which had been made by God Himself, was that they were of
stone, since no one knew whether God had used one stone or two for the
purpose. There is apparently far more importance in the following
distinction, that the second tables were delivered by Moses and only
written upon by God, whereas in the case of the former both the writing
and the materials came from God. This cannot have been intended either
as a punishment for the nation (Hengstenberg), or as "the sign of a
higher stage of the covenant, inasmuch as the further the reciprocity
extended, the firmer was the covenant" (Baumgarten). It is much more
natural to seek for the cause, as Rashi does, in the fact, that Moses
had broken the first in pieces; only we must not regard it as a sign
that God disapproved of the manifestation of anger on the part of Moses,
but rather as a recognition of his zealous exertions for the restoration
of the covenant which had been broken by the sin of the nation. As Moses
had restored the covenant through his energetic intercession, he should
also provide the materials for the renewal of the covenant record, and
bring them to God, for Him to complete and confirm the record by writing
the covenant words upon the tables.

On the following morning, when Moses ascended the mountain, Jehovah
granted him the promised manifestation of His glory ([Exo
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#005)..md). The description of this
unparalleled occurrence is in perfect harmony with the mysterious and
majestic character of the revelation. "Jehovah descended (from heaven)
in the cloud, and stood by him there, and proclaimed the name of
Jehovah; and Jehovah passed by in his sight, and proclaimed Jehovah,
Jehovah God, merciful and gracious," etc. What Moses saw we are not
told, but simply the words in which Jehovah proclaimed all the glory of
His being; whilst it is recorded of Moses, that he bowed his head toward
the earth and worshipped. This "sermon on the name of the Lord," as
Luther calls it, disclosed to Moses the most hidden nature of Jehovah.
It proclaimed that God is love, but that kind of love in which mercy,
grace, long-suffering, goodness, and truth are united with holiness and
justice. As the merciful One, who is great in goodness and truth,
Jehovah shows mercy to the thousandth, forgiving sin and iniquity in
long-suffering and grace; but He does not leave sin altogether
unpunished, and in His justice visits the sin of the fathers upon the
children and the children's children even unto the fourth generation.
The Lord had already revealed Himself to the whole nation from Mount
Sinai as visiting sin and showing mercy ([Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)..md). But whereas on that occasion
the burning zeal of Jehovah which visits sin stood in the foreground,
and mercy only followed afterwards, here grace, mercy, and goodness are
placed in the front. And accordingly all the words which the language
contained to express the idea of grace in its varied manifestations to
the sinner, are crowded together here, to reveal the fact that in His
inmost being God is love. But in order that grace may not be perverted
by sinners into a ground of wantonness, justice is not wanting even here
with its solemn threatenings, although it only follows mercy, to show
that mercy is mightier than wrath, and that holy love does not punish
til sinners despise the riches of the goodness, patience, and
long-suffering of God. As Jehovah here proclaimed His name, so did He
continue to bear witness of it to the Israelites, from their departure
from Sinai till their entrance into Canaan, and from that time forward
till their dispersion among the heathen, and even now in their exile
showing mercy to the thousandth, when they turn to the Redeemer who has
come out of Zion.

[Exodus 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 34:9</span></span>

On this manifestation of mercy, Moses repeated the prayer that Jehovah
would go in the midst of Israel. It is true the Lord had already
promised that His face should go with them ([Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014).md); but as Moses had asked for a
sign of the glory of the Lord as a seal to the promise, it was perfectly
natural that, when this petition was granted, he should lay hold of the
grace that had been revealed to him as it never had been before, and
endeavour to give even greater stability to the covenant. To this end he
repeated his former intercession on behalf of the nation, at the same
time making this confession, "For it is a stiff-necked people; therefore
forgive our iniquity and our sin, and make us the inheritance." Moses
spoke collectively, including himself in the nation in the presence of
God. The reason which he assigned pointed to the deep root of corruption
that had broken out in the worship of the golden calf, and was
appropriately pleaded as a motive for asking forgiveness, inasmuch as
God Himself had assigned the natural corruption of the human race as a
reason why He would not destroy it again with a flood ([Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021).md). Wrath was mitigated by a regard
to the natural condition. - נחל in the Kal, with an accusative of the
person, does not mean to lead a person into the inheritance, but to make
a person into an inheritance; here, therefore, to make Israel the
possession of Jehovah ([Deu 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md); [Deu
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#026.md), cf. [Zac
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012).md). Jehovah at once declared ([Exo
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#010).md) that He would conclude a
covenant, i.e., restore the broken covenant, and do marvels before the
whole nation, such as had not been done in all the earth or in any
nation, and thus by these His works distinguish Israel before all
nations as His own property ([Exo
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#016).md). The nation was to see this,
because it would be terrible; terrible, namely, through the overthrow of
the powers that resisted the kingdom of God, every one of whom would be
laid prostrate and destroyed by the majesty of the Almighty.

[Exodus 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 34:11</span></span>

To recall the duties of the covenant once more to the minds of the
people, the Lord repeats from among the rights of Israel, upon the basis
of which the covenant had been established (ch. 21-23), two of the
leading points which determined the attitude of the nation towards Him,
and which constituted, as it were, the main pillars that were to support
the covenant about to be renewed. These were, first, the warning against
every kind of league with the Canaanites, who were to be driven out
before the Israelites ([Exo 34:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#011).md);
and, secondly, the instructions concerning the true worship of Jehovah
([Exo 34:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#017).md). The warning against
friendship with the idolatrous Canaanites ([Exo
34:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#011).md) is more fully developed and
more strongly enforced than in [Exo
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023.md). The Israelites, when received
into the covenant with Jehovah, were not only to beware of forming any
covenant with the inhabitants of Canaan (cf. [Exo
23:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#032).md), but were to destroy all the
signs of their idolatrous worship, such as altars, monuments (see [Exo
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#024).md), and asherim, the idols of
Astarte, the Canaanitish goddess of nature, which consisted for the most
part of wooden pillars (see my Comm. on [Kg1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023).md), and to worship no other god,
because Jehovah was called jealous, i.e., had revealed Himself as
jealous (see at [Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).md), and was a
jealous God. This was commanded, that the Israelites might not suffer
themselves to be led astray by such an alliance; to go a whoring after
their gods, and sacrifice to them, to take part in their sacrificial
festivals, or to marry their sons to the daughters of the Canaanites, by
whom they would be persuaded to join in the worship of idols. The use of
the expression "go a whoring" in a spiritual sense, in relation to
idolatry, is to be accounted for on the ground, that the religious
fellowship of Israel with Jehovah was a covenant resembling the marriage
tie; and we meet with it for the first time, here, immediately after the
formation of this covenant between Israel and Jehovah. The phrase is all
the more expressive on account of the literal prostitution that was
frequently associated with the worship of Baal and Astarte (cf. [Lev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md); [Lev
20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#005.md); [Num
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033), etc..md). We may see from [Num
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md). how Israel was led astray by
this temptation in the wilderness.

[Exodus 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 34:17</span></span>

The true way to worship Jehovah is then pointed out, first of all
negatively, in the prohibition against making molten images, with an
allusion to the worship of the golden calf, as evinced by the use of the
expression מסּכה אלהי, which only occurs again in [Lev
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#004.md), instead of the phrase "gods of
silver and gold" ([Exo 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#023).md); and
then positively, by a command to observe the feast of Mazzoth and the
consecration of the first-born connected with the Passover (see at [Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md), [Exo
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011.md), and [Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012).md), also the Sabbath ([Exo
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#021).md), the feasts of Weeks and
Ingathering, the appearance of the male members of the nation three
times a year before the Lord ([Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md), see at [Exo
23:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014).md), together with all the other
instructions connected with them ([Exo
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#025.md), [Exo
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026).md). Before the last, however, the
promise is introduced, that after the expulsion of the Canaanites,
Jehovah would enlarge the borders of Israel (cf. [Exo
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031).md), and make their land so secure,
that when they went up to the Lord three times in the year, no one
should desire their land, sc., because of the universal dread of the
might of their God ([Exo 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027).md).

[Exodus 34:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 34:27</span></span>

Moses was to write down these words, like the covenant rights and laws
that had been given before ([Exo 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#004.md),
[Exo 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007).md), because Jehovah had
concluded the covenant with Moses and Israel according to the tenor of
them. By the renewed adoption of the nation, the covenant in ch. 24 was
eo ipso restored; so that no fresh conclusion of this covenant was
necessary, and the writing down of the fundamental conditions of the
covenant was merely intended as a proof of its restoration. It does not
appear in the least degree "irreconcilable," therefore, with the writing
down of the covenant rights before Knobel).

[Exo 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028.md)

Moses remained upon the mountain forty days, just as on the former
occasion (cf. [Exo 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#018).md). "And He
(Jehovah) wrote upon the tables the ten covenant words" (see at [Exo
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001).md).

[Exo 34:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029.md)

The sight of the glory of Jehovah, though only of the back or reflection
of it, produced such an effect upon Moses' face, that the skin of it
shone, though without Moses observing it. When he came down from the
mountain with the tables of the law in his hand, and the skin of his
face shone אתּו בּדבּרו, i.e., on account of his talking with God, Aaron
and the people were afraid to go near him when they saw the brightness
of his face. But Moses called them to him, - Viz. first of all Aaron and
the princes of the congregation to speak to them, and then all the
people to give them the commandments of Jehovah; but on doing this ([Exo
34:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#033)), he put a veil upon (before.md)
his face, and only took it away when he went in before Jehovah to speak
with Him, and then, when he came out (from the Lord out of the
tabernacle, of course after the erection of the tabernacle), he made
known His commands to the people. But while doing this, he put the veil
upon his face again, and always wore it in his ordinary intercourse with
the people ([Exo 34:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#034.md), [Exo
34:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#035).md). This reflection of the
splendour thrown back by the glory of God was henceforth to serve as the
most striking proof of the confidential relation in which Moses stood to
Jehovah, and to set forth the glory of the office which Moses filled.
The Apostle Paul embraces this view in [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md)., and lays stress upon the fact
that the glory was to be done away, which he was quite justified in
doing, although nothing is said in the Old Testament about the glory
being transient, from the simple fact that Moses died. The apostle
refers to it for the purpose of contrasting the perishable glory of the
law with the far higher and imperishable glory of the Gospel. At the
same time he regards the veil which covered Moses' face as a symbol of
the obscuring of the truth revealed in the Old Testament. But this does
not exhaust the significance of this splendour. The office could only
confer such glory upon the possessor by virtue of the glory of the
blessings which it contained, and conveyed to those for whom it was
established. Consequently, the brilliant light on Moses' face also set
forth the glory of the Old Covenant, and was intended both for Moses and
the people as a foresight and pledge of the glory to which Jehovah had
called, and would eventually exalt, the people of His possession.
