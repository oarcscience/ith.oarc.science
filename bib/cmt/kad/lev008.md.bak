Induction of Aaron and His Sonsinto the Priestly Office - Leviticus 8-10

To the law of sacrifice there is appended first of all an account of the
fulfilment of the divine command to sanctify Aaron and his sons as
priests, which Moses had received upon the mount along with the laws
concerning the erection of the sanctuary of the tabernacle (Ex 28 and
29). This command could not properly be carried out till after the
appointment and regulation of the institution of sacrifice, because most
of the laws of sacrifice had some bearing upon this act. The
sanctification of the persons, whom God had called to be His priests,
consisted in a solemn consecration of these persons to their office by
investiture, anointing, and sacrifice (ch. 8), - their solemn entrance
upon their office by sacrifices for themselves and the people (ch. 9), -
the sanctification of their priesthood by the judgment of God upon the
eldest sons of Aaron, when about to offer strange, fire-and certain
instructions, occasioned by this occurrence, concerning the conduct of
the priests in the performance of their service (ch. 10).

[Leviticus 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 8:1</span></span>

Consecration of the Priests and the Sanctuary (cf. Ex 29:1-37). - The
consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests was carried out by Moses
according to the instructions in Ex 29:1-36; [Exo
40:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#012.md); and the anointing of the
tabernacle, with the altar and its furniture, as prescribed in [Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md); [Exo
30:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#026.md), and [Exo
40:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009.md), was connected with it ([Lev
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010.md), [Lev
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#011).md).

[Lev 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001.md)

[Lev 8:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001.md) contain an account of the
preparations for this holy act, the performance of which was enjoined
upon Moses by Jehovah after the publication of the laws of sacrifice
([Lev 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001).md). Moses brought the persons
to be consecrated, the official costume that had been made for them (Ex
28), the anointing oil ([Exo 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023)..md),
and the requisite sacrificial offerings ([Exo
29:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001).md), to the door of the tabernacle
(i.e., into the court, near the altar of burnt-offering), and then
gathered "the whole congregation" - that is to say, the nation in the
persons of its elders-there also (see my Archeologie ii. p. 221). The
definite article before the objects enumerated in [Lev
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#002.md) may be explained on the ground
that they had all been previously and more minutely described. The
"basket of the unleavened" contained, according to [Exo
29:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#002), (1.md) unleavened bread, which is
called חלּה in [Lev 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#026.md), i.e., round
flat bread-cakes, and לחם כּכּר (loaf of bread) in [Exo
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#023.md), and was baked for the purpose
of the consecration (see at [Lev 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#031.md),
[Lev 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#032)); (2.md) unleavened oil-cakes;
and (3) unleavened flat cakes covered with oil (see at [Lev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004.md) and [Lev
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012).md).

[Lev 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#005.md)

When the congregation was assembled, Moses said, "This is the word which
Jehovah commanded you to do." His meaning was, the substance or
essential part of the instructions in [Exo
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001.md) and 29:1-37, which he had
published to the assembled congregation before the commencement of the
act of consecration, and which are not repeated here as being already
known from those chapters. The congregation had been summoned to perform
this act, because Aaron and his sons were to be consecrated as priests
for them, as standing mediators between them and the Lord.

[Leviticus 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 8:6</span></span>

After this the act of consecration commenced. It consisted of two parts:
first, the consecration of the persons themselves to the office of the
priesthood, by washing, clothing, and anointing ([Lev
8:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#006).md); and secondly, the sacrificial
rites, by which the persons appointed to the priestly office were
inducted into the functions and prerogatives of priests (vv. 16-36).

[Lev 8:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#006.md)

The washing, clothing, and anointing. - [Lev
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#006.md). "Moses brought Aaron and his
sons, and washed them with water;" i.e., directed them to wash
themselves, no doubt all over, and not merely their hands and feet. This
cleansing from bodily uncleanness was a symbol of the putting away of
the filth of sin; the washing of the body, therefore, was a symbol of
spiritual cleansing, without which no one could draw near to God, and
least of all those who were to perform the duties of reconciliation.

[Lev 8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#007.md)

Then followed the clothing of Aaron. Moses put upon him the body-coat
([Exo 28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039).md) and girdle ([Exo
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039.md) and [Exo
39:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#022).md), then clothes him with the mel
([Exo 28:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#031).md) and ephod ([Exo
28:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006).md), and the choshen with the
Urim and Thummim (Ex 28:15-30), and put the cap ([Exo
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039).md) upon his head, with the golden
diadem over his forehead ([Exo
28:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036).md). This investiture, regarded
as the putting on of an important official dress, was a symbol of his
endowment with the character required for the discharge of the duties of
his office, the official costume being the outward sign of installation
in the office which he was to fill.

[Lev 8:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010.md)

According to the directions in [Exo
30:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#026.md) (cf. Lev [Exo
40:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009).md), the anointing was performed
first of all upon "the tabernacle and everything in it," i.e., the ark
of the covenant, the altar of incense, the candlestick, and table of
shew-bread, and their furniture; and then upon the altar of
burnt-offering and its furniture, and upon the laver and its pedestal;
and after this, upon Aaron himself, by the pouring of the holy oil upon
his head. This was followed by the robing and anointing of Aaron's sons,
the former only of which is recorded in [Lev
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#013.md) (according to [Exo
28:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#040).md), the anointing not being
expressly mentioned, although it had not only been commanded, in [Exo
28:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#041.md) and [Exo
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#015.md), but the performance of it is
taken for granted in [Lev 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#036.md); [Lev
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007.md), and [Num
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#003.md). According to the Jewish
tradition, the anointing of Aaron (the high priest) was different from
that of the sons of Aaron (the ordinary priests), the oil being poured
upon the head of the former, whilst it was merely smeared with the
finger upon the forehead in the case of the latter (cf. Relandi Antiqq.
ss. ii. 1, 5, and 7, and Selden, de succ. in pontif. ii. 2). There
appears to be some foundation for this, as a distinction is assumed
between the anointing of the high priest and that of the ordinary
priests, not only in the expression, "he poured of the anointing oil
upon Aaron's head" ([Lev 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#012.md), cf.
[Exo 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007.md); [Psa
133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002).md), which is applied to Aaron
only, but also in [Lev 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010.md), [Lev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#012.md); although the further statement
of the later Talmudists and Rabbins, that Aaron was also marked upon the
forehead with the sign of a Hebrew כ (the initial letter of כהן), has no
support in the law (vid., Selden, ii. 9; Vitringa, observv. ss. ii. c.
15, 9). - On the mode in which the tabernacle and its furniture were
anointed, all that is stated is, that the altar of burnt-offering was
anointed by being sprinkled seven times with the anointing oil; from
which we may safely conclude, that the other portions and vessels of the
sanctuary were anointed in the same way, but that the sprinkling was not
performed more than once in their case. The reason why the altar was
sprinkled seven times with the holy anointing oil, is to be sought for
in its signification as the place of worship. The anointing, both of the
sacred things and also of the priests, is called קדּשׁ "to sanctify," in
[Lev 8:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010.md), as well as in [Exo
40:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009.md) and [Exo
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#013.md); and in [Exo
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#010.md) the following stipulation is
added with regard to the altar of burnt-offering: "and it shall be most
holy," - a stipulation which is not extended to the dwelling and its
furniture, although those portions of the sanctuary were most holy also,
that the altar of burnt-offering, which was the holiest object in the
court by virtue of its appointment as the place of expiation, might be
specially guarded from being touched by unholy hands (see at [Exo
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#016).md). To impress upon it this
highest grade of holiness, it was sprinkled even times with anointing
oil; and in the number seven, the covenant number, the seal of the
holiness of the covenant of reconciliation, to which it was to be
subservient, was impressed upon it. To sanctify is not merely to
separate to holy purposes, but to endow or fill with the powers of the
sanctifying Spirit of God. Oil was a fitting symbol of the Spirit, or
spiritual principle of life, by virtue of its power to sustain and
fortify the vital energy; and the anointing oil, which was prepared
according to divine instructions, was therefore a symbol of the Spirit
of God, as the principle of spiritual life which proceeds from God and
fills the natural being of the creature with the powers of divine life.
The anointing with oil, therefore, was a symbol of endowment with the
Spirit of God ([Sa1 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001.md), [Sa1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#006.md); [Sa1
16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md); [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md) for the duties of the office to
which a person was consecrated. The holy vessels also were not only
consecrated, through the anointing, for the holy purposes to which they
were to be devoted (Knobel), but were also furnished in a symbolical
sense with powers of the divine Spirit, which were to pass from them to
the people who came to the sanctuary. The anointing was not only to
sanctify the priests as organs and mediators of the Spirit of God, but
the vessels of the sanctuary also, as channels and vessels of the
blessings of grace and salvation, which God as the Holy One would bestow
upon His people, through the service of His priests, and in the holy
vessels appointed by Him. On these grounds the consecration of the holy
things was associated with the consecration of the priests. The notion
that even vessels, and in fact inanimate things in general, can be
endowed with divine and spiritual powers, was very widely spread in
antiquity. We meet with it in the anointing of memorial stones ([Gen
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017.md); [Gen
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014).md), and it occurs again in the
instructions concerning the expiation of the sanctuary on the annual day
of atonement (ch. 16). It contains more truth than some modern views of
the universe, which refuse to admit that any influence is exerted by the
divine Spirit except upon animated beings, and thus leave a hopeless
abyss between spirit and matter. According to [Exo
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#009.md), the clothing and anointing of
Aaron and his sons were to be "a priesthood to them for a perpetual
statute," i.e., to secure the priesthood to them for all ages; for the
same thought is expressed thus in [Exo
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#015.md) : "their anointing shall surely
be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations." When the
Talmudists refer these words to the sons of Aaron or the ordinary
priests, to the exclusion of Aaron or the high priest, this is opposed
to the distinct context, according to which the sons of Aaron were to be
anointed like their father Aaron. The utter want of foundation for the
rabbinical assumption, that the anointing of the sons of Aaron,
performed by Moses, availed not only for themselves, but for their
successors also, and therefore for the priests of every age, is also the
more indisputable, because the Talmudists themselves infer from [Lev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#015.md) (cf. [Exo
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#029).md), where the installation of
Aaron's successor in his office is expressly designated an anointing,
the necessity for every successor of Aaron in the high-priesthood to be
anointed. The meaning of the words in question is no doubt the
following: the anointing of Aaron and his sons was to stand as a
perpetual statute for the priesthood, and to guarantee it to the sons of
Aaron for all time; it being assumed as self-evident, according to [Lev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#015.md), that as every fresh generation
entered upon office, the anointing would be repeated or renewed.

[Leviticus 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 8:14</span></span>

The sacrificial ceremony with which the consecration was concluded,
consisted of a threefold sacrifice, the materials for which were not
supplied by the persons about to be installed, but were no doubt
provided by Moses at the expense of the congregation, for which the
priesthood was instituted. Moses officiated as the mediator of the
covenant, through whose service Aaron and his sons were to be
consecrated as priests of Jehovah, and performed every part of the
sacrificial rite-the slaughtering, sprinkling of the blood, and burning
of the altar gifts, - just as the priests afterwards did at the public
daily and festal sacrifices, the persons to be consecrated simply laying
their hands upon the sacrificial animals, to set them apart as their
representatives.

[Lev 8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014.md)

The first sacrifice was a sin-offering, for which a young ox was taken
([Exo 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001).md), as in the case of the
sin-offerings for the high priest and the whole congregation ([Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md), [Lev
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014).md): the highest kind of sacrificial
animal, which corresponded to the position to be occupied by the priests
in the Israelitish kingdom of God, as the ἐκλογή of the covenant nation.
Moses put some of the blood with his finger upon the horns of the altar
of burnt-offering, and poured the rest at the foot of the altar. The far
portions (see [Lev 3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003).md) he burned
upon the altar; but the flesh of the ox, as well as the hide and dung,
he burned outside the camp. According to the general rule of the
sin-offerings, whose flesh was burnt outside the camp, the blood was
brought into the sanctuary itself ([Lev
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#023).md); but here it was only put upon
the altar of burnt-offering to make this sin-offering a
consecration-sacrifice. Moses was to take the blood to "purify (יחטּא)
and sanctify the altar, to expiate it." As the altar had been sanctified
immediately before by the anointing with holy oil ([Lev
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#011).md), the object of the cleansing or
sanctification of it through the blood of the sacrifice cannot have been
to purify it a second time from uncleanness, that still adhered to it,
or was inherent in it; but just as the purification or expiation of the
vessels or worship generally applied only to the sins of the nation, by
which these vessels had been defiled ([Lev
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016.md), [Lev
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#019).md), so here the purification of
the altar with the blood of the sin-offering, upon which the priests had
laid their hands, had reference simply to pollutions, with which the
priests defiled the altar when officiating at it, through the
uncleanness of their sinful nature. As the priests could not be
installed in the functions of the priesthood, notwithstanding the
holiness communicated to them through the anointing, without a
sin-offering to awaken the consciousness in both themselves and the
nation that the sinfulness which lay at the root of human nature was not
removed by the anointing, but only covered in the presence of the holy
God, and that sin still clung to man, and polluted all his doings and
designs; so that altar, upon which they were henceforth to offer
sacrifices, still required to be purified through the blood of the
bullock, that had been slaughtered as a sin-offering for the expiation
of their sins, to sanctify it for the service of the priests, i.e., to
cover up the sins by which they would defile it when performing their
service. For this sanctification the blood of the sin-offering, that had
been slaughtered for them, was taken, to indicate the fellowship which
was henceforth to exist between them and the altar, and to impress upon
them the fact, that the blood, by which they were purified, was also to
serve as the means of purifying the altar from the sins attaching to
their service. Although none of the blood of this sin-offering was
carried into the holy place, because only the anointed priests were to
be thereby inducted into the fellowship of the altar, the flesh of the
animal could only be burnt outside the camp, because the sacrifice
served to purify the priesthood (see [Lev
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#011).md). For the rest, the remarks
made on [Lev 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#004.md) are also applicable
to the symbolical meaning of this sacrifice.

[Lev 8:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#018.md)

The sin-offering, through which the priests and the altar had been
expiated, and every disturbance of the fellowship existing between the
holy God and His servants at the altar, in consequence of the sin of
those who were to be consecrated, had been taken away, was followed by a
burnt-offering, consisting of a ram, which was offered according to the
ordinary ritual of the burnt-offering ([Lev
1:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003).md), and served to set forth the
priests, who had appointed it as their substitute through the laying on
of hands, as a living, holy, and well-pleasing sacrifice to the Lord,
and to sanctify them to the Lord with all the faculties of both body and
soul.

[Lev 8:22-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#022.md)

This was followed by the presentation of a peace-offering, which also
consisted of a ram, called "the ram of the filling," or "of the
fill-offering," from the peculiar ceremony performed with the flesh, by
which this sacrifice became a consecration-offering, inducting the
persons consecrated into the possession and enjoyment of the privileges
of the priesthood. A ram was offered as a peace-offering, by the nation
as a whole ([Lev 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#004.md), [Lev
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#018).md), the tribe-princes ([Num
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#017)..md), and a Nazarite ([Num
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#014.md), [Num
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#017).md), who also occupied a higher
position in the congregation ([Amo
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011).md); but it was never brought by
a private Israelite for a peace-offering. The offering described here
differed from the rest of the peace-offerings, first of all, in the
ceremony performed with the blood ([Lev
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#023.md) and [Lev
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#024.md), cf. [Exo
29:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#020).md). Before sprinkling the blood
upon the altar, Moses put some of it upon the tip of the right ear, upon
the right thumb, and upon the great toe of the right foot of Aaron and
his sons. Thus he touched the extreme points, which represented the
whole, of the ear, hand, and foot on the right, or more important and
principal side: the ear, because the priest was always to hearken to the
word and commandment of God; the hand, because he was to discharge the
priestly functions properly; and the foot, because he was to walk
correctly in the sanctuary. Through this manipulation the three organs
employed in the priestly service were placed, by means of their tips, en
rapport with the sacrificial blood; whilst through the subsequent
sprinkling of the blood upon the altar they were introduced symbolically
within the sphere of the divine grace, by virtue of the sacrificial
blood, which represented the soul as the principle of life, and covered
it in the presence of the holiness of God, to be sanctified by that
grace to the rendering of willing and righteous service to the Lord. The
sanctification was at length completed by Moses' taking some of the
anointing oil and some of the blood upon the altar, and sprinkling Aaron
and his sons, and also their clothes; that is to say, by his sprinkling
the persons themselves, as bearers of the priesthood, and their clothes,
as the insignia of the priesthood, with a mixture of holy anointing oil
and sacrificial blood taken from the altar ([Lev
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#030).md). The blood taken from the altar
shadowed forth the soul as united with God through the medium of the
atonement, and filled with powers of grace. The holy anointing oil was a
symbol of the Spirit of God. Consequently, through this sprinkling the
priests were endowed, both soul and spirit, with the higher powers of
the divine life. The sprinkling, however, was performed, not upon the
persons alone, but also upon their official dress. For it had reference
to the priests, not in their personal or individual relation to the
Lord, but in their official position, and with regard to their official
work in the congregation of the Lord.

(Note: In the instructions in [Exo
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#021.md) this ceremony is connected with
the sprinkling of the blood upon the altar; but here, on the contrary,
it is mentioned after the burning of the flesh. Whether because it was
not performed till after this, or because it is merely recorded here in
a supplementary form, it is difficult to decide. The latter is the more
probable, because the blood upon the altar would soon run off; so that
if Moses wanted to take any of it off, it could not be long delayed.)

In addition to this, the following appointment is contained in [Exo
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#029.md), [Exo
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#030.md) : "The holy garments of Aaron
shall be his sons' after him," i.e., pass to his successors in the
high-priesthood, "to anoint them therein and fill their hands therein.
Seven days shall the priest of his sons in his stead put them on
(ילבּשׁם with the suffix - ם as in [Gen
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#019).md), who shall go into the
tabernacle to serve in the sanctuary." Accordingly, at Aaron's death his
successor Eleazar was dressed in his robes ([Num
20:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#026).md). It by no means follows from
this, that a formal priestly consecration was repeated solely in the
case of the high priest as the head of the priesthood, and that with the
common priests the first anointing by Moses sufficed for all time. We
have already observed at p. 545 that this is not involved in [Exo
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#015.md); and the fact that it is only
the official costume of the high priest which is expressly said to have
passed to his successor, may be explained on the simple ground, that as
his dress was only worn when he was discharging certain special
functions before Jehovah, it would not be worn out so soon as the dress
of the ordinary priests, which was worn in the daily service, and
therefore would hardly last long enough to be handed down from father to
son.

(Note: It no more follows from the omission of express instructions
concerning the repetition of the ceremony in the case of every priest
who had to be consecrated, that the future priests were not invested,
anointed, and in all respects formally consecrated, than the fact that
the anointing is not mentioned in [Lev
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#013.md) proves that the priests were not
anointed at all.)

The ceremony performed with the flesh of this sacrifice was also
peculiarly significant ([Lev 8:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#025).md).
Moses took the fat portions, which were separated from the flesh in the
case of the ordinary peace-offerings and burned upon the altar, and the
right leg, which was usually assigned to the officiating priest, and
then laid by the pieces of flesh (or upon them) another cake of each of
the three kinds of pastry, which fell to the portion of the priest in
other cases, as a heave-offering for Jehovah, and put all this into the
hands of Aaron and his sons, and waved it as a wave-offering for
Jehovah, after which he took it from their hands and burned it upon the
altar, "as a filling (מלּאים) for a savour of satisfaction, as a firing
for Jehovah." These last words, which are attached to the preceding
without a conjunction, and, as the הם and הוּא show, form independent
clauses (lit., "filling are they...a firing is it for Jehovah"), contain
the reason for this unusual proceeding, so that Luther's explanation is
quite correct, "for it is a fill-offering," etc. The ceremony of handing
the portions mentioned to Aaron and his sons denoted the filling of
their hands with the sacrificial gifts, which they were afterwards to
offer to the Lord in the case of the peace-offerings, viz., the fat
portions as a firing upon the altar, the right leg along with the
bread-cake as a wave-offering, which the Lord then relinquished to them
as His own servants. The filling of their hands with these sacrificial
gifts, from which the offering received the name of fill-offering,
signified on the one hand the communication of the right belonging to
the priest to offer the fat portions to the Lord upon the altar, and on
the other hand the enfeoffment of the priests with gifts, which they
were to receive in future for their service. This symbolical
signification of the act in question serves to explain the circumstance,
that both the fat portions, which were to be burned upon the altar, and
also the right leg with the bread-cakes which formed the priests' share
of the peace-offerings, were merely placed in the priests's hands in
this instance, and presented symbolically to the Lord by waving, and
then burned by Moses upon the altar. For Aaron and his sons were not
only to be enfeoffed with what they were to burn unto the Lord, but also
with what they would receive for their service. And as even the latter
was a prerogative bestowed upon them by the Lord, it was right that at
their consecration they should offer it symbolically to the Lord by
waving, and actually by burning upon the altar. But as the right leg was
devoted to another purpose in this case, Moses received the
breast-piece, which was presented to the Lord by waving ([Lev
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#029).md), and which afterwards fell to
the lot of the priests, as his portion for the sacrificial meal, which
formed the conclusion of this dedicatory offering, as it did of all the
peace-offerings. In [Exo 29:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027.md), we
also find the command, that the wave-breast of the ram of the
fill-offering, and the heave-leg which had been lifted off, should
afterwards belong to Aaron and his sons on the part of the children of
Israel, as a perpetual statute, i.e., as a law for all time; and the
following reason is assigned: "for it is a heave-offering (terumah, a
lifting off), and shall be a heave-offering on the part of the children
of Israel of their peace-offerings, their heave-offering for Jehovah,"
i.e., which they were to give to the Lord from their peace-offerings for
the good of His servants. The application of the word terumah to both
kinds of offering, the wave-breast and the heave-shoulder, may be
explained on the simple ground, that the gift to be waved had to be
lifted off from the sacrificial animal before the waving could be
performed.

[Lev 8:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#031.md)

For the sacrificial meal, the priests were to boil the flesh in front of
the door of the tabernacle, or, according to [Exo
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#031.md), "at the holy place," i.e., in
the court, and eat it with the bread in the fill-offering basket; and no
stranger (i.e., layman or non-priest) was to take part in the meal,
because the flesh and bread were holy ([Exo
29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033).md), that is to say, had served to
make atonement for the priests, to fill their hands and sanctify them.
Atoning virtue is attributed to this sacrifice in the same sense as to
the burnt-offering in [Lev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004.md).
Whatever was left of the flesh and bread until the following day, that
is to say, was not eaten on the day of sacrifice, was to be burned with
fire, for the reason explained at [Lev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#017.md). The exclusion of laymen from
participating in this sacrificial meal is to be accounted for in the
same way as the prohibition of unleavened bread, which was offered and
eaten in the case of the ordinary peace-offerings along with the
unleavened sacrificial cakes (see at [Lev
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013).md). The meal brought the
consecration of the priests to a close, as Aaron and his sons were
thereby received into that special, priestly covenant with the Lord, the
blessings and privileges of which were to be enjoyed by the consecrated
priests alone. At this meal the priests were not allowed to eat leavened
bread, any more than the nation generally at the feast of Passover ([Exo
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#008)..md).

[Leviticus 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 8:33</span></span>

(cf. [Exo 29:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#035).md). The consecration
was to last seven days, during which time the persons to be consecrated
were not to go away from the door of the tabernacle, but to remain there
day and night, and watch the watch of the Lord that they might not die.
"For the Lord will fill your hand seven days. As they have done on this
(the first) day, so has Jehovah commanded to do to make atonement for
you" ([Lev 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#034).md). That is to say, the
rite of consecration which has been performed upon you to-day, Jehovah
has commanded to be performed or repeated for seven days. These words
clearly imply that the whole ceremony, in all its details, was to be
repeated for seven days; and in [Exo
29:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036.md), besides the filling of the
hand which was to be continued seven days, and which presupposes the
daily repetition of the consecration-offering, the preparation of the
sin-offering for reconciliation and the expiation or purification and
anointing of the altar are expressly commanded for each of the seven
days. This repetition of the act of consecration is to be regarded as
intensifying the consecration itself; and the limitation of it to seven
days is to be accounted for from the signification and holiness of the
number seven as the sign of the completion of the works of God. The
commandment not to leave the court of the tabernacle during the whole
seven days, is of course not to be understood literally (as it is by
some of the Rabbins), as meaning that the persons to be consecrated were
not even to go away from the spot for the necessities of nature (cf.
Lund. jd. Heiligth. p. 448); but when taken in connection with the
clause which follows, "and keep the charge of the Lord," it can only be
understood as signifying that during these days they were not to leave
the sanctuary to attend to any earthly avocation whatever, but
uninterruptedly to observe the charge of the Lord, i.e., the
consecration commanded by the Lord. משׁמרת שׁמר, lit., to watch the
watch of a person or thing, i.e., to attend to them, to do whatever was
required for noticing or attending to them (cf. [Gen
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#005), and Hengstenberg, Christology.md).
