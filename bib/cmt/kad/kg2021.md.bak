### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 21:1</span></span>

Reign of Manasseh (cf. 2 Chron 33:1-20). - [Kg2
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001.md). Manasseh was twelve years old
when he began to reign, so that he was not born till after Hezekiah's
dangerous illness ([Kg2 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#001)..md).

[Kg2 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#002.md)

Having begun to reign at this early age, he did not choose his father's
ways, but set up the idolatry of his father Ahab again, since the
godless party in the nation, at whose head chiefs, priests, and (false)
prophets stood, and who would not hearken to the law of the Lord, and in
the time of Hezekiah had sought help against Assyria not from Jehovah,
but from the Egyptians ([Isa 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md),
[Isa 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md)., [Isa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009)..md), had obtained control of the
young an inexperienced king, and had persuaded him to introduce idolatry
again. On [Kg2 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#002.md) cf. [Kg2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md) and [Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md).

[Kg2 21:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md)

ויּבן ויּשׁב, "he built again" the high places, which Hezekiah had
destroyed ([Kg2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004).md), erected altars
for Baal and an Asherah, like Ahab of Israel ([Kg1
16:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#032).md). האשׁרה is the image of
Asherah mentioned in [Kg2 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007.md),
whereas in the Chronicles the thought is generalized by the plurals
לבּעלים and האשׁרות. To these two kinds of idolatry, the idolatrous
bamoth and the (true) Baal-and Asherah-worship, Manasseh added as a
third kind the worship of all the host of heaven, which had not occurred
among the Israelites before the Assyrian era, and was probably of
Assyrian or Chaldaean origin. This worship differed from the
Syrophoenician star-worship, in which sun and moon were worshipped under
the names of Baal and Astarte as the bearers of the male and female
powers of nature, and was pure star-worship, based upon the idea of the
unchangeableness of the stars in contradistinction to the perishableness
of everything earthly, according to which the stars were worshipped not
merely as the originators of all rise and decay in nature, but also as
the leaders and regulators of sublunary things (see Movers, Phniz. i.
pp. 65 and 161). This star-worship was a later development of the
primary star-worship of Ssabism, in which the stars were worshipped
without any image, in the open air or upon the housetops, by simple
contemplation, the oldest and comparatively the purest form of
deification of nature, to which the earlier Arabians and the worshippers
of the sun among the Ssabians (Zabians) were addicted (cf. Delitzsch on
[Job 31:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026).md), and which is mentioned
and forbidden in [Deu 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md) and [Deu
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003.md). In this later form the sun had
sacred chariots and horses as among the Persians ([Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011).md), and incense was offered to the
stars, with the face turned towards the east, upon altars which were
built either upon housetops, as in the case of the Nabataeans (Strabo,
xvi. 784), or within the limits of the temple in the two courts (cf.
[Eze 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md), also [Kg2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#005.md); [Kg2
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md), and [Ch2
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#005.md); [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005).md). This burning of incense took
place not merely to the sun and moon, but also to the signs of the
zodiac and to all the host of heaven, i.e., to all the stars ([Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005).md); by which we are no doubt to
understand that the sun, moon, planets and other stars, were worshipped
in conjunction with the zodiac, and with this were connected astrology,
augury, and the casting of nativities, as in the case of the later
so-called Chaldaeans.

(Note: Movers (Phniz. i. p. 65) correctly observes, that "in all the
books of the Old Testament which are written before the Assyrian period
there is no trace of any (?) star-worship; not that the Phoenician
(Canaanitish) gods had not also a sidereal significance, but because
this element was only a subordinate one, and the expressions, sun, moon,
and stars, and all the host of heaven, which are not met with before,
become for the first time common now," - although his proofs of the
difference between the Assyrian star-worship and the Phoenician and
Babylonian image-worship stand greatly in need of critical sifting.)

This star-worship is more minutely described in [Kg2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#004.md), [Kg2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#005.md). The two verses are closely
connected. The מזבּחות וּבנה of [Kg2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#004.md) is resumed in מזב ויּבן in [Kg2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#005.md), and the יי בּבית of [Kg2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#004.md) is more minutely defined in the
יי בּית חצרות בּשׁתּי of. [Kg2 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#005.md).
"In the two courts:" not merely in the outer court, but even in the
court of the priests, which was set apart for the worship of Jehovah.

[Kg2 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#006.md)

He also offered his son in sacrifice to Moloch, like Ahaz ([Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003).md), in the valley of Benhinnom
(Chr. cf. [Kg2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010).md), and practised
soothsaying and witchcraft of every kind. On ונחשׁ עונן see [Deu
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md) and [Lev
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026.md), אוב עשׂה, he made, i.e.,
appointed, put into office, a "necromancer and wise people" (cf. [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031.md) and [Deu
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#011).md).

[Kg2 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007.md)

Yea, he even placed the image of Asherah in the temple, i.e., in the
Holy Place. In the description of his idolatry, which advances gradatim,
this is introduced as the very worst crime. According to the express
declaration of the Lord to David ([Sa2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013).md) and Solomon ([Kg1
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#003.md) compared with [Kg2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016).md), the temple was to serve as the
dwelling-place of His name.

[Kg2 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#008.md)

The word of the Lord, "I will no more make the foot of Israel to move
out of the land which I gave to their fathers," refers to the promise in
[Sa2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010.md) : "I will appoint my people
a place, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be stirred up
no more," which had been fulfilled by the building of the temple as the
seat of the name of the Lord, in the manner indicated in pp. 85ff. The
lasting fulfilment of this promise, however, was made to rest upon the
condition of Israel's faithful adherence to the commandments of God (cf.
[Kg1 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#006)..md).

[Kg2 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#009.md)

This condition was not observed by the Israelites; Manasseh seduced
them, so that they did more evil than the Canaanites, whom Jehovah had
destroyed before them.

[Kg2 21:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010.md)

The Lord therefore announced through the prophets, to the rebellious and
idolatrous nation, the destruction of Jerusalem and the deliverance of
Judah into the hands of its enemies; but, as is added in [Ch2
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#010.md), they paid no heed to them. The
prophets who foretold this terrible judgment are not named. According to
[Ch2 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#018.md), their utterances were
entered in the annals of the kings. Habakkuk was probably one of them,
since he ([Hab 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005).md) predicted the
Chaldaean judgment as a fact which excited astonishment and appeared
incredible. The Amorites are mentioned in [Kg2
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#011.md) instar omnium as the supporters
of the Canaanitish ungodliness, as in [Kg1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#026.md), etc. - The phrase, "that
whosoever heareth it, both his ears may tingle," denotes such a judgment
as has never been heard of before, and excites alarm and horror (cf.
[Sa1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011.md) and [Jer
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003).md). The Keri שׁמעהּ is a
correction, to bring the pronom. suff. into conformity with the noun רעה
so far as the gender is concerned, whereas in the Chethb שׁמעיו the
masculine suffix is used in the place of the feminine, as is frequently
the case.

[Kg2 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013.md)

"I stretch over Jerusalem the measure of Samaria, and the plummet of the
house of Ahab." The measure (קו) and the plummet (משׁקלת, lit., a level)
were applied to what was being built ([Zac
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#016).md), and also to what was being made
level with the ground, i.e., completely thrown down ([Amo
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007).md). From this sprang the figurative
expressions, measure of desolation and plummet of devastation ([Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011).md). - The measure of Samaria
therefore denotes the measure which was applied to the destruction of
Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab denotes the extermination
of the royal house of Ahab. The meaning is: I shall destroy Jerusalem as
I have destroyed Samaria, and exterminate its inhabitants like the house
of Ahab. In the second hemistich the same thing is expressed, if
possible, still more strongly: "I wipe away Jerusalem as one wipes the
dish, and (having) wiped (it), turns it upon its upper side (פּניה)."
The wiping of a dish that has been used, and the turning over of the
dish wiped, so as not to leave a single drop in it, are a figurative
representation of the complete destruction of Jerusalem and the utter
extermination of its inhabitants.

[Kg2 21:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#014.md)

With the destruction of Jerusalem the Lord forsakes the people of His
possession, and give it up to its enemies for a prey and spoil. נחלתי
שׁארית: Judah is called the remnant of the people of God's inheritance
with a reference to the rejection and leading away of the ten tribes,
which have already taken place. On וּמשׁסּה בּז see [Isa
42:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#022.md); [Jer
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#016.md).

To this announcement of the judgment there is appended in [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md). the statement, that Jehovah
caused Manasseh the king to be taken prisoner by the generals of the
king of Assyria and led away to Babylon in chains; and that when he
humbled himself before God there, and made supplication to Him, He
brought him back to Jerusalem and placed him upon his throne again;
whereupon Manasseh fortified the walls of Jerusalem still further,
placed garrisons in the fortified cities, removed the idol from the
temple, abolished from the city the idolatrous altars erected in
Jerusalem and upon the temple-mountain, restored the altar of Jehovah,
and commanded the people to offer sacrifice upon it. - This incident is
omitted in our book, because the conversion of Manasseh was not followed
by any lasting results so far as the kingdom was concerned; the
abolition of outward idolatry in Jerusalem did not lead to the
conversion of the people, and after the death of Manasseh even the
idolatrous abominations that had been abolished were restored by Amon.

(Note: The historical truth of these accounts, which Rosenmller, Winer,
and Hitzig called in question after the example of Gramberg, has been
defended by Ewald, Bertheau, and even by Thenius; and the latest attack
which has been made upon it by Graf in the theol. Studien u. Krit. 1859,
iii., has been met by E. Gerlach in the same magazine of 1861. For
further remarks see the Commentary on the Chronicles.)

[Kg2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md)

Manasseh also sinned grievously by shedding innocent blood till
Jerusalem was quite filled with it. לפה פּה, from one edge to the other,
see at [Kg2 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#021.md). This statement has
been paraphrased by Josephus thus (Ant. x. 3, 1): Manasseh slew πάντας
ὁμῶς τοὺς δικαίους τοὺς ἐν τοῖς Ἑεβραίοις, and did not spare even the
prophets, with the additional clause, which exaggerates the thing: καὶ
τούτων δέ τινας καθ ̓ ἡμέραν ἀπέσφαξε, ὥστε αἵματι ῥεῖσθαι τὰ
Ἱεροσόλυμα.

(Note: The widespread Jewish and Christian legend, that Manasseh put to
death the prophet Isaiah, and indeed had him sawn in sunder, to which
there is an allusion in [Heb 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md),
also belongs here. (See Delitzsch, Comm. on Isaiah, p. 5.))

[Kg2 21:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#017.md)

Manasseh was buried "in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza."
"His house" cannot be the royal palace built by Solomon, because the
garden is also called the garden of Uzza, evidently from the name of its
former possessor. "His house" must therefore have been a summer palace
belonging to Manasseh, the situation of which, however, it is impossible
to determine more precisely. The arguments adduced by Thenius in support
of the view that it was situated upon Ophel, opposite to Zion, are
perfectly untenable. Robinson (Pal. i. p. 394) conjectures that the
garden of Uzza was upon Zion. The name עוּא (עזּה) occurs again in [Sa2
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008.md); [Ch1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#007.md); [Ezr
2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#049.md), and [Neh
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#051.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 21:19</span></span>

Reign of Amon (cf. [Ch2 33:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#021).md). -
Amon reigned only two years, and that in the spirit of his father, that
is to say, worshipping all his idols. The city of Jotbah, from which his
mother sprang, was, according to Jerome (in the Onom. s. v. Jethaba),
urbs antiqua Judaeae; but it is not further known.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 21:23</span></span>

His servants conspired against him and slew him in his palace; whereupon
the people of the land, i.e., the population of Judah (הארץ עם = יהוּדה
עם, [Ch2 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001).md), put the conspirators
to death and made Josiah the son of Amon king, when he was only eight
years old.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 21:26</span></span>

Amon was buried "in his grave in the garden of Uzza," i.e., in the grave
which he had had made in the garden of Uzza by the side of his father's
grave. He had probably resided in this palace of his father. יקבּר, one
buried him.
