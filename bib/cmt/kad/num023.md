### [Numbers Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 23:1</span></span>

Balaam's First Words. - [Num 23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md).
Preparations for the first act, which was performed at Bamoth-baal. At
Balaam's command Balak built seven altars, and then selected seven
bullocks and seven rams, which they immediately sacrificed, namely, one
bullock and one ram upon each altar. The nations of antiquity generally
accompanied all their more important undertakings with sacrifices, to
make sure of the protection and help of the gods; but this was
especially the case with their ceremonies of adjuration. According to
Diod. Sic. ii. 29, the Chaldeans sought to avert calamity and secure
prosperity by sacrifices and adjurations. The same thing is also related
of other nations (see Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 392). Accordingly, Balaam
also did everything that appeared necessary, according to his own
religious notions, to ensure the success of Balak's undertaking, and
bring about the desired result. The erection of seven altars, and the
sacrifice of seven animals of each kind, are to be explained from the
sacredness acquired by this number, through the creation of the world in
seven days, as being the stamp of work that was well-pleasing to God.
The sacrifices were burnt-offerings, and were offered by themselves to
Jehovah, whom Balaam acknowledged as his God.

[Numbers 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 23:3</span></span>

After the offering of the sacrifices, Balaam directed the king to stand
by his burnt-offering, i.e., by the sacrifices that had been offered for
him upon the seven altars, that he might go out for auguries. The
meaning of the words, "I will go, peradventure Jehovah will come to meet
me," is apparent from [Num 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001.md) : and
"he went no more to meet with the auguries" (נחשׁים, see at [Lev
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026).md). Balaam went out to look for a
manifestation of Jehovah in the significant phenomena of nature. The
word which Jehovah should show to him, he would report to Balak. We have
here what is just as characteristic in relation to Balaam's religious
stand-point, as it is significant in its bearing upon the genuine
historical character of the narrative, namely, an admixture of the
religious ideas of both the Israelites and the heathen, inasmuch as
Balaam hoped to receive or discover, in the phenomena of nature, a
revelation from Jehovah. Because heathenism had no "sure word of
prophecy," it sought to discover the will and counsel of God, which are
displayed in the events of human history, through various signs that
were discernible in natural phenomena, or, as Chryssipus the Stoic
expresses it in Cicero de divin. ii. 63, "Signa quae a Diis hominibus
portendantur."

(Note: See the remarks of Ngelsbach and Hartung on the nature of the
heathen auspices, in Hengstenberg's Balaam and his Prophecies (pp.
396-7). Hartung observes, for example: "As the gods did not live outside
the world, or separated from it, but the things of time and space were
filled with their essence, it followed, as a matter of course, that the
signs of their presence were sought and seen in all the visible and
audible occurrences of nature, whether animate or inanimate. Hence all
the phenomena which affected the senses, either in the elements or in
the various creatures, whether sounds or movements, natural productions
or events, of a mechanical or physical, or voluntary or involuntary
kind, might serve as the media of revelation." And again (p. 397): "The
sign in itself is useless, if it be not observed. It was therefore
necessary that man and God should come to meet one another, and that the
sign should not merely be given, but should also be received.")

To look for a word of Jehovah in this way, Balaam betook himself to a
"bald height." This is the only meaning of שׁפי, from שׁפה, to rub, to
scrape, to make bare, which is supported by the usage of the language;
it is also in perfect harmony with the context, as the heathen augurs
were always accustomed to select elevated places for their auspices,
with an extensive prospect, especially the towering and barren summits
of mountains that were rarely visited by men (see Hengstenberg, ut
sup.). Ewald, however, proposes the meaning "alone," or "to spy," for
which there is not the slightest grammatical foundation.

[Numbers 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 23:4</span></span>

"And God came to meet Balaam," who thought it necessary, as a true
hariolus, to call the attention of God to the altars which had been
built for Him, and the sacrifices that had been offered upon them. And
God made known His will to him, though not in a natural sign of doubtful
signification. He put a very distinct and unmistakeable word into his
mouth, and commanded him to make it known to the king.

[Numbers 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 23:7</span></span>

Balaam's first saying. - Having come back to the burnt-offering, Balaam
commenced his utterance before the king and the assembled princes. משׁל,
lit., a simile, then a proverb, because the latter consists of
comparisons and figures, and lastly a sentence or saying. The
application of this term to the announcements made by Balaam ([Num
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md), [Num
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#018.md), [Num
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md), [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md), [Num
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020).md), whereas it is never used of
the prophecies of the true prophets of Jehovah, but only of certain
songs and similes inserted in them (cf. [Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md); [Eze
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#002.md); [Eze
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md); [Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004).md), is to be accounted for not
merely from the poetic form of Balaam's utterances, the predominance of
poetical imagery, the sustained parallelism, the construction of the
whole discourse in brief pointed sentences, and other peculiarities of
poetic language (e.g., בּנו, [Num
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md), [Num
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015).md), but it points at the same time
to the difference which actually exists between these utterances and the
predictions of the true prophets. The latter are orations addressed to
the congregation, which deduce from the general and peculiar relation of
Israel to the Lord and to His law, the conduct of the Lord towards His
people either in their own or in future times, proclaiming judgment upon
the ungodly and salvation to the righteous. "Balaam's mental eye," on
the contrary, as Hengstenberg correctly observes, "was simply fixed upon
what he saw; and this he reproduced without any regard to the impression
that it was intended to make upon those who heard it." But the very
first utterance was of such a character as to deprive Balak of all hope
that his wishes would be fulfilled.

[Num 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md)

"Balak, the king of Moab, fetches me from Aram, from the mountains of
the East," i.e., of Mesopotamia, which was described, as far back as
[Gen 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001.md), as the land of the sons of
the East (cf. [Num 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005).md). Balaam
mentions the mountains of his home in contradistinction to the mountains
of the land of the Moabites upon which he was then standing. "Come,
curse me Jacob, and come threaten Israel." Balak had sent for him for
this purpose (see [Num 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#011.md), [Num
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#017).md). זעמה, for זעמה, imperative
(see Ewald, 228, b.). זעם, to be angry, here to give utterance to the
wrath of God, synonymous with נקב or קבב, to curse. Jacob: a poetical
name for the nation, equivalent to Israel.

[Num 23:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#008.md)

"How shall I curse whom God does not curse, and how threaten whom
Jehovah does not threaten?" Balak imagined, like all the heathen, that
Balaam, as a goetes and magician, could distribute blessings and curses
according to his own will, and put such constraint upon his God as to
make Him subservient to his own will (see at [Num
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#006).md). The seer opposes this delusion:
The God of Israel does not curse His people, and therefore His servant
cannot curse them. The following verses ([Num
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md) and [Num
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010).md) give the reason why: "For from
the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him. Lo, it
is a people that dwelleth apart, and is not numbered among the heathen.
Who determines the dust of Jacob, and in number the fourth part of
Israel? Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and my end be like
his?" There were two reasons which rendered it impossible for Balaam to
curse Israel: (1) Because they were a people both outwardly and inwardly
different from other nations, and (2) because they were a people richly
blessed and highly favoured by God. From the top of the mountains Balaam
looked down upon the people of Israel. The outward and earthly height
upon which he stood was the substratum of the spiritual height upon
which the Spirit of God had placed him, and had so enlightened his
mental sight, that he was able to discern all the peculiarities and the
true nature of Israel. In this respect the first thing that met his view
was the fact that this people dwelt alone. Dwelling alone does not
denote a quiet and safe retirement, as many commentators have inferred
from [Deu 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md); [Jer
49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md), and [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md); but, according to the parallel
clause, "it is not reckoned among the nations," it expresses the
separation of Israel from the rest of the nations. This separation was
manifested outwardly to the seer's eye in the fact that "the host of
Israel dwelt by itself in a separate encampment upon the plain. In this
his spirit discerned the inward and essential separation of Israel from
all the heathen" (Baumgarten). This outward "dwelling alone" was a
symbol of their inward separation from the heathen world, by virtue of
which Israel was not only saved from the fate of the heathen world, but
could not be overcome by the heathen; of course only so long as they
themselves should inwardly maintain this separation from the heathen,
and faithfully continue in covenant with the Lord their God, who had
separated them from among the nations to be His own possession. As soon
as Israel lost itself in heathen ways, it also lost its own external
independence. This rule applies to the Israel of the New Testament as
well as the Israel of the Old, to the congregation or Church of God of
all ages. יתחשּׁב לע, "it does not reckon itself among the heathen
nations," i.e., it does not share the lot of the other nations, because
it has a different God and protector from the heathen (cf. [Deu
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#008.md); [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029).md). The truth of this has been so
marvellously realized in the history of the Israelites, notwithstanding
their falling short of the idea of their divine calling, "that whereas
all the mightier kingdoms of the ancient world, Egypt, Assyria, Babel,
etc., have perished without a trace, Israel, after being rescued from so
many dangers which threatened utter destruction under the Old Testament,
still flourishes in the Church of the New Testament, and continues also
to exist in that part which, though rejected now, is destined one day to
be restored" (Hengstenberg).

In this state of separation from the other nations, Israel rejoiced in
the blessing of its God, which was already visible in the innumerable
multitude into which it had grown. "Who has ever determined the dust of
Jacob?" As the dust cannot be numbered, so is the multitude of Israel
innumerable. These words point back to the promise in [Gen
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016.md), and applied quite as much to
the existing state as to the future of Israel. The beginning of the
miraculous fulfilment of the promise given to the patriarchs of an
innumerable posterity, was already before their eyes (cf. [Deu
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#022).md). Even now the fourth part of
Israel is not to be reckoned. Balaam speaks of the fourth part with
reference to the division of the nation into four camps (ch. 2), of
which he could see only one from his point of view ([Num
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041).md), and therefore only the fourth
part of the nation. מספּר is an accusative of definition, and the
subject and verb are to be repeated from the first clause; so that there
is no necessity to alter מספּר into ספר מי. - But Israel was not only
visibly blessed by God with an innumerable increase; it was also
inwardly exalted into a people of ישׁרים, righteous or honourable men.
The predicate ישׁרים is applied to Israel on account of its divine
calling, because it had a God who was just and right, a God of truth and
without iniquity ([Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004).md), or
because the God of Israel was holy, and sanctified His people ([Lev
20:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#007.md); [Exo
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013).md) and made them into a Jeshurun
([Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md); [Deu
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005.md), [Deu
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026).md). Righteousness, probity, is the
idea and destination of this people, which has never entirely lost it,
though it has never fully realized it. Even in times of general apostasy
from the Lord, there was always an ἐκλογή in the nation, of which
probity and righteousness could truly be predicated (cf. [Kg1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018).md). The righteousness of the
Israelites was "a product of the institutions which God had established
among them, of the revelation of His holy will which He had given them
in His law, of the forgiveness of sins which He had linked on to the
offering of sacrifices, and of the communication of His Spirit, which
was ever living and at work in His Church, and in it alone"
(Hengstenberg). Such a people Balaam could not curse; he could only wish
that the end of his own life might resemble the end of these righteous
men. Death is introduced here as the end and completion of life. "Balaam
desires for himself the entire, full, indestructible, and inalienable
blessedness of the Israelite, of which death is both the close and
completion, and also the seal and attestation" (Kurtz). This desire did
not involve the certain hope of a blessed life beyond the grave, which
the Israelites themselves did not then possess; it simply expressed the
thought that the death of a pious Israelite was a desirable good. And
this it was, whether viewed in the light of the past, the present, or
the future. In the hour of death the pious Israelite could look back
with blessed satisfaction to a long life, rich "in traces of the
beneficent, forgiving, delivering, and saving grace of God;" he could
comfort himself with the delightful hope of living on in his children
and his children's children, and in them of participating in the future
fulfilment of the divine promises of grace; and lastly, when dying in
possession of the love and grace of God, he could depart hence with the
joyful confidence of being gathered to his fathers in Sheol ([Gen
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008).md).

[Numbers 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 23:11</span></span>

Balak reproached Balaam for this utterance, which announced blessings to
the Israelites instead of curses. But he met his reproaches with the
remark, that he was bound by the command of Jehovah. The infinitive
absolute, בּרך, after the finite verb, expresses the fact that Balaam
had continued to give utterance to nothing but blessings. לדבּר שׁמר, to
observe to speak; שׁמר, to notice carefully, as in [Deu
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#001.md), [Deu
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#029.md), etc. But Balak thought that the
reason might be found in the unfavourable locality; he therefore led the
seer to "the field of the watchers, upon the top of Pisgah," whence he
could see the whole of the people of Israel. The words וגו תּראנּוּ אשׁר
([Num 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013).md) are to be rendered,
"whence thou wilt see it (Israel); thou seest only the end of it, but
not the whole of it" (sc., here upon Bamoth-baal). This is required by a
comparison of the verse before us with [Num
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041.md), where it is most unquestionably
stated, that upon the top of Bamoth-baal Balaam only saw "the end of the
people." For this reason Balak regarded that place as unfavourable, and
wished to lead the seer to a place from which he could see the people,
without any limitation whatever. Consequently, notwithstanding the
omission of כּי (for), the words קצהוּ אפס can only be intended to
assign the reason why Balak supposed the first utterances of Balaam to
have been unfavourable. קצהוּ = העם קצה, the end of the people ([Num
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041).md), cannot possibly signify the
whole nation, or, as Marck, de Geer, Gesenius, and Kurtz suppose, "the
people from one end to the other," in which case העם קצה (the end of the
people) would signify the very opposite of קצהוּ (the end of it); for
העם קצה is not interchangeable, or to be identified, with מקּצה כּל־העם
([Gen 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#004).md), "the whole people, from
the end or extremity of it," or from its last man; in other words, "to
the very last man." Still less does העם קצה אפס signify "the uttermost
end of the whole people, the end of the entire people," notwithstanding
the fact that Kurtz regards the expression, "the end of the end of the
people," as an intolerable tautology. קבנו, imperative with nun epenth.,
from קבב. The "field of the watchers," or "spies (zophim), upon the top
of Pisgah," corresponds, no doubt, to "the field of Moab, upon the top
of Pisgah," on the west of Heshbon (see at [Num
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020).md). Mount Nebo, from which Moses
surveyed the land of Canaan in all its length and breadth, was one
summit, and possibly the summit of Pisgah (see [Deu
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#027.md); [Deu
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001).md). The field of the spies was very
probably a tract of table-land upon Nebo; and so called either because
watchers were stationed there in times of disturbance, to keep a
look-out all round, or possibly because it was a place where augurs made
their observations of the heavens and of birds (Knobel). The locality
has not been thoroughly explored by travellers; but from the spot
alluded to, it must have been possible to overlook a very large portion
of the Arboth Moab. Still farther to the north, and nearer to the camp
of the Israelites in these Arboth, was the summit of Peor, to which
Balak afterwards conducted Balaam ([Num
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028).md), and where he not only saw the
whole of the people, but could see distinctly the camps of the different
tribes ([Num 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#002).md).

[Num 23:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014.md)

Upon Pisgah, Balak and Balaam made the same preparations for a fresh
revelation from God as upon Bamoth-baal ([Num
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001).md). כּה in [Num
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#015.md) does not mean "here" or
"yonder," but "so" or "thus," as in every other case. The thought is
this: "Do thou stay (sc., as thou art), and I will go and meet thus"
(sc., in the manner required). אקּרה (I will go and meet) is a technical
term here for going out for auguries ([Num
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001).md), or for a divine revelation.

[Numbers 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 23:18</span></span>

The second saying. - "Up, Balak, and hear! Hearken to me, son of
Zippor!" קוּם, "stand up," is a call to mental elevation, to the
perception of the word of God; for Balak was standing by his sacrifice
([Num 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#017).md). האזין with עד, as in
[Job 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#011.md), signifies a hearing which
presses forward to the speaker, i.e., in keen and minute attention
(Hengstenberg). בּנו, with the antiquated union vowel for בּן; see at
[Gen 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024.md).

[Num 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md)

"God is not a man, that He should lie; nor a son of man, that He should
repent: hath He said, and should He not do it? and spoken, and should
not carry it out?"

[Num 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#020.md)

"Behold, I have received to bless: and He hath blessed; and I cannot
turn it." Balaam meets Balak's expectation that he will take back the
blessing that he has uttered, with the declaration, that God does not
alter His purposes like changeable and fickle men, but keeps His word
unalterably, and carries it into execution. The unchangeableness of the
divine purposes is a necessary consequence of the unchangeableness of
the divine nature. With regard to His own counsels, God repents of
nothing; but this does not prevent the repentance of God, understood as
an anthropopathic expression, denoting the pain experienced by the love
of God, on account of the destruction of its creatures (see at [Gen
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006.md), and [Exo
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014).md). The ה before הוּא [Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019).md) is the interrogative ה (see
Ges. 100, 4). The two clauses of [Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md), "Hath He spoken," etc., taken
by themselves, are no doubt of universal application; but taken in
connection with the context, they relate specially to what God had
spoken through Balaam, in his first utterance with reference to Israel,
as we may see from the more precise explanation in [Num
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#020.md), "Behold, I have received to
bless' (לקח, taken, accepted), etc. השׁיב, to lead back, to make a thing
retrograde ([Isa 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013).md). Samuel
afterwards refused Saul's request in these words of Balaam ([Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019).md), when he entreated him to
revoke his rejection on the part of God ([Sa1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029).md).

[Num 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021.md)

After this decided reversal of Balak's expectations, Balaam carried out
still more fully the blessing which had been only briefly indicated in
his first utterance. "He beholds not wickedness in Jacob, and sees not
suffering in Israel: Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout
(jubilation) of a king in the midst of him." The subject in the first
sentence is God (see [Hab 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#003.md), [Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013).md). God sees not און,
worthlessness, wickedness, and עמל, tribulation, misery, as the
consequence of sin, and therefore discovers no reason for cursing the
nation. That this applied to the people solely by virtue of their
calling as the holy nation of Jehovah, and consequently that there is no
denial of the sin of individuals, is evident from the second hemistich,
which expresses the thought of the first in a positive form: so that the
words, "Jehovah his God is with him," correspond to the words, "He
beholds not wickedness;" and "the shout of a king in the midst of it,"
to His not seeing suffering. Israel therefore rejoiced in the blessing
of God only so long as it remained faithful to the idea of its divine
calling, and continued in covenant fellowship with the Lord. So long the
power of the world could do it no harm. The "shout of a king" in Israel
is the rejoicing of Israel at the fact that Jehovah dwells and rules as
King in the midst of it (cf. [Exo
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#018.md); [Deu
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005).md). Jehovah had manifested Himself
as King, by leading them out of Egypt.

[Num 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022.md)

"God brings them out of Egypt; his strength is like that of a buffalo."
אל is God as the strong, or mighty one. The participle מוציאם is not
used for the preterite, but designates the leading out as still going
on, and lasting till the introduction into Canaan. The plural suffix,
ם-, is used ad sensum, with reference to Israel as a people. Because God
leads them, they go forward with the strength of a buffalo. תּועפות,
from יעף, to weary, signifies that which causes weariness, exertion, the
putting forth of power; hence the fulness of strength, ability to make
or bear exertions. ראם is the buffalo or wild ox, an indomitable animal,
which is especially fearful on account of its horns ([Job
39:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#009.md); [Deu
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md); [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022).md).

[Num 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023.md)

The fellowship of its God, in which Israel rejoiced, and to which it
owed its strength, was an actual truth. "For there is no augury in
Jacob, and no divination in Israel. At the time it is spoken to Jacob,
and to Israel what God doeth." כּי does not mean, "so that, as an
introduction to the sequel," as Knobel supposes, but "for," as a causal
particle. The fact that Israel was not directed, like other nations, to
the uncertain and deceitful instrumentality of augury and divination,
but enjoyed in all its concerns the immediate revelation of its God,
furnished the proof that it had its God in the midst of it, and was
guided and endowed with power by God Himself. נחשׁ and קסם, οἰωνισμός
and μαντεία, augurium et divinatio (lxx, Vulg.), were the two means
employed by the heathen for looking into futurity. The former (see at
[Lev 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026).md) was the unfolding of the
future from signs in the phenomena of nature, and inexplicable
occurrences in animal and human life; the latter, prophesying from a
pretended or supposed revelation of the Deity within the human mind.
כּעת, "according to the time," i.e., at the right time, God revealed His
acts, His counsel, and His will to Israel in His word, which He had
spoken at first to the patriarchs, and afterwards through Moses and the
prophets. In this He revealed to His people in truth, and in a way that
could not deceive, what the heathen attempted in vain to discover
through augury and divination (cf. [Deu
18:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#014).md).

(Note: "What is here affirmed of Israel, applies to the Church of all
ages, and also to every individual believer. The Church of God knows
from His word what God does, and what it has to do in consequence. The
wisdom of this world resembles augury and divination. The Church of God,
which is in possession of His word, has no need of it, and it only leads
its followers to destruction, from inability to discern the will of God.
To discover this with certainty, is the great privilege of the Church of
God" (Hengstenberg).)

[Num 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024.md)

Through the power of its God, Israel was invincible, and would crush all
its foes. "Behold, it rises up, a people like the lioness, and lifts
itself up like the lion. It lies not down till it eats dust, and drinks
the blood of the slain." What the patriarch Jacob prophesied of Judah,
the ruler among his brethren, in [Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md), Balaam here transfers to the
whole nation, to put to shame all the hopes indulged by the Moabitish
king of the conquest and destruction of Israel.

Balaam's Last Words. - [Num 23:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#025.md).
Balak was not deterred, however, from making another attempt. At first,
indeed, he exclaimed in indignation at these second sayings of Balaam:
"Thou shalt neither curse it, nor even bless." The double גּם with לא
signifies "neither - nor;" and the rendering, "if thou do not curse it,
thou shalt not bless it," must be rejected as untenable. In his vexation
at the second failure, he did not want to hear anything more from
Balaam. But when he replied again, that he had told him at the very
outset that he could do nothing but what God should say to him (cf. [Num
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#038).md), he altered his mind, and
resolved to conduct Balaam to another place with this hope:
"peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from
thence." Clericus observes upon this passage, "It was the opinion of the
heathen, that what was not obtained through the first, second, or third
victim, might nevertheless be secured through a fourth;" and he adduces
proofs from Suetonius, Curtius, Gellius, and others.

He takes the seer "to the top of Peor, which looks over the face of the
desert" (Jeshimon: see at [Num 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020).md),
and therefore was nearer to the camp of the Israelites. Mount Peor was
one peak of the northern part of the mountains of Abarim by the town of
Beth-peor, which afterwards belonged to the Reubenites ([Jos
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#020).md), and opposite to which the
Israelites were encamped in the steppes of Moab ([Deu
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029.md); [Deu
4:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#046).md). According to Eusebius (Onom. s.
v. Φογώρ), Peor was above Libias (i.e., Bethharam),

(Note: Ὑυπέρκειται δὲ τῆς νῦν Λιβαίδος καλουμένης. Jerome has "in
supercilio Libiados.")

which was situated in the valley of the Jordan; and according to the
account given under Araboth Moab,

(Note: Καὶ ἔστι τόπος εἰς δεῦρο δεικνύμενος παρὰ τῷ ὄρει Φογώρ ὁ
παράκειται ἀνιόντων ἀπὸ Λιβίαδος ἐπὶ Ἐσσεβοὺς (i.e., Heshbon) τῆς
Ἀραβίας ἀντικρὺ Ἰεριχώ.)

it was close by the Arboth Moab, opposite to Jericho, on the way from
Libias to Heshbon. Peor was about seven Roman miles from Heshbon,
according to the account given s. v. Danaba; and Beth-peor (s. v.
Bethphozor) was near Mount Peor, opposite to Jericho, six Roman miles
higher than Libias, i.e., to the east of it (see Hengstenberg, Balaam,
p. 538).

[Num 23:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#029.md)

The sacrifices offered in preparation for this fresh transaction were
the same as in the former cases ([Num
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014.md), and [Num
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md), [Num
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#002).md).
