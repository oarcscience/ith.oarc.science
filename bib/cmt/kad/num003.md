### [Numbers Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 3:1</span></span>

Muster of the Tribe of Levi. - As Jacob had adopted the two sons of
Joseph as his own sons, and thus promoted them to the rank of heads of
tribes, the tribe of Levi formed, strictly speaking, the thirteenth
tribe of the whole nation, and was excepted from the muster of the
twelve tribes who were destined to form the army of Jehovah, because God
had chosen it for the service of the sanctuary. Out of this tribe God
had not only called Moses to be the deliverer, lawgiver, and leader of
His people, but Moses' brother Aaron, with the sons of the latter, to be
the custodians of the sanctuary. And now, lastly, the whole tribe was
chosen, in the place of the first-born of all the tribes, to assist the
priests in performing the duties of the sanctuary, and was numbered and
mustered for this its special calling.

[Num 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

In order to indicate at the very outset the position which the Levites
were to occupy in relation to the priests (viz., Aaron and his
descendants), the account of their muster commences not only with the
enumeration of the sons of Aaron who were chosen as priests ([Num
3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#002).md), but with the heading: "These
are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day (i.e., at the time)
when Jehovah spake with Moses in Mount Sinai ([Num
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001).md). The toledoth (see at [Gen
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004).md) of Moses and Aaron are not only
the families which sprang from Aaron and Moses, but the Levitical
families generally, which were named after Aaron and Moses, because they
were both of them raised into the position of heads or spiritual fathers
of the whole tribe, namely, at the time when God spoke to Moses upon
Sinai. Understood in this way, the notice as to the time is neither a
superfluous repetition, nor introduced with reference to the subsequent
numbering of the people in the steppes of Moab ([Num
26:57](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#057)..md). Aaron is placed before Moses
here (see at [Exo 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#026)..md), not merely
as being the elder of the two, but because his sons received the
priesthood, whilst the sons of Moses, on the contrary, were classed
among the rest of the Levitical families (cf. [Ch1
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#014).md).

[Num 3:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#002.md)

Names of the sons of Aaron, the "anointed priests (see [Lev
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#012).md), whose hand they filled to be
priests," i.e., who were appointed to the priesthood (see at [Lev
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#037).md). On Nadab and Abihu, see [Lev
10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md). As they had neither of them
any children when they were put to death, Eleazar and Ithamar were the
only priests "in the sight of Aaron their father," i.e., during his
lifetime. "In the sight of:" as in [Gen
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#028.md).

[Numbers 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 3:5</span></span>

The Levites are placed before Aaron the priest, to be his servants.

[Num 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#006.md)

"Bring near:" as in [Exo 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001.md). The
expression לפני עמד is frequently met with in connection with the
position of a servant, as standing before his master to receive his
commands.

[Num 3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#007.md)

They were to keep the charge of Aaron and the whole congregation before
the tabernacle, to attend to the service of the dwelling, i.e., to
observe what Aaron (the priest) and the whole congregation were bound to
perform in relation to the service at the dwelling-place of Jehovah. "To
keep the charge:" see [Num 1:53](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#053.md) and
[Gen 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#005.md). In [Num
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#008.md) this is more fully explained: they
were to keep the vessels of the tabernacle, and to attend to all that
was binding upon the children of Israel in relation to them, i.e., to
take the oversight of the furniture, to keep it safe and clean.

[Num 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#009.md)

Moses was also to give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. "They are
wholly given to him out of the children of Israel:" the repetition of
נתוּנם here and in [Num 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#016.md) is
emphatic, and expressive of complete surrender (Ewald, 313). The
Levites, however, as nethunim, must be distinguished from the nethinim
of non-Israelitish descent, who were given to the Levites at a later
period as temple slaves, to perform the lowest duties connected with the
sanctuary (see at [Jos 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027).md).

[Num 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#010.md)

Aaron and his sons were to be appointed by Moses to take charge of the
priesthood; as no stranger, no one who was not a son of Aaron, could
approach the sanctuary without being put to death (cf. [Num
1:53](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#053.md) and [Lev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010).md).

[Numbers 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 3:11</span></span>

God appointed the Levites for this service, because He had decided to
adopt them as His own in the place of all the first-born of Egypt. When
He slew the first-born of Egypt, He sanctified to Himself all the
first-born of Israel, of man and beast, for His own possession (see [Exo
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001).md). By virtue of this
sanctification, which was founded upon the adoption of the whole nation
as His first-born son, the nation was required to dedicate to Him its
first-born sons for service at the sanctuary, and sacrifice all the
first-born of its cattle to Him. But now the Levites and their cattle
were to be adopted in their place, and the first-born sons of Israel to
be released in return ([Num 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040)..md). By
this arrangement, through which the care of the service at the sanctuary
was transferred to one tribe, which would and should henceforth devote
itself with undivided interest to this vocation, not only was a more
orderly performance of this service secured, than could have been
effected through the first-born of all the tribes; but so far as the
whole nation was concerned, the fulfilment of its obligations in
relation to this service was undoubtedly facilitated. Moreover, the
Levites had proved themselves to be the most suitable of all the tribes
for his post, through their firm and faithful defence of the honour of
the Lord at the worship of the golden calf ([Exo
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026)..md). It is in this spirit, which
distinguished the tribe of Levi, that we may undoubtedly discover the
reason why they were chosen by God for the service of the sanctuary, and
not in the fact that Moses and Aaron belonged to the tribe, and desired
to form a hierarchical caste of the members of their own tribe, such as
was to be found among other nations: the magi, for example, among the
Medes, the Chaldeans among the Persians, and the Brahmins among the
Indians. יהוה אני לי, "to Me, to Me, Jehovah" ([Num
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#013.md), [Num
3:41](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#041.md), and [Num
3:45](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#045); cf. Ges. 121, 3.md).

[Numbers 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 3:14</span></span>

The muster of the Levites included all the males from a month old and
upwards, because they were to be sanctified to Jehovah in the place of
the first-born; and it was at the age of a month that the latter were
either to be given up or redeemed (comp. [Num
3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040.md) and [Num
3:43](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#043.md) with [Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016).md). In [Num
3:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#017.md) the sons of Levi and their
sons are enumerated, who were the founders of the mishpachoth among the
Levites, as in [Exo 6:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016.md).

[Numbers 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 3:21</span></span>

The Gershonites were divided into two families, containing 7500 males.
They were to encamp under their chief Eliasaph, behind the tabernacle,
i.e., on the western side ([Num 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#023.md),
[Num 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#024).md), and were to take charge of
the dwelling-place and the tent, the covering, the curtain at the
entrance, the hangings round the court with the curtains at the door,
and the cords of the tent, "in relation to all the service thereof"
([Num 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025)..md); that is to say,
according to the more precise injunctions in [Num
4:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#025.md), they were to carry the
tapestry of the dwelling (the inner covering, [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001)..md), and of the tent (i.e., the
covering made of goats' hair, [Exo
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007)..md), the covering thereof (i.e.,
the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of sea-cow skin
upon the top of it, [Exo 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016).md), the
hangings of the court and the curtain at the entrance ([Exo
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009.md), [Exo
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016).md), which surrounded the altar (of
burnt-offering) and the dwelling round about, and their cords, i.e., the
cords of the tapestry, coverings, and curtains ([Exo
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#014).md), and all the instruments of
their service, i.e., the things used in connection with their service
([Exo 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019).md), and were to attend to
everything that had to be done to them; in other words, to perform
whatever was usually done with those portions of the sanctuary that are
mentioned here, especially in setting up the tabernacle or taking it
down. The suffix in מיתריו ([Num 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026).md)
does not refer to the court mentioned immediately before; for, according
to [Num 3:37](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#037.md), the Merarites were to
carry the cords of the hangings of the court, but to the "dwelling and
tent," which stand farther off. In the same way the words, "for all the
service thereof," refer to all those portions of the sanctuary that are
mentioned, and mean "everything that had to be done or attended to in
connection with these things."

[Numbers 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 3:27</span></span>

The Kohathites, who were divided into four families, and numbered 8600,
were to encamp on the south side of the tabernacle, and more especially
to keep the charge of the sanctuary ([Num
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#028).md), viz., to take care of the ark
of the covenant, the table (of shew-bread), the candlestick, the altars
(of incense and burnt-offering), with the holy things required for the
service performed in connection therewith, and the curtain (the veil
before the most holy place), and to perform whatever had to be done
("all the service thereof," see at [Num
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026).md), i.e., to carry the said holy
things after they had been rolled up in covers by the priests (see [Num
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005)..md).

[Numbers 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 3:32</span></span>

As the priests also formed part of the Kohathites, their chief is
mentioned as well, viz., Eleazar the eldest son of Aaron the high
priest, who was placed over the chiefs of the three Levitical families,
and called פּקדּה, oversight of the keepers of the charge of the
sanctuary," i.e., authority, superior, of the servants of the sanctuary.

[Numbers 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 3:33</span></span>

The Merarites, who formed two families, comprising 6200 males, were to
encamp on the north side of the tabernacle, under their prince Zuriel,
and to observe the boards, bolts, pillars, and sockets of the
dwelling-place ([Exo 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015.md), [Exo
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#026.md), [Exo
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#032.md), [Exo
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#037).md), together with all the vessels
thereof (the plugs and tools), and all that had to be done in connection
therewith, also the pillars of the court with their sockets, the plugs
and the cords ([Exo 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#010.md), [Exo
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019.md); [Exo
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#018).md); that is to say, they were to
take charge of these when the tabernacle was taken down, to carry them
on the march, and to fix them when the tabernacle was set up again ([Num
4:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#031).md).

[Numbers 3:38](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">num 3:38</span></span>

Moses and Aaron, with the sons of the latter (the priests), were to
encamp in front, before the tabernacle, viz., on the eastern side, "as
keepers of the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of
Israel," i.e., to attend to everything that was binding upon the
children of Israel in relation to the care of the sanctuary, as no
stranger was allowed to approach it on pain of death (see [Num
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#051).md).

[Num 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039.md)

The number of the Levites mustered, 22,000, does not agree with the
numbers assigned to the three families, as 7500 + 8600 + 6200 = 22,300.
But the total is correct; for, according to [Num
3:46](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#046.md), the number of the first-born,
22,273, exceeded the total number of the Levites by 273. The attempt
made by the Rabbins and others to reconcile the two, by supposing the
300 Levites in excess to be themselves first-born, who were omitted in
the general muster, because they were not qualified to represent the
first-born of the other tribes, is evidently forced and unsatisfactory.
The whole account is so circumstantial, that such a fact as this would
never have been omitted. We must rather assume that there is a copyist's
error in the number of one of the Levitical families; possibly in [Num
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#028.md) we should read שׁלשׁ for שׁשׁ
(8300 for 8600). The puncta extraordinaria above ואהרן are intended to
indicate that this word is either suspicious or spurious (see at [Gen
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#005).md); and it is actually omitted in
Sam., Syr., and 12 MSS, but without sufficient reason: for although the
divine command to muster the Levites ([Num
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#005.md) and [Num
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014).md) was addressed to Moses alone,
yet if we compare [Num 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#001.md), [Num
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#034.md), [Num
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#037.md), [Num
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#041.md), [Num
4:45](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#045.md), where the Levites qualified for
service are said to have been mustered by Moses and Aaron, and still
more [Num 4:46](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#046.md), where the elders of
Israel are said to have taken part in the numbering of the Levites as
well as in that of the twelve tribes ([Num
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003).md), there can be no reason to
doubt that Aaron also took part in the mustering of the whole of the
Levites, for the purpose of adoption in the place of the first-born of
Israel; and no suspicion attaches to this introduction of his name in
[Num 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039.md), although it is not
mentioned in [Num 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#005.md), [Num
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011.md), [Num
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014.md), [Num
3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040.md), and [Num
3:44](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044.md).

[Numbers 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">num 3:40</span></span>

After this, Moses numbered the first-born of the children of Israel, to
exchange them for the Levites according to the command of God, which is
repeated in [Num 3:41](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#041.md) and [Num
3:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044.md) from [Num
3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011.md), and to adopt the latter in
their stead for the service at the sanctuary (on [Num
3:41](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#041.md) and [Num
3:45](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#045.md), cf. [Num
3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011).md). The number of the first-born
of the twelve tribes amounted to 22,273 of a month old and upwards ([Num
3:43](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#043).md). Of this number 22,000 were
exchanged for the 22,000 Levites, and the cattle of the Levites were
also set against the first-born of the cattle of the tribes of Israel,
though without their being numbered and exchanged head for head. In [Num
3:44](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044.md) and [Num
3:45](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#045.md) the command of God concerning the
adoption of the Levites is repeated, for the purpose of adding the
further instructions with regard to the 273, the number by which the
first-born of the tribes exceeded those of the Levites. "And as for the
redemption of the 273 (lit., the 273 to be redeemed) of the first-born
of the children of Israel which were more than the Levites, thou shalt
take five shekels a head," etc. This was the general price established
by the law for the redemption of the first-born of men (see [Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016).md). On the sacred shekel, see at
[Exo 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md). The redemption money for
273 first-born, in all 1365 shekels, was to be paid to Aaron and his
sons as compensation for the persons who properly belonged to Jehovah,
and had been appointed as first-born for the service of the priests.

[Numbers 3:49](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">num 3:49</span></span>

"The redeemed of the Levites" are the 22,000 who were redeemed by means
of the Levites. In [Num 3:50](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#050.md), the
Chethibh הפּדים is the correct reading, and the Keri הפּדים an
unnecessary emendation. The number of the first-born and that of the
Levites has already been noticed in the introduction to Numbers 1.
