The Deliverer from Death in Waters and in a Snare

The statement "the stream had gone over our soul" of this fifth Son of
degrees, coincides with the statement "our soul is full enough" of the
fourth; the two Psalms also meet in the synonymous new formations
גּאיונים and זידונים, which also look very much as though they were
formed in allusion to contemporary history. The לדוד is wanting in the
lxx, Codd. Alex. and Vat., here as in [Psa
122:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md), and with the exception of the
Targum is wanting in general in the ancient versions, and therefore is
not so much as established as a point of textual criticism. It is a
Psalm in the manner of the Davidic Psalms, to which it is closely allied
in the metaphors of the overwhelming waters, [Psa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md), [Psa
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017.md) (cf. [Psa
144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007).md), [Psa
69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md)., and of the little bird; cf.
also on לוּלי [Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md), on אדם used
of hostile men [Psa 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012.md), on בּלע
חיּים [Psa 55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md), on בּרוּך ה [Psa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006.md); [Psa
31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022.md). This beautiful song makes its
modern origin known by its Aramaizing character, and by the delight,
after the manner of the later poetry, in all kinds of embellishments of
language. The art of the form consists less in strophic symmetry than in
this, that in order to take one step forward it always goes back half a
step. Luther's imitation (1524), "Were God not with us at this time"
(Wהre Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit), bears the inscription "The true
believers' safeguard."

[Psalms 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 124:1</span></span>

It is commonly rendered, "If it had not been Jahve who was for us." But,
notwithstanding the subject that is placed first (cf. [Gen
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#013).md), the שׁ belongs to the לוּלי;
since in the Aramaizing Hebrew (cf. on the other hand [Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042)) לוּלי שׁ (cf. Arab. lawlâ an.md)
signifies nisi (prop. nisi quod), as in the Aramaic (דּ) שׁ (לואי) לוי,
o si (prop. o si quod). The אזי, peculiar to this Psalm in the Old
Testament, instead of אז follows the model of the dialectic אדין, Arab.
iḏan, Syr. hāden (הידין, הדין). In order to begin the apodosis of לוּלי
(לוּלא) emphatically the older language makes use of the confirmatory
כּי, [Gen 31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md); [Gen
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#010.md); here we have אזי (well rendered
by the lxx ἄρα), as in [Psa 119:92](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#092.md).
The Lamed of היה לנו is raphe in both instances, according to the rule
discussed above, p. 373. When men (אדם) rose up against Israel and their
anger was kindled against them, they who were feeble in themselves over
against the hostile world would have been swallowed up alive if they had
not had Jahve for them, if they had not had Him on their side. This
"swallowing up alive" is said elsewhere of Hades, which suddenly and
forcibly snatches away its victims, [Psa
55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md); [Pro
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012.md); here, however, as [Psa
124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md) shows, it is said of the
enemies, who are represented as wild beasts. In [Psa
124:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md) the hostile power which rolls
over them is likened to an overflowing stream, as in [Isa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md)., the Assyrian. נחלה, a stream or
river, is Milel; it is first of all accusative: towards the stream ([Num
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#005).md); then, however, it is also used
as a nominative, like לילה, המּותה, and the like (cf. common Greek ἡ
νύχθα, ἡ νεόντητα); so that תה- is related to ת- ( ה-) as נה-, מו- to ן-
and ם- (Bttcher, 615). These latest Psalms are fond of such
embellishments by means of adorned forms and Aramaic or Aramaizing
words. זידונים is a word which is indeed not unhebraic in its formation,
but is more indigenous to Chaldee; it is the Targum word for זדים in
[Psa 86:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#014.md); [Psa
119:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#051.md), [Psa
119:78](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#078.md) (also in [Psa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005) for זרים.md), although according to
Levy the MSS do not present זידונין but זידנין. In the passage before us
the Targum renders: the king who is like to the proud waters (למוי
זידוניּא) of the sea (Antiochus Epiphanes? - a Scholium explains οἱ
ὑπερήφανοι). With reference to עבר before a plural subject, vid., Ges.
147.

[Psalms 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 124:6</span></span>

After the fact of the divine succour has been expressed, in [Psa
124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md) follows the thanksgiving for it,
and in [Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md) the joyful shout of
the rescued one. In [Psa 124:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#006.md) the
enemies are conceived of as beasts of prey on account of their
bloodthirstiness, just as the worldly empires are in the Book of Daniel;
in [Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md) as "fowlers" on account
of their cunning. According to the punctuation it is not to be rendered:
Our soul is like a bird that is escaped, in which case it would have
been accented בפשׁנו כצפור, but: our soul (subject with Rebia magnum) is
as a bird (כּצפור as in [Hos 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md);
[Pro 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#032.md); [Job
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002.md), instead of the syntactically
more usual כּצּפור) escaped out of the snare of him who lays snares
(יוקשׁ, elsewhere יקושׁ, יקוּשׁ, a fowler, [Psa
91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003)). נשׁבר (with ā beside Rebia.md) is
3rd praet.: the snare was burst, and we - we became free. In [Psa
124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008.md) (cf. [Psa
121:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002.md); [Psa
134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003).md) the universal, and here
pertinent thought, viz., the help of Israel is in the name of Jahve, the
Creator of the world, i.e., in Him who is manifest as such and is
continually verifying Himself, forms the epiphonematic close. Whether
the power of the world seeks to make the church of Jahve like to itself
or to annihilate it, it is not a disavowal of its God, but a faithful
confession, stedfast even to death, that leads to its deliverance.
