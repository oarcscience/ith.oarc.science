### [Deuteronomy Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 7:1</span></span>

As the Israelites were warned against idolatry in [Deu
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#014.md), so here are they exhorted to
beware of the false tolerance of sparing the Canaanites and enduring
their idolatry. - [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md), [Deu
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005.md). When the Lord drove out the
tribes of Canaan before the Israelites, and gave them up to them and
smote them, they were to put them under the ban (see at [Lev
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028).md), to make no treaty with them,
and to contract no marriage with them. נשׁל, to draw out, to cast away,
e.g., the sandals ([Exo 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005).md); here and
[Deu 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022.md) it signifies to draw out, or
drive out a nation from its country and possessions: it occurs in this
sense in the Piel in [Kg2 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006.md). On the
Canaanitish tribes, see at [Gen 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015.md).
and [Deu 15:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#020.md). There are seven of
them mentioned here, as in [Jos 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010.md)
and [Jos 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#011.md); on the other hand,
there are only six in [Deu 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#017.md), as
in [Exo 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md), [Exo
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#017.md); [Exo
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023.md), and [Exo
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#002.md), the Girgashites being omitted.
The prohibition against making a covenant, as in [Exo
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#032.md) and [Exo
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#012.md), and that against marrying, as
in [Exo 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#016.md), where the danger of the
Israelites being drawn away to idolatry is mentioned as a still further
reason for these commands. יסיר כּי, "for he (the Canaanite) will cause
thy son to turn away from behind me," i.e., tempt him away from
following me, "to serve other gods." Moses says "from following me,"
because he is speaking in the name of Jehovah. The consequences of
idolatry, as in [Deu 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#015.md); [Deu
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026.md), etc.

[Deuteronomy 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 7:5</span></span>

The Israelites were rather to destroy the altars and idols of the
Canaanites, according to the command in [Exo
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013.md); [Exo
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#024.md).

[Deuteronomy 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 7:6</span></span>

They were bound to do this by virtue of their election as a holy nation,
the nation of possession, which Jehovah had singled out from all other
nations, and brought out of the bondage of Egypt, not because of its
greatness, but from love to them, and for the sake of the oath given to
the fathers. This exalted honour Israel was not to cast away by apostasy
from the Lord. It was founded upon the word of the Lord in [Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md), which Moses brought to the
recollection of the people, and expressly and emphatically developed.
"Not because of your multitude before all nations (because ye were more
numerous than all other nations) hath Jehovah turned to you in love
(חשׁק, to bind oneself with, to hang upon a person, out of love), for ye
are the littleness of all nations" (the least numerous). Moses could say
this to Israel with reference to its descent from Abraham, whom God
chose as the one man out of all the world, whilst nations, states, and
kingdoms had already been formed all around (Baumgarten). "But because
Jehovah loved you, and kept His oath which He had sworn to the fathers,
He hath brought you out," etc. Instead of saying, He hath chosen you out
of love to your fathers, as in [Deu
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037.md), Moses brings out in this place
love to the people of Israel as the divine motive, not for choosing
Israel, but for leading it out and delivering it from the slave-house of
Egypt, by which God had practically carried out the election of the
people, that He might thereby allure the Israelites to a reciprocity of
love.

[Deuteronomy 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 7:9</span></span>

By this was Israel to know that Jehovah their God was the true God, the
faithful God, who keeps His covenant, showing mercy to those who love
Him, even to the thousandth generation, but repaying those who hate Him
to the face. This development of the nature of God Moses introduces from
[Exo 20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md), as a light warning not to
forfeit the mercy of God, or draw upon themselves His holy wrath by
falling into idolatry. To this end He emphatically carries out still
further the thought of retribution, by adding להאבידו, "to destroy him"
(the hater), and וגו יאהר לא, "He delays not to His hater (sc., to repay
him); He will repay him to his face." "To the face of every one of
them," i.e., that they may see and feel that they are smitten by God
(Rosenmller).

[Deuteronomy 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 7:11</span></span>

This energy of the grace and holiness of the faithful covenant God was a
powerful admonition to keep the divine commandments.

[Deuteronomy 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 7:12</span></span>

The observance of these commandments would also bring great blessings
([Deu 7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#012).md). "If ye hearken to
these demands of right" (mishpatim) of the covenant Lord upon His
covenant people, and keep them and do them, "Jehovah will keep unto thee
the covenant and the mercy which He hath sworn to thy fathers." In עקב,
for אשׁר עקב ([Gen 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018).md), there is
involved not only the idea of reciprocity, but everywhere also an
allusion to reward or punishment (cf. [Deu
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#020.md); [Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024).md). חסד was the favour displayed
in the promises given to the patriarchs on oath ([Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016).md).

[Deu 7:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013.md)

This mercy flowed from the love of God to Israel, and the love was
manifested in blessing and multiplying the people. The blessing is then
particularized, by a further expansion of [Exo
23:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#025.md), as a blessing upon the fruit
of the body, the fruits of the field and soil, and the rearing of
cattle. שׁגר, see [Exo 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012.md). צאן
עשׁתּרת only occurs again in [Deu
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004.md), [Deu
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#018.md), [Deu
28:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#051.md), and certainly signifies the
young increase of the flocks. It is probably a Canaanitish word, derived
from Ashtoreth (Astharte), the female deity of the Canaanites, which was
regarded as the conceiving and birth-giving principle of nature,
literally Veneres, i.e., amores gregis, hence soboles (Ges.); just as
the Latin poets employ the name Ceres to signify the corn, Venus for
love and sexual intercourse, and Lucina for birth. On [Deu
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#014.md) and [Deu
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#015.md), see [Exo
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#026.md). In [Deu
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#015.md), the promise of the preservation
of Israel from all diseases ([Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026.md), and [Exo
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#025).md) is strengthened by the addition
of the clause, "all the evil diseases of Egypt," by which, according to
[Deu 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md), we are probably to
understand chiefly the malignant species of leprosy called
elephantiasis, and possibly also the plague and other malignant forms of
disease. In Egypt, diseases for the most part readily assume a very
dangerous character. Pliny (h. n. xxvi. 1) calls Egypt the genitrix of
contagious pestilence, and modern naturalists have confirmed this (see
Hengstenberg, Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 215; and Pruner,
Krankheiten des Orients, pp. 460ff.). Diseases of this kind the Lord
would rather bring upon the enemies of Israel. The Israelites, on the
other hand, should be so strong and vigorous, that they would devour,
i.e., exterminate, all the nations which their God would give into their
hands (cf. [Num 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009).md). With this
thought Moses reverts with emphasis to the command to root out the
Canaanites without reserve, and not to serve their gods, because they
would become a snare to them (see [Exo
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007).md); and then in [Deu
7:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#017.md) he carries out still further
the promise in [Exo 23:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md) of the
successful subjugation of the Canaanites through the assistance of the
Lord, and sweeps away all the objections that a weak faith might raise
to the execution of the divine command.

[Deu 7:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#017.md)

To suppress the thought that was rising up in their heart, how could it
be possible for them to destroy these nations which were more numerous
than they, the Israelites were to remember what the Lord had done in
Egypt and to Pharaoh, namely, the great temptations, signs, and wonders
connected with their deliverance from Egypt (cf. [Deu
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md) and [Deu
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#022).md). He would do just the same to
the Canaanites.

[Deu 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#020.md)

He would also send hornets against them, as He had already promised in
[Exo 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#028) (see the passage.md), until
all that were left and had hidden themselves should have utterly
perished.

[Deu 7:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021.md)

Israel had no need to be afraid of them, as Jehovah was in the midst of
it a mighty God and terrible. He would drive out the nations, but only
gradually, as He had already declared to Moses in [Exo
23:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#030.md), and would smite them with
great confusion, till they were destroyed, as was the case for example
at Gibeon ([Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md); cf. [Exo
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md), where the form המם is used
instead of הוּם), and would also deliver their kings into the hand of
Israel, so that their names should vanish under the heaven (cf. [Deu
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#014.md); [Deu
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019.md); and for the fulfilment, [Jos
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#022.md)., [Deu
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#012); 12:7-24.md). No one would be able
to stand before Israel.

[Deu 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#024.md)

"To stand before thee:" lit., to put oneself in the face of a person, so
as to withstand him. השׁמיד for השׁמיד, as in [Lev
14:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#043.md), etc.

[Deu 7:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025.md)

Trusting to this promise, the Israelites were to burn up the idols of
the Canaanites, and not to desire the silver and gold upon them (with
which the statues were overlaid), or take it to themselves, lest they
should be snared in it, i.e., lest the silver and gold should become a
snare to them. It would become so, not from any danger lest they should
practise idolatry with it, but because silver and gold which had been
used in connection with idolatrous worship was an abomination to
Jehovah, which the Israelites were not to bring into their houses, lest
they themselves should fall under the ban, to which all the objects
connected with idolatry were devoted, as the history of Achan in Josh 7
clearly proves. For this reason, any such abomination was to be
abhorred, and destroyed by burning or grinding to powder (cf. [Exo
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020.md); [Kg2
23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004.md); [Ch2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016).md).
