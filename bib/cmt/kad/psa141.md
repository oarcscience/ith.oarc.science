Evening Psalm in the Times of Absalom

The four Psalms, [Psa 140:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001), [Psa
141:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001), [Psa
142:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001), and [Psa
143:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001), are interwoven with one
another in many ways (Symbolae, pp. 67f.). The following passages are
very similar, viz., [Psa 140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007); [Psa
141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001); [Psa
142:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#002), and [Psa
143:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001). Just as the poet complains in
[Psa 142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004), "when my spirit veils
itself within me," so too in [Psa
143:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#004); as he prays in Ps 142:8, "Oh
bring my soul out of prison," so in [Psa
143:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#011), "bring my soul out of
distress," where צרה takes the place of the metaphorical מסגר. Besides
these, compare [Psa 140:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005) with [Psa
141:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#009); [Psa
142:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007) with [Psa
143:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#009); [Psa
140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003) with [Psa
141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005), רעות; Ps 140:14 with Ps 142:8;
[Psa 142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004) with [Psa
143:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#008).

The right understanding of the Psalm depends upon the right
understanding of the situation. Since it is inscribed לדוד, it is
presumably a situation corresponding to the history of David, out of the
midst of which the Psalm is composed, either by David himself or by some
one else who desired to give expression in Davidic strains to David's
mood when in this situation. For the gleaning of Davidic Psalms which we
find in the last two Books of the Psalter is for the most part derived
from historical works in which these Psalms, in some instances only free
reproductions of the feelings of David with respect to old Davidic
models, adorned the historic narrative. The Psalm before us adorned the
history of the time of the persecution by Absalom. At that time David
was driven out of Jerusalem, and consequently cut off from the
sacrificial worship of God upon Zion; and our Psalm is an evening hymn
of one of those troublous days. The ancient church, even prior to the
time of Gregory (Constitutiones Apostolicae, ii. 59), had chosen it for
its evening hymn, just as it had chosen [Psa
63:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001) for its morning hymn. Just as
[Psa 63:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001) was called ὁ ὀρθρινός
(ibid. 8:37), so this Psalm, as being the Vesper Psalm, was called ὁ
ἐπιλύχνιος (vid., 8:35).

[Psalms 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 141:1</span></span>

The very beginning of [Psa 141:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001) is
more after the manner of David than really Davidic; for instead of haste
thee to me, David always says, haste thee for my help, [Psa
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020); 38:23; [Psa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014). The לך that is added to בּקראי
(as in [Psa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002)) is to be explained,
as in [Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003) : when I call to Thee,
i.e., when I call Thee, who art now far from me, to me. The general cry
for help is followed in [Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002) by
a petition for the answering of his prayer. Luther has given an
excellent rendering: Let my prayer avail to Thee as an offering of
incense; the lifting up of my hands, as an evening sacrifice (Mein Gebet
msse fur dir tgen wie ein Reuchopffer, Meine Hende auffheben, wie ein
Abendopffer). תּכּון is the fut. Niph. of כּוּן, and signifies properly
to be set up, and to be established, or reflexive: to place and arrange
or prepare one's self, [Amo 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#012); then
to continue, e.g., [Psa 101:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#007);
therefore, either let it place itself, let it appear, sistat se, or
better: let it stand, continue, i.e., let my prayer find acceptance,
recognition with Thee קטרת, and the lifting up of my hands מנחת־ערב.
Expositors say that this in both instances is the comparatio decurtata,
as in [Psa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001) and elsewhere: as an
incense-offering, as an evening mincha. But the poet purposely omits the
כּ of the comparison. He wishes that God may be pleased to regard his
prayer as sweet-smelling smoke or as incense, just as this was added to
the azcara of the meal-offering, and gave it, in its ascending perfume,
the direction upward to God,

(Note: It is not the priestly קטרת תּמיד, i.e., the daily morning and
evening incense-offering upon the golden altar of the holy place, [Exo
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#008), that is meant (since it is a
non-priest who is speaking, according to Hitzig, of course John
Hyrcanus), but rather, as also in [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013), the incense of the azcara of the
meal-offering which the priest burnt (הקטיר) upon the altar; the incense
([Isa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003)) was entirely consumed, and
not merely a handful taken from it.)

and that He may be pleased to regard the lifting up of his hands (משׂאת,
the construct with the reduplication given up, from משּׂאת, or even,
after the form מתּנת, from משּׂאה, here not oblatio, but according to
the phrase נשׂא כפּים ידים, elevatio, [Jdg
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#038), [Jdg
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#040), cf. [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002), and frequently) as an evening
mincha, just as it was added to the evening tamı̂d according to [Exo
29:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038), and concluded the work of
the service of the day.

(Note: The reason of it is this, that the evening mincha is oftener
mentioned than the morning mincha (see, however, [Kg2
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#020)). The whole burnt-offering of the
morning and the meat-offering of the evening ([Kg2
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015); [Kg1
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#029), [Kg1
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#036)) are the beginning and close of
the daily principal service; whence, according to the example of the
usus loquendi in [Dan 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021); [Ezr
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#004)., later on mincha directly
signifies the afternoon or evening.)

[Psalms 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 141:3</span></span>

The prayer now begins to be particularized, and that in the first
instance as a petition fore the grace of silence, calling to mind old
Davidic passages like [Psa 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002); [Psa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014). The situation of David, the
betrayed one, requires caution in speaking; and the consciousness of
having sinned, not indeed against the rebels, but against God, who would
not visit him thus without his deserving it, stood in the way of any
outspoken self-vindication. In pone custodiam ori meo שׁמרה is ἅπ. λεγ.,
after the infinitive form דּבקה, עזבה, עצמה. In [Psa
141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003) דּל is ἅπ. λεγ. for דּלת; cf.
"doors of the mouth" in [Mic 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#005), and
πύλαι στόματος in Euripides. נצּרה might be imper. Kal: keep I pray,
with Dag. dirimens as in [Pro 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#013).
But נצר על is not in use; and also as the parallel word to שׁמרה, which
likewise has the appearance of being imperative, נצּרה is explicable as
regards its pointing by a comparison of יקּהה in [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010), דּבּרה in [Deu
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003), and קרבה in [Psa
73:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#028). The prayer for the grace of
silence is followed in [Psa 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004) by a
prayer for the breaking off of all fellowship with the existing rulers.
By a flight of irony they are called אישׁים, lords, in the sense of בּני
אישׁ, [Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003) (cf. the Spanish
hidalgos = hijos d'algo, sons of somebody). The evil thing (רע

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

דּבר, with Pasek between the two ר, as in [Num
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#013); [Deu
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001) between the two מ, and in [Ch1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#003) between the two )ל, to which
Jahve may be pleased never to incline his heart (תּט, fut. apoc. Hiph.
as in [Psa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009)), is forthwith more
particularly designated: perpetrare facinora maligne cum dominis, etc.
עללות of great achievements in the sense of infamous deeds, also occurs
in [Psa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001); [Psa
99:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#008). Here, however, we have the
Hithpo. התעלל, which, with the accusative of the object עללות,
signifies: wilfully to make such actions the object of one's acting (cf.
Arab. ta‛allala b-'l-š', to meddle with any matter, to amuse, entertain
one's self with a thing). The expression is made to express disgust as
strongly as possible; this poet is fond of glaring colouring in his
language. In the dependent passage neve eorum vescar cupediis, לחם is
used poetically for אכל, and בּ is the partitive Beth, as in [Job
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#025). מנעמּים is another
hapaxlegomenon, but as being a designation of dainties (from נעם, to be
mild, tender, pleasant), it may not have been an unusual word. It is a
well-known thing that usurpers revel in the cuisine and cellars of those
whom they have driven away.

[Psalms 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 141:5</span></span>

Thus far the Psalm is comparatively easy of exposition; but now it
becomes difficult, yet not hopelessly so. David, thoroughly conscious of
his sins against God and of his imperfection as a monarch, says, in
opposition to the abuse which he is now suffering, that he would gladly
accept any friendly reproof: "let a righteous man smite in kindness and
reprove me - head-oil (i.e., oil upon the head, to which such reproof is
likened) shall my head not refuse." So we render it, following the
accents, and not as Hupfeld, Kurtz, and Hitzig do: "if a righteous man
smites me, it is love; if he reproves me, an anointing of the head is it
unto me;" in connection with which the designation of the subject with
היא would be twice wanting, which is more than is admissible. צדּיק
stands here as an abstract substantive: the righteous man, whoever he
may be, in antithesis, namely, to the rebels and to the people who have
joined them. Amyraldus, Maurer, and Hengstenberg understand it of God;
but it only occurs of God as an attribute, and never as a direct
appellation. חסד, as in [Jer 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003), is
equivalent to בּחסד, cum benignitate = benigne. What is meant is, as in
[Job 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014), what Paul ([Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)) styles πνεῦμα πραΰ́τητος. and הלם,
tundere, is used of the strokes of earnest but well-meant reproof, which
is called "the blows of a friend" in [Pro
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006). Such reproof shall be to him as
head-oil ([Psa 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005); [Psa
133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002)), which his head does not
despise. יני, written defectively for יניא, like ישּׁי, in [Psa
55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016), אבי, [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029) and frequently; הניא (root נא,
Arab. n', with the nasal n, which also expresses the negation in the
Indo-Germanic languages) here signifies to deny, as in [Psa
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#010) to bring to nought, to destroy.
On the other hand, the lxx renders μὴ λιπανάτω τὴν κεφαλήν μου, which is
also followed by the Syriac and Jerome, perhaps after the Arabic nawiya,
to become or to be fat, which is, however, altogether foreign to the
Aramaic, and is, moreover, only used of fatness of the body, and in fact
of camels. The meaning of the figure is this: well-meant reproof shall
be acceptable and spiritually useful to him. The confirmation כּי־עוד
וגו follows, which is enigmatical both in meaning and expression. This
עוד is the cipher of a whole clause, and the following ו is related to
this עוד as the Waw that introduces the apodosis, not to כּי as in [Ch2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020), since no progression and
connection is discernible if כי is taken as a subordinating quia. We
interpret thus: for it is still so (the matter still stands thus), that
my prayer is against their wickednesses; i.e., that I use no weapon but
that of prayer against these, therefore let me always be in that
spiritual state of mind which is alive to well-meant reproof.
Mendelssohn's rendering is similar: I still pray, whilst they practise
infamy. On עוד ו cf. [Zac 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020) עוד
אשׁר (vid., Khler), and [Pro 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#027) אחר
ו. He who has prayed God in [Psa 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003)
to set a watch upon his mouth is dumb in the presence of those who now
have dominion, and seeks to keep himself clear of their sinful doings,
whereas he willingly allows himself to be chastened by the righteous;
and the more silent he is towards the world (see [Amo
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013)), the more constant is he in his
intercourse with God. But there will come a time when those who now
behave as lords shall fall a prey to the revenge of the people who have
been misled by them; and on the other hand, the confession of the
salvation, and of the order of the salvation, of God, that has hitherto
been put to silence, will again be able to make itself freely heard, and
find a ready hearing.

As [Psa 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006) says, the new rulers
fall a prey to the indignation of the people and are thrown down the
precipices, whilst the people, having again come to their right mind,
obey the words of David and find them pleasant and beneficial (vid.,
[Pro 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#026); [Pro
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024)). נשׁמטוּ is to be explained
according to [Kg2 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#033). The casting of
persons down from the rock was not an unusual mode of execution ([Ch2
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#012)). ידי־סלע are the sides ([Psa
140:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#006); [Jdg
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#026)) of the rock, after which the
expression ἐχόμενα πέτρας of the lxx, which has been misunderstood by
Jerome, is intended to be understood;

(Note: Beda Pieringer in his Psalterium Romana Lyra Radditum (Ratisbonae
1859) interprets κατεπόθησαν ἐχόμενα πέτρας οἱ κραταιοὶ τὐτῶν, absorpti,
i.e., operti sunt loco ad petram pertinente signiferi turpis consilii
eorum.)

they are therefore the sides of the rock conceived of as it were as the
hands of the body of rock, if we are not rather with Bttcher to compare
the expressions בּידי and על־ידי construed with verbs of abandoning and
casting down, [Lam 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014); [Job
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#011), and frequently. In [Psa
141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007) there follows a further
statement of the issue on the side of David and his followers: instar
findentis et secantis terram (בּקע with Beth, elsewhere in the hostile
signification of irrumpere) dispersa sunt ossa nostra ad ostium (לפי as
in [Pro 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#003)) orci; Symmachus: ὥσπερ
γεωργὸς ὅταν ῥήσσῃ τὴν τὴν, οὕτως ἐσκορπίσθη τὰ ὀστᾶ ἡμῶν εἰς στόμα
ᾅδου; Quinta: ὡς καλλιεργῶν καὶ σκάπτων ἐν τῇ γῇ κ. τ. λ. Assuming the
very extreme, it is a look of hope into the future: should his bones and
the bones of his followers be even scattered about the mouth of Shel
(cf. the Syrian picture of Shel: "the dust upon its threshold
‛al-escûfteh," Deutsche Morgenlnd. Zeitschrift, xx. 513), their soul
below, their bones above - it would nevertheless be only as when on in
ploughing cleaves the earth; i.e., they do not lie there in order that
they may continue lying, but that they may rise up anew, as the seed
that is sown sprouts up out of the upturned earth. lxx Codd. Vat. et
Sinait. τὰ ὀστᾶ ἡμῶν, beside which, however, is found the reading αὐτῶν
(Cod. Alex. by a second hand, and the Syriac, Arabic, and Aethiopic
versions), as Bttcher also, pro ineptissimo utcunque, thinks עצמינו must
be read, understanding this, according to [Ch2
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#012) extrem., of the mangled bodies
of those cast down from the rock. We here discern the hope of a
resurrection, if not directly, at least (cf. Oehler in Herzog's
Real-Encyclopdie, concluding volume, S. 422) as am emblem of victory in
spite of having succumbed. That which authorizes this interpretation
lies in the figure of the husbandman, and in the conditional clause
([Psa 141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008)), which leads to the true
point of the comparison; for as a complaint concerning a defeat that had
been suffered: "so are our bones scattered for the mouth of the grave
(in order to be swallowed up by it)," [Psa
141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007), would be alien and isolated
with respect to what precedes and what follows.

[Psalms 141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 141:8</span></span>

If [Psa 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007) is not merely an
expression of the complaint, but at the same time of hope, we now have
no need to give the כּי the adversative sense of imo, but we may leave
it its most natural confirmatory signification namque. From this point
the Psalm gradually dies away in strains comparatively easy to be
understood and in perfect keeping with the situation. In connection with
[Psa 141:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#008) one is reminded of [Psa
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015); [Psa
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002); with [Psa
141:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#009)., of [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016); [Psa
69:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023), and other passages. In "pour
not out (תּער with sharpened vowel instead of תּער, Ges. ֗75, rem. 8) my
soul," ערה, Piel, is equivalent to the Hiph. הערה in [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012). ידי פח are as it were the hands
of the seizing and capturing snare; and יקשׂוּ לּי is virtually a
genitive: qui insidias tendunt mihi, since one cannot say יקשׁ פח,
ponere laqueum. מכמרים, nets, in [Psa
141:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#010) is another hapaxlegomenon; the
enallage numeri is as in [Psa 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005);
[Isa 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#008); [Isa
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023), - the singular that slips in
refers what is said of the many to each individual in particular. The
plural מקשׁות for מקשׁים, [Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006);
[Psa 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006), also occurs only here. יחד
is to be explained as in 4:9: it is intended to express the coincidence
of the overthrow of the enemies and the going forth free of the
persecuted one. With יחד אנכי the poet gives prominence to his
simultaneous, distinct destiny: simul ego dum (עד as in [Job
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021), cf. [Job
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#018)) praetereo h.e. evado. The
inverted position of the כּי in [Psa
18:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010) may be compared; with [Psa
120:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#007) and [Kg2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#014), however (where instead of
אף־הוּא it is with Thenius to be read אפוא), the case is different.
