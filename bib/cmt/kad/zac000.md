Zechariah

Introduction

The Prophet. - Zechariah, זכריה - i.e., not μνήμη Κυρίου, memoria
Domini, remembrance of God (Jerome and others), nor God's renown (Frst),
but he whom God remembers (lxx Ζαχαρίας, Vulg. Zacharias) - is a name of
frequent occurrence in the Old Testament. Our prophet, like Jeremiah and
Ezekiel, was of priestly descent, - a son of Berechiah, and grandson of
Iddo ([Zac 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md), [Zac
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007).md), the chief of one of the priestly
families, that returned from exile along with Zerubbabel and Joshua
([Neh 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#004).md). He followed his
grandfather in that office under the high priest Jehoiakim ([Neh
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#016).md), from which it has been justly
concluded that he returned from Babylon while still a youth, and that
his father died young. This also probably serves to explain the fact
that Zechariah is called bar 'Iddo', the son (grandson) of Iddo, in [Ezr
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md) and [Ezr
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014.md), and that his father is passed
over. He commenced his prophetic labours in the second year of Darius
Hystaspes, only two months later than his contemporary Haggai, in common
with whom he sought to stimulate the building of the temple ([Ezr
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md); [Ezr
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014).md), and that while he was still of
youthful age, as we may infer partly from the facts quoted above, and
partly from the epithet הנּער הלּז (the young man) in [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008) (4.md), which refers to him. On the
other hand, the legends handed down by the fathers, which are at
variance with the biblical accounts, to the effect that Zechariah
returned from Chaldaea at an advanced age, that he had previously
predicted to Jozadak the birth of his son Joshua, and to Shealtiel the
birth of Zerubbabel, and had shown to Cyrus his victory over Croesus and
Astyages by means of a miracle (Ps. Dor., Ps. Epiph., Hesych., and
others), are not worth noticing. It is impossible to determine how long
his prophetic labours lasted. We simply know from [Zac
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md), that in the fourth year of Darius
he announced a further revelation from God to the people, and that his
last two oracles (ch. 9-14) fall within a still later period. All that
the fathers are able to state with regard to the closing portion of his
life is, that he died at an advanced age, and was buried near to Haggai;
whilst the contradictory statement, in a Cod. of Epiph., to the effect
that he was slain under Joash king of Judah, between the temple and the
altar, has simply arisen from our prophet being confounded with the
Zechariah mentioned in [Ch2 24:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md).

2\. The Book of Zechariah contains, besides the brief word of God, which
introduces his prophetic labours ([Zac
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001).md), four longer prophetic
announcements: viz., (1) a series of seven visions, which Zechariah saw
during the night, on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, in the
second year of Darius (Zechariah 1:7-6:8), together with a symbolical
transaction, which brought the visions to a close ([Zac
6:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#009)); (2.md) the communication to the
people of the answer of the Lord to a question addressed to the priests
and prophets by certain Judaeans as to their continuing any longer to
keep the day appointed for commemorating the burning of the temple and
Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans as a fast-day, which took place in the
fourth year of Darius ([Zac 7:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md) and
8); (3) a burden, i.e., a prophecy of threatening import, concerning the
land of Hadrach, the seat of the ungodly world-power (ch. 9-11); and (4)
a burden concerning Israel (ch. 12-14). The last two oracles, which are
connected together by the common epithet massȧ', are distinguished from
the first two announcements not only by the fact that the headings
contain neither notices as to the time, nor the prophet's name, but also
by the absence of express allusions to the circumstances of Zechariah's
own times, however unmistakeably the circumstances of the covenant
nation after the captivity form the historical background of these
prophecies also; whilst there is in general such a connection between
their contents and the prophetic character of the night-visions, that
ch. 9-14 might be called a prophetic description of the future of the
kingdom of God, in its conflict with the kingdoms of the world, as seen
in the night-visions. For example, in the night-visions, as a sequel to
Haggai, who had predicted two months before the overthrow of the might
of all the kingdoms of the world and the preservation of Zerubbabel in
the midst of that catastrophe ([Hag
2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020).md), the future development of
the kingdom of God is unfolded to the prophet in its principal features
till its final completion in glory. The first vision shows that the
shaking of the kingdoms of the world predicted by Haggai will soon
occur, notwithstanding the fact that the whole earth is for the time
still quiet and at rest, and that Zion will be redeemed from its
oppression, and richly blessed ([Zac
1:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007).md). The realization of this
promise is explained in the following visions: in the second ([Zac
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001).md), the breaking in pieces of the
kingdoms of the world, by the four smiths who threw down the horns of
the nations; in the third ([Zac
2:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005).md), the spread of the kingdom of
God over the whole earth, through the coming of the Lord to His people;
in the fourth ([Zac 3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001).md), the
restoration of the church to favour, through the wiping away of its
sins; in the fifth ([Zac 4:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001).md), the
glorifying of the church through the communication of the gifts of the
Spirit; in the sixth ([Zac 5:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001).md),
the sifting out of sinners from the kingdom of God; in the seventh ([Zac
6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001).md), the judgment, through which
God refines and renews the sinful world; and lastly, in the symbolical
transaction which closes the visions ([Zac
6:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#009).md), the completion of the kingdom
of God by the Sprout of the Lord, who combines in His own person the
dignity of both priest and king. If we compare with these the last two
oracles, in ch. 9-11 we have first of all a picture of the judgment upon
the kingdoms of the world, and of the establishment of the Messianic
kingdom, through the gathering together of the scattered members of the
covenant nation, and their exaltation to victory over the heathen (ch.
9, [Zac 10:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001).md), and secondly, a more
minute description of the attitude of the Lord towards the covenant
nation and the heathen world (ch. 11); and in ch. 12-14 we have an
announcement of the conflict of the nations of the world with Jerusalem,
of the conversion of Israel to the Messiah, whom it once rejected and
put to death ([Zac 12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md), [Zac
13:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001).md); and lastly, of the final
attack of the heathen world upon the city of God, with its consequences,
- namely, the purification and transfiguration of Jerusalem into a holy
dwelling-place of the Lord, as King over the whole earth (ch. 14); so
that in both oracles the development of the Old Testament kingdom of God
is predicted until its completion in the kingdom of God, which embraces
the whole earth. The revelation from God, which stands between these two
principal parts, concerning the continuance of the fast-days ([Zac
7:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001), 8.md), does indeed divide the two
from one another, both chronologically and externally; but substantially
it forms the connecting link between the two, inasmuch as this word of
God impresses upon the people the condition upon which the attainment of
the glorious future set before them in the night-visions depends, and
thereby prepares them for the conflicts which Israel will have to
sustain according to the announcement in ch. 9-14, until the completion
of the kingdom of God in glory.

Thus all the parts of the book hang closely together; and the objection
which modern critics have offered to the unity of the book has arisen,
not from the nature of the last two longer oracles (ch. 9-14), but
partly from the dogmatic assumption of the rationalistic and
naturalistic critics, that the biblical prophecies are nothing more than
the productions of natural divination, and partly from the inability of
critics, in consequence of this assumption, to penetrate into the depths
of the divine revelation, and to grasp either the substance or form of
their historical development, so as to appreciate it fully.

(Note: For the history of these attacks upon the genuineness of the last
part of Zechariah, and of the vindication of its genuineness, with the
arguments pro and con, see my Lehrbuch der Einleitung, 103, and
Koehler's Zechariah, ii. p. 297ff.)

The current opinion of these critics, that the chapters in question date
from the time before the captivity - viz. ch. 9-11 from a contemporary
of Isaiah, and ch. 12-14 from the last period before the destruction of
the kingdom of Judah - is completely overthrown by the circumstance,
that even in these oracles the condition of the covenant nation after
the captivity forms the historical ground and starting-point for the
proclamation and picture of the future development of the kingdom of
God. The covenant nation in its two parts, into which it had been
divided since the severance of the kingdom at the death of Solomon, had
been dispersed among the heathen like a flock without a shepherd ([Zac
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002).md). It is true that Judah had
already partially returned to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah; but the
daughter Zion had still "prisoners of hope" waiting for release ([Zac
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md), compared with [Zac
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010).md), and the house of Joseph or
Ephraim was still to be gathered and saved ([Zac
10:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006).md). Moreover, the severance of
Judah and Ephraim, which lasted till the destruction of both kingdoms,
had ceased. The eye of Jehovah is now fixed upon all the tribes of
Israel ([Zac 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001).md); Judah and Ephraim
are strengthened by God for a common victorious conflict with the sons
of Javan ([Zac 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013).md); the Lord their
God grants salvation to His people as a flock ([Zac
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#016.md) compared with [Zac
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013).md); the shepherd of the Lord feeds
them both as a single flock, and only abolishes the brotherhood between
Judah and Israel by the breaking of his second staff ([Zac
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#014).md). Hence the jealousy between
Judah and Ephraim, the cessation of which was expected in the future by
the prophets before the captivity (cf. [Isa
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013.md); [Hos
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002.md); [Eze
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015)..md), is extinct; and all that
remains of the severance into two kingdoms is the epithet house of Judah
or house of Israel, which Zechariah uses not only in ch. 9-11, but also
in the appeal in [Zac 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013.md), which no
critic has called in question. All the tribes form one nation, which
dwells in the presence of the prophet in Jerusalem and Judah. Just as in
the first part of our book Israel consists of Judah and Jerusalem ([Zac
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019.md), cf. [Zac
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012).md), so in the second part the
burden pronounced upon Israel ([Zac
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001).md) falls upon Jerusalem and Judah
([Zac 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md), [Zac
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#005.md)., [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md), [Zac
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#014).md); and just as, according to the
night-visions, the imperial power has its seat in the land of the north
and of the south ([Zac 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006).md), so in the
last oracles Asshur (the north land) and Egypt (the south land) are
types of the heathen world ([Zac
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010).md). And when at length the empire
of the world which is hostile to God is more precisely defined, it is
called Javan, - an epithet taken from [Dan
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021.md), which points as clearly as
possible to the times after the captivity, inasmuch as the sons of Javan
never appear as enemies of the covenant nation before the captivity,
even when the Tyrians and Philistines are threatened with divine
retribution for having sold to the Javanites the prisoners of Judah and
Jerusalem ([Joe 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006).md).

On the other hand, the differences which prevail between the first two
prophecies of Zechariah and the last two are not of such a character as
to point to two or three different prophets. It is true that in ch. 9-14
there occur no visions, no angels taking an active part, no Satan, no
seven eyes of God; but Amos also, for example, has only visions in the
second part, and none in the first; whilst the first part of Zechariah
contains not only visions, but also, in [Zac
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md), [Zac
7:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md) and 8, simple prophetic
addresses, and symbolical actions not only in [Zac
6:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#009.md), but also in [Zac
11:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#004.md). The angels and Satan, which
appear in the visions, are also absent from [Zac
7:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md) and 8; whereas the angel of
Jehovah is mentioned in the last part in [Zac
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008.md), and the saints in [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md) are angels. The seven eyes of God
are only mentioned in two visions ([Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md) and [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010).md); and the providence of God is
referred to in [Zac 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md), [Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md), under the epithet of the eye of
Jehovah. This also applies to the form of description and the language
employed in the two parts. The visionary sights are described in simple
prose, as the style most appropriate for such descriptions. The
prophecies in word are oratorical, and to some extent are rich in gold
figures and similes. This diversity in the prophetic modes of
presentation was occasioned by the occurrence of peculiar facts and
ideas, with the corresponding expressions and words; but it cannot be
proved that there is any constant diversity in the way in which the same
thing or the same idea is described in the two parts, whereas there are
certain unusual expressions, such as מעבר וּמשּׁב (in [Zac
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md) and [Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008).md) and העביר in the sense of
removere (in [Zac 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#004.md) and [Zac
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002).md), which are common to both parts.
Again, the absence of any notice as to the time in the headings in [Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md) and [Zac
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md) may be explained very simply from
the fact, that these prophecies of the future of the kingdom are not so
directly associated with the prophet's own time as the visions are, the
first of which describes the condition of the world in the second year
of Darius. The omission of the name of the author from the headings no
more disproves the authorship of the Zechariah who lived after the
captivity, than the omission of the name from [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md); [Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md); [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md), disproves Isaiah's authorship in
the case of the chapters named. All the other arguments that have been
brought against the integrity or unity of authorship of the entire book,
are founded upon false interpretations and misunderstandings; whereas,
on the other hand, the integrity of the whole is placed beyond the reach
of doubt by the testimony of tradition, which is to be regarded as of
all the greater value in the case of Zechariah, inasmuch as the
collection of the prophetic writings, if not of the whole of the Old
Testament canon, was completed within even less than a generation after
the prophet's death.

Zechariah's mode of prophesying presents, therefore, according to the
cursory survey just given, a very great variety. Nevertheless, the
crowding together of visions is not to be placed to the account of the
times after the captivity; nor can any foreign, particularly Babylonian,
colouring be detected in the visions or in the prophetic descriptions.
The habit of leaning upon the prophecies of predecessors is not greater
in his case than in that of many of the prophets before the captivity.
The prophetic addresses are to some extent rich in repetitions,
especially in [Zac 7:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md) and 8, and
tolerably uniform; but in the last two oracles they rise into very bold
and most original views and figures, which are evidently the production
of a lively and youthful imagination. This abundance of very unusual
figures, connected with much harshness of expression and transitions
without intermediate links, makes the work of exposition a very
difficult one; so that Jerome and the rabbins raise very general, but
still greatly exaggerated, lamentations over the obscurity of this
prophet. The diction is, on the whole, free from Chaldaisms, and formed
upon the model of good earlier writers. For the proofs of this, as well
as for the exegetical literature, see my Lehrbuch der Einleitung, p.
310ff.
