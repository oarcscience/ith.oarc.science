Easter Festival Salutation and Discourse

Ps 80, which looks back into the time of the leading forth out of Egypt,
is followed by another with the very same Asaphic thoroughly
characteristic feature of a retrospective glance at Israel's early
history (cf. More particularly [Psa
81:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011.md) with [Psa
80:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009).md). In Psalms 81 the lyric element
of Ps 77 is combined with the didactic element of Ps 78. The unity of
these Psalms is indubitable. All three have towards the close the
appearance of being fragmentary. Fro the author delights to ascend to
the height of his subject and to go down into the depth of it, without
returning to the point from which he started. In Ps 77 Israel as a whole
was called "the sons of Jacob and Joseph;" in Ps 78 we read "the sons of
Ephraim" instead of the whole nation; here it is briefly called
"Joseph." This also indicates the one author. Then Psalms 81, exactly
like [Psa 79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md), is based upon the
Pentateuchal history in Exodus and Deuteronomy. Jahve Himself speaks
through the mouth of the poet, as He did once through the mouth of Moses
- Asaph is κατ ̓ ἐξοχήν the prophet (חזה) among the psalmists. The
transition from one form of speech to another which accompanies the
rapid alternation of feelings, what the Arabs call talwı̂n el-chitab, "a
colouring of a speech by a change of the persons," is also
characteristic of him, as later on of Micah (e.g., [Mic
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#015)..md).

This Psalms 81 is according to ancient custom the Jewish New Year's
Psalm, the Psalm of the Feast of Trumpets ([Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001).md), therefore the Psalm of the
first (and second) of Tishri; it is, however, a question whether the
blowing of the horn (shophar) at the new moon, which it calls upon them
to do, does not rather apply to the first of Nisan, to the
ecclesiastical New Year. In the weekly liturgy of the Temple it was the
Psalm for the Thursday.

The poet calls upon them to give a jubilant welcome to the approaching
festive season, and in [Psa 81:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#007.md).
Jahve Himself makes Himself heard as the Preacher of the festival. He
reminds those now living of His loving-kindness towards ancient Israel,
and admonishes them not to incur the guilt of like unfaithfulness, in
order that they may not lose the like tokens of His loving-kindness.
What festive season is it? Either the Feast of the Passover or the Feast
of Tabernacles; for it must be one of these two feasts which begin on
the day of the full moon. Because it is one having reference to the
redemption of Israel out of Egypt, the Targum, Talmud (more particularly
Rosh ha-Shana, where this Psalm is much discussed), Midrash, and Sohar
understand the Feast of Tabernacles; because [Psa
81:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#002.md) seem to refer to the new moon
of the seventh month, which is celebrated before the other new moons
([Num 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010).md), as יום התּרוּעה ([Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md), cf. [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024).md), i.e., to the first of Tishri,
the civil New Year; and the blowing of horns at the New Year, is,
certainly not according to Scripture, but yet according to tradition
(vid., Maimonides, Hilchoth Shophar [Psa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002).md), a very ancient arrangement.
Nevertheless we must give up this reference of the Psalm to the first of
Tishri and to the Feast of Tabernacles, which begins with the fifteenth
of Tishri: - (1) Because between the high feast-day of the first of
Tishri and the Feast of Tabernacles on the fifteenth to the twenty-first
(twenty-second) of Tishri lies the great day of Atonement on the tenth
of Tishri, which would be ignored, by greeting the festive season with a
joyful noise from the first of Tishri forthwith to the fifteenth. (2)
Because the remembrance of the redemption of Israel clings far more
characteristically to the Feast of the Passover than to the Feast of
Tabernacles. This latter appears in the oldest law-giving ([Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md); [Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022).md) as חג האסיף, i.e., as a feast
of the ingathering of the autumn fruits, and therefore as the closing
festival of the whole harvest; it does not receive the historical
reference to the journey through the desert, and therewith its character
of a feast of booths or arbours, until the addition in [Lev
23:39-44](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md), having reference to the
carrying out of the celebration of the feasts in Canaan; whereas the
feast which begins with the full moon of Nisan has, it is true, not been
entirely free of all reference to agriculture, but from the very
beginning bears the historical names פּסח and חג המּצּות. (3) Because in
the Psalm itself, viz., in [Psa 81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006.md),
allusion is made to the fact which the Passover commemorates.

Concerning על־הגּתּית vid., on [Psa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001.md). The symmetrical, stichic plan of
the Psalm is clear: the schema is 11. 12. 12.

[Psalms 81:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 81:1</span></span>

The summons in [Psa 81:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#002.md) is addressed
to the whole congregation, inasmuch as הריעוּ is not intended of the
clanging of the trumpets, but as in [Ezr
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011.md), and frequently. The summons in
[Psa 81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003.md) is addressed to the Levites,
the appointed singers and musicians in connection with the divine
services, [Ch2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md), and frequently.
The summons in [Psa 81:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004.md) is addressed
to the priests, to whom was committed not only the blowing of the two
(later on a hundred and twenty, vid., [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012).md) silver trumpets, but who appear
also in [Jos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004.md) and elsewhere (cf.
[Psa 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#006.md) with [Ch2
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#028).md) as the blowers of the shophar.
The Talmud observes that since the destruction of the Temple the names
of instruments שׁופרא and חצוצרתּא are wont to be confounded one for the
other (B. Sabbath 36a, Succa 34a), and, itself confounding them, infers
from [Num 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md) the duty and
significance of the blowing of the shophar (B. Erachin 3b). The lxx also
renders both by σάλπιγξ; but the Biblical language mentions שׁופר and
חצצרה, a horn (more especially a ram's horn) and a (metal) trumpet, side
by side in [Psa 98:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#006.md); [Ch1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#028.md), and is therefore conscious of a
difference between them. The Tפra says nothing of the employment of the
shophar in connection with divine service, except that the commencement
of every fiftieth year, which on this very account is called שׁנת היּבל,
annus buccinae, is to be made known by the horn signal throughout all
the land ([Lev 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009).md). But just as
tradition by means of an inference from analogy derives the blowing of
the shophar on the first of Tishri, the beginning of the common year,
from this precept, so on the ground of the passage of the Psalm before
us, assuming that בּחרשׁ, lxx ἐν νεομηνίᾳ, refers not to the first of
Tishri but to the first of Nisan, we may suppose that the beginning of
every month, but, in particular, the beginning of the month which was at
the same time the beginning of the ecclesiastical year, was celebrated
by a blowing of the shophar, as, according to Josephus, Bell. iv. 9, 12,
the beginning and close of the Sabbath was announced from the top of the
Temple by a priest with the salpinx. The poet means to say that the
Feast of the Passover is to be saluted by the congregation with shouts
of joy, by the Levites with music, and even beginning from the new moon
(neomenia) of the Passover month with blowing of shophars, and that this
is to be continued at the Feast of the Passover itself. The Feast of the
Passover, for which Hupfeld devises a gloomy physiognomy,

(Note: In the first of his Commentationes de primitiva et vera festorum
apud Hebraeos ratione, 1851, 4to.)

was a joyous festival, the Old Testament Christmas. [Ch2
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#021.md) testifies to the exultation of
the people and the boisterous music of the Levite priests, with which it
was celebrated. According to [Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md), the trumpeting of the priests
was connected with the sacrifices; and that the slaying of the paschal
lambs took place amidst the Tantaratan of the priests (long-drawn notes
interspersed with sharp shrill ones, תקיעה תרועה וקיעה), is expressly
related of the post-exilic service at least.

(Note: Vid., my essay on the Passover rites during the time of the
second Temple in the Luther. Zeitschr. 1855; and cf. Armknecht, Die
heilige Psalmidoe (1855), S. 5.)

The phrase נתן תּף proceeds from the phrase נתן קול, according to which
נתן directly means: to attune, strike up, cause to be heard. Concerning
כּסה ([Pro 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#020) כּסא.md) tradition is
uncertain. The Talmudic interpretation (B. Rosh ha-Shana 8b, Betza 16a,
and the Targum which is taken from it), according to which it is the day
of the new moon (the first of the month), on which the moon hides
itself, i.e., is not to be seen at all in the morning, and in the
evening only for a short time immediately after sunset, and the
interpretation that is adopted by a still more imposing array of
authorities (lxx, Vulgate, Menahem, Rashi, Jacob Tam, Aben-Ezra,
Parchon, and others), according to which a time fixed by computation
(from כּסה = כּסס, computare) is so named in general, are outweighed by
the usage of the Syriac, in which Keso denotes the full moon as the moon
with covered, i.e., filled-up orb, and therefore the fifteenth of the
month, but also the time from that point onwards, perhaps because then
the moon covers itself, inasmuch as its shining surface appears each day
less large (cf. the Peshto, [Kg1 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032.md)
of the fifteenth day of the eighth month, [Ch2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010.md) of the twenty-third day of the
seventh month, in both instances of the Feast of Tabernacles), after
which, too, in the passage before us it is rendered wa-b-kese, which a
Syro-Arabic glossary (in Rosenmller) explains festa quae sunt in medio
mensis. The Peshto here, like the Targum, proceeds from the reading
חגּינוּ, which, following the lxx and the best texts, is to be rejected
in comparison with the singular חגּנוּ. If, however, it is to be read
chgnw, and כּסה (according to Kimchi with Segol not merely in the second
syllable, but with double Segol כּסה, after the form טנא = טנא)
signifies not interlunium, but plenilunium (instead of which also Jerome
has in medio mense, and in [Pro 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#020.md),
in die plenae lunae, Aquila ἡμέρᾳ πανσελήνου), then what is meant is
either the Feast of Tabernacles, which is called absolutely החג in [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md) ([Ch2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#003).md) and elsewhere, or the Passover,
which is also so called in [Isa 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md)
and elsewhere. Here, as [Psa 81:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#005.md) will
convince us, the latter is intended, the Feast of unleavened bread, the
porch of which, so to speak, is ערב פּסח together with the ליל שׁמּרים
([Exo 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#042).md), the night from the
fourteenth to the fifteenth of Nisan. In [Psa
81:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#002.md), [Psa
81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003.md) they are called upon to give a
welcome to this feast. The blowing of the shophar is to announce the
commencement of the Passover month, and at the commencement of the
Passover day which opens the Feast of unleavened bread it is to be
renewed. The ל of ליום is not meant temporally, as perhaps in [Job
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#030.md) : at the day = on the day; for
why was it not ביום? It is rather: towards the day, but בכסה assumes
that the day has already arrived; it is the same Lamed as in [Psa
81:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#002.md), the blowing of the shophar is to
concern this feast-day, it is to sound in honour of it.

[Psalms 81:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 81:4</span></span>

[Psa 81:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004.md) now tell whence the feast
which is to be met with singing and music has acquired such a high
significance: it is a divine institution coming from the time of the
redemption by the hand of Moses. It is called חק as being a legally
sanctioned decree, משׁפּט as being a lawfully binding appointment, and
עדוּת as being a positive declaration of the divine will. The ל in
לישׂראל characterizes Israel as the receiver, in לאלהי the God of Israel
as the owner, i.e., Author and Lawgiver. By בּצעתו the establishing of
the statute is dated back to the time of the Exodus; but the statement
of the time of its being established, "when He went out over the land of
Egypt," cannot be understood of the exodus of the people out of Egypt,
natural as this may be here, where Israel has just been called יהוסף
(pathetic for יוסף), by a comparison with [Gen
41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045.md), where Joseph is spoken of in
the same words. For this expression does not describe the going forth
out of a country, perhaps in the sight of its inhabitants, [Num
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#003.md), cf. [Exo
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#008) (Hengstenberg.md), but the going out
over a country. Elohim is the subject, and צאת is to be understood
according to [Exo 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md) (Kimchi, De
Dieu, Dathe, Rosenmller, and others): when He went out for judgment over
the land of Egypt (cf. [Mic 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003).md). This
statement of the time of itself at once decides the reference of the
Psalm to the Passover, which commemorates the sparing of Israel at that
time ([Exo 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#027).md), and which was
instituted on that very night of judgment. The accentuation divides the
verse correctly. According to this, שׂפת לא־ידעתּי אשׁמע is not a
relative clause to מצרים: where I heard a language that I understood not
([Psa 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001).md). Certainly ידע שׂפה, "to
understand a language," is an expression that is in itself not
inadmissible (cf. ידע ספר, to understand writing, to be able to read,
[Isa 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011)..md), the selection of which
instead of the more customary phrase שׁמע לשׁון ([Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md); [Isa
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#019.md); [Jer
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015).md) might be easily intelligible
here beside אשׁמע; but the omission of the שׁם (אשׁר) is harsh, the
thought it here purposeless, and excluded with our way of taking בצאתו.
From the speech of God that follows it is evident that the clause is
intended to serve as an introduction of this divine speech, whether it
now be rendered sermonem quem non novi (cf. [Psa
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044), populus quem non novi.md), or
alicujus, quem non novi (Ges. 123, rem. 1), both of which are
admissible. It is not in some way an introduction to the following
speech of God as one which it has been suddenly given to the psalmist to
hear: "An unknown language, or the language of one unknown, do I hear?"
Thus Dderlein explains it: Subitanea et digna poetico impetu digressio,
cum vates sese divino adflatu subito perculsum sentit et oraculum audire
sibi persuadet; and in the same way De Wette, Olshausen, Hupfeld, and
others. But the oracle of God cannot appear so strange to the
Israelitish poet and seer as the spirit-voice to Eliphaz ([Job
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#016).md); and moreover אשׁמע after the
foregoing historical predicates has the presumption of the imperfect
signification in its favour. Thus, then, it will have to be interpreted
according to [Exo 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#002.md). It was the
language of a known, but still also unknown God, which Israel heard in
the redemption of that period. It was the God who had been made manifest
as יהוה only, so to speak, by way of prelude hitherto, who now appeared
at this juncture of the patriarchal history, which had been all along
kept in view, in the marvellous and new light of the judgment which was
executed upon Egypt, and of the protection, redemption, and election of
Israel, as being One hitherto unknown, as the history of salvation
actually then, having arrived at Sinai, receives an entirely new form,
inasmuch as from this time onwards the congregation or church is a
nation, and Jahve the King of a nation, and the bond of union between
them a national law educating it for the real, vital salvation that is
to come. The words of Jahve that follow are now not the words heard then
in the time of the Exodus. The remembrance of the words heard forms only
a transition to those that now make themselves heard. For when the poet
remembers the language which He who reveals Himself in a manner never
before seen and heard of spoke to His people at that time, the
Ever-living One Himself, who is yesterday and to-day the same One,
speaks in order to remind His people of what He was to them then, and of
what He spake to them then.

[Psalms 81:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 81:6</span></span>

It is a gentle but profoundly earnest festival discourse which God the
Redeemer addresses to His redeemed people. It begins, as one would
expect in a Passover speech, with a reference to the סבלות of Egypt
([Exo 1:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011.md); [Exo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#004.md); [Exo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006)..md), and to the duwd, the
task-basket for the transport of the clay and of the bricks ([Exo
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#014.md); [Exo
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#007)..md).

(Note: In the Papyrus Leydensis i. 346 the Israelites are called the
"Aperiu (עברים), who dragged along the stones for the great watch-tower
of the city of Rameses," and in the Pap. Leyd. i. 349, according to
Lauth, the "Aperiu, who dragged along the stones for the storehouse of
the city of Rameses.")

Out of such distress did He free the poor people who cried for
deliverance ([Exo 2:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023).md); He
answered them בּסתר רעם, i.e., not (according to [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md); [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002).md): affording them protection
against the storm, but (according to [Psa
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md); [Psa
77:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#017)..md): out of the thunder-clouds in
which He at the same time revealed and veiled Himself, casting down the
enemies of Israel with His lightnings, which is intended to refer
pre-eminently to the passage through the Red Sea (vid., [Psa
77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019).md); and He proved them (אבחנך,
with ŏ contracted from ō, cf. on [Job
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#006).md) at the waters of Merbah, viz.,
whether they would trust Him further on after such glorious tokens of
His power and loving-kindness. The name "Waters of Merı̂bah," which
properly is borne only by Merı̂bath Kadesh, the place of the giving of
water in the fortieth year ([Num
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013.md); [Num
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md); [Deu
32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051.md); [Deu
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008).md), is here transferred to the
place of the giving of water in the first year, which was named Massah
u-Merı̂bah ([Exo 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007).md), as the
remembrances of these two miracles, which took place under similar
circumstances, in general blend together (vid., on [Psa
95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008)..md). It is not now said that Israel
did not act in response to the expectation of God, who had son
wondrously verified Himself; the music, as Seal imports, here rises, and
makes a long and forcible pause in what is being said. What now follows
further, are, as the further progress of [Psa
81:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012.md) shows, the words of God
addressed to the Israel of the desert, which at the same time with its
faithfulness are brought to the remembrance of the Israel of the
present. העיד בּ, as in [Psa 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007.md);
[Deu 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#019.md), to bear testimony that
concerns him against any one. אם (according to the sense, o si, as in
[Psa 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007.md), which is in many ways akin
to this Psalm) properly opens a searching question which wishes that the
thing asked may come about (whether thou wilt indeed give me a willing
hearing?!). In [Psa 81:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#010.md) the key-note
of the revelation of the Law from Sinai is struck: the fundamental
command which opens the decalogue demanded fidelity to Jahve and forbade
idol-worship as the sin of sins. אל זר is an idol in opposition to the
God of Israel as the true God; and אל נכר, a strange god in opposition
to the true God as the God of Israel. To this one God Israel ought to
yield itself all the more undividedly and heartily as it was more
manifestly indebted entirely to Him, who in His condescension had chosen
it, and in His wonder-working might had redeemed it (המּעלך, part. Hiph.
with the eh elided, like הפּדך, [Deu
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md), and אכלך, from כּלּה, [Exo
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#003).md); and how easy this submission
ought to have been to it, since He desired nothing in return for the
rich abundance of His good gifts, which satisfy and quicken body and
soul, but only a wide-opened mouth, i.e., a believing longing, hungering
for mercy and eager for salvation ([Psa
119:131](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#131).md)!

[Psalms 81:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 81:11</span></span>

The Passover discourse now takes a sorrowful and awful turn: Israel's
disobedience and self-will frustrated the gracious purpose of the
commandments and promises of its God. "My people" and "Israel" alternate
as in the complaint in [Isa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003.md).
לא־אבה followed by the dative, as in [Deu
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009) (\[8\], ου ̓ συνθελήσεις αὐτῷ.md).
Then God made their sin their punishment, by giving them over judicially
(שׁלּח as in [Job 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004).md) into the
obduracy of their heart, which rudely shuts itself up against His mercy
(from שׁרר, Aramaic שׁרר, Arabic sarra, to make firm = to cheer, make
glad), so that they went on (cf. on the sequence of tense, [Psa
61:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#008).md) in their, i.e., their own,
egotistical, God-estranged determinations; the suffix is thus accented,
as e.g., in [Isa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002.md), cf. the
borrowed passage [Jer 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#024.md), and the
same phrase in [Mic 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md). And now,
because this state of unfaithfulness in comparison with God's
faithfulness has remained essentially the same even to to-day, the
exalted Orator of the festival passes over forthwith to the generation
of the present, and that, as is in accordance with the cheerful
character of the feast, in a charmingly alluring manner. Whether we take
לוּ in the signification of si (followed by the participle, as in [Sa2
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#012).md), or like אם above in [Psa
81:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#009.md) as expressing a wish, o si (if
but!), [Psa 81:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#015.md). at any rate have
the relation of the apodosis to it. From כּמעט (for a little, easily) it
may be conjectured that the relation of Israel at that time to the
nations did not correspond to the dignity of the nation of God which is
called to subdue and rule the world in the strength of God. השׁיב
signifies in this passage only to turn, not: to again lay upon. The
meaning is, that He would turn the hand which is now chastening His
people against those by whom He is chastening them (cf. on the usual
meaning of the phrase, [Isa 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025.md); [Amo
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008.md); [Jer
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009.md); [Eze
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#012).md). The promise in [Psa
81:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#016.md) relates to Israel and all the
members of the nation. The haters of Jahve would be compelled
reluctantly to submit themselves to Him, and their time would endure for
ever. "Time" is equivalent to duration, and in this instance with the
collateral notion of Prosperity, as elsewhere ([Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022).md) of the term of punishment. One
now expects that it should continue with ואאכילהוּ, in the tone of a
promise. The Psalm, however, closes with an historical statement. For
ויּאכילהו cannot signify et cibaret eum; it ought to be pronounced
ויאכילהו. The pointing, like the lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate, takes v. 17a
(cf. [Deu 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013)..md) as a retrospect, and
apparently rightly so. For even the Asaphic Ps 77 and 78 break off with
historical pictures. V. 17b is, accordingly, also to be taken as
retrospective. The words of the poet in conclusion once more change into
the words of God. The closing word runs אשׂבּיעך, as in [Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md), [Deu
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#031.md), and (with the exception of the
futt. Hiph. of Lamed He verbs ending with ekka) usually. The Babylonian
system of pointing nowhere recognises the suffix-form ekka. If the
Israel of the present would hearken to the Lawgiver of Sinai, says v.
17, then would He renew to it the miraculous gifts of the time of the
redemption under Moses.
