### [Genesis Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 19:1</span></span>

The messengers (angels) sent by Jehovah to Sodom, arrived there in the
evening, when Lot, who was sitting at the gate, pressed them to pass the
night in his house. The gate, generally an arched entrance with deep
recesses and seats on either side, was a place of meeting in the ancient
towns of the East, where the inhabitants assembled either for social
intercourse or to transact public business (vid., [Gen
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#020.md); [Deu
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#019.md); [Deu
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#015), etc..md). The two travellers,
however (for such Lot supposed them to be, and only recognised them as
angels when they had smitten the Sodomites miraculously with blindness),
said that they would spend the night in the street - בּרחוב the broad
open space within the gate - as they had been sent to inquire into the
state of the town. But they yielded to Lot's entreaty to enter his
house; for the deliverance of Lot, after having ascertained his state of
mind, formed part of their commission, and entering into his house might
only serve to manifest the sin of Sodom in all its heinousness. While
Lot was entertaining his guests with the greatest hospitality, the
people of Sodom gathered round his house, "both old and young, all
people from every quarter" (of the town, as in [Jer
51:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#031).md), and demanded, with the basest
violation of the sacred rite of hospitality and the most shameless
proclamation of their sin ([Isa 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009).md),
that the strangers should be brought out, that they might know them. ידע
is applied, as in [Jdg 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022.md), to the
carnal sin of paederastia, a crime very prevalent among the Canaanites
([Lev 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#022.md)., [Lev
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#023).md), and according to [Rom
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md), a curse of heathenism generally.

[Genesis 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 19:6</span></span>

Lot went out to them, shut the door behind him to protect his guests,
and offered to give his virgin daughters up to them. "Only to these men
(האל, an archaism for האלּה rof, occurs also in [Gen
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025.md); [Gen
26:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#003.md); [Lev
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#027.md), and [Deu
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#042.md); [Deu
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022.md); [Deu
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#011.md); and אל for אלּה in [Ch1
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#008).md) do nothing, for therefore (viz.,
to be protected from injury) have they come under the shadow of my
roof." In his anxiety, Lot was willing to sacrifice to the sanctity of
hospitality his duty as a father, which ought to have been still more
sacred, "and committed the sin of seeking to avert sin by sin." Even if
he expected that his daughters would suffer no harm, as they were
betrothed to Sodomites ([Gen 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014).md),
the offer was a grievous violation of his paternal duty. But this offer
only heightened the brutality of the mob. "Stand back" (make way, [Isa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020).md), they said; "the man, who came
as a foreigner, is always wanting to play the judge" (probably because
Lot had frequently reproved them for their licentious conduct, [Pe2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007.md), [Pe2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008).md): "not will we deal worse with
thee than with them." With these words they pressed upon him, and
approached the door to break it in. The men inside, that is to say, the
angels, then pulled Lot into the house, shut the door, and by miraculous
power smote the people without with blindness (סנורים here and [Kg2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#018.md) for mental blindness, in which
the eye sees, but does not see the right object), as a punishment for
their utter moral blindness, and an omen of the coming judgment.

[Genesis 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 19:12</span></span>

The sin of Sodom had now become manifest. The men, Lot's guests, made
themselves known to him as the messengers of judgment sent by Jehovah,
and ordered him to remove any one that belonged to him out of the city.
"Son-in-law (the singular without the article, because it is only
assumed as a possible circumstance that he may have sons-in-law), and
thy sons, and thy daughters, and all that belongs to thee" (sc., of
persons, not of things). Sons Lot does not appear to have had, as we
read nothing more about them, but only "sons-in-law (בנתיו לקחי) who
were about to take his daughters," as Josephus, the Vulgate, Ewald, and
many others correctly render it. The lxx, Targums, Knobel, and Delitzsch
adopt the rendering "who had taken his daughters," in proof of which the
last two adduce הנּמצאת in [Gen 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#015.md)
as decisive. But without reason; for this refers not to the daughters
who were still in the father's house, as distinguished form those who
were married, but to his wife and two daughters who were to be found
with him in the house, in distinction from the bridegrooms, who also
belonged to him, but were not yet living with him, and who had received
his summons in scorn, because in their carnal security they did not
believe in any judgment of God ([Luk
17:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#028).md). If Lot had had married
daughters, he would undoubtedly have called upon them to escape along
with their husbands, his sons-in-law.

[Genesis 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 19:15</span></span>

As soon as it was dawn, the angels urged Lot to hasten away with his
family; and when he still delayed, his heart evidently clinging to the
earthly home and possessions which he was obliged to leave, they laid
hold of him, with his wife and his two daughters, עליו יהוה בּחמלת, "by
virtue of the sparing mercy of Jehovah (which operated) upon him," and\_
led him out of the city.

[Genesis 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 19:17</span></span>

When they left him here (הנּיח, to let loose, and leave, to leave to
one's self), the Lord commanded him, for the sake of his life, not to
look behind him, and not to stand still in all the plain (כּכּר, [Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010).md), but to flee to the mountains
(afterwards called the mountains of Moab). In [Gen
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017.md) we are struck by the change from
the plural to the singular: "when they brought them forth, he said." To
think of one of the two angels - the one, for example, who led the
conversation - seems out of place, not only because Lot addressed him by
the name of God, "Adonai" ([Gen
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#018).md), but also because the speaker
attributed to himself the judgment upon the cities ([Gen
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#021.md), [Gen
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022).md), which is described in [Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md) as executed by Jehovah. Yet
there is nothing to indicate that Jehovah suddenly joined the angels.
The only supposition that remains, therefore, is that Lot recognised in
the two angels a manifestation of God, and so addressed them ([Gen
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#018)) as Adonai (my Lord.md), and that
the angel who spoke addressed him as the messenger of Jehovah in the
name of God, without its following from this, that Jehovah was present
in the two angels. Lot, instead of cheerfully obeying the commandment of
the Lord, appealed to the great mercy shown to him in the preservation
of his life, and to the impossibility of his escaping to the mountains,
without the evil overtaking him, and entreated therefore that he might
be allowed to take refuge in the small and neighbouring city, i.e., in
Bela, which received the name of Zoar ([Gen
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#002).md) on account of Lot's calling it
little. Zoar, the Σηγώρ of the lxx, and Segor of the crusaders, is
hardly to be sought for on the peninsula which projects a long way into
the southern half of the Dead Sea, in the Ghor of el Mezraa, as Irby and
Robinson (Pal. iii. p. 481) suppose; it is much more probably to be
found on the south-eastern point of the Dead Sea, in the Ghor of el
Szaphia, at the opening of the Wady el Ahsa (vid., v. Raumer, Pal. p.
273, Anm. 14).

[Genesis 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 19:23</span></span>

"When the sun had risen and Lot had come towards Zoar (i.e., was on the
way thither, but had not yet arrived), Jehovah caused it to rain
brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven, and overthrew those
cities, and the whole plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and
the produce of the earth." In the words "Jehovah caused it to rain from
Jehovah" there is no distinction implied between the hidden and the
manifested God, between the Jehovah present upon earth in His angels who
called down the judgment, and the Jehovah enthroned in heaven who sent
it down; but the expression "from Jehovah" is emphatica repetitio, quod
non usitato naturae ordine tunc Deus pluerit, sed tanquam exerta manu
palam fulminaverit praeter solitum morem: ut satis constaret nullis
causis naturalibus conflatam fuisse pluviam illam ex igne et sulphure
(Calvin). The rain of fire and brimstone was not a mere storm with
lightning, which set on fire the soil already overcharged with naphtha
and sulphur. The two passages, [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md) and [Eze
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022.md), cannot be adduced as proofs
that lightning is ever called fire and brimstone in the Scriptures, for
in both passages there is an allusion to the event recorded here. The
words are to be understood quite literally, as meaning that brimstone
and fire, i.e., burning brimstone, fell from the sky, even though the
examples of burning bituminous matter falling upon the earth which are
given in Oedmann's vermischte Sammlungen (iii. 120) may be called in
question by historical criticism. By this rain of fire and brimstone not
only were the cities and their inhabitants consumed, but even the soil,
which abounded in asphalt, was set on fire, so that the entire valley
was burned out and sank, or was overthrown (הפך) i.e., utterly
destroyed, and the Dead Sea took its place.

(Note: Whether the Dead Sea originated in this catastrophe, or whether
there was previously a lake, possibly a fresh water lake, at the north
of the valley of Siddim, which was enlarged to the dimensions of the
existing sea by the destruction of the valley with its cities, and
received its present character at the same time, is a question which has
been raised, since Capt. Lynch has discovered by actual measurement the
remarkable fact, that the bottom of the lake consists of two totally
different levels, which are separated by a peninsula that stretches to a
very great distance into the lake from the eastern shore; so that whilst
the lake to the north of this peninsula is, on an average, from 1000 to
1200 feet deep, the southern portion is at the most 16 feet deep, and
generally much less, the bottom being covered with salt mud, and heated
by hot springs from below.)

In addition to Sodom, which was probably the chief city of the valley of
Siddim, Gomorrah and the whole valley (i.e., the valley of Siddim, [Gen
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#003).md) are mentioned; and along with
these the cities of Admah and Zeboim, which were situated in the valley
([Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md), cf. [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008).md), also perished, Zoar alone,
which is at the south-eastern end of the valley, being spared for Lot's
sake. Even to the present day the Dead Sea, with the sulphureous vapour
which hangs about it, the great blocks of saltpetre and sulphur which
lie on every hand, and the utter absence of the slightest trace of
animal and vegetable life in its waters, are a striking testimony to
this catastrophe, which is held up in both the Old and New Testaments as
a fearfully solemn judgment of God for the warning of self-secure and
presumptuous sinners.

[Genesis 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 19:26</span></span>

On the way, Lot's wife, notwithstanding the divine command, looked
"behind him away," - i.e., went behind her husband and looked backwards,
probably from a longing for the house and the earthly possessions she
had left with reluctance (cf. [Luk
17:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#031).md), - and "became a pillar of
salt." We are not to suppose that she was actually turned into one, but
having been killed by the fiery and sulphureous vapour with which the
air was filled, and afterwards encrusted with salt, she resembled an
actual statue of salt; just as even now, from the saline exhalation of
the Dead Sea, objects near it are quickly covered with a crust of salt,
so that the fact, to which Christ refers in [Luk
17:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#032.md), may be understood without
supposing a miracle.

(Note: But when this pillar of salt is mentioned in Wis. 11:7 and
Clemens ad Cor. xi. as still in existence, and Josephus professes to
have seen it, this legend is probably based upon the pillar-like lumps
of salt, which are still to be seen at Mount Usdum (Sodom), on the
south-western side of the Dead Sea.)

\- In [Gen 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#027.md), [Gen
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#028.md), the account closes with a
remark which points back to [Gen
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017.md)., viz., that Abraham went in the
morning to the place where he had stood the day before, interceding with
the Lord for Sodom, and saw how the judgment had fallen upon the entire
plain, since the smoke of the country went up like the smoke of a
furnace. Yet his intercession had not been in vain.

[Genesis 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 19:29</span></span>

For on the destruction of these cities, God had thought of Abraham, and
rescued Lot. This rescue is attributed to Elohim, as being the work of
the Judge of the whole earth ([Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025).md), and not to Jehovah the
covenant God, because Lot was severed from His guidance and care on his
separation from Abraham. The fact, however, is repeated here, for the
purpose of connecting with it an event in the life of Lot of great
significance to the future history of Abraham's seed.

[Gen 19:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030.md)

From Zoar Lot removed with his two daughters to the (Moabitish)
mountains, for fear that Zoar might after all be destroyed, and dwelt in
one of the caves (מערה with the generic article), in which the limestone
rocks abound (vid., Lynch), and so became a dweller in a cave. While
there, his daughters resolved to procure children through their father;
and to that end on two successive evenings they made him intoxicated
with wine, and then lay with him in the might, one after the other, that
they might conceive seed. To this accursed crime they were impelled by
the desire to preserve their family, because they thought there was no
man on the earth to come in unto them, i.e., to marry them, "after the
manner of all the earth." Not that they imagined the whole human race to
have perished in the destruction of the valley of Siddim, but because
they were afraid that no man would link himself with them, the only
survivors of a country smitten by the curse of God. If it was not lust,
therefore, which impelled them to this shameful deed, their conduct was
worthy of Sodom, and shows quite as much as their previous betrothal to
men of Sodom, that they were deeply imbued with the sinful character of
that city. The words of [Gen 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#033.md) and
[Gen 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#035.md), "And he knew not of her
lying down and of her rising up," do not affirm that he was in an
unconscious state, as the Rabbins are said by Jerome to have indicated
by the point over בּקוּמה: "quasi incredibile et quod natura rerum non
capiat, coire quempiam nescientem." They merely mean, that in his
intoxicated state, though not entirely unconscious, yet he lay with his
daughters without clearly knowing what he was doing.

[Gen 19:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#036.md)

But Lot's daughters had so little feeling of shame in connection with
their conduct, that they gave names to the sons they bore, which have
immortalized their paternity. Moab, another form of מאב "from the
father," as is indicated in the clause appended in the lxx: λέγουσα ἐκ
τοῦ πατρός μου, and also rendered probable by the reiteration of the
words "of our father" and "by their father" ([Gen
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#032.md), [Gen
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#034.md), and [Gen
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#036).md), as well as by the analogy of
the name Ben-Ammi = Ammon, Ἀμμάν, λέγουσα Υἱος γένους μου (lxx). For
עמּון, the sprout of the nation, bears the same relation to עם, as
אגמון, the rush or sprout of the marsh, to אגם Delitzsch). - This
account was neither the invention of national hatred to the Moabites and
Ammonites, nor was it placed here as a brand upon those tribes. These
discoveries of a criticism imbued with hostility to the Bible are
overthrown by the fact, that, according to [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md), Israel was ordered not to touch
the territory of either of these tribes because of their descent from
Lot; and it was their unbrotherly conduct towards Israel alone which
first prevented their reception into the congregation of the Lord, [Deu
23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004.md). - Lot is never mentioned
again. Separated both outwardly and inwardly from Abraham, he was of no
further importance in relation to the history of salvation, so that even
his death is not referred to. His descendants, however, frequently came
into contact with the Israelites; and the history of their descent is
given here to facilitate a correct appreciation of their conduct towards
Israel.
