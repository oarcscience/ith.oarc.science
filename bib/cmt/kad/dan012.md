### [Daniel Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 12:1</span></span>

ההיא וּבעת points back to קץ בּעת ([Dan
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004).md). At the time of the end, in
which the hostile persecutor rises up to subdue the whole world, and
sets up his camp in the Holy Land to destroy many in great anger and to
strike them with the ban (החרים, [Dan
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#044).md), i.e., totally to outroot them
([Dan 11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md), the great
angel-prince Michael shall come forth and fight for the people of God
against their oppressor. Regarding Michael, see under [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md), p. 771. "Who stands over the
sons of thy people," i.e., stands near, protecting them (cf. for על עמד
in the sense of coming to protect, [Est
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011.md); [Est
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#016).md), describes Michael, who carries
on his work as Israel's שׂר ([Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021).md). That Michael, fighting for
Daniel's people, goes forth against the hostile king ([Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045).md), is, it is true, not said
expressis verbis, but it lies in the context, especially in the עמך
ימּלט (they people shall be delivered) of the second half of the verse,
as well as in the expressions regarding Michael, [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md) and [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md).

But the people of God need such powerful help for their deliverance,
because that time shall be one of oppression without any parallel. The
description of this oppression seems to be based on [Jer
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007) (C. B. Michaelis, Hengstenberg.md);
but that which is there said is here heightened by the relative clause
(cf. [Joe 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002).md), which enlarges the
thought, [Exo 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#018.md), [Exo
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#024). This צרה עת (time of distress.md)
is the climax of the oppression which the hostile king shall bring upon
Israel, and occurs at the same time as the expiry of the last (the
seventieth) week, [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md). "The
salvation of Israel (ימּלט), which is here thought of as brought about
under the direction of Michael, coincides essentially with the
description, [Dan 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018.md), [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md)., 14, [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)." Thus Kranichfeld rightly
remarks. He also rightly identifies the continued victorious deliverance
of Israel from the oppression ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md) with the setting up of the
Messianic kingdom, described in [Dan
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002.md), [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md), and finds in this verse ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md) the Messianic kingdom dissolving
the world-kingdoms.

With this the opposers of the genuineness of the book of Daniel also
agree, and deduce therefrom the conclusion, that the pseudo-Daniel
expected, along with the overthrow of Antiochus Epiphanes, the
appearance of the Messianic kingdom of glory. This conclusion would be
indisputable if the premises from which it is drawn, that ההיא בּעת (at
that time) is the time of Antiochus, were well founded. All attempts of
believing interpreters, who, with Porphyry, Grotius, Bleek, v. Lengerke,
Hitzig, and others, find the death of Antiochus prophesied in [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045.md), to dismiss this conclusion,
appear on close inspection to be untenable. According to Hvernick, with
ההיא וּבעת (and at that time) a new period following that going before
is introduced, and that ההיא בּעת means at some future time. The
appearance of Michael for his people denotes the appearance of the
Messiah; and the sufferings and oppressions connected with his
appearance denote the sufferings which the people of Israel shall endure
at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, but which shall be most
fully realized only at the second coming of the Lord, [Mat
24:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021.md). But this explanation is
shattered against the ההיא בּעת, which never has the meaning "at some
time," i.e., in the further future, and is refuted by the following
remark of Hitzig: - "Not once," says he, with good ground, "can the
words ההוּא בּיּום be proved by such passages as [Kg2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#006.md); [Isa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005.md); [Gen
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#011.md), to have the meaning of at that
day; in ההיא בעת we may not by any means seek such a meaning, and the
copula here puts a complete barrier in the way of such arbitrariness.
Moreover, if the epoch of Antiochus Epiphanes was indeed a time of
oppression, who could a reader then not refer this ההיא to the time of
that king described in the foregoing chapter?" Finally, משׂכּילים
(intelligentes), [Dan 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md), refers
back to the עם משׂכּילי who helped may to knowledge, and who lost their
lives in the persecution ([Dan
11:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033).md), and now are raised to
eternal life.

(Note: These arguments extend also to the overthrow of Ebrard's view,
that the expression "to this time" refers to the time after Antiochus
Epiphanes shall have died.)

Hvernick, however, was right, in opposing those who refer [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) to the period of persecution
under Antiochus, in arguing that the statement of the unheard-of
greatness of the affliction is far too strong for such a period, and at
the same time that the promise of the deliverance of those that shall be
found written in the book does not accord with that Syrian oppression,
although he is in error when he interprets the appearance of Michael of
the first appearance of Christ. This interpretation receives no support
either from [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) or from [Mat
24:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021.md), because both passages treat
of the coming of Christ in glory. But if the reference of this verse to
the appearance of Christ in the flesh is inconsistent with the words,
still more so is its reference to the period of Antiochus. Those
interpreters who advance this view are under the necessity of violently
separating [Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) from [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md), [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md), which undoubtedly treat of the
resurrection from the dead.

According to Auberlen, who has rightly conceived that the משׂכּילים,
[Dan 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md), allude to the משׂכּילים,
[Dan 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md) and [Dan
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#034.md), the הרבּים מצדּיקי to the
לרבּים יבינוּ, [Dan 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md), [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md), [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md) do not intimate any progress in
the development of the history, but by mentioning the resurrection only,
are referred to the eternal retribution which awaits the Israelites
according to their conduct during the time of great persecution under
Antiochus, because, as C. B. Michaelis has said, ejus (i.e., of the
resurrection) consideratio magnam vim habet ad confirmandum animum sub
tribulationibus. As to the period between the time of trial and the
resurrection, nothing whatever is said; for in [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md), [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md) every designation of time is
wanting, while in [Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) the
expression "at this time" twice occurs. Thus Hengstenberg (Christol.
iii. 1, p. 6) has remarked, "Whether there be a longer or a shorter time
between the tribulation of the Maccabean era and the resurrection, the
consolation from the fact of the resurrection remains equally powerful.
Therefore it is so connected with the deliverance from the persecution
as if the one immediately followed the other." But with this it is
conceded that the resurrection from the dead is so associated with the
deliverance of Israel from the tyranny of Antiochus as if it came
immediately after it, as the opponents of the genuineness of the book
affirm. But this interpretation is obviously a mere make-shift.

[Daniel 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 12:2</span></span>

These verses do not at all present the form of a parenetic reference to
the retribution commencing with the resurrection. [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md) is by the copula וconnected with
[Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md), and thereby designates the
continuance of the thought of the second half of [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md), i.e., the further representation
of the deliverance of God's people, namely, of all those who are written
in the book of life. Since many of the משׂכּילים who know their God
([Dan 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033).md) lose their life in the
persecution, so in the promise of deliverance a disclosure of the lot
awaiting those who sealed with their blood their fidelity to God was not
to be avoided, if the prophecy shall wholly gain its end, i.e., if the
promise of the deliverance of all the pious shall afford to the people
of God in the times of oppression strength and joy in their enduring
fidelity to God. The appeal to the fact that [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md), [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md) contain no designation of time
proves nothing at all, for this simple reason, that the verses connected
by "and" are by this copula placed under [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md), which contains a designation of
time, and only further show how this deliverance shall ensue, namely
thus, that a part of the people shall outlive the tribulation, but those
who lose their lives in the persecution shall rise again from the dead.

To this is to be added that the contents of [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) do not agree with the period of
persecution under Antiochus. That which is said regarding the greatness
of the persecution is much too strong for it. The words, "There shall be
a time of trouble such as never was מהיות , since there was a nation or
nations," designate it as such as never was before on the earth.
Theodoret interprets thus: οἵα οὐ γέγονεν, αφ ̓οὐ γεγένηται εθνος ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς ἕως τοῦ καιροῦ ἐκείνου. With reference to these words our Lord
says: οἵα οὐ γέγονεν ἀπ ̓ἀρχῆς κόσμου ἕως τοῦ νῦν, οὐδ ̓οὐ μὴ γένηται,
[Mat 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021.md). Though the oppression
which Antiochus brought upon Israel may have been most severe, yet it
could not be said of it without exaggeration, that it was such a
tribulation as never had been from the beginning of the world.
Antiochus, it is true, sought to outroot Judaism root and branch, but
Pharaoh also wished to do the same by his command to destroy all the
Hebrew male children at their birth; and as Antiochus wished to make the
worship of the Grecian Zeus, so also Jezebel the worship of the
Phoenician Hercules, in the place of the worship of Jehovah, the
national religion in Israel.

Still less does the second hemistich of [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) refer to the deliverance of the
people from the power of Antiochus. Under the words, "every one that
shall be found written in the book," Hitzig remarks that they point back
to [Isa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md), and that the book is thus
the book of life, and corrects the vain interpretation of v. Lengerke,
that "to be written in the book" means in an earthly sense to live, to
be appointed to life, by the more accurate explanation, "The book of
life is thus the record of those who shall live, it is the list of the
citizens of the Messianic kingdom ([Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003).md), and in Isaiah contains the names
of those who reach it living, in Daniel also of those who must first be
raised from the dead for it." Cf. regarding the book of life, under [Exo
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md).

Accordingly, ההיא בּעת extends into the Messianic time. This is so far
acknowledged by Hofmann (Weiss. u. Erf. i. p. 313, and Shcriftbew. 2:2,
p. 697), in that he finds in [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md), from "and there shall be a
time," and in [Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md), [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md), the prophecy of the final close
of the history of nations, the time of the great tribulation at the
termination of the present course of the world, the complete salvation
of Israel in it, and the resurrection of the dead at the end of the
world. Since, however, Hofmann likewise refers the last verses of the
preceding chapter to the time of Antiochus and his destruction, and can
only refer the ההיא וּבעת at the beginning of [Dan
12:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md), from its close connection
with the last words of Daniel 11, to the time which has hitherto been
spoken of, so he supposes that in the first clause of the first verse of
this chapter ([Dan 12:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md) there
cannot be a passing over to another time, but that this transition is
first made by והיתה. This transition he seeks indeed, in the 2nd ed. of
his Schriftbew. l.c., to cover by the remark: that we may not explain
the words of the angel, וגו עת והיתה, as if they meant: that time shall
be a time of trouble such as has not been till now; but much rather that
they are to be translated: "and there shall arise a time of trouble such
as never was to that time." But this separation of the words in question
from those going before by the translation of והיתה "and there shall
arise," is rendered impossible by the words following, ההיא העת עד; for
these so distinctly point back to the words with which the verse
commences, that we may not empty them of their definite contents by the
ambiguous "till that time." If the angel says, There shall arise a time
of oppression such as has never been since there were nations till that
time when Michael shall appear for his people, or, as Hofmann translates
it, shall "hold fast his place," then to every unprejudiced reader it is
clear that this tribulation such as has never been before shall arise
not for the first time centuries after the appearance of Michael or of
his "holding fast his place," but in the time of the war of the
angel-prince for the people of God. In this same time the angel further
places the salvation of the people of Daniel and the resurrection of the
dead.

(Note: Hofmann's explanation of the words would only be valid if the
definition of time ההיא העת אחרי stood after והיתה in the text, which
Hofm. in his most recent attempts at its exposition has interpolated
inadvertently, while in his earlier exposition (Weiss. u. Erf. i. p.
314) he has openly said: "These last things connect themselves with the
prospect of the end of that oppressor of Israel, not otherwise than as
when Isaiah spoke of the approaching assault of the Assyrians on
Jerusalem as of the last affliction of the city, or as in Jeremiah the
end of those seventy years is also the end of all the sufferings of his
people. There remains therefore a want of clearness in this prospect,"
etc. This want of clearness he has, in his most recent exposition in the
Schriftbew., not set aside, but increased, by the supposition of an
immediate transition from the time of Antiochus to the time of the end.)

The failure of all attempts to gain a space of time between [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045.md) and [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md), [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md) incontrovertibly shows that the
assertions of those who dispute the genuineness of the book, that the
pseudo-Daniel expected along with the death of Antiochus the
commencement of the Messianic kingdom and of the resurrection of the
dead, would have a foundation if the last verses of Daniel 11 treated of
the last undertakings of this Syrian king against the theocracy. This
if, it has, however, been seen from Daniel 11, is not established. In
[Dan 11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md) the statements do not
refer to Antiochus, but to the time of the end, of the last enemy of the
holy God, and of his destruction. With that is connected, without any
intervening space, in [Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) the
description of the last oppression of the people of God and their
salvation to everlasting life. The prophecy of that unheard-of great
tribulation Christ has in [Mat 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021.md)
referred, wholly in the sense of the prophetic announcement, to the yet
future θλῖψις μεγάλη which shall precede the coming of the Son of man in
the clouds of heaven to judge the world and to bring to a consummation
the kingdom of God. That this tribulation shall come only upon Israel,
the people of God, is not said; the גּוי מהיות refers much more to a
tribulation that shall come upon the whole of humanity. In it shall the
angel-prince Michael help the people of Daniel, i.e., the people of God.
That he shall destroy the hostile king, the Antichrist, is not said. His
influence extends only to the assistance which he shall render to the
people of God for their salvation, so that all who are written in the
book of life shall be saved. Christ, in His eschatological discourse,
Matt 24, does not make mention of this assistance, but only says that
for the elect's sake the days of the oppression shall be shortened,
otherwise that no one would be saved (ἐσώθη, [Mat
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022).md). Wherein the help of Michael
consists, is seen partly from that which is said in [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md) and [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md) regarding him, that he helped
the Angel of the Lord in the war against the hostile spirit of the
Persian and the Javanic world-kingdom, partly from the war of Michael
against the dragon described in [Rev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007.md). From these indications it is
clear that we may not limit the help on the part of Michael to the help
which he renders to the saints of God in the last war and struggle, but
that he stands by them in all wars against the world-power and its
princes, and helps them to victory.

But the salvation which the people of God shall experience in the time
of the unparalleled great oppression is essentially different from the
help which was imparted to the people of Israel in the time of the
Maccabees. This is called "a little help," [Dan
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#034.md). So also is the oppression of
Israel in the time of the Maccabees different from the oppression in the
end of the time, as to its object and consequences. The former
oppression shall, according to [Dan
11:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md), serve to purify the people
and to make them white to the time of the end; the oppression at the
time of the end, on the contrary, according to [Dan
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md), shall effect the salvation
(המּלט) of the people, i.e., prepare the people for the everlasting
life, and bring about the separation of the righteous from the wicked
for eternity. These clearly stated distinctions confirm the result
already reached, that [Dan 12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) do
not treat of the time of Antiochus and the Maccabees.

The promised salvation of the people (ימּלט) is more particularly
defined by the addition to עמך: "every one who shall be found written in
the book," sc. of life (see above, p. 813); thus every one whom God has
ordained to life, all the genuine members of the people of God. נמלט,
shall be saved, sc. out of the tribulation, so that they do not perish
therein. But since, according to [Dan
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md)., in the oppression, which
passes over the people of God for their purification, many shall lose
their lives, and this also shall be the case in the last and severest
oppression, the angel gives to the prophet, in [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md), disclosures also regarding the
dead, namely, that they shall awaken out of the sleep of death. By the
connection of this verse with the preceding by ,ו without any further
designation of time, the resurrection of the dead is placed as
synchronous with the deliverance of the people. "For that the two
clauses, 'thy people shall be delivered' ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md), and 'many shall awake,' not
only reciprocally complete each other, but also denote contemporaneous
facts, we only deny by first denying that the former declares the final
salvation of Israel" (Hofm. Schriftbew. ii. 2, p. 598). ישׁן, sleeping,
is here used, as in [Job 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013.md); [Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md), of death; cf. καθεύδειν, [Mat
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#024.md); [Th1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010.md), and κοιμᾶσθαι, [Th1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014.md). אדמת־עפר, occurring only here,
formed after [Gen 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019.md), means not the
dust of the earth, but dusty earth, terra pulveris, denoting the grave,
as עפר, [Psa 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030.md).

It appears surprising that רבּים, many, shall awake, since according to
the sequel, where the rising of some to life and of some to shame is
spoken of, much rather the word all might have been expected. This
difficulty is not removed by the remark that many stands for all,
because רבּים does not mean all. Concerning the opinion that many stands
for all, Hofmann remarks, that the expression "sleeping in the dust of
earth" is not connected with the word many (רבּים), but with the verb
"shall awake" (יקיצוּ): "of them there shall be many, of whom those who
sleep in the earth shall arise" (Hofm.). So also C. B. Michaelis
interprets the words by reference to the Masoretic accentuation, which
has separated רבּים from מיּשׁני (sleeping), only that he takes מן in
the sense of stating the terminus mutationis a quo. But by this very
artificial interpretation nothing at all is gained; for the thought
still remains the same, that of those who sleep in the dust many (not
all) awake. The partitive interpretation of מן is the only simple and
natural one, and therefore with most interpreters we prefer it. The
רבּים can only be rightly interpreted from the context. The angel has it
not in view to give a general statement regarding the resurrection of
the dead, but only disclosures on this point, that the final salvation
of the people shall not be limited to those still living at the end of
the great tribulation, but shall include also those who have lost their
lives during the period of the tribulation.

In [Dan 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md), [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), the angel had already said,
that of "those that understand" many shall fall by the sword and by
flame, etc. When the tribulation at the time of the end increases to an
unparalleled extent ([Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md), a yet
greater number shall perish, so that when salvation comes, only a
remnant of the people shall be then in life. To this surviving remnant
of the people salvation is promised; but the promise is limited yet
further by the addition: "every one that is found written in the book;"
not all that are then living, but only those whose names are recorded in
the book of life shall be partakers of the deliverance, i.e., of the
Messianic salvation. But many (רבּים) of those that sleep, who died in
the time of tribulation, shall awake out of sleep, some to everlasting
life, and some to everlasting shame. As with the living, so also with
the dead, not all attain to salvation. Also among those that arise there
shall be a distinction, in which the reward of the faithful and of the
unfaithful shall be made known. The word "many" is accordingly used only
with reference to the small number of those who shall then be living,
and not with reference either to the universality of the resurrection of
the dead or to a portion only of the dead, but merely to add to the
multitude of the dead, who shall then have part with the living, the
small number of those who shall experience in the flesh the conclusion
of the matter.

If we consider this course of thought, then we shall find it necessary
neither to obtrude upon רבּים the meaning of all, - a meaning which it
has not and cannot have, for the universality of the resurrection is
removed by the particle מן, which makes it impossible that ,οἱ πολλοί =
πάντες; for this conclusion can only be drawn from the misapprehension
of the course of thought here presented, that this verse contains a
general statement of the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, an
idea which is foreign to the connection.

From the correct interpretation of the course of thought arises the
correct answer to the controverted question, whether here we are taught
concerning the resurrection of the people of Israel, or concerning the
resurrection of mankind generally. Neither the one nor the other of
these things is taught here. The prophetic words treat of the people of
Daniel, by which we are to understand the people of Israel. But the
Israel of the time of the end consists not merely of Jews or of Jewish
Christians, but embraces all peoples who belong to God's kingdom of the
New Covenant founded by Christ. In this respect the resurrection of all
is here implicite intimated, and Christ has explicitly set forth the
thoughts lying implicite in this verse; for in [Joh
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md). He teaches the awakening from
sleep of all the dead, and speaks, with unmistakeable reference to this
passage before us, of an ἀνάστασις ζωῆς and an ἀνάστασις κρίσεως. For in
the O.T. our verse is the only passage in which, along with the
resurrection to everlasting life, there is mention also made of the
resurrection to everlasting shame, or the resurrection of the righteous
and of the wicked. The conception of עולם ,חיּיζωὴ αἰώνιος, meets us
here for the first time in the O.T. חיּים denotes, it is true,
frequently the true life with God, the blessed life in communion with
God, which exists after this life; but the addition עולם does not
generally occur, and is here introduced to denote, as corresponding to
the eternal duration of the Messianic kingdom ([Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md); [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md), [Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027.md), cf. [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md), the life of the righteous in
this kingdom as imperishable. עולם לדראון לחרפות forms the contrast to
עולם לחיּי; for first חרפות, shame (a plur. of intensive fulness), is
placed over against the חיּי, then this shame is designated in reference
to [Isa 66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md) as דּראון, contempt, an
object of aversion.

[Dan 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md)

Then shall they who in the times of tribulation have led many to the
knowledge of salvation receive the glorious reward of their
faithfulness. With this thought the angel closes the announcement of the
future. המשׂכּילים refers back to [Dan
11:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033.md), and is here, as there, not
limited to the teachers, but denotes the intelligent who, by instructing
their contemporaries by means of word and deed, have awakened them to
stedfastness and fidelity to their confession in the times of
tribulation and have strengthened their faith, and some of whom have in
war sealed their testimony with their blood. These shall shine in
eternal life with heavenly splendour. The splendour of the vault of
heaven (cf. [Exo 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010).md) is a figure of
the glory which Christ designates as a light like the sun ("The
righteous shall shine forth as the sun," [Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043.md), referring to the passage before
us). Cf. for this figure also [Rev
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028.md) and [Co1
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040.md). By the expression הרבּים
מצדּיקי Kranichfeld would understand such as take away the sins of the
people in the offering up of sacrifice, i.e., the priests who attend to
the offering of the sacrifices, because the expression is borrowed from
[Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md), "where it is predicated of
the Messianic priest κατ ̓ἐξοχὴν, in the fullest sense of the word, what
is said here of the common priests." But this interpretation is not
satisfactory. In [Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md) the
Servant of Jehovah justifies many, not by the sacrifice, but by His
righteousness, by this, that He, as צדּיק who has done no sin, takes
upon Himself the sins of the people and gives His soul an offering for
sin. הצּדּיק is neither in the law of sacrifices nor anywhere in the
O.T. named as the effect of the sacrifice, but always only עון שׂאת
(נשׂא) (to take up, take away iniquity) and כּפּר, and in the expiatory
sacrifices with the constant addition לו (&lt;) ונסלח; cf. [Lev
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026.md), [Lev
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#031.md), [Lev
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035.md); [Lev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#010.md),[Lev
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016.md); [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md).

Nor is the practice of offering sacrifice anywhere described as a
הצּדּיק. This word signifies to assist in obtaining, or to lead to,
righteousness, and is here to be read in this general interpretation,
and not to be identified with the Pauline δικαιοῦσθαι. The מצדּיקים are
those who by their צדקה, i.e., by their fidelity to the law, led others
to צדקה, showed them by their example and teaching the way to
righteousness.

The salvation of the people, which the end shall bring in, consists
accordingly in the consummation of the people of God by the resurrection
of the dead and the judgment dividing the pious from the godless,
according to which the pious shall be raised to eternal life, and the
godless shall be given up to everlasting shame and contempt. But the
leaders of the people who, amid the wars and conflicts of this life,
have turned many to righteousness, shall shine in the imperishable glory
of heaven.

The Close of the Revelation of God and of the Book

As the revelation in Daniel 8 closes with the direction, "Wherefore shut
thou up the vision" ([Dan 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026).md), so
this before us closes with the command ([Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004).md), "But thou Daniel shut up these
words;" and as in the former case החזון denotes the vision interpreted
to him by the angel, so here הדּברים can only be the announcements of
the angel, Daniel 11:2-12:3, along with the preceding appearance, Daniel
10:2-11:1, thus only the revelation designated as דּבר, [Dan
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md). Accordingly, also, סתן is
obviously to be interpreted in the meaning illustrated and defended
under [Dan 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md), to shut up in the
sense of guarding; and thus also חתם, to seal. Thus all the objections
against this command are set aside which Hitzig has derived from the
sealing, which he understands of the sealing up of the book, so that he
may thereby cast doubt on the genuineness of the book.

It is disputed whether הספר is only the last revelation, Daniel 10-12
(Hvernick, v. Leng., Maurer, Kran.), or the whole book (Bertholdt,
Hitzig, Auberlen, Kliefoth). That ספר might designate a short connected
portion, a single prophecy, is placed beyond a doubt by [Nah
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md); [Jer
51:63](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#063.md). The parallelism of the members
of the passage also appears to favour the opinion that הספר stands in
the same meaning as הדּברים. But this appearance amounts to a valid
argument only under the supposition that the last revelation stands
unconnected with the revelations going before. But since this is not the
case, much rather the revelation of these chapters is not only in point
of time the last which Daniel received, but also forms the essential
conclusion of all earlier revelations, then the expression used of the
sealing of this last revelation refers plainly to the sealing of the
whole book. This supposition is unopposed. That the writing down of the
prophecy is not commanded to Daniel, cannot be objected against. As this
is here and in [Dan 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026.md) presupposed
as a matter of course, for the receiving of a revelation without
committing it to writing is not practicable, so we may without
hesitation suppose that Daniel wrote down all the earlier visions and
revelations as soon as he received them, so that with the writing down
of the last of them the whole book was completed. For these reasons we
understand by הספר the whole book. For, as Kliefoth rightly remarks, the
angel will close, [Dan 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md), the last
revelation, and along with it the whole prophetical work of Daniel, and
dismiss him from his prophetical office, as he afterwards, [Dan
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013.md), does, after he has given him,
[Dan 12:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005.md), disclosures regarding
the periods of these wonderful things that were announced. He must seal
the book, i.e., guard it securely from disfigurement, "till the time of
the end," because its contents stretch out to the time of the end. Cf.
[Dan 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026.md), where the reason for the
sealing is stated in the words, "for yet it shall be for many days."
Instead of such a statement as that, the time of the end is here briefly
named as the terminus, down to which the revelation reaches, in harmony
with the contents of Daniel 11:40-12:3, which comprehend the events of
the time of the end.

The two clauses of [Dan 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md) are
differently explained. The interpretation of J. D. Michaelis, "Many
shall indeed go astray, but on the other side also the knowledge shall
be great," is verbally just as untenable as that of Hvernick, "Many
shall wander about, i.e., in the consciousness of their misery, strive
after salvation, knowledge." For שׁוּט signifies neither to go astray
(errare) nor to wander about, but only to go to and fro, to pass through
a land, in order to seek out or search, to go about spying ([Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md), of the eyes of God; [Eze
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#008.md), [Eze
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#026), to row.md). From these renderings
there arises for this passage before us the meaning, to search through,
to examine, a book; not merely to "read industriously" (Hitzig, Ewald),
but thoroughly to search into it (Gesenius). The words do not supply the
reason for the command to seal, but they state the object of the
sealing, and are not (with many interpreters) to be referred merely to
the time of the end, that then for the first time many shall search
therein and find great knowledge. This limiting of their import is
connected with the inaccurate interpretation of the sealing as a figure
either of the incomprehensibility of the prophecy or of the secrecy of
the writing, and is set aside with the correct interpretation of this
figure. If Daniel, therefore, must only place the prophecy securely that
it may continue to the time of the end, the sealing thus does not
exclude the use of it in transcriptions, then there exists no reason for
thinking that the searching into it will take place only for the first
time in the end. The words וגו רבּים ישׁטטוּ are not connected with the
preceding by any particle or definition of time, whereby they should be
limited to קץ עת. To this is to be added, that this revelation,
according to the express explanation of the angel ([Dan
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#014).md), refers to all that shall be
experienced by the people of Daniel from the time of Cyrus to the time
of the end. If, then, it must remain sealed or not understood till the
time of the end, it must have lain unused and useless for centuries,
while it was given for the very purpose of reflecting light on the ways
of God for the pious in all times, and of imparting consolation amid
their tribulations to those who continued stedfast in their fidelity. In
order to serve these purposes it must be accessible at all times, so
that they might be able to search into it, to judge events by it and to
strengthen their faith. Kliefoth therefore is right in his thus
interpreting the whole passage: "Daniel must place in security the
prophecies he has received until the time of the end, so that through
all times many men may be able to read them and gain understanding
(better: obtain knowledge) from them." הדּעת is the knowledge of the
ways of the Lord with His people, which confirms them in their fidelity
towards God.

[Daniel 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 12:5</span></span>

With [Dan 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md) the revelation might
have concluded, as that in Daniel ends with the direction to shut up the
vision. But then a disclosure regarding the times of the events
prophesied of, which Daniel might have expected according to the analogy
of the visions in Daniel 8 and 9, would have been wanting. This
disclosure is given to him in [Dan
12:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005.md), and that in a very solemn,
impressive way. The appearance which hitherto he has seen is changed. He
sees two other angels standing on the banks of the river, the one on
this side and the other on that side. והנּה ... וראיתי (then I looked,
and lo) does not, it is true, indicate a new vision so much as a new
scene in the vision, which still continued. The words אהרים שׁנים, two
others, sc. heavenly beings or angels (without the article), show that
they now for the first time became visible, and were different from the
one who was hitherto seen by him and had spoken with him. Therefore the
supposition that the one of these two angels was Gabriel, who had
communicated to him the revelation, fails, even if, which is according
to our exposition, not the case, the speaker in Daniel 11 and [Dan
12:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md) were this angel.

[Daniel 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 12:6</span></span>

Besides these two now first seen by Daniel, he who was "clothed in
linen" is named as standing above the waters of the river; but when we
take into view the whole scene, he is by no means to be regarded as now
for the first time coming into view. The use of the article (לאישׁ), and
the clothing that characterized him, point him out as the person spoken
of in [Dan 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md). Hence our view
developed in p. 768 is confirmed, viz., that previously the man clothed
in linen was visible to Daniel alone, and announced to him the future.
He also in the sequel alone speaks with Daniel. One of the other two
makes inquiry regarding the end of the wonderful things, so as to give
occasion to him (as in [Dan 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md) and
[Dan 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014).md) to furnish an answer. With
this the question presses itself upon us, For what purpose do the two
angels appear, since only one of them speaks - the other neither does
anything nor speaks? Leaving out of view the opinion of Jerome, Grotius,
Studlin, and Ewald, that the two angels were the guardian spirits of
Persia and Greece, and other conceits, such e.g., as that they represent
the law and the prophets (after a gloss in the Cod. Chis.), which Geier
has rejected as figmenta hominum textus auctoritate destituta, we
confine ourselves to a consideration of the views of Hitzig and
Kliefoth.

Hitzig thinks that the two angels appear as witnesses of the oath, and
that for that reason there are two; cf. [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md) with [Deu
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#028.md). But these passage do not prove
that for the ratification of an oath witnesses are necessary. The
testimony of two or three witnesses was necessary only for the
attestation of an accusation laid before a judge. Add to this also that
in [Dan 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md). two angels appear along
with him whose voice came from the Ulai ([Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016).md), without any oath being there
given. It is true that there the two angels speak, but only the
utterance of one of them is communicated. Hence the conjecture is
natural, that here also both of the angels spake, the one calling to the
other the question that was addressed to the Angel of the Lord hovering
over the water, as Theodot. and Ephrem Syrus appear to have thought, and
as Klief. regards as probable. In any case the appearance of the angels
on the two banks of the river stands in actual connection with the
hovering of the man clothed in linen above the waters of this river, in
which the circumstance merits consideration that the river, according to
[Dan 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004.md) the Tigris, is here called
יאר, as besides the Nile only is called in the O.T. The hovering above
the stream can represent only the power or dominion over it. But
Kliefoth is inclined to regard the river as an emblem of time flowing on
to eternity; but there is no support in Scripture for such a
representation. Besides, by this the appellation יאר is not taken into
consideration, by which, without doubt, the river over which the Angel
of the Lord hovers is designated as a Nile; i.e., it is indicated that
as the Angel of the Lord once smote the waters of the Nile to ransom his
people out of Egypt, so in the future shall he calm and suppress the
waves of the river which in Daniel's time represented the might of the
world-kingdom.

(Note: C. B. Michaelis has similarly interpreted the standing (or
hovering) over the waters of the river as symbolum potestatis atque
dominii supremi, quo non solum terram continentem et aridam, sed etiam
aquas pedibus quasi suis subjectas habet, et ea quae aquarum instar
tumultuantur, videlicet gentes, adversus ecclesiam Dei insurgentes atque
frementes, compescere et coercere potest. Only he has not in this regard
to the name יאר.)

The river Hiddekel (Tigris) was thus a figure of the Persian
world-power, through whose territory it flowed (cf. for this prophetic
type, [Isa 8:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md); [Psa
124:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003).md), and the designation of the
river as יאר, Nile, contains an allusion to the deliverance of Israel
from the power of Egypt, which in its essence shall be repeated in the
future. Two other angels stand as servants by the side of the Angel of
the Lord, the ruler over the Hiddekel, prepared to execute his will.
Thus interpreted, all the features of the vision gain an interpretation
corresponding with the contents of the prophecy.

But the significance of the whole scene, which presents itself to the
prophet after he received the announcement, at the same time shows that
the [Dan 12:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#005.md) form no mere
supplementary communication, which is given to Daniel before he is
wholly dismissed for his prophetical office, regarding the question that
lay upon his heart as to the duration of the severe tribulation that was
announced, but that this disclosure constitutes an integral part of the
foregoing revelation, and is placed at the end of the angel's message
only because a change of scene was necessary for the giving prominence
to the import of this disclosure.

Thus, to give the prophet the firm certainty that the oppression of his
people spoken of, on the part of the ungodly world-rulers, when it has
gained its end, viz., The purification of the people, shall bring about,
along with the destruction of the enemy of the last time, the salvation
of those who are truly the people of God in their advancement to eternal
life in glory, the Angel of the Lord standing above the waters of the
river presents himself to view as the guide and ruler of the affairs of
the nations, and announces with a solemn oath the duration and the end
of the time of tribulation. This announcement is introduced by the
question of the angel standing by the river: "Till when the end, i.e.,
how long continues the end, of these wonderful things?" not: "When shall
the end of these things be?" (Kran.) הפּלאות are, according to the
context, the extraordinary things which the prophecy had declared,
particularly the unheard-of oppressions described in [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md).; cf. with פּלאות the synonym
נפּלאות, [Dan 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md) and [Dan
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024.md). But the question is not: "How
long shall all these פּלאות themselves continue?" but: "How long shall
הפּלאות קץ, the end of these wonderful things, continue?" The end of
these things is the time of the end prophesied of from [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md) to [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md), with all that shall happen in
it. To this the man clothed with linen answers with a solemn oath for
the confirmation of his statement. The lifting up of his hands to heaven
indicates the solemnity of the oath. Commonly he who swears lifts up
only one hand; cf. [Deu 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040.md); [Eze
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005.md), and the remark under [Exo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#008.md); but here with greater solemnity
both hands are lifted up, and he swears העולם בּחי, by Him that liveth
for ever. This predicate of God, which we have already heard from the
mouth of Nebuchadnezzar, [Dan 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#031.md),
here points back to [Deu 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040.md), where
God swears, "I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever," and
is quoted from this verse before us in [Rev
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006.md), and there further expanded. This
solemn form of swearing shows that the question and answer must refer
not to the duration of the period of the persecution under Antiochus,
but to that under the last enemy, the Antichrist. The definition of time
given in the answer leads us also to this conclusion: a time, two times,
and half a time; which accurately agrees with the period of time named
in [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md) as that of the duration
of the actions of the enemy of God who would arise out of the fourth
world-kingdom. The כּי serves, as ὅτι frequently, only for the
introducing of the statement or the answer. ל before מועד does not
signify till (= עד, [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md), but to
or upon, at. In both of the clauses of the answer, "space of time and
point of time, duration and final end, are connected, and this relation
is indicated by an interchange of the prepos. ל and כ" (Hitzig). In וגו
למועד (for a time, etc.) is given the space of time on or over which the
פּלאות קץ (the end of these wonders) stretches itself, and in the
following clause, וגו וּככלּות (and when he shall have accomplished,
etc.), the point of time in which the wonderful things reach their end.
Thus the two expressions of the oath are related to one another.

In the second clause יד נפּץ are differently expounded. Ancient and very
wide-spread is the exposition of נפּץ by to scatter. Theodotion has
translated the words thus: ἐν τῷ συντελεσθῆναι διασκορπισμόν; and Jerome
(Vulg.): cum completa fuerit dispersio manus populi sancti. Hvernick, v.
Lengerke, Gesenius, de Wette, Hitzig: when at the end of the dispersion
of a portion of the holy people, which Hv., v. Leng., and others
understand of the dispersion of Israel into the different countries of
the world, which dispersion shall be brought to an end, according to the
prophetic view, at the time of the Messianic final victory; [Joe
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#005.md). ([Dan
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#032)..md); [Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md). Hitzig, however, refers this to
the circumstance that Simon and Judas Maccabaeus brought back their
people to Judea who were living scattered among the heathen in Galilee
and Gilead (1 Macc. 5:23, 45, 53, 54). But against such an
interpretation of the word נפּץ, Hofmann (Weiss. u. Erf. i. p. 314) has
with justice replied, that the reference to the reunion of Israel, which
is nowhere else presented in Daniel, would enter very unexpectedly into
this connection, besides that נפּץ does not agree with its object יד,
though we should translate this by "might," or altogether improperly by
"part." יד has not the meaning "part," which is attributed to it only on
the ground of an incorrect interpretation of certain passages. נפּץ
signifies to beat to pieces, to shatter; cf. [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md); [Psa
137:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#009.md), and in the Pu. [Isa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009.md). This is the primary meaning of
the word, from which is attempted to be derived the meaning, to burst
asunder, to scatter. This primary meaning of the word, however,
Hengstenberg, Maurer, Auberlen, Kranichfeld, Kliefoth, and Ewald have
rightly maintained in this place. Only we may not, with them, translate
כּלּות by: to have an end, for then the answer would be tautological,
since the breaking to pieces of the might of the people is identical
with their scattering, but it has the meaning to make perfect, to
accomplish, so that nothing more remains to be done. יד, hand, is the
emblem of active power; the shattering of the hand is thus the complete
destruction of power to work, the placing in a helpless and powerless
condition, such as Moses has described in the words יד אזלת כּי (for the
hand is gone), [Deu 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md), and
announced that when this state of things shall arise, then "the Lord
shall judge His people, and repent Himself for His servants." With this
harmonizes the conclusion of the oath: then all these things shall be
finished, or shall complete themselves. כּל־אלּה (all these things) are
the פּלאות, [Dan 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006.md). To these
"wonderful things" belong not merely the crushing of the holy people in
the tribulation such as never was before, but also their deliverance by
the coming of the angel-prince Michael, the resurrection of the dead,
and the eternal separation of the righteous from the wicked ([Dan
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md). This last designation of the
period of time goes thus, beyond a doubt, to the end of all things, or
to the consummation of the kingdom of God by the resurrection of the
dead and the final judgment. With this also agrees with expression קדשׁ
עם, which is not to be limited to the converted Jews. The circumstance
that in Daniel's time the Israel according to the flesh constituted the
"holy people," does not necessitate our understanding this people when
the people of God are spoken of in the time of the end, since then the
faithful from among all nations shall be the holy people of God.

But by the majority of modern interpreters the designation of time,
three and a half times, is referred to the duration of the oppression of
the Jews under Antiochus Epiphanes; whence Bleek, v. Lengerke, Maurer,
Hitzig, Ewald, and others conclude that the Maccabean pseudo-Daniel
placed together as synchronous the death of Antiochus and the beginning
of the Messianic salvation. Hvernick finds in the answer two different
designations of time, but has said nothing as to the relation they bear
to each other; Hofmann (Weiss. u. Erf. i. p. 314) finds an obscurity in
this, that the end of all things is simply placed in connection with the
end of the oppressor Antiochus (see under [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md). But, thus Kliefoth rightly
asks, on the contrary, "How is it only possible that the catastrophe of
Antiochus, belonging to the middle of the times, and the time of the end
lying in the distant future, are so comprehended in one clause in an
answer to a question regarding a point of time? How as it possible that
to the question, How long continues the end of the wonders? it could be
answered: For three and a half years shall Antiochus carry on his work;
and when it comes to an end in the breaking of the people, then all
shall come to an end? Thus the last only would be an answer to the
question, and the first an addition not appertaining to it. Or how were
it possible that for the expression, 'all shall be ended,' two
characteristics were given, one of which belonged to the time of
Antiochus and the other to the time of the end?" And, we must further
ask, are we necessitated by the statement to make such an unnatural
supposition? Certainly not. The two clauses do not give two different
definitions of time, i.e., refer to different periods of time, but only
two definitions of one period of time, the first of which describes its
course according to a symbolical measure of time, the second its
termination according to an actual characteristic. None of these
definitions of time has any reference to the oppression of the holy
people by Antiochus, but the one as well as the other refers to the
tribulation of the time of the end. The measure of time: time, times,
and half a time, does not indeed correspond to the duration of the
dominion of the little horn proceeding from the Javanic world-kingdom
(spoken of in Daniel 8) = 2300 evening-mornings ([Dan
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014).md), but literally (for מועד
corresponds with the Chald. עדּן) agrees with that in [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md), for the dominion of the hostile
king, the Antichrist, rising out of the ten kingdoms of the fourth or
last world-kingdom. יד נפּץ כּכלּות also refers to this enemy; for of
him it is said, [Dan 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#021.md), [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md), that he shall prevail against
and destroy the saints of the Most High (יבלּא, [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md).

The reference of both the statements in the oath to the history of the
end, or the time of Antichrist, has therefore been recognised by
Auberlen and Zndel, although the latter understands also, with Hofmann,
[Dan 11:36-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md) of the oppression of
Israel by Antiochus. To the question, how long the end of the terrible
things prophesied of in Daniel 11:40-12:1 shall continue, the Angel of
the Lord hovering over the waters answered with a solemn oath: Three and
a half times, which, according to the prophecy of [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md) and [Dan
9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), are given for the fullest
unfolding of the power of the last enemy of God till his destruction;
and when in this time of unparalleled oppression the natural strength of
the holy people shall be completely broken to piece, then shall these
terrible things have reached their end. Regarding the definition of
time, cf. The exposition under [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md).

[Daniel 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 12:8</span></span>

Daniel heard his answer, but he understood it not. To שׁמעתּי, as to
אבין לא, the object is wanting, because it can easily be supplied from
the connection, namely, the meaning of the answer of the man clothed in
linen. Grotius has incorrectly supplied quid futurum esset from the
following question, in which he has also incorrectly rendered אלּה אחרית
by post illiu triennii et temporis semestris spatium. Hvernick has also
defined the object too narrowly, for he has referred the
non-understanding merely to the mysterious number (a time, two times,
etc.). It was, besides, not merely the double designation of time in
[Dan 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md) which first at the hour of
his receiving it, but while it was yet unintelligible to the hearer,
compelled Daniel, as Hitzig thinks, to put the further question. The
whole answer in [Dan 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md) is obscure.
It gives no measure for the "times," and thus no intelligible disclosure
for the prophet regarding the duration of the end, and in the
definition, that at the time of the deepest humiliaton of the people the
end shall come, leaves wholly undefined when this shall actually take
place.

(Note: As to this latter circumstance L'Empereur remarks: Licet Daniel
ex antecedentibus certo tempus finiendarum gravissimarum calamitatum
cognoverit, tamen illum latuit, quo temporis articulo calamitas
inceptura esset: quod ignorantiam quandam in tota prophetia peperit, cum
a priori termino posterioris exacta scientia dependeret. Initium quidem
variis circumstantiis definitum fuerat: sed quando circumstantiae
futurae essent, antequam evenirent, ignorabatur.)

Hence his desire for a more particular disclosure.

The question, "what the end of these?" is very differently interpreted.
Following the example of Grotius, Kliefoth takes אחרית in the sense of
that which follows something which is either clearly seen from the
connection or is expressly stated, and explains אלּה אחרית of that which
follows or comes after this. But אלּה is not, with most interpreters, to
be taken as identical with כּל־אלּה of [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md); for since "this latter phrase
includes all the things prophesied of down to the consummation, then
would this question refer to what must come after the absolute
consummation of all things, which would be meaningless." Besides, the
answer, [Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), [Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md), which relates to the things of
Antiochus, would not harmonize with such a question. Much more are we,
with Auberlen (p. 75f.), to understand אלּה of the present things and
circumstances, things then in progress at the time of Daniel and the
going forth of the prophecy. In support of this interpretation Auberlen
adds, "The angel with heavenly eye sees into the far distant end of all;
the prophet, with human sympathies, regards the more immediate future of
his people." But however correct the remark, that אלּה is not identical
with כּל־אלּה, this not identical with all this, there is no warrant for
the conclusion drawn from it, that אלּה designates the present things
and circumstances existing under Antiochus at the time of Daniel. אלּה
must, by virtue of the connection in [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md), [Dan
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008.md), be understood of the same things
and circumstances, and a distinction between the two is established only
by כּל. If we consider this distinction, then the question, What is the
last of these things? contains not the meaningless thought, that yet
something must follow after the absolute consummation, but the
altogether reasonable thought, Which shall be the last of the פּלאות
prophesied of? Thus Daniel could ask in the hope of receiving an answer
from which he might learn the end of all these פּלאות more distinctly
than from the answer given by the angel in [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md). But as this reference of אלּה to
the present things and circumstances is excluded by the connection, so
also is the signification attributed to אחרית, of that which follows
something, verbally inadmissible; see under [Dan
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019.md).

Most other interpreters have taken אחרית as synonymous with קץ, which
Hvernick seeks to establish by a reference to [Dan
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019.md), [Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023.md), and [Deu
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#012.md). But none of these passage
establishes this identity. קץ is always thus distinguished from אחרית,
that it denotes a matter after its conclusion, while אחרית denotes the
last or the uttermost of the matter. A distinction which, it is true,
may in many cases become irrelevant. For if this distinction is not
noticed here, we would be under the necessity, in order to maintain that
the two questions in [Dan 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006.md), [Dan
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008.md) are not altogether identical, of
giving to מה the meaning qualis (Maurer), of what nature (Hofmann, v.
Lengerke, and others); a meaning which it has not, and which does not
accord with the literal idea of אחרית. "Not how? but what? is the
question; מה is not the predicate, but the subject, the thing inquired
about." Thus Hitzig, who is altogether correct in thus stating the
question: "What, i.e., which even its the uttermost, the last of the
פּלאות, which stands before the end?"

[Daniel 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 12:9</span></span>

The answer, לך , go thy way, Daniel, is quieting, and at the same time
it contains a refusal to answer; yet it is not wholly a refusal, as is
clear from [Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), [Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md). The disclosure regarding the
end which is given to him in these verses shows distinctly that the end
of the things is not so revealed as that men shall be able to know it
beforehand with certainty.

(Note: On this Calvin has well remarked: Quamvis Daniel non stulta
curiositate inductus quaesierit ex angelo de fine mirabilium, tamen non
obtinet, quod petebat, quia scilicet voluit Deus ad modum aliquem
intelligi quae praedixerat, sed tamen aliquid manere occultum usque dum
veniret maturum plenae revelationis tempus. Haec igitur ratio est, cur
angelus non exaudiat Danielem. Pium quidem erat ejus votum (neque enim
optat quicquam scire plus quam jus esset), verum Deus scit quod opus
sit, ideo non concessit quod optabat.)

לך signifies neither go hence, i.e., depart, die (Bertholdt, Hvernick),
nor go away, instead of standing waiting for an answer (Hitzig), for the
angel does give him an answer; but as the formula dimittentis ut
excitantis ad animi tranquillitatem (C. B. Michaelis), it has the
meaning: vade Daniel, h. e. mitte hanc praesentem tuam curam. "Be at
peace, leave this matter alone" (Geier and others, and similarly v.
Lengerke, Kranichfeld, Kliefoth). The clause assigning the reason for
the command כּי (for the words are shut up, etc.), is chiefly
interpreted as referring the closing and sealing up to the
incomprehensibility of the prophecy. Thus e.g., Ewald explains it: "For
hidden and sealed up are the words, all the things contained in these
prophecies, till the time of the end; then shall they be easily unsealed
and deciphered." But since, according to [Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md), Daniel himself must shut up and
seal the book, the participles in the clause, assigning the reason for
the command לך, cannot have the meaning of the perfect, but only state
what is or shall be done: shut up - they shall be (remain) till the time
of the end; thus they only denote the shutting up and sealing which must
be accomplished by Daniel. But Daniel could not make the prophecy
unintelligible, since ([Dan 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008).md) he
himself did not understand it; nor could he seal it up till the time of
the end, since he did not live to see the end. The shutting up and
sealing which was commanded to the prophet can therefore only consist in
this, that the book should be preserved in security against any
defacement of its contents, so that it might be capable of being read at
all times down to the time of the end, and might be used by God's people
for the strengthening of their faith; cf. [Dan
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026.md). "Thus Daniel is calmed in regard
to his not understanding it by the fact that this whole prophecy
(הדּברים as in [Dan 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004).md) shall be
guarded and placed in safety, and shall continue through all times down
to the end" (Kliefoth). For the use of it in all times is supposed in
[Dan 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#010.md).

[Daniel 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 12:10</span></span>

The first clause of this verse is interpreted from [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md). The being purified is effected
through tribulation and affliction, which the people shall endure to the
end. The prophecy shall serve for the gaining of this object. It is
true, indeed, that this perfection shall not be attained by all; they
that are ungodly shall remain ungodly still, and therefore they do not
come to the understanding of the words which all the wise shall gain.
יבינוּ and יבינוּ לא stand in such distinct relation to the אבין לא (I
understood not), [Dan 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008.md), that they
must be taken in the same sense in both places, i.e., not to have
insight in general, but by supplying הדּברים as the object from [Dan
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008.md), to have understanding of the
prophecy. This is denied of the wicked or the godless. Only the wise
shall gain it. Thus the angel says to Daniel for the purpose of calming
him regarding his non-understanding: - Calm thyself, Daniel, if thou
dost not understand these words. The prophecy shall be preserved for all
times to the end of the days. These times shall bring many tribulations,
to purify thy people; and though by these afflictions all shall not be
converted, but the wicked shall remain wicked still and shall not
understand the prophecy, yet the wise shall be purified and made white
by the afflictions, and the longer they are tried the better shall they
learn to understand the prophecy. Thus, though thou thyself
understandest it not, yet it shall be a source of great blessing to the
people of God, and in all times, even unto the end, they shall have more
and more an understanding of it.

Thus has Kliefoth rightly presented the meaning of both verses, and in
confirmation of this interpretation has referred to [Pe1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md),[Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md), where, with reference to the
passage before us (cf. Hengstenberg, Beitrag. i. p. 273f.), it is said
that the prophets received the prophecies of the end not for themselves
alone, but much rather for "us," for those who come after.

[Daniel 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 12:11</span></span>

The angel gives to the prophet yet one revelation more regarding the
duration of the time of tribulation and its end, which should help him
to understand the earlier answer. The words, "from the time that the
daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination of the
desolation," so distinctly point back to [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md), that they must here be
referred, as there, to the wickedness of Antiochus in his desecrating
the sanctuary of the Lord. The circumstance that the שׁקּוּץ
(abomination) is here described as שׁמם and in [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md) as משׁמם, indicates no material
distinction. In [Dan 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md), where the
subject spoken of is the proceedings of the enemy of God causing
desolation, the abomination is viewed as משׁמם, bringing desolation;
here, with reference to the end of those proceedings, as שׁמם, brought
to desolation; cf. under [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md).
All interpreters therefore have found in these two verses statements
regarding the duration of the persecutions carried on by Antiochus
Epiphanes, and have sought to compare them with the period of 2300
evening-mornings mentioned in [Dan
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md), in order thus to reckon the
duration of the time during which this enemy of God shall prosecute his
wicked designs.

But as the opinion is regarding the reckoning of the 2300
evening-mornings in [Dan 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md) are very
diverse from each other, so also are they here. First the interpretation
of ולתת (and set up) is disputed. Wieseler is decidedly wrong in
thinking that it designates the terminsu ad quem to הוּסר מעת (from the
time shall be removed), as is generally acknowledged. Hitzig thinks that
with ולתת the foregoing infin. הוּסר is continued, as [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md); [Jer
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md); [Jer
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#012.md), and therewith a second terminus
a quo supposed. This, however, is only admissible if this second
terminus stands in union with the first, and a second terminus ad quem
also stands over against it as the parallel to the later terminus ad
quem. Both here denote: the daily sacrifice shall be taken away
forty-five days before the setting up of the βδέλυγμα ἐρημώσεως, and by
so much the date in [Dan 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md) comes
below that of [Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md). According to
this, both verses are to be understood thus: from the time of the taking
away of the daily sacrifice as 1290 days, and from the time of the
setting up of the abomination of desolation are 1335 days. But this
interpretation is utterly destitute of support. In the first place,
Hitzig has laid its foundation, that the setting up of the
idol-abomination is separated from the cessation of the worship of
Jehovah by forty-five days, only by a process of reasoning in a circle.
In the second place, the המחכּה אשׁרי (blessed is he that waiteth), [Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md), decidedly opposes the combining
of the 1335 days with the setting up of the idol-abomination; and
further, the grammatical interpretation of ולתת is not justified. The
passages quoted in its favour are all of a different character; there a
clause with definite time always goes before, on which the infinitive
clause depends. Kranichfeld seeks therefore to take הוּסר also not as an
infinitive, but as a relative asyndetical connection of the praeter.
proph. to עת, by which, however, no better result is gained. For with
the relative interpretation of הוּסר: the time, since it is taken away
... ולתת cannot so connect itself that this infinitive yet depends on
עת. The clause beginning with ולתת cannot be otherwise interpreted than
as a final clause dependent on וגו הוּסר מעת; thus here and in [Dan
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016.md), as in the passages quoted by
Hitzig, in the sense: to set (to set up) the abomination, so that the
placing of the abomination of desolation is viewed as the object of the
taking away of the תּמיד (daily sacrifice). From this grammatically
correct interpretation of the two clauses it does not, however, follow
that the setting up of the idol-abomination first followed later than
the removal of the daily sacrifice, so that ולתת signified "to set up
afterwards," as Kliefoth seeks to interpret it for the purpose of
facilitating the reckoning of the 1290 days. Both can be done at the
same time, the one immediately after the other.

A terminus ad quem is not named in both of the definitions. This appears
from the words "blessed is he that waiteth ... ." By this it is said
that after the 1335 days the time of tribulation shall be past. Since
all interpreters rightly understand that the 1290 and the 1335 days have
the same terminus a quo, and thus that the 1290 days are comprehended in
the 1335, the latter period extending beyond the former by only
forty-five days; then the oppression cannot properly last longer than
1290 days, if he who reaches to the 1335 days is to be regarded as
blessed.

With regard to the reckoning of these two periods of time, we have
already shown that neither the one nor the other accords with the 2300
evening-mornings, and that there is no ground for reckoning those 2300
evening-mornings for the sake of these verses before us as 1150 days.
Moreover, we have there already shown how the diversity of the two
statements is explained from this, that in [Dan
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md) a different terminus a quo is
named from that in [Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md).; and
besides have remarked, that according to 1 Macc. 1:54, 59, cf. with
4:52, the cessation of the Mosaic order of worship by sacrifice lasted
for a period of only three years and ten days. Now if these three years
and ten days are reckoned according to the sun-year at 365 days, or
according to the moon-year at 354 days with the addition of an
intercalary month, they amount to 1105 or 1102 days. The majority of
modern interpreters identify, it is true, the 1290 days with the 3 1/2
times (= years), and these two statements agree so far, since 3 1/2
years make either 1279 or 1285 days. But the identifying of the two is
not justified. In [Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md) the
subject plainly is the taking away of the worship of Jehovah and the
setting up of the worship of idols in its stead, for which the Maccabean
times furnish an historical fulfilment; in [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md),however, the angel speaks of a
tribulation which extends so far that the strength of the holy people is
altogether broken, which cannot be said of the oppression of Israel by
Antiochus, since a stop was put to the conduct of this enemy by the
courageous revolt of the Maccabees, and the power of valiant men put an
end to the abomination of the desolation of the sanctuary. The
oppression mentioned in [Dan 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md)
corresponds not only in fact, but also with respect to its duration,
with the tribulation which the hostile king of the time of the end, who
shall arise from the fourth world-kingdom, shall bring upon the holy
people, since, as already remarked, the 3 1/2 times literally correspond
with [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md). But [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md) and [Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md) treat of a different, namely, an
earlier, period of oppression than [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md), so the 1290 and the 1335 days
are not reckoned after the 3 1/2 times ([Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011) and Daniel 7:35.md); and for the
Maccabean period of tribulation there remain only the 2300
evening-mornings ([Dan 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014).md) for
comparison, if we count the evening-mornings, contrary to the usage of
the words, as half-days, and so reduce them to 1150 days. But if
herewith we take into consideration the historical evidence of the
duration of the oppression under Antiochus, the 1290 days would agree
with it only if we either fix the taking away of the legal worship from
185 to 188 days, i.e., six months and five or eight days, before the
setting up of the idol-altar on Jehovah's altar of burnt-offering, or,
if these two facta occurred simultaneously, extend the terminus ad quem
by six months and five or eight days beyond the day of the
re-consecration of the altar. For both suppositions historical evidence
is wanting. The former is perhaps probable from 1 Macc. 4:45, cf. with
v. 54; but, on the contrary, for the second, history furnishes no
epoch-making event of such significance as that the cessation of the
oppression could be defined by it.

The majority of modern interpreters, in the reckoning of the 1290 and
the 1335 days, proceed from [Dan 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md),
and with them Kliefoth holds, firstly, that the 2300 evening-mornings
are 1150 days, the termination of which constitutes the epoch of the
re-consecration of the temple, on the 25th of the month Kisleu of the
year 148 of the Seleucidan aera (i.e., 164 b.c.); and secondly, he
supposes that the terminus a quo of the 2300 evening-mornings ([Dan
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md) and of the 1290 or 1335 days is
the same, namely, the taking of Jerusalem by Apollonius (1 Macc.
1:29ff.), and the setting aside of the תּמיד which followed immediately
after it was taken, about 140 days earlier than the setting up of the
idol-altar. As the terminus ad quem of the 2300 evening-mornings the
re-consecration of the temple is taken, with which the power of
Antiochus over Israel was broken, and the beginning of the restoration
made. No terminus ad quem is named in this passage before us, but
perhaps it lies in the greater number of the days, as well as in this,
that this passage speaks regarding the entire setting aside of the power
of Antiochus-an evidence and a clear argument for this, that in [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), [Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md) a further terminus ad quem,
reaching beyond the purification of the temple, is to be supposed. This
terminus is the death of Antiochus. "It is true," Kliefoth further
argues, "we cannot establish it to a day and an hour, that between the
putting away of the daily sacrifice and the death of Antiochus 1290 days
intervened, since of both facta we do not know the date of the day. But
this we know from the book of the Maccabees, that the consecration of
the temple took place on the 25th day of the month Kisleu in the 148th
year of the Seleucidan aera, and that Antiochus died in the 149th year;
and if we now add the 140 days, the excess of 2300 above 1290 after the
consecration of the temple, we certainly come into the year 149. The
circumstance also, that in the whole connection of this chapter the
tendency is constantly toward the end of Antiochus, the Antichrist,
induces us to place the death of that persecutor as the terminus ad quem
of the 1290 days. Consequently we shall not err if, with Bleek, Kirmss,
Hitzig, Delitzsch, Hofmann, Auberlen, Zndel, we suppose, that as the
purifying of the temple is the end of the 2300 evening-mornings, so the
death of Antiochus is the end of the 1290 days. The end of the 1335
days, [Dan 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md), must then be an
event which lies forty-five days beyond the death of Antiochus, and
which certainly attests the termination of the persecution under
Antiochus and the commencement of better days, and which at least bears
clear evidence of the introduction of a better time, and of a settled
and secure state of things. We are not able to adduce proof of such a
definite event which took place exactly fort-five days after the death
of Antiochus, simply because we do not know the date of the death of
Antiochus. The circumstances, however, of the times after the death of
Antiochus furnish the possibility of such an event. The successor of
Antiochus Epiphanes, Antiochus Eupator, certainly wrote to the Jews,
after they had vanquished his host under Lysias, asking from them a
peace; but the alienation between them continued nevertheless, and did
not absolutely end till the victory over Nicanor, 2 Macc. 11-15. Hence
there was opportunity enough for an event of the kind spoken of, though
we may not be able, from the scantiness and the chronological
uncertainty of the records of these times, to prove it positively."
Hereupon Kliefoth enters upon the conjectures advanced by Hitzig
regarding the unknown joyful event, and finds that nothing important can
be brought forward in opposition to this especially, that the
termination of the 1335 days may be the point of time when the tidings
of the death of Antiochus, who died in Babylonia, reached the Jews in
Palestine, and occasioned their rejoicing, since it might easily require
forty-five days to carry the tidings of that even to Jerusalem; and
finally he throws out the question, whether on the whole the more
extended period of 1335 days must have its termination in a single
definite event, whether by the extension of the 1290 days by fort-five
days the meaning may not be, that whoever lives beyond this period of
1290 days, i.e., the death of Antiochus, in patience and in fidelity to
the truth, is to be esteemed blessed. "The forty-five days were then
only added to express the living beyond that time, and the form of this
expression was chosen for the purpose of continuing that contained in
[Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md)."

We cannot, however, concur in this view, because not only is its
principal position without foundation, but also its contents are
irreconcilable with historical facts. To change the 2300
evening-mornings into 1150 days cannot be exegetically justified,
because according to the Hebrew mode of computation evening and morning
do not constitute a half but a whole day. But if the 2300
evening-mornings are to be reckoned as so many days, then neither their
terminus a quo nor their terminus ad quem stands in a definite relation
to the 1290 days, from which a conclusion may be drawn regarding the
terminus ad quem of the latter. Then the death of Antiochus Epiphanes
does not furnish a turning-point for the commencement of a better time.
According to 1 Macc. 6:18-54, the war against the Jews was carried on by
his successor Eupator more violently than before. And on the news that
Philippus, returning from Persia, sought to deprive him of the
government, Lysias advised the king to make peace with the Jews, and to
promise to them that they would be permitted to live according to their
own laws. On this the Jews opened the citadel of Zion; but the king,
after he had entered into it, violated his oath, and ordered its walls
to be demolished. It was not till two years after the death of Antiochus
Epiphanes that Judas gained a decisive victory over Nicanor, which was
celebrated by the Jews by a joyful festival, which they resolved to keep
every year in memory of that victory (1 Macc. 7:26-50). In these
circumstances it is wholly impossible to suppose an event forty-five
days after the death of Antiochus which could clearly be regarded as the
beginning of a better time, and of a settled and secure state of things,
or to regard the reception in Palestine of the news of the death of
Antiochus as an event so joyful, that they were to be esteemed as
blessed who should live to hear the tidings.

After all, we must oppose the opinion that the 1290 and the 1335 days
are to be regarded as historical and to be reckoned chronologically, ad
we are decidedly of opinion that these numbers are to be interpreted
symbolically, notwithstanding that days as a measure of time are named.
This much seems to be certain, that the 1290 days denote in general the
period of Israel's sorest affliction on the part of Antiochus Epiphanes
by the taking away of the Mosaic ordinance of worship and the setting up
of the worship of idols, but without giving a statement of the duration
of this oppression which can be chronologically reckoned. By the naming
of "days" instead of "times" the idea of an immeasurable duration of the
tribulation is set aside, and the time of it is limited to a period of
moderate duration which is exactly measured out by God. But this is more
strictly represented by the second definition, by which it is increased
by 45 days: 1335 days, with the expiry of which the oppression shall so
wholly cease, that every one shall be blessed who lives till these days
come. For 45 days have the same relation to 1290 that 1 1/2 have to 43,
and thus designate a proportionally very brief time. But as to this
relation, the two numbers themselves show nothing. If we reduce them to
the measure of time usual for the definition of longer periods, the 1290
days amount to 54 months, or 3 years and 7 months, and the 1335 days to
44 1/2 months, or 3 years and 8 1/2 months, since generally, and still
more in symbolical definitions of time, the year is wont to be reckoned
at 12 months, and the months at 30 days. Each of the two periods of time
thus amounts to a little more than 3 1/2 years; the first exceeds by 1
month and the second by 2 1/2 months, only a little more than the half
of 7 years - a period occurring several times in the O.T. as the period
of divine judgments. By the reduction of the days to years and parts of
a year the two expressions are placed in a distinct relation to the 3
1/2 times, which already appears natural by the connection of the two
questions in [Dan 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006.md), [Dan
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008.md). On the one hand, by the
circumstance that the 1290 days amount to somewhat more than 3 1/2
years, the idea that "times" stands for years is set aside; but on the
other hand, by the use of "days" as a measure of time, the obscurity of
the idea: time, times, and half a time, is lessened, and Daniel's
inquiry as to the end of the terrible things is answered in a way which
might help him to the understanding of the first answer, which was to
him wholly unintelligible.

Such an answer contains the two definitions of the time under the
supposition that the hostile undertakings of Antiochus against Judaism,
in their progress and their issue, form a type of the persecution of the
last enemy Antichrist against the church of the Lord, or that the taking
away of the daily sacrifice and the setting up of the idol-abomination
by Antiochus Epiphanes shows in a figure how the Antichrist at the time
of the end shall take away the worship of the true God, renounce the God
of his fathers, and make war his god, and thereby bring affliction upon
the church of God, of which the oppression which Antiochus brought upon
the theocracy furnished a historical pattern. But this typical relation
of the two periods of oppression is clearly set forth in Daniel
11:21-12:3, since in the conduct and proceedings of the hostile king two
stadia are distinguished, which so correspond to each other in all
essential points that the first, [Dan
11:21-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md), is related to the second,
Daniel 11:35-12:3, as the beginning and the first attempt is related to
the complete accomplishment. This also appears in the wars of this king
against the king of the south ([Dan
11:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025.md), cf. with [Dan
11:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md), and in the consequences
which this war had for his relation to the people of God. On his return
from the first victorious war against the south, he lifted up his heart
against the holy covenant ([Dan
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028).md), and being irritated by the
failure of the renewed war against the south and against the holy
covenant, he desolated the sanctuary (vv. 30, 31); finally, in the war
at the time of the end, when Egypt and the lands fell wholly under his
power, and when, alarmed by tidings from the east and the north, he
thought to destroy many, he erected his palace - tent in the Holy Land,
so that he might here aim a destructive blow against all his enemies -
in this last assault he came to his end ([Dan
11:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md).

Yet more distinctly the typical relation shows itself in the description
of the undertakings of the enemy of God against the holy covenant, and
their consequences for the members of the covenant nation. In this
respect the first stadium of his enmity against the God of Israel
culminates in the taking away of His worship, and in the setting up of
the abomination of desolation, i.e., the worship of idols, in the
sanctuary of the Lord. Against this abomination the wise of the people
of God raise themselves up, and they bring by their rising up "a little
help," and accomplish a purification of the people ([Dan
11:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031).md). In the second stadium,
i.e., at the time of the end, the hostile king raises himself against
the God of gods, and above every god ([Dan
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#037).md), and brings upon the people of
God an oppression such as has never been from the beginning of the world
till now; but this oppression ends, by virtue of the help of the
archangel Michael, with the deliverance of the people of God and the
consummation by the resurrection of the dead, of some to everlasting
life, and of some to everlasting shame ([Dan
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md).

If thus the angel of the Lord, after he said to Daniel that he might
rest as to the non-understanding of his communication regarding the end
of the wonderful things ([Dan 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007).md),
because the prophecy shall at the time of the end give to the wise
knowledge for the purifying of many through the tribulation, so answers
the question of Daniel as to the אלּה אחרית that he defines in
symbolically significant numbers the duration of the sufferings from the
removal of the worship of Jehovah to the commencement of better times,
with which all oppression shall cease, then he gave therewith a measure
of time, according to which all those who have understanding, who have
lived through this time of oppression, or who have learned regarding it
from history, may be able to measure the duration of the last
tribulation and its end so far beforehand, as, according to the fatherly
and wise counsel of God, it is permitted to us to know the times of the
end and of our consummation. For, from the comparison of this passage
with that in [Dan 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md) regarding the
duration of the crushing under feet of the holy people by the enemy
rising from the Javanic world-kingdom, it is clear that as the 2300
evening-mornings do not contain a complete heptad of years, so the 1290
days contain only a little more than half a heptad. In this lies the
comfort, that the severest time of oppression shall not endure much
longer than half the time of the whole period of oppression. And if we
compare with this the testimony of history regarding the persecution of
the Old Covenant people under Antiochus, in consequence of which God
permitted the suppression of His worship, and the substitution of
idol-worship in its stead, for not fully 3 1/2 years, but only for 3
years and 10 days, then we are able to gather the assurance that He
shall also shorten, for the sake of His elect, the 3 1/2 times of the
last tribulation. We should rest here, that His grace is sufficient for
us ([Co2 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009).md). For as God revealed to
the prophets, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto us, the
sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow, that they might
search and inquire what and what manner of time the Spirit of Christ who
was in them did signify; so in the times of the accomplishment, we who
are living are not exempted from searching and inquiring, but are led by
the prophetic word to consider the signs of the times in the light of
this word, and from that which is already fulfilled, as well as from the
nature and manner of the fulfilment, to confirm our faith, for the
endurance amid the tribulations which prophecy has made known to us,
that God, according to His eternal gracious counsel, has measured them
according to their beginning, middle, and end, that thereby we shall be
purified and guarded for the eternal life.

[Daniel 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 12:13</span></span>

After these disclosures regarding the time of the end, the angel of the
Lord dismisses the highly-favoured prophet from his life's work with the
comforting assurance that he shall stand in his own lot in the end of
the days. לקּץ לך evidently does not mean "go to the end, i.e., go thy
way" (Hitzig), nor "go hence in relation to the end," as Kranichfeld
translates it, because לקּץ with the article points back to קץ עת, [Dan
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009.md). For though this reference were
placed beyond a doubt, yet לקּץ could only declare the end of the going:
go to the end, and the meaning could then with Ewald only be: "but go
thou into the grave till the end." But it is more simple, with Theodoret
and most interpreters, to understand לקּץ of the end of Daniel's life:
go to the end of thy life (cf. for the constr. of הלך with ל, [Sa1
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#018).md). With this ותנוּח simply
connects itself: and thou shalt rest, namely, in the grave, and rise
again. תּעמוד = תּקוּם, to rise up, sc. from the rest of the grave, thus
to rise again. לגורלך, in thy lot. גּורל, lot, of the inheritance
divided to the Israelites by lot, referred to the inheritance of the
saints in light ([Col 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012).md), which
shall be possessed by the righteous after the resurrection from the
dead, in the heavenly Jerusalem. הימים לקץ, to = at, the end of the
days, i.e., not = הימים אחרית, in the Messianic time, but in the last
days, when, after the judgment of the world, the kingdom of glory shall
appear. Well shall it be for us if in the end of our days we too are
able to depart hence with such consolation of hope!
