### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 1:1</span></span>

The title of the book at once denotes that it is a connected whole, and
is the work of one author. - [Sol 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001.md).
The Song of Songs, composed by Solomon. The genitival connection, "Song
of Songs," cannot here signify the Song consisting of a number of songs,
any more than calling the Bible "The Book of books" leads us to think of
the 24 + 27 canonical books of which it consists. Nor can it mean "one
of Solomon's songs;" the title, as it here stands, would then be the
paraphrase of שׁיר שׁירי שׁ, chosen for the purpose of avoiding the
redoubled genitives; but "one of the songs" must rather have been
expressed by שׁיר משּׁירי. It has already been rightly explained in the
Midrash:

(Note: Vid., Frst's Der Kanon des A. T. (1868), p. 86.)

"the most praiseworthy, most excellent, most highly-treasured among the
songs." The connection is superl. according to the sense (cf. ἄῤῥητα
ἀῤῥήτων of Sophocles), and signifies that song which, as such, surpasses
the songs one and all of them; as "servant of servants," [Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md), denotes a servant who is such
more than all servants together. The plur. of the second word is for
this superl. sense indispensable (vid., Dietrich's Abhand. zur hebr.
Gramm. p. 12), but the article is not necessary: it is regularly wanting
where the complex idea takes the place of the predicate, [Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md); [Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md), or of the inner member of a
genitival connection of words, [Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019.md); but it is also wanting in other
places, as [Eze 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007.md) and [Ecc
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#002.md); [Ecc
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008.md), where the indeterminate plur.
denotes not totality, but an unlimited number; here it was necessary,
because a definite Song - that, namely, lying before us - must be
designated as the paragon of songs. The relative clause, "asher
lishlōmō," does not refer to the single word "Songs" (Gr. Venet. τῶν
τοῦ), as it would if the expression were שׁיר מהשּׁ, but to the whole
idea of "the Song of Songs." A relative clause of similar formation and
reference occurs at [Kg1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002.md) : "These
are the princes, asher lo, which belonged to him (Solomon)." They who
deny the Solomonic authorship usually explain: The Song of Songs which
concerns or refers to Solomon, and point in favour of this
interpretation to lxx B. ὃ ἐστι Σαλ., which, however, is only a latent
genit., for which lxx A. τῷ Σαλ. Lamed may indeed introduce the
reference of a writing, as at [Jer
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md); but if the writing is more
closely designated as a "Song," "Psalm," and the like, then Lamed with
the name of a person foll. is always the Lamed auctoris; in this case
the idea of reference to, as e.g., at [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md), cf. [Kg1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013.md), is unequivocally expressed by
על. We shall find that the dramatized history which we have here, or as
we might also say, the fable of the melodrama and its dress, altogether
correspond with the traits of character, the favourite turns, the sphere
of vision, and the otherwise well-known style of authorship peculiar to
Solomon. We may even suppose that the superscription was written by the
author, and thus by Solomon himself. For in the superscription of the
Proverbs he is surnamed "son of David, king of Israel," and similarly in
Ecclesiastes. But he who entitles him merely "Solomon" is most probably
himself. On the other hand, that the title is by the author himself, is
not favoured by the fact that instead of the שׁ, everywhere else used in
the book, the fuller form asher is employed. There is the same reason
for this as for the fact that Jeremiah in his prophecies always uses
asher, but in the Lamentations interchanges שׁ with asher. This original
demonstrative שׁ is old-Canaanitish, as the Phoenician אש, arrested
half-way toward the form asher, shows.

(Note: From this it is supposed that asher is a pronom. root-cluster
equivalent to אשׁל. Fleischer, on the contrary, sees in asher an
original substantive athar = (Arab.) ithr, Assyr. asar, track, place, as
when the vulgar expression is used, "The man where (wo instead of
welcher) has said.")

In the Book of Kings it appears as a North Palest. provincialism, to the
prose of the pre-exilian literature it is otherwise foreign;

(Note: We do not take into view here [Gen
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md). If בּשׁגם is then to be read,
then there is in it the pronominal שׁ, as in the old proper name Mishael
(who is what God is?).)

but the pre-exilian shir and kinah (cf. also [Job
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#029).md) make use of it as an ornament.
In the post-exilian literature it occurs in poetry ([Psa
122:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003), etc..md) and in prose ([Ch1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020.md); [Ch1
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#027).md); in Ecclesiastes it is already
a component part of the rabbinism in full growth. In a pre-exilian
book-title שׁ in place of asher is thus not to be expected. On the other
hand, in the Song itself it is no sign of a post-exilian composition, as
Grtz supposes. The history of the language and literature refutes this.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 1:2</span></span>

From these words with which as a solo the first strophe begins:

Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth,

We at once perceive that she who here speaks is only one of many among
whom Solomon's kisses are distributed; for min is partitive, as e.g.,
[Exo 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#027.md) (cf. [Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md) and [Isa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009).md), with the underlying phrase
נשׁיקה נשׁק, osculum osculari = figere, jungere, dare. Nashak properly
means to join to each other and to join together, particularly mouth to
mouth. פּיהוּ is the parallel form of פּיו, and is found in prose as
well as in poetry; it is here preferred for the sake of the rhythm.
Bttcher prefers, with Hitzig, ישׁקני ("let him give me to drink"); but
"to give to drink with kisses" is an expression unsupported.

In line 2 the expression changes into an address:

For better is thy love than wine.

Instead of "thy love," the lxx render "thy breasts," for they had before
them the word written defectively as in the traditional text, and read
דּדּיך. Even granting that the dual dadayim or dadiym could be used in
the sense of the Greek μαστοί ([Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013).md),

(Note: Vid., my Handsch. Funde, Heft 2 (1862).)

of the breasts of a man (for which [Isa
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#012.md), Targ., furnishes no sufficient
authority); yet in the mouth of a woman it were unseemly, and also is
itself absurd as the language of praise. But, on the other hand, that
דּדיך is not the true reading ("for more lovely - thus he says to me -
are," etc.), R. Ismael rightly says, in reply to R. Akiba, Aboda zara
29b, and refers to שׁמניך following ([Sol
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003).md), which requires the mas. for
דדיך. Rightly the Gr. Venet. οἱ σοὶ ἔρωτες, for דּודים is related to
אהבח, almost as ἔρως to ἀγάπη, Minne to Liebe. It is a plur. like חיּים,
which, although a pluraletantum, is yet connected with the plur. of the
pred. The verbal stem דוד is an abbreviated reduplicative stem (Ewald,
118. 1); the root דו appears to signify "to move by thrusts or pushes"
(vid., under [Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005).md); of a fluid,
"to cause to boil up," to which the word דּוּד, a kitchen-pot, is
referred.

(Note: Yet it is a question whether דד, to love, and דד, the breast
(Arab. thady, with a verb thadiyi, to be thoroughly wet), are not after
their nearest origin such words of feeling, caressing, prattling, as the
Arab. dad, sport (also dadad, the only Arab. word which consists of the
same three letters); cf. Fr. dada, hobby-horse.)

It is the very same verbal stem from which דּיד (David), the beloved,
and the name of the foundress of Carthage, דּידה ( = דּידון) Minna, is
derived. The adj. tov appears here and at 3a twice in its nearest
primary meaning, denoting that which is pleasant to the taste and (thus
particularly in Arab.) to the smell.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 1:3</span></span>

This comparison suaves prae vino, as well as that which in line 3 of the
pentastich, [Sol 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003.md),

To smell thy ointments are sweet

shows that when this song is sung wine is presented and perfumes are
sprinkled; but the love of the host is, for those who sing, more
excellent than all. It is maintained that ריח signifies fragrance
emitted, and not smell. Hence Hengst., Hahn, Hlem., and Zck. explain: in
odour thy ointments are sweet. Now the words can certainly, after [Jos
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#010.md); [Job
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004.md); [Kg1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023), mean "sweet in (of.md) smell;" but
in such cases the word with Lamed of reference naturally stands after
that to which it gives the nearer reference, not as here before it.
Therefore Hengst.: ad odorem unguentorem tuorum quod attinet bonus est,
but such giving prominence to the subject and attraction (cf. [Sa1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004.md); [Job
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020).md) exclude one another; the
accentuation correctly places לריה out of the gen. connection. Certainly
this word, like the Arab. ryḥ, elsewhere signifies odor, and the Hiph.
הריח (araḥ) odorari; but why should not ריח be also used in the sense of
odoratus, since in the post-bibl. Heb. הריח חושׁ means the sense of
smell, and also in Germ. "riechen" means to emit fragrance as well as to
perceive fragrance? We explain after [Gen
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009.md), where Lamed introduces the sense
of sight, as here the sense of smell. Zckl. and others reply that in
such a case the word would have been לריח; but the art. is wanting also
at [Gen 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009.md) (cf. [Sol
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006).md), and was not necessary,
especially in poetry, which has the same relation to the art. as to
asher, which, wherever practicable, is omitted.

Thus in line 4:

An ointment poured forth is thy name.

By "thy ointments," line 3, spices are meant, by which the palace was
perfumed; but the fragrance of which, as line 4 says, is surpassed by
the fragrance of his name. שׁם (name) and שׁמן (fragrance) form a
paranomasia by which the comparison is brought nearer [Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md). Both words are elsewhere mas.;
but sooner than שׁם, so frequently and universally mas. (although its
plur. is שׁמות, but cf. אבות), שׁמן may be used as fem., although a
parallel example is wanting (cf. devǎsh, mōr, nōphěth, kěmāh, and the
like, which are constantly mas.). Ewald therefore translates שמן תורק as
a proper name: "O sweet Salbenduft" Fragrance of Ointment; and Bttcher
sees in turǎk a subst. in the sense of "sprinkling" \[Spreng-Oel\]; but
a name like "Rosenoel" \[oil of roses\] would be more appropriately
formed, and a subst. form תורק is, in Heb. at least, unexampled (for
neither תּוּגה nor תּוּבל, in the name Tubal-Cain, is parallel). Frst
imagines "a province in Palestine where excellent oil was got," called
Turak; "Turkish" Rosenl recommends itself, on the contrary, by the fact
of its actual existence. Certainly less is hazarded when we regard
shěměn, as here treated exceptionally, as fem.; thus, not: ut unguentum
nomen tuum effunditur, which, besides, is unsuitable, since one does not
empty out or pour out a name; but: unguentum quod effunditur (Hengst.,
Hahn, and others), an ointment which is taken out of its depository and
is sprinkled far and wide, is thy name. The harsh expression שׁמן מוּרק
is intentionally avoided; the old Heb. language is not φιλομέτοχος (fond
of participles); and, besides, מורק sounds badly with מרק, to rub off,
to wash away. Perhaps, also, יוּרק שׁמן is intentionally avoided,
because of the collision of the weak sounds n and j. The name Shēm is
derived from the verb shāmā, to be high, prominent, remarkable: whence
also the name for the heavens (vid., under [Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002).md). That attractive charm (lines 2,
3), and this glory (line 4), make him, the praised, an object of general
love, line 5, [Sol 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003.md) :

Therefore virgins love thee.

This "therefore" reminds us of Ps 45. עלמות (sing. [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)), from עלם (Arab..md), ghalima,
pubescere, are maidens growing to maturity. The intrans. form אהבוּך,
with transitive signification, indicates a pathos. The perf. is not to
be translated dilexerunt, but is to be judged of according to Gesen.
126. 3: they have acquired love to thee (= love thee), as the ἠγάπησάν
σε of the Greek translators is to be understood. The singers themselves
are the evidence of the existence of this love.

With these words the first pentastich of the table-song terminates. The
mystical interpretation regards it as a song of praise and of loving
affection which is sung to Christ the King, the fairest of the children
of men, by the church which is His own. The Targum, in line first,
thinks of the "mouth to mouth" \[[Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008.md)\] in the intercourse of Moses
with God. Evidence of divine love is also elsewhere thought of as a
kiss: the post-bibl. Heb. calls the gentlest death the death בנשׁיקה,
i.e., by which God takes away the soul with a kiss.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 1:4</span></span>

The second pentastich also begins with a solo:

4 Draw me, so will we run after thee.

All recent interpreters (except Bttcher) translate, like Luther, "Draw
me after thee, so we run." Thus also the Targ., but doubtfully: Trahe
nos post te et curremus post viam bonitatis tuae. But the accentuation
which gives Tiphcha to משׁ requires the punctuation to be that adopted
by the Peshito and the Vulg., and according to which the passage is
construed by the Greeks (except, perhaps, by the Quinta): Draw me, so
will we, following thee, run (vid., Dachselt, Biblia Accentuata, p. 983
s.). In reality, this word needs no complement: of itself it already
means, one drawing towards, or to himself; the corresponding (Arab.)
masak signifies, prehendere prehensumque tenere; the root is מש,
palpare, contrectare. It occurs also elsewhere, in a spiritual
connection, as the expression of the gentle drawing of love towards
itself ([Hos 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md); [Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003).md); cf. ἑλκύειν, [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md); [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md). If one connects "after thee"
with "draw me," then the expression seems to denote that a certain
violence is needed to bring the one who is drawn from her place; but if
it is connected with "we will run," then it defines the desire to run
expressed by the cohortative, more nearly than a willing obedience or
following. The whole chorus, continuing the solo, confesses that there
needs only an indication of his wish, a direction given, to make those
who here speak eager followers of him whom they celebrate.

In what follows, this interchange of the solo and the unisono is
repeated:

4b If the king has brought me into his chambers,

So will we exult and rejoice in thee.

We will praise thy love more than wine!

Uprightly have they loved thee.

The cohortative נרוּצה (we will run) was the apodosis imperativi; the
cohortatives here are the apodosis perfecti hypothetici. "Suppose that
this has happened," is oftener expressed by the perf. ([Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md); [Pro
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029.md); [Pro
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016).md); "suppose that this happens,"
by the fut. ([Job 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024); Ewald, 357b.md).
חדרי are the interiora domus; the root word hhādǎr, as the Arab. khadar
shows, signifies to draw oneself back, to hide; the hhěděr of the tent
is the back part, shut off by a curtain from the front space. Those who
are singing are not at present in this innermost chamber. But if the
king brings one of them in (הביא, from בּוא, introire, with acc. loci),
then - they all say - we will rejoice and be glad in thee. The
cohortatives are better translated by the fut. than by the conjunctive
(exultemus); they express as frequently not what they then desire to do,
but what they then are about to do, from inward impulse, with heart
delight. The sequence of ideas, "exult" and "rejoice," is not a climax
descendens, but, as [Psa 118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024.md), etc.,
an advance from the external to the internal, - from jubilation which
can be feigned, to joy of heart which gives it truth; for שׂמח -
according to its root signification: to be smoothed, unwrinkled, to be
glad

(Note: Vid., Friedr. Delitzsch's Indo-german.-sem. Studien (1873), p.
99f.)

\- means to be of a joyful, bright, complaisant disposition; and גּיל,
cogn. חיל, to turn (wind) oneself, to revolve, means conduct betokening
delight. The prep. ב in verbs of rejoicing, denotes the object on
account of which, and in which, one has joy. Then, if admitted into the
closest neighbourhood of the king, they will praise his love more than
wine. זכר denotes to fix, viz., in the memory; Hiph.: to bring to
remembrance, frequently in the way of praise, and thus directly
equivalent to celebrare, e.g., Ps. 45:18. The wine represents the gifts
of the king, in contradistinction to his person. That in inward love he
gives himself to them, excels in their esteem all else he gives. For, as
the closing line expresses, "uprightly they love thee," - viz. they love
thee, i.e., from a right heart, which seeks nothing besides, and nothing
with thee; and a right mind, which is pleased with thee, and with
nothing but thee. Heiligstedt, Zckler, and others translate: with right
they love thee. But the pluralet. מישׁרים (from מישׁר, for which the
sing. מישׁור occurs) is an ethical conception ([Pro
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003).md), and signifies, not: the right of
the motive, but: the rightness of the word, thought, and act ([Pro
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#016.md); [Psa
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002.md); [Psa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002).md); thus, not: jure; but: recte,
sincere, candide. Hengst., Thrupp, and others, falsely render this word
like the lxx, Aquil., Symm., Theod., Targ., Jerome, Venet., and Luther,
as subject: rectitudes abstr. for concr. = those who have rectitude, the
upright. Hengstenberg's assertion, that the word never occurs as in
adv., is set aside by a glance at [Psa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002.md); [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md); and, on the other hand, there is
no passage in which it is sued as abstr. pro concr. It is here, as
elsewhere, an adv. acc. for which the word בּמישׁרים might also be used.

The second pentastich closes similarly with the first, which ended with
"love thee." What is there said of this king, that the virgins love him,
is here more generalized; for diligunt te is equivalent to diligeris
(cf. [Sol 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001.md), [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007).md). With these words the table-song
ends. It is erotic, and yet so chaste and delicate, - it is sensuous,
and yet so ethical, that here, on the threshold, we are at once
surrounded as by a mystical cloudy brightness. But how is it to be
explained that Solomon, who says ([Pro
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#002).md), "Let another praise thee, and
not thine own mouth," begins this his Song of Songs with a song in
praise of himself? It is explained from this, that here he celebrates an
incident belonging to the happy beginning of his reign; and for him so
far fallen into the past, although not to be forgotten, that what he was
and what he now is are almost as two separate persons.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 1:5</span></span>

After this choral song, Shulamith, who has listened to the singers not
without being examined by their inquisitive glances as a strange guest
not of equal rank with them, now speaks:

5 Black am I, yet comely, ye daughters of Jerusalem,

As the tents of Kedar, as the hangings of Solomon.

From this, that she addresses the ladies of the palace as "daughters of
Jerusalem" (Kerı̂ ירושׁלים, a du. fractus; like עפרין for עפרון, [Ch2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019).md), it is to be concluded that
she, although now in Jerusalem, came from a different place. She is, as
will afterwards appear, from Lower Galilee; - and it may be remarked, in
the interest of the mystical interpretation, that the church, and
particularly her first congregations, according to the prophecy, was
also Galilean, for Nazareth and Capernaum are their original seats; -
and if Shulamith is a poetico-mystical Mashal or emblem, then she
represents the synagogue one day to enter into the fellowship of Solomon
- i.e., of the son of David, and the daughters of Jerusalem, i.e., the
congregation already believing on the Messiah. Yet we confine ourselves
to the nearest sense, in which Solomon relates a self-experience.
Shulamith, the lightly esteemed, cannot boast that she is so ruddy and
fair of countenance as they who have just sung how pleasant it is to be
beloved by this king; but yet she is not so devoid of beauty as not to
venture to love and hope to be loved: "Black am I, yet comely." These
words express humility without abjectness. She calls herself "black,"
although she is not so dark and unchangeably black as an "Ethiopian"
([Jer 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023).md). The verb שׁחר has the
general primary idea of growing dark, and signifies not necessarily
soot-blackness (modern Arab. shuhwar, soot), but blackness more or less
deep, as שׁחר, the name of the morning twilight, or rather the morning
grey, shows; for (Arab.) saḥar

(Note: After an improbable etymology of the Arab., from saḥar, to turn,
to depart, "the departure of the night" (Lane). Magic appears also to be
called sihar, as nigromantia (Mediaev. from nekromantia), the black
art.)

denotes the latter, as distinguished from (Arab.) fajr, the morning
twilight (vid., under [Isa 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md); [Isa
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#011).md). She speaks of herself as a
Beduin who appears to herself as (Arab.) sawda, black, and calls

(Note: The houri (damsel of paradise) is thus called ḥawaryyt, adj.
relat. from ḥawra, from the black pupil of the eye in the centre of the
white eyeball.)

the inhabitants of the town (Arab.) ḥawaryyat (cute candidas). The Vav
we have translated "yet" ("yet comely"); it connects the opposite, which
exists along with the blackness. נאוה is the fem. of the adj. נאוה =
נאוה = נאוי, which is also formed by means of the doubling of the third
stem-letter of נאה = נאו, נאי (to bend forward, to aim; to be
corresponding to the aim, conformable, becoming, beautiful), e.g., like
רענן, to be full of sap, green. Both comparisons run parallel to nigra
et bella; she compares on the one hand the tents of Kedar, and on the
other the tapestry of Solomon. אהל signifies originally, in general, the
dwelling-place, as בּית the place where one spends the night; these two
words interchange: ohel is the house of the nomad, and baith is the tent
of him who is settled. קדר (with the Tsere, probably from (Arab.) ḳadar,
to have ability, be powerful, though of after the Heb. manner, as
Theodoret explains and Symm. also translates: σκοτασμός, from (Heb.)
Kadar, atrum esse) is the name of a tribe of North. Arab. Ishmaelites
([Gen 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#013).md) whom Pliny speaks of
(Cedraei in his Hist. Nat. [Sol 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#011).md),
but which disappeared at the era of the rise of Islam; the Karaite
Jefeth uses for it the word (Arab.) Ḳarysh, for he substitutes the
powerful Arab tribe from which Muhammed sprung, and rightly remarks:
"She compares the colour of her skin to the blackness of the hair tents
of the Koreishites," - even to the present day the Beduin calls his tent
his "hair-house" (bêt wabar, or, according to a more modern expression,
bêt sa'r, שׂער בּית); for the tents are covered with cloth made of the
hair of goats, which are there mostly black-coloured or grey. On the one
hand, dark-coloured as the tents of the Kedarenes, she may yet, on the
other hand, compare herself to the beautiful appearance of the יריעות of
Solomon. By this word we will have to think of a pleasure-tent or
pavilion for the king; pavillon (softened from Lat. papilio) is a
pleasure-tent spread out like the flying butterfly. This Heb. word could
certainly also mean curtains for separating a chamber; but in the
tabernacle and the temple the curtains separating the Most Holy from the
Holy Place were not so designated, but are called פּרכת and מסך; and as
with the tabernacle, so always elsewhere, יריעות (from ירע, to tremble,
to move hither and thither) is the name of the cloths or tapestry which
formed the sides of the tent ([Isa
54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002).md); of the tent coverings, which
were named in parall. with the tents themselves as the clothing of their
framework ([Hab 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#007.md); [Jer
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md); [Jer
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020.md); [Jer
49:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#029).md). Such tent hangings will thus
also be here meant; precious, as those described Ex 26 and 36, and as
those which formed the tabernacle on Zion (2 Sam 7; cf. [Ch1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#001).md) before the erection of the
temple. Those made in Egypt

(Note: Vid., Wetzstein's Isaiah (1869), p. 698.)

were particularly prized in ancient times.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 1:6</span></span>

Shulamith now explains, to those who were looking upon her with
inquisitive wonder, how it is that she is swarthy:

6a Look not on me because I am black,

Because the sun has scorched me.

If the words were בי (תּראינה) אל־תּראוּ, then the meaning would be:
look not at me, stare not at me. But אל־תּראני, with שׁ (elsewhere כּי)
following, means: Regard me not that I am blackish (subnigra); the
second שׁ is to be interpreted as co-ordin. with the first (that ...
that), or assigning a reason, and that objectively (for). We prefer,
with Bttch., the former, because in the latter case we would have had
שׁהשׁמשׁ. The quinqueliterum שׁחרחרת signifies, in contradistinction to
שׁחור, that which is black here and there, and thus not altogether
black. This form, as descriptive of colour, is diminutive; but since it
also means id quod passim est, if the accent lies on passim, as
distinguished from raro, it can be also taken as increasing instead of
diminishing, as in יפיפה, הפכפּך. The lxx trans. παρέβλεπσέ (Symm.
παρανέβλεπσέ) με ὁ ἣλιος: the sun has looked askance on me. But why only
askance? The Venet. better: κατεῖδέ με; but that is too little. The look
is thought of as scorching; wherefore Aquila: συνέκαυσέ με, it has burnt
me; and Theodotion: περιέφρυξέ με, it has scorched me over and ov. שׁזף
signifies here not adspicere ([Job
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#009.md); [Job
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#010).md) so much as adurere. In this
word itself (cogn. שׁדף; Arab. sadaf, whence asdaf, black; cf. דּעך and
זעך, [Job 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001).md), the looking is
thought of as a scorching; for the rays of the eye, when they fix upon
anything, gather themselves, as it were, into a focus. Besides, as the
Scriptures ascribe twinkling to the morning dawn, so it ascribes eyes to
the sun ([Sa2 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011).md), which is itself
as the eye of the heavens.

(Note: According to the Indian idea, it is the eye of Varuna; the eye
(also after Plato: ἡλιοειδέστατον τῶν περὶ τὰς αἰσθήσεις οργάνων) is
regarded as taken from the sun, and when men die returning to the sun
(Muir in the Asiatic Journal, 1865, p. 294, S. 309).)

The poet delicately represents Shulamith as regarding the sun as fem.
Its name in Arab. and old Germ. is fem., in Heb. and Aram. for the most
part mas. My lady the sun, she, as it were, says, has produced on her
this swarthiness.

She now says how it has happened that she is thus sunburnt:

6b My mother's sons were angry with me,

Appointed me as keeper of the vineyards -

Mine own vineyard have I not kept.

If "mother's sons" is the parallel for "brothers" (אחי), then the
expressions are of the same import, e.g., [Gen
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md); but if the two expressions
stand in apposition, as Deut. 13:76, then the idea of the natural
brother is sharpened; but when "mother's sons" stands thus by itself
alone, then, after [Lev 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009.md), it means
the relationship by one of the parents alone, as "father's wife" in the
language of the O.T. and also [Co1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md)
is the designation of a step-mother. Nowhere is mention made of
Shulamith's father, but always, as here, only of her mother, [Sol
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004.md); [Sol
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002.md); [Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md); and she is only named without
being introduced as speaking. One is led to suppose that Shulamith's own
father was dead, and that her mother had been married again; the sons by
the second marriage were they who ruled in the house of their mother.
These brothers of Shulamith appear towards the end of the melodrama as
rigorous guardians of their youthful sister; one will thus have to
suppose that their zeal for the spotless honour of their sister and the
family proceeded from an endeavour to accustom the fickle or dreaming
child to useful activity, but not without step-brotherly harshness. The
form נחרוּ, Ewald, 193c, and Olsh. p. 593, derive from חרר, the Niph. of
which is either נחר or נחר (= נחרר), Gesen. 68, An. 5; but the plur. of
this נחר should, according to rule, have been נחרוּ (cf. however, נחלוּ,
profanantur, [Eze 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#024).md); and what is
more decisive, this נחר from חרר everywhere else expresses a different
passion from that of anger; Bttch. 1060 (2, 379). חרה is used of the
burning of anger; and that נחרוּ (from נחרה = נחרה) can be another form
for נחרוּ, is shown, e.g., by the interchange of אחרוּ and אחרוּ; the
form נחרוּ, like נחלוּ, [Amo 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006.md),
resisted the bringing together of the ח and the half guttural ר. Něhěrā
(here as [Isa 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#011.md); [Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024).md) means, according to the
original, mid. signif. of the Niph., to burn inwardly, ἀναφλέγεσθαι =
ὀργίζεσθαι. Shulamith's address consists intentionally of clauses with
perfects placed together: she speaks with childlike artlessness, and not
"like a book;" in the language of a book, וישׂמוּני would have been used
instead of שׂמני. But that she uses נטרה (from נטר, R. טר = τηρεῖν; cf.
Targ. [Gen 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#011.md) with [Luk
2:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#051).md), and not נחרה, as they were wont
to say in Judea, after [Pro 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#018.md), and
after the designation of the tower for the protection of the flocks by
the name of "the tower of the nōtsrīm" the watchmen, [Kg2
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009.md), shows that the maid is a
Galilean, whose manner of speech is Aramaizing, and if we may so say,
platt-Heb. (= Low Heb.), like the Lower Saxon plattdeutsch. Of the three
forms of the particip. נטרה, נוטרה, נוטרת, we here read the middle one,
used subst. (Ewald, 188b), but retaining the long ē (ground-form,
nâṭir). The plur. את־הךּ does not necessarily imply that she had several
vineyards to keep, it is the categ. plur. with the art. designating the
genus; custodiens vineas is a keeper of a vineyard. But what kind of
vineyard, or better, vine-garden, is that which she calls שׁלּי כּרמי,
i.e., meam ipsius vineam? The personal possession is doubly expressed;
shělli is related to cǎrmī as a nearer defining apposition: my vineyard,
that which belongs to me (vid., Fr. Philippi's Status constr. pp.
112-116). Without doubt the figure refers to herself given in charge to
be cared for by herself: vine-gardens she had kept, but her own
vine-garden, i.e., her own person, she had not kept. Does she indicate
thereby that, in connection with Solomon, she has lost herself, with all
that she is and has? Thus in 1851 I thought; but she certainly seeks to
explain why she is so sunburnt. She intends in this figurative way to
say, that as the keeper of a vineyard she neither could keep nor sought
to keep her own person. In this connection cǎarmī, which by no means =
the colourless memet ipsam, is to be taken as the figure of the person
in its external appearance, and that of its fresh-blooming attractive
appearance which directly accords with כּרם, since from the stem-word
כּרם (Arab.), karuma, the idea of that which is noble and distinguished
is connected with this designation of the planting of vines (for כּרם,
Arab. karm, cf. karmat, of a single vine-stock, denotes not so much the
soil in which the vines are planted, as rather the vines themselves):
her kěrěm is her (Arab.) karamat, i.e., her stately attractive
appearance. If we must interpret this mystically then, supposing that
Shulamith is the congregation of Israel moved at some future time with
love to Christ, then by the step-brothers we think of the teachers, who
after the death of the fathers threw around the congregation the fetters
of their human ordinances, and converted fidelity to the law into a
system of hireling service, in which all its beauty disappeared. Among
the allegorists, Hengstenberg here presents the extreme of an
interpretation opposed to what is true and fine.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 1:7</span></span>

These words ([Sol 1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005).md) are addressed
to the ladies of the palace, who look upon her with wonder. That which
now follows is addressed to her beloved:

7 O tell me, thou whom my soul loveth: where feedest thou?

Where causest thou it (thy flock) to lie down at noon?

Among the flocks of thy companions!

The country damsel has no idea of the occupation of a king. Her
simplicity goes not beyond the calling of a shepherd as of the fairest
and the highest. She thinks of the shepherd of the people as the
shepherd of sheep. Moreover, Scripture also describes governing as a
tending of sheep; and the Messiah, of whom Solomon is a type, is
specially represented as the future Good Shepherd. If now we had to
conceive of Solomon as present from the beginning of the scene, then
here in [Sol 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007.md) would Shulamith say
that she would gladly be alone with him, far away from so many who are
looking on her with open eyes; and, indeed, in some country place where
alone she feels at home. The entreaty "O tell me" appears certainly to
require (cf. [Gen 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#019).md) the presence
of one to whom she addresses herself. But, on the other hand, the
entreaty only asks that he should let her know where he is; she longs to
know where his occupation detains him, that she may go out and seek him.
Her request is thus directed toward the absent one, as is proved by [Sol
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md). The vocat., "O thou whom my soul
loveth," is connected with אתּה, which lies hid in הגּידה ("inform
thou"). It is a circumlocution for "beloved" (cf. [Neh
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#026).md), or "the dearly beloved of my
soul" (cf. [Jer 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007).md). The entreating
request, indica quaeso mihi ubi pascis, reminds one of [Gen
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#016.md), where, however, ubi is
expressed by איפה, while here by איכה, which in this sense is hap leg
For ubi = איפה, is otherwise denoted only by איכה (איכו), [Kg2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#013.md), and usually איּה, North Palest.,
by Hosea אהי. This איכה elsewhere means quomodo, and is the key-word of
the Kîna, as איך is of the Mashal (the satire); the Song uses for it, in
common with the Book of Esther, איככה. In themselves כה and כה, which
with אי preceding, are stamped as interrog. in a sense analogous to hic,
ecce, κεῖνος, and the like; the local, temporal, polite sense rests only
on a conventional usus loq., Bttch. 530. She wishes to know where he
feeds, viz., his flock, where he causes it (viz., his flock) to lie down
at mid-day. The verb רבץ (R. רב, with the root signif. of condensation)
is the proper word for the lying down of a four-footed animal:
complicatis pedibus procumbere (cubare); Hiph. of the shepherd, who
causes the flock to lie down; the Arab. rab'a is the name for the
encampment of shepherds. The time for encamping is the mid-day, which as
the time of the double-light, i.e., the most intense light in its
ascending and descending, is called צהרים. שׁלּמה, occurring only here,
signifies nam cur, but is according to the sense = ut ne, like למּה
אשׁר, [Dan 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#010.md) (cf. [Ezr
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#023).md); למּה, without Dag. forte
euphone., is, with the single exception of [Job
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020.md), always milra, while with the
Dag. it is milel, and as a rule, only when the following word begins
with הע''א carries forward the tone to the ult. Shulamith wishes to know
the place where her beloved feeds and rests his flock, that she might
not wander about among the flocks of his companions seeking and asking
for him. But what does כּעטיה mean? It is at all events the part. act.
fem. of עטי which is here treated after the manner of the strong verb,
the kindred form to the equally possible עטה (from 'âṭaja) and עטיּה. As
for the meaning, instar errabundae (Syr., Symm., Jerome, Venet., Luther)
recommends itself; but עטה must then, unless we wish directly to adopt
the reading כּטעיה (Bttch.), have been transposed from טעה (תעה), which
must have been assumed if עטה, in the usual sense of velare (cf. עטף),
did not afford an appropriate signification. Indeed, velans, viz., sese,
cannot denote one whom consciousness veils, one who is weak or fainting
(Gesen. Lex.), for the part. act. expresses action, not passivity. But
it can denote one who covers herself (the lxx, perhaps, in this sense ὡς
περιβαλλομένη), because she mourns (Rashi); or after [Gen
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014) (cf. Martial, 9:32.md) one who
muffles herself up, because by such affected apparent modesty she wishes
to make herself known as a Hierodoule or harlot. The former of these
significations is not appropriate; for to appear as mourning does not
offend the sense of honour in a virtuous maiden, but to create the
appearance of an immodest woman is to her intolerable; and if she bears
in herself the image of an only beloved, she shrinks in horror from such
a base appearance, not only as a debasing of herself, but also as a
desecration of this sanctuary in her heart. Shulamith calls entreatingly
upon him whom her soul loveth to tell her how she might be able directly
to reach him, without feeling herself wounded in the consciousness of
her maidenhood and of the exclusiveness of her love. It is thereby
supposed that the companions of her only beloved among the shepherds
might not treat that which to her is holy with a holy reserve, - a
thought to which Hattendorff has given delicate expression in his
exposition of the Song, 1867. If Solomon were present, it would be
difficult to understand this entreating call. But he is not present, as
is manifest from this, that she is not answered by him, but by the
daughters of Jerusalem.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 1:8</span></span>

8 If thou knowest not, thou fairest of women,

Go after the footprints of the flock,

And feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.

היּפה, standing in the address or call, is in the voc.; the art. was
indispensable, because "the beautiful one among women" = the one
distinguished for beauty among them, and thus is, according to the
meaning, superlative; cf. [Jdg 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015.md);
[Amo 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#016.md), with [Jdg
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024.md); [Luk
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028.md); Ewald, 313c. The verb יפה refers
to the fundamental idea: integrum, completum esse, for beauty consists
in well-proportioned fulness and harmony of the members. That the ladies
of the court are excited to speak thus may arise from this, that one
often judges altogether otherwise of a man, whom one has found not
beautiful, as soon as he begins to speak, and his countenance becomes
intellectually animated. And did not, in Shulamith's countenance, the
strange external swarthiness borrow a brightness from the inner light
which irradiated her features, as she gave so deep and pure an
expression to her longing? But the instruction which her childlike,
almost childish, navete deserved, the daughters of Jerusalem do not feel
disposed to give her. ידע לא signifies, often without the obj. supplied,
non sapere, e.g., [Psa 82:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#005.md); [Job
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009.md). The לך subjoined guards against
this inclusive sense, in which the phrase here would be offensive. This
dat. ethicus (vid., [Sol 2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010.md), [Sol
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013.md), [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md); [Sol
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006.md); [Sol
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014).md), used twice here in [Sol
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md) and generally in the Song,
reflects that which is said on the will of the subject, and thereby
gives to it an agreeable cordial turn, here one bearing the colour of a
gentle reproof: if thou knowest not to thee, - i.e., if thou, in thy
simplicity and retirement, knowest it not, viz., that he whom thou
thinkest thou must seek for at a distance is near to thee, and that
Solomon has to tend not sheep but people, - now, then, so go forth,
viz., from the royal city, and remain, although chosen to royal honours,
as a shepherdess beside thine own sheep and kids. One misapprehends the
answer if he supposes that they in reality point out the way to
Shulamith by which she might reach her object; on the contrary, they
answer her ironically, and, entering into her confusion of mind, tell
her that if she cannot apprehend the position of Solomon, she may just
remain what she is. עקב (Arab. 'aḳib), from עקב, to be convex, arched,
is the heel; to go in the heels (the reading fluctuates between the
form, with and without Dag. dirimens in ק) of one = to press hard after
him, to follow him immediately. That they assign to her not goats or
kids of goats, but kids, גּריּת, is an involuntary fine delicate thought
with which the appearance of the elegant, beautiful shepherdess inspires
them. But that they name kids, not sheep, may arise from this, that the
kid is a near-lying erotic emblem; cf. [Gen
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#017.md), where it has been fittingly
remarked that the young he-goat was the proper courtesan-offering in the
worship of Aphrodite (Movers' Phnizier, I 680). It is as if they said:
If thou canst not distinguish between a king and shepherds, then indulge
thy love-thoughts beside the shepherds' tents, - remain a country maiden
if thou understandest not how to value the fortune which has placed thee
in Jerusalem in the royal palace.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 1:9</span></span>

Solomon, while he was absent during the first scene, is now present. It
is generally acknowledged that the words which follow were spoken by
him:

9 To a horse in the chariot of Pharaoh Do I compare thee, my love.

10 Beautiful are thy cheeks in the chains, Thy neck in the necklaces.

11 Golden chains will we make for thee, With points of silv.

Till now, Shulamith was alone with the ladies of the palace in the
banqueting-chamber. Solomon now comes from the banquet-hall of the men
([Sol 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012).md); and to [Sol
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007.md), to which this scene extends, we
have to think of the women of the palace as still present, although not
hearing what Solomon says to Shulamith. He addresses her, "my love:" she
is not yet his bride. רעיה (female friend), from רעי (רעה), to guard,
care for, tend, ethically: to delight in something particularly, to take
pleasure in intercourse with one, is formed in the same way as נערה; the
mas. is רעה (= ra'j), abbreviated רע, whence the fem. rǎ'yāh ([Jdg
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#037); Chethı̂b.md), as well as rē'āh,
also with reference to the ground-form. At once, in the first words used
by Solomon, one recognises a Philip, i.e., a man fond of horses, - an
important feature in the character of the sage (vid., Sur. 38 of the
Koran), - and that, one fond of Egyptian horses: Solomon carried on an
extensive importation of horses from Egypt and other countries ([Ch2
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#028).md); he possessed 1400 war-chariots
and 12, 000 horsemen ([Kg1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026).md); the
number of stalls of horses for his chariots was still greater ([Kg1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006)) \[4:26\]. Horace (Ode iii. 11.md)
compares a young sprightly maiden to a nimble and timid equa trima;
Anacreon (60) addresses such an one: "thou Thracian filly;" and
Theocritus says (Idyl xviii. 30, 31):

"As towers the cypress mid the garden's bloom,

As in the chariot proud Thessalian steed,

Thus graceful rose-complexioned Helen moves."

But how it could occur to the author of the Song to begin the praise of
the beauty of a shepherdess by saying that she is like a horse in
Pharaoh's chariot, is explained only by the supposition that the poet is
Solomon, who, as a keen hippologue, had an open eye for the beauty of
the horse. Egyptian horses were then esteemed as afterwards the Arabian
were. Moreover, the horse was not native to Egypt, but was probably
first imported thither by the Hyksos: the Egyptian name of the horse,
and particularly of the mare, ses-t, ses-mut, and of the chariot,
markabuta, are Semitic.

(Note: Eber's Aegypten u. die B. Mose's, Bd. I pp. 221f. 226; cf. Aeg.
Zeitschr. 1864, p. 26f.)

סוּסה is here not equitatus (Jerome), as Hengst. maintains: "Susah does
not denote a horse, but is used collectively;" while he adds, "Shulamith
is compared to the whole Egyptian cavalry, and is therefore an ideal
person." The former statement is untrue, and the latter is absurd. Sūs
means equus, and susā may, indeed, collectively denote the stud (cf.
[Jos 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#005.md) with [Ch1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031).md), but obviously it first denotes
the equa. But is it to be rendered, with the lxx and the Venet., "to my
horse"? Certainly not; for the chariots of Pharaoh are just the chariots
of Egypt, not of the king of Israel. The Chirek in which this word
terminates is the Ch. compag., which also frequently occurs where, as
here and [Gen 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md), the second member
of the word-chain is furnished with a prep. (vid., under [Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001).md). This i is an old genitival
ending, which, as such, has disappeared from the language; it is almost
always accented as the suff. Thus also here, where the Metheg shows that
the accent rests on the ult. The plur. רכבי, occurring only here, is the
amplificative poetic, and denotes state equipage. דּמּה is the trans. of
דּמה, which combines the meanings aequum and aequalem esse. Although not
allegorizing, yet, that we may not overlook the judiciousness of the
comparison, we must remark that Shulamith is certainly a "daughter of
Israel;" a daughter of the people who increased in Egypt, and, set free
from the bondage of Pharaoh, became the bride of Jahve, and were brought
by the law as a covenant into a marriage relation to Him.

The transition to [Sol 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#010.md) is
mediated by the effect of the comparison; for the head-frame of the
horse's bridle, and the poitral, were then certainly, must as now,
adorned with silken tassels, fringes, and other ornaments of silver
(vid., Lane's Modern Egypt, I 149). Jerome, absurdly, after the lxx:
pulchrae sunt genae tuae sicut turturis. The name of the turtle, תּוּד,
redupl. turtur, is a pure onomatopoeia, which has nothing to do with
תּוּר, whence דּוּר, to go round about, or to move in a circle; and
turtle-dove's cheeks - what absurdity! Birds have no cheeks; and on the
sides of its neck the turtle-dove has black and white variegated
feathers, which also furnishes no comparison for the colour of the
cheeks. תּורים are the round ornaments which hang down in front on both
sides of the head-band, or are also inwoven in the braids of hair in the
forehead; תּוּר, circumire, signifies also to form a circle or a row; in
Aram. it thus denotes, e.g., the hem of a garment and the border round
the eye. In נאווּ (vid., at 5a) the Aleph is silent, as in לאמר, אכל.
חרוּזים are strings of pearls as a necklace; for the necklace (Arab.
kharaz) consists of one or more, for the most part, of three rows of
pearls. The verb חרז signifies, to bore through and to string together;
e.g., in the Talm., fish which one strings on a rod or line, in order to
bring them to the market. In Heb. and Aram. the secondary sense of
stringing predominates, so that to string pearls is expressed by חרז,
and to bore through pearls, by קדח; in Arab., the primary meaning of
piercing through, e.g., michraz, a shoemaker's awl.

After [Sol 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#011.md), one has to represent
to himself Shulamith's adorning as very simple and modest; for Solomon
seeks to make her glad with the thought of a continued residence at the
royal court by the promise of costly and elegant ornaments. Gold and
silver were so closely connected in ancient modes of representation,
that in the old Aegypt. silver was called nub het, or white gold. Gold
derived its name of זהב from its splendour, after the witty Arab. word
zahab, to go away, as an unstable possession; silver is called כּסף,
from כּסף, scindere, abscindere, a piece of metal as broken off from the
mother-stone, like the Arab. dhuḳrat, as set free from the lump by means
of the pickaxe (cf. at [Psa 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011.md);
[Psa 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003).md). The name of silver has
here, not without the influence of the rhythm ([Sol
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#009).md), the article designating the
species; the Song frequently uses this, and is generally in using the
art. not so sparing as poetry commonly is.

(Note: The art. denoting the idea of species in the second member of the
st. const. standing in the sing. without a determining reference to the
first, occurs in [Sol 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md), "a bundle
of (von) myrrh;" [Sol 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md), "a cluster
of (von) the cyprus-flower;" [Sol 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003.md),
"a thread of (von) scarlet," "a piece of pomegranate;" [Sol
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#013.md), "a bed of balm" (but otherwise,
[Sol 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002).md), [Sol
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009.md), "clusters of the vine;" [Sol
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003.md), "a bowl of roundness" (which has
this property); [Sol 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010.md), "wine (of
the quality) of goodness;" cf. [Sol
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002), "wine the (= of the.md) spicing." It
also, in cases where the defined species to which the first undefined
member of the st. const. belongs, stands in the pl.: [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md), [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md); [Sol
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014.md), "like a young one of the hinds;"
[Sol 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md); [Sol
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005.md), "a herd of goats;" [Sol
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#002.md), "a flock of shorn sheep;" [Sol
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#006.md), "a flock of lambs," i.e.,
consisting of individuals of this kind. Also, when the second member
states the place where a thing originates or is found, the first often
remains indeterminate, as one of that which is there found, or a part of
that which comes from thence: [Sol
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md), "a meadow-saffron of Sharon," "a
lily of the valleys;" [Sol 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#009.md), "the
wood of Lebanon." The following are doubtful: [Sol
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004.md), "a thousand bucklers;" and [Sol
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005.md), "a tower of ivory;" less so [Sol
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001.md), "the dance of Mahanaim." The
following are examples of a different kind: [Gen
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007.md), "a well of water;" [Deu
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#019.md), "a damsel of Israel;" [Psa
113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md), "a mother of children;" cf.
[Gen 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#028)..md)

עם makes prominent the points of silver as something particular, but not
separate. In נישׂה, Solomon includes himself among the other
inhabitants, especially the women of the palace; for the plur. majest.
in the words of God of Himself (frequently in the Koran), or persons of
rank of themselves (general in the vulgar Arab.), is unknown in the O.T.

They would make for her golden globules or knobs with (i.e., provided
with ...; cf. [Psa 89:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#014).md) points of
silver sprinkled over them, - which was a powerful enticement for a
plain country damsel.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 1:12</span></span>

Now for the first time Shulamith addresses Solomon, who is before her.
It might be expected that the first word will either express the joy
that she now sees him face to face, or the longing which she had
hitherto cherished to see him again. The verse following accords with
this expectation:

12 While the king is at his table,

My nard has yielded its fragrance.

שׁ עד or אשׁר r עד, with fut. foll., usually means: usque eo, until this
and that shall happen, [Sol 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007.md), [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md); with the perf. foll., until
something happened, [Sol 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004.md). The idea
connected with "until" may, however, be so interpreted that there comes
into view not the end of the period as such, but the whole length of the
period. So here in the subst. clause following, which in itself is
already an expression of continuance, donec = dum (erat); so also עד
alone, without asher, with the part. foll. ([Job
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#018).md), and the infin. ([Jdg
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#026.md); [Exo
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022.md); [Jon
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002.md); cf. [Kg2
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022).md); seldomer with the fin. foll.,
once with the perf. foll. ([Sa1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019).md), once (for [Job
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021) is easily explained otherwise.md)
with the fut. foll. ([Psa 141:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#010.md),
according to which [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md) also is
explained by Baur and others, but without כי עד in this sense of limited
duration: "so long as," being anywhere proved). מסבּו is the inflected
מסב, which, like the post-bibl. מסבּה, signifies the circuit of the
table; for סבב signifies also, after [Sa1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011.md) (the lxx rightly, after the
sense οὐ μὴ κατακλιθῶμεν), to seat themselves around the table, from
which it is to be remarked that not till the Greek-Roman period was the
Persian custom of reclining at table introduced, but in earlier times
they sat ([Sa1 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#005.md); [Kg1
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#020.md); cf. [Psa
128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003).md). Reclining and eating are to be
viewed as separate from each other, [Amo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004.md); הסב, "three and three they
recline at table," is in matter as in language mishnic (Berachoth 42b;
cf. Sanhedrin 2:4, of the king: if he reclines at table, the Tra must be
opposite him). Thus: While (usque eo, so long as), says Shulamith, the
king was at his table, my nard gave forth its fragrance.

נרדּ is an Indian word: naladâ, i.e., yielding fragrance, Pers. nard
(nârd), Old Arab. nardîn (nârdîn), is the aromatic oil of an Indian
plant valeriana, called Nardostachys 'Gatâmânsi (hair-tress nard).
Interpreters are wont to represent Shulamith as having a stalk of nard
in her hand. Hitzig thinks of the nard with which she who is speaking
has besprinkled herself, and he can do this because he regards the
speaker as one of the court ladies. But that Shulamith has besprinkled
herself with nard, is as little to be thought of as that she has in her
hand a sprig of nard (spica nardi), or, as the ancients said, an ear of
nard; she comes from a region where no nard grows, and nard-oil is for a
country maiden unattainable.

(Note: The nard plant grows in Northern and Eastern India; the hairy
part of the stem immediately above the root yields the perfume. Vid.,
Lassen's Indische Alterthumskunde, I 338f., III 41f.)

Horace promises Virgil a cadus (= 9 gallons) of the best wine for a
small onyx-box full of nard; and Judas estimated at 300 denarii (about
8, 10s.) the genuine nard (how frequently nard was adulterated we learn
from Pliny) which Mary of Bethany poured from an alabaster box on the
head of Jesus, so that the whole house was filled with the odour of the
ointment ([Mar 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#005.md); [Joh
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#002).md). There, in Bethany, the love
which is willing to sacrifice all expressed itself in the nard; here,
the nard is a figure of the happiness of love, and its fragrance a
figure of the longing of love. It is only in the language of flowers
that Shulamith makes precious perfume a figure of the love which she
bears in the recess of her heart, anl which, so long as Solomon was
absent, breathed itself out and, as it were, cast forth its fragrance

(Note: In Arab. ntn = נתן, to give an odour, has the specific
signification, to give an ill odour (mintin, foetidus), which led an
Arab. interpreter to understand the expression, "my nard has yielded,
etc.," of the stupifying savour which compels Solomon to go away
(Mittheilung, Goldziher's).)

(cf. [Sol 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013.md); [Sol
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#013).md) in words of longing. She has
longed for the king, and has sought to draw him towards her, as she
gives him to understand. He is continually in her mind.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 1:13</span></span>

13 A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me,

Which lieth between by breasts.

14 A bunch of cypress-flowers is my beloved to me,

From the vine-gardens of Engedi.

Most interpreters, ignoring the lessons of botany, explain [Sol
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md) of a little bunch of myrrh; but
whence could Shulamith obtain this? Myrrh, מר (מרר, to move oneself in a
horizontal direction hither and thither, or gradually to advance; of a
fluid, to flow over the plain),

(Note: Vid., Schlotmann in the Stud. u. Krit. (1867), p. 217.)

belongs, like the frankincense, to the amyrids, which are also exotics

(Note: They came from Arabia and India; the better Arabian was
adulterated with Indian myrrh.)

in Palestine; and that which is aromatic in the Balsamodendron myrrha
are the leaves and flowers, but the resin (Gummi myrrhae, or merely
myrrha) cannot be tied in a bunch. Thus the myrrh here can be understood
in no other way than as at [Sol 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005.md);
in general צרור, according to Hitzig's correct remark, properly denotes
not what one binds up together, but what one ties up - thus sacculus, a
little bag. It is not supposed that she carried such a little bag with
her (cf. [Isa 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020).md), or a box of
frankincense (Luth. musk-apple); but she compares her beloved to a
myrrh-repository, which day and night departs not from her bosom, and
penetrates her inwardly with its heart-strengthening aroma. So
constantly does she think of him, and so delightful is it for her to
dare to think of him as her beloved.

The 14th verse presents the same thought. כּפר is the cypress-cluster or
the cypress-flowers, κύπρος (according to Frst, from כפר = עפר, to be
whitish, from the colour of the yellow-white flowers), which botanists
call Lawsonia, and in the East Alḥennā; its leaves yield the orange
colour with which the Moslem women stain

(Note: Vid., the literature of this subject in Defrmery's notice of
Dozy-Engelmann's work in the Revue Critique, III 2 (1868), p. 408.)

their hands and feet. אשׁכּל (from שׁכל, to interweave) denotes that
which is woven, tresses, or a cluster or garland of their flowers. Here
also we have not to suppose that Shulamith carried a bunch of flowers;
in her imagination she places herself in the vine-gardens which Solomon
had planted on the hill-terraces of Engedi lying on the west of the Dead
Sea ([Ecc 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004).md), and chooses a cluster
of flowers of the cypress growing in that tropical climate, and says
that her beloved is to her internally what such a cluster of
cypress-flowers would be to her externally. To be able to call him her
beloved is her ornament; and to think of him refreshes her like the most
fragrant flowers.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sol 1:15</span></span>

In this ardour of loving devotion, she must appear to the king so much
the more beautiful.

15 Lo, thou art fair, my love.

Lo, thou art fair; thine eyes are doves.

This is a so-called comparatio decurtata, as we say: feet like the
gazelle, i.e., to which the swiftness of the gazelle's feet belongs
([Hab 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019).md); but instead of "like
doves," for the comparison mounts up to equalization, the expression is
directly, "doves." If the pupil of the eye were compared with the
feathers of the dove (Hitz.), or the sprightliness of the eye with the
lively motion hither and thither of the dove (Heiligst.), then the
eulogium would stand out of connection with what Shulamith has just
said. But it stands in reference to it if her eyes are called doves; and
so the likeness to doves' eyes is attributed to them, because purity and
gentleness, longing and simplicity, express themselves therein. The dove
is, like the myrtle, rose, and apple, an attribute of the goddess of
love, and a figure of that which is truly womanly; wherefore ימימה (the
Arab. name of a dove), Columbina, and the like names of women, columba
and columbari, are words of fondness and caressing. Shulamith gives back
to Solomon his eulogium, and rejoices in the prospect of spending her
life in fellowship with him.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 1:16</span></span>

16 Behold, thou art comely, my beloved; yea charming;

Yea, our couch is luxuriously green.

17 The beams of our house are cedars,

Our wainscot of cypresses.

If [Sol 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#016.md) were not the echo of her
heart to Solomon, but if she therewith meant some other one, then the
poet should at least not have used הנּך, but הנּה. Hitzig remarks, that
up to "my beloved" the words appear as those of mutual politeness - that
therefore נעים (charming) is added at once to distinguish her beloved
from the king, who is to her insufferable. But if a man and a woman are
together, and he says הנּכך and she says הנּך, that is as certainly an
interchange of address as that one and one are two and not three. He
praises her beauty; but in her eyes it is rather he who is beautiful,
yea charming: she rejoices beforehand in that which is assigned to her.
Where else would her conjugal happiness find its home but among her own
rural scenes? The city with its noisy display does not please her; and
she knows, indeed, that her beloved is a king, but she thinks of him as
a shepherd. Therefore she praises the fresh green of their future
homestead; cedar tops will form the roof of the house in which they
dwell, and cypresses its wainscot. The bed, and particularly the
bridal-bower (D. M. Z. xxii. 153), - but not merely the bed in which one
sleeps, but also the cushion for rest, the divan ([Amo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004).md), - has the name ערשׂ, from ערשׂ,
to cover over; cf. the "network of goats' hair" ([Sa1
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#013).md) and the κωνωπεῖον of Holofernes
(Judith 10:21; 13:9), (whence our kanapee = canopy), a bed covered over
for protection against the κώνωπες, the gnats. רענן, whence here the
fem. adj. accented on the ult., is not a word of colour, but signifies
to be extensible, and to extend far and wide, as lentus in lenti
salices; we have no word such as this which combines in itself the ideas
of softness and juicy freshness, of bending and elasticity, of
looseness, and thus of overhanging ramification (as in the case of the
weeping willow). The beams are called קרות, from קרה, to meet, to lay
crosswise, to hold together (cf. congingere and contignare). רחיטנוּ
(after another reading, רח, from רחיט, with Kametz immutable, or a
virtual Dag.) is North Palest. = רה = .tse (Kerı̂), for in place of
רהטים, troughs ([Exo 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016).md), the
Samarit. has רחטים (cf. sahar and sahhar, circumire, zahar and zahhar,
whence the Syr. name of scarlet); here the word, if it is not defect.
plur. (Heiligst.), is used as collect. sing. of the hollows or panels of
a wainscoted ceiling, like φάτναι, whence the lxx φατνώματα (Symm.
φατνώσεις), and like lacunae, whence lacunaria, for which Jerome has
here laquearia, which equally denotes the wainscot ceiling. Abulwald
glosses the word rightly by מרזבים, gutters (from רהט, to run); only
this and οἱ διάδρομοι of the Gr. Venet. is not an architectural
expression, like רהיטים, which is still found in the Talm. (vid.,
Buxtorf's Lex.). To suppose a transposition from חריטנו, from חרט, to
turn, to carve (Ew., Heiligst., Hitz.), is accordingly not necessary. As
the ת in בּרותים belongs to the North Palest. (Galilean) form of speech,

(Note: Pliny, H. N. xxiv. 102, ed. Jan., notes brathy as the name of the
savin-tree Juniperus sabina. Wetstein is inclined to derive the name of
Beirut from ברות, as the name of the sweet pine, the tree peculiar to
the Syrian landscape, and which, growing on the sandy hills, prevents
the town from being filled with flying sand. The cypress is now called
(Arab.) sanawbar; regarding its old names, and their signification in
the figurative language of love, vid., under [Isa
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#019)..md)

so also ח for ה in this word: an exchange of the gutturals was
characteristic of the Galilean idiom (vid., Talm. citations by Frankel,
Einl. in d. jerus. Talm. 1870, 7b). Well knowing that a mere hut was not
suitable for the king, Shulamith's fancy converts one of the magnificent
nature-temples of the North Palest. forest-solitudes into a house where,
once together, they will live each for the other. Because it is a large
house, although not large by art, she styles it by the poet. plur.
bāattenu. The mystical interpretation here finds in [Isa
60:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#013.md) a favourable support.
