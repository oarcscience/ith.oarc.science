### [Job Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#001.md)

[Job 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 34:1</span></span>

1 Then began Elihu and said:

2 Hear, ye wise men, my words,

And ye experienced ones, give ear to me!

3 For the ear trieth words,

As the palate tasteth by eating.

4 Let us find out what is right,

Let us explore among ourselves what is good.

After his first speech Elihu has made a brief pause; now since Job is
silent, he begins anew. ויען ויאמר, lxx correctly, here as in all other
instances where the phrase occurs: ὑπολαβὼν λέγει, taking up the word he
said. The wise and the knowing (Arab. ‛ulamâ), whose attention he
bespeaks, are not Job and the three (Umbr., Hahn), who are indeed a
party, and as such a subject for the arbitrative appearance of Elihu;
also not every one capable of forming a judgment (Hirz.); but those in
the circle of spectators and listeners which, as is assumed, has
assembled round the disputants (Schlottm.). In [Job
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004.md) Elihu does not expressly mean his
own ear, but that of the persons addressed: he establishes his summons
to prove what he says by the general thought brought over from [Job
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011.md), and as there (comp. [Job
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007.md); [Job
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012).md), clothed in the form of the
emblematic proverb, - that as there is a bodily, so there is also a
mental organ of sense which tries its perceptions. לאכל is not intended
as expressing a purpose (ad vescendum), but as a gerundive (vescendo).
The phrase בּחר משׁפּט, occurring only here, signifies neither to
institute a search for the purpose of decision (Schult. and others),
since בחר does not signify to decide upon anything, nor to investigate a
cause (Hahn), which would be נבחנה, but to test and choose what is
right, δοκιμάζειν καὶ τὸ καλὸν κατέχειν, [Th1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021.md), after which the parallel runs:
cognoscamus inter nos (i.e., in common) quid bonum.

[Job 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 34:5</span></span>

5 For Job hath said: "I am guiltless,

"And God hath put aside my right.

6 "Shall I lie in spite of my right,

"Incurable is mine arrow without transgression."

7 Where is there a man like Job,

Who drinketh scorning like water,

8 And keepeth company with the workers of iniquity,

And walketh with wicked men,

9 So that he saith: "A man hath no profit

"From entering into fellowship with God"?!

That in relation to God, thinking of Him as a punishing judge, he is
righteous or in the right, i.e., guiltless (צדקתּי with Pathach in
pause, according to Ew. 93, c, from צדק = צדק, but perhaps, comp. [Pro
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#030.md); [Psa
102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md), because the Athnach is taken
only as of the value of Zakeph), Job has said verbatim in [Job
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018.md), and according to meaning, [Job
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010.md); [Job
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007.md), and throughout; that He puts
aside his right (the right of the guiltless, and therefore not of one
coming under punishment): [Job 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002.md).
That in spite of his right (על, to be interpreted, according to
Schultens' example, just like [Job
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#007.md); [Job
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017).md), i.e., although right is on his
side, yet he must be accounted a liar, since his own testimony is belied
by the wrathful form of his affliction, that therefore the appearance of
wrong remains inalienably attached to him, we find in idea in [Job
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020.md) and freq. Elihu makes Job call
his affliction חצּי, i.e., an arrow sticking in him, viz., the arrow of
the wrath of God (on the objective suff. comp. on [Job
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002).md), after [Job
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004.md); [Job
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md); [Job
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#011.md); and that this his arrow, i.e.,
the pain which it causes him, is incurably bad, desperately malignant
without (בּלי as [Job 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011).md) פּשׁע,
i.e., sins existing as the ground of it, from which he would be obliged
to suppose they had thrust him out of the condition of favour, is Job's
constant complaint (vid., e.g., [Job
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023)..md). Another utterance of Job
closely connected with it has so roused Elihu's indignation, that he
prefaces it with the exclamation of astonishment: Who is a man like Job,
i.e., where in all the world (מי as [Sa2
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023).md) has this Job his equal, who ...
. The attributive clause refers to Job; "to drink scorn (here:
blasphemy) like water," is, according to [Job
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016.md), equivalent to to give one's
self up to mockery with delight, and to find satisfaction in it. ארח
לחברה, to go over to any one's side, looks like a poeticized prose
expression. ללכת is a continuation of the ארח, according to Ew. 351, c,
but not directly in the sense "and he goes," but, as in the similar
examples, [Jer 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md); [Jer
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#019.md); [Ch2
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#017.md), and freq., in the sense of: "he
is in the act of going;" comp. on [Job
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#020.md) and [Hab
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017.md). The utterance runs: a man does
not profit, viz., himself (on the use of סכן of persons as well as of
things, vid., on [Job 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002).md), by his
having joyous and familiar intercourse (בּרצתו, as little equivalent to
בּרוּץ as in [Psa 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018).md) with God. Job
has nowhere expressly said this, but certainly the declaration in [Job
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022.md), in connection with the repeated
complaints concerning the anomalous distribution of human destinies
(vid., especially [Job 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007.md), [Job
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001).md), are the premises for such a
conclusion. That Elihu, in [Job 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007.md),
is more harsh against Job than the friends ever were (comp. e.g., the
well-measured reproach of Eliphaz, [Job
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#004).md), and that he puts words into
Job's moth which occur nowhere verbatim in his speeches, is worked up by
the Latin fathers (Jer., Philippus Presbyter, Beda,

(Note: Philippus Presbyter was a disciple of Jerome. His Comm. in Iobum
is extant in many forms, partly epitomized, partly interpolated (on this
subject, vid., Hieronymi Opp. ed. Vallarsi, iii. 895ff.). The commentary
of Beda, dedicated to a certain Nectarius (Vecterius), is fundamentally
that of this Philippus.)

Gregory) in favour of their unfavourable judgment of Elihu; the Greek
fathers, however, are deprived of all opportunity of understanding him
by the translation of the lxx (in which μυκτηρισμόν signifies the scorn
of others which Job must swallow down, comp. [Pro
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#006).md), which here perverts everything.

[Job 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 34:10</span></span>

10 Therefore, men of understanding, hearken to me!

Far be it from god to do evil,

And the Almighty to act wrongfully.

11 No indeed, man's work He recompenseth to him,

And according to man's walk He causeth it to be with him.

"Men of heart," according to Psychol. S. 249, comp. 254, is equivalent
to noee'mones or noeeroi' (lxx συνετοὶ καρδίας). The clause which Elihu
makes prominent in the following reply is the very axiom which the three
defend, perfectly true in itself, but falsely applied by them: evil,
wrong, are inconceivable on the part of God; instead of וּלשׁדּי it is
only ושׁדּי in the second member of the verse, with the omission of the
praep. - a frequent form of ellipsis, particularly in Isaiah ([Isa
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008.md); [Isa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#006.md); [Isa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014.md); [Isa
61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007.md), comp. [Eze
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015).md). Far removed from acting
wickedly and wrongfully, on the contrary He practises recompense exactly
apportioned to man's deeds, and ever according to the walk of each one
(ארח like דּרך or דּרכי, e.g., [Jer
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019), in an ethical sense.md) He causes
it to overtake him, i.e., to happen to him (המציא only here and [Job
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013).md). The general assertion brought
forward against Job is now proved.

[Job 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 34:12</span></span>

12 Yea verily God acteth not wickedly,

And the Almighty perverteth not the right.

13 Who hath given the earth in charge to Him?

And who hath disposed the whole globe?

14 If He only set His heart upon Himself,

If He took back His breath and His inspiration to Himself:

15 All flesh would expire together,

And man would return to dust.

With אף אמנם (Yea verily, as [Job
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#004), "and really".md) the
counter-assertion of [Job 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#011.md) is
repeated, but negatively expressed (comp. [Job
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003).md). הרשׁיע signifies sometimes to
act as רשׁע, and at others to be set forth and condemned as a רשׁע;
here, as the connection requires, it is the former. [Job
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013.md) begins the proof. Ewald's
interpretation: who searcheth, and Hahn's: who careth for the earth
beside Him, are hazardous and unnecessary. פּקד with על of the person
and the acc. of the thing signifies: to enjoin anything as a duty on any
one, to entrust anything to any one, [Job
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#023.md); [Num
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#027.md); [Ch2
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#023.md); therefore: who has made the
earth, i.e., the care of it, a duty to Him? ארצה (Milel) is not to be
refined into the meaning "to the earth" (as here by Schultens and a few
others, [Isa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md) by Luzzatto: he hath
smitten down, better: dishonoured, to the earth with a light stroke),
but is poetically equivalent to ארץ, as לילה (comp. modern Greek ἡ
νύχθα) is in prose equivalent to ליל. [Job
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013.md) is by no means, with Ew. and
Hahn, to be translated: who observes (considers) the whole globe, שׂים
as [Job 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023.md); [Job
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020.md); [Job
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012.md) - the expression would be too
contracted to affirm that no one but God bestowed providential attention
upon the earth; and if we have understood [Job
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013.md) correctly, the thought is also
inappropriate. A more appropriate thought is gained, if עליו is supplied
from [Job 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013.md): who has enjoined upon
Him the whole circle of the earth (Saad., Gecat., Hirz., Schlottm.); but
this continued force of the עליו into the second independent question is
improbable in connection with the repetition of מי. Therefore: who has
appointed, i.e., established (שׂם as [Job
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#005.md); [Isa
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007).md), - a still somewhat more
suitable thought, going logically further, since the one giving the
charge ought to be the lord of him who receives the commission, and
therefore the Creator of the world. This is just God alone, by whose
רוּח and נשׁמה the animal world as well as the world of men (vid., [Job
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md); [Job
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004).md) has its life, [Job
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014.md) : if He should direct His heart,
i.e., His attention (שׂים לב אל, as [Job
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003).md), to Himself (emphatic: Himself
alone), draw in (אסף as [Psa 104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md);
comp. for the matter [Ecc 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md),
Psychol. S. 406) to Himself His inspiration and breath (which emanated
from Him or was effected by Him), all flesh would sink together, i.e.,
die off at once (this, as it appears, has reference to the taking back
of the animal life, רוח), and man would return (this has reference to
the taking back of the human spirit, נשׁמה) to dust (על instead of אל,
perhaps with reference to the usual use of the על־עפר, [Job
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016.md); [Job
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#011.md); [Job
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#026).md).

Only a few modern expositors refer אליו, as Targ. Jer. and Syr., to man
instead of reflexively to God; the majority rightly decide in favour of
the idea which even Grotius perceived: si sibi ipsi tantum bonus esse
(sui unius curam habere) vellet. אם followed by the fut. signifies
either si velit (lxx ει ̓ βούλοιτο), as here, or as more frequently, si
vellet, [Psa 50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012.md); [Psa
139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008.md), [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004.md), [Isa
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md); [Amo
9:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md). It is worthy of remark that,
according to Norzi's statement, the Babylonian texts presented ישׁיב,
[Job 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014.md), as Chethb, ישׂים as Ker
(like our Palestine text, [Dan 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#018).md),
which a MS of De Rossi, with a Persian translation, confirms; the
reading gives a fine idea: that God's heart is turned towards the world,
and is unclosed; its ethical condition of life would then be like its
physical ground of life, that God's spirit dwells in it; the drawing
back of the heart, and the taking back to Himself of the spirit, would
be equivalent to the exclusion of the world from God's love and life.
However, ישׂים implies the same; for a reference of God's thinking and
willing to Himself, with the exclusion of the world, would be just a
removal of His love. Elihu's proof is this: God does not act wrongly,
for the government of the world is not a duty imposed upon Him from
without, but a relation entered into freely by Him: the world is not the
property of another, but of His free creative appointment; and how
unselfishly, how devoid of self-seeking He governs it, is clear from the
fact, that by the impartation of His living creative breath He sustains
every living thing, and does not, as He easily might, allow them to fall
away into nothingness. There is therefore a divine love which has called
the world into being and keeps it in being; and this love, as the
perfect opposite of sovereign caprice, is a pledge for the absolute
righteousness of the divine rule.

[Job 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 34:16</span></span>

16 And oh understand now, hear this;

Hearken to the sound of my words.

17 Would one who hateth right also be able to subdue?

Or wilt thou condemn the All-just?

18 Is it becoming to say to a king: Worthless One!?

Thou evil-doer! to princes?

19 To Him who accepteth not the person of rulers,

And regardeth not the noble before the poor:

For they are all the work of His hands.

20 In a moment they die, and at midnight

The people are overthrown and perish,

And they put aside the mighty - not by the hand of man.

This strophe contains several grammatical rarities. At first sight it
appears that [Job 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#016.md) ought to be
translated: "and if there is understanding (viz., to thee = if thou
hast), then hear this." But בּינה is accented as Milel and with Mercha,
and can therefore not be a substantive (Hirz., Hahn, and others); for
the retreat of the accent would be absolutely incomprehensible, and
instead of a conjunctive, a distinctive, viz., Dech, ought to be
expected. Several of the old expositors, therefore, interpret with
Nolde: quod quum ita sit, intellige; but this elliptical ואם, well as it
might also be used for [Job 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#004.md), is
unsupportable; the Makkeph between the two words is also against it,
which rather arises from the assumption that בּינה is the imperat., and
אם as an exception, like [Gen 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#013.md),
is an optative particle joined to the imper. 2 instead of to the fut.:
"and if thou shouldst observe" (= ואם־תּבין). To translate [Job
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md) with Schultens: num iram osor
judicii frenabit, is impracticable on account of the order of the words,
and gives a thought that is inappropriate here. אף is a particle, and
the fut. is potentialis: is it also possible that an enemy of right
should govern? (חבשׁ, imperio coercere, as אצר [Sa1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#017.md), אסר [Psa
105:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#022).md); right and government are
indeed mutually conditioned, without right everything would fall into
anarchy and confusion. In [Job 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md)
this is applied to the Ruler of the world: or (ואם, an, as [Job
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003.md); [Job
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#004.md); [Job
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#009).md) wilt thou condemn the mighty
just One, i.e., the All-just? As Elihu calls God שׂגּיא כח, [Job
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023.md), as the Almighty, and as the
Omniscient One, תּמים דּעים, [Job
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016.md), so here as the All-just One,
צדּיק כּבּיר. The two adjectives are put side by side ἀσυνδέτως, as is
frequently the case in Arabic, and form one compound idea, Ew. 270, d.

[Job 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#018.md)

The interrogative ה is joined to the inf., not, however, as [Job
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002.md) (num litigare cum Deo castigator,
scil. vult), with the inf. absol., but with the inf. constr.; the form
אמר for אמר occurs also in [Pro 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#007.md),
and is also otherwise not rare, especially in combination with
particles, e.g., בּאכל, [Num 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010.md),
Olsh. 160, b.

(Note: [Eze 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md) is also to be read
אמר according to the Masora and old editions (as אבד [Deu
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#020.md), אכל [Deu
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#023.md), אחז [Kg1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006).md), for distinction from the
imperatives, which have Chateph-Segol.)

It is unnecessary to suppose that the inf. constr., which sometimes,
although rarely, does occur (Ges. 131, rem. 2), is used here instead of
the inf. absol.; it is thus, as after טּוב, e.g., [Jdg
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#002) (המשׁל.md), [Pro
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#007.md); [Psa
133:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md), and [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md) after אין, used as n. actionis,
since ha in a pregnant sense is equivalent to num licet (הטוב), if one
does not prefer, with Olsh., to suppose an aposiopesis: "(dare one be so
bold as) to say to a king: Thou worthless one! Thou evil-doer! to
princes?" The reading האמר is an unnecessary lightening of the
difficulty. It were a crimen laesae, if one reproached a king with being
unjust, and therefore thereby denied him the most essential requisite of
a ruler; and now even Him (Merc. correctly supplies tanto minus ei) who
does not give the preference to the person (נשׂא פּני as [Job
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008.md); [Job
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#021).md) of princes, and does not (with
preference) regard (on נכּר vid., on [Job
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#029.md), also here Piel, and according
to the statement of the Masora, Milel, for an acknowledged reason which
can be maintained even in remarkable instances, like [Deu
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#005.md) in ויהיו, [Eze
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md) in מחללי, whereas [Sa1
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#007) is Milra.md) the rich before (לפני
in the sense of prae) the poor! therefore the King of kings, who makes
no partial distinction, because the king and the beggar are the work of
His hands: they stand equally near to Him as being His creatures, and He
is exalted above both alike as their Creator, this order and partiality
are excluded; - what a nota bene against the doctrine of the decretum
absolutum, which makes the love of the Creator a partial love, and turns
this love, which in its very nature is perfect love, into caprice! In
[Job 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md) Elihu appeals to human
history in favour of this impartiality of the Ruler of the world. It may
there appear as though God with partiality suffered rulers and peoples
in authority in the world to do as they please; but suddenly they die
away, and in fact in the middle of the night (here Mercha-mahpach), the
individuals of a great people (thus must עם be understood in accordance
with the prominently-placed plur. predicate, Ges. 146, 1) tremble and
perish; and they remove (ויסירוּ instead of the passive, as [Job
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020) and frequently.md) the mighty -
לא־ביד. It is not the hand of man which does this, but an invisible
higher power (which, if it is called yd, only bears this name per
anthropomorphismum); comp. [Dan 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034.md),
לא בידין; [Dan 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md), בּאפס יד; and
also [Job 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026.md), like the New
Testament use of ου ̓ χειροποίητος. The subj. of [Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md) are the previously mentioned
princes. The division according to the accents may be received with
hesitation, since the symmetry of the sticks, which it restores, is not
unfrequently wanting in the Elihu section. [Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md) refers back to the possessors of
power, and in the interval, [Job 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md)
describes the fate of those who belong to the people which has become
subservient to their lust of conquest, for עם cannot signify "in crowds"
(Ew., Hahn); it is therefore, and especially when mentioned as here
between princes and rulers, the people, and in fact, in distinction from
gwy, the people together forming a state.

[Job 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 34:21</span></span>

21 For His eyes are upon the ways of each one,

And He seeth all his steps.

22 There is no darkness nor shadow of death

Wherein the workers of iniquity might hide themselves.

23 For He needeth not long to regard a man

That he may enter into judgment with God.

As the preceding strophe showed that God's creative order excludes all
partiality, so this strophe shows that His omniscience qualifies Him to
be an impartial judge. He sees everything, nothing can escape His gaze;
He sees through man without being obliged to wait for the result of a
judicial investigation. שׂים with על does not here signify: to lay upon
(Saad., Gecat.), but as [Job 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015.md),
and as with אל ([Job 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014).md) or בּ
([Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006).md); to direct one's attention
(supply לבּו, [Job 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008).md) towards
anything; the fut. has here a modal signification; עוד is used as e.g.,
[Gen 46:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#029.md) : again and again,
continuously; and in the clause expressive of purpose it is אל־אל
(instead of אליו, a very favourite combination used throughout the whole
book, [Job 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#008.md); [Job
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#005.md); [Job
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003), and so on.md) from the human
standpoint: He, the all-seeing One, needs not to observe him long that
he should enter into judgment with God - He knows him thoroughly before
any investigation takes place, which is not said without allusion to
Job's vehement longing to be able to appear before God's tribunal.

[Job 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 34:24</span></span>

24 He breaketh the mighty in pieces without investigation

And setteth others in their place.

25 Thus He seeth through their works,

And causeth their overthrow by night, thus they are crushed.

26 He smiteth them after the manner of evil-doers

In the sight of the public.

27 For for such purpose are they fallen away from Him

And have not considered any of His ways,

28 To cause the cry of the poor to come up to Him,

And that He should hear the cry of the needy.

He makes short work (לא־חקר for בּלא, as [Job
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#024.md); [Job
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#026.md) : without research, viz., into
their conduct, which is at once manifest to Him; not: in an
incomprehensible manner, which is unsuitable, and still less:
innumerabiles, as Jer., Syr.) with the mighty (כּבּירים, Arab. kibâr,
kubarâ), and in consequence of this (fut. consec.) sets up (constituit)
others, i.e., better and worthier rulers (comp. אהר, [Job
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019.md); [Isa
55:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001) :15.md), in their stead. The
following לכן is not equivalent to לכן אשׁר, for which no satisfactory
instance exists; on the contrary, לכן here, as more frequently,
introduces not the real consequence ([Job
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#002).md), but a logical inference,
something that directly follows in and with what precedes (corresponding
to the Greek ἄρα, just so, consequently), comp. [Job
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003.md); [Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md); [Isa
61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007.md); [Jer
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033.md); [Jer
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md); [Zac
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007) (vid., Khler in loc..md). Thus,
then, as He hereby proves, He is thoroughly acquainted with their
actions (מעבּד, nowhere besides in the book of Job, an Aramaizing
expression for מעשׂה). This abiding fact of divine omniscience, inferred
from the previously-mentioned facts, then serves again in its turn, in
[Job 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#025.md), as the source of facts by
which it is verified. לילה is by no means an obj. The expositions: et
inducit noctem (Jer.), He walks in the night in which He has veiled
Himself (Umbr.), convertit eos in noctem (Syr., Arab.), and such like,
all read in the two words what they do not imply. It is either to be
translated: He throws them by night (לילה as [Job
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020).md) upon the heaps (הפך as [Pro
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#007).md), or, since the verb has no
objective suff.: He maketh a reformation or overthrow during the night,
i.e., creates during the night a new order of things, and they who stood
at the head of the former affairs are crushed by the catastrophe.

[Job 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026.md)

The following תּחת רשׁעים cannot signify: on the place of the
evil-doers, i.e., in the place where evil-doers are punished (Hirz.,
Hahn, and others), for תּחת (תּחתּי) only has this signification with
the suff. (vid., on [Hab 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016).md); but
not otherwise than: in the evil-doers' stead, taking them and treating
them as such, as Jer. has correctly translated: quasi impios (comp. [Isa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004), Jerome, cum interfectis.md). The
place first mentioned afterwards is not exactly the usual place of
judgment, but any place whatever where all can see it. There He smites
those who hitherto held positions of eminence, as of unimpeachable
honour, like the common criminal; ספק, Arab. ṣfq, complodere, and then
ictu resonante percutere, as the likewise cognate Arab. sf' signifies
first to box the ear (as Arab. sfq = ṣfq), then so to strike that it
smacks. As little as לכן, [Job 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#025.md),
was = לכן אשׁר, just so little is אשׁר על־כּן, [Job
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#027.md), = על־כן אשׁר (vid., on the
other hand what is said on [Gen 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005.md)
concerning כּי־על־כּן). Elihu wishes to say that they endure such a
destiny of punishment, because they therefore, i.e., in order to suffer
such, have turned aside from following after God, and have not thought
on all His ways, i.e., guidings, by which He manifested Himself to them:
they have thus sought to cause the cry of the poor to come (Jer. well
renders: ut pervenire facerent ad eum) before Him (עליו, perhaps with
the idea of urging forward = לפניו or בּאזניו), and that He may hear the
cry of the lowly (construction exactly like [Job
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017).md), i.e., have sought to bring
forth His avenging justice by injustice that cries aloud to heaven.

[Job 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 34:29</span></span>

29 If He, however, maketh peace, who will then condemn?

And if He hideth His countenance - who then can behold Him? -

Both concerning numbers and individuals together:

30 That godless men reign not,

That they be not nets to the people.

31 For one, indeed, saith to God,

"I have been proud, I will not do evil;

32 "What I see not, show Thou me;

"If I have done wrong, I will do it no more"!? -

If God makes peace (ישׁקיט as [Psa
94:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#013.md), comp. [Isa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007.md), הארץ שׁקטה כל־, viz., after the
overthrow of the tyrant) in connection with such crying oppression of
the poor, who will then condemn Him without the rather recognising
therein His comprehensive justice? The conjecture ירעשׁ

(Note: Vid., Grtz in Frankel's Monatsschrift, 1861, i.)

is not required either here or [Sa1
14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md) (where הרשׁיע signifies to
punish the guilty); ירשׁע is also not to be translated turbabit
(Rosenm.), since רשׁע (Arab. rs‛, rsg) according to its primitive notion
does not signify "to be restless, to rage," but "to be relaxed, hollow"
(opposite of צדק, Arab. ṣdq, to be hard, firm, tight). Further: If God
hides His countenance, i.e., is angry and punishes, who can then behold
Him, i.e., make Him, the veiled One, visible and claim back the favour
withdrawn? The Waw of וּמי, if one marks off the periods of the
paratactic expression, is in both cases the Waw of conclusion after
hypothetical antecedents, and. [Job
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md) refers to Job's impetuous
challenging of God. Thus exalted above human controversy and defiance,
God rules both over the mass and over individuals alike. יחד gives
intensity of the equality thus correlatively (et-et) expressed (Targ.,
Syr.); to refer it to אדם as generalizing (lxx, Jer. et super omnes
homines), is forbidden by the antithesis of peoples and individuals. To
the thought, that God giveth rest (from oppressors) and hides His
countenance (from the oppressors and in general those who act wrongly),
two co-ordinate negative final clauses are attached: in order that
godless men may not rule (ממּלך, as e.g., [Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033), Keri.md), in order that they may
no longer be (מ( e = מהיות, under the influence of the notion of putting
aside contained in the preceding final clause, therefore like [Isa
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md) מעם, [Isa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002.md) מעיר, [Jer
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002) מגוי, and the like.md) snares of the
people, i.e., those whose evil example and bad government become the
ruin of the community.

In [Job 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#031.md) the view of those who by
some jugglery concerning the laws of the vowel sounds explain האמר as
imper. Niph. (= האמר), be it in the sense of להאמר, dicendum est
(Rosenm., Schlottm., and others, after Raschi), or even in the
unheard-of reflexive signification: express thyself (Stick., Hahn), is
to be rejected. The syncopated form of the infin. בּהרג, [Eze
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#015.md), does not serve as a palliation
of this adventurous imperative. It is, on the contrary, אמר with ה
interrog., as [Eze 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#009.md) האמר, and
probably also העמוּר [Mic 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md) (vid.,
Hitz.). A direct exhortation to Job to penitence would also not be in
place here, although what Elihu says is levelled against Job. The כּי is
confirmatory. Thus God acts with that class of unscrupulous men who
abuse their power for the destruction of their subjects: for he (one of
them) says (or: has said, from the standpoint of the execution of
punishment) to God, etc. Ew. differently: "for one says thus to God
even: I expiate what I do not commit," by understanding the speech
quoted of a defiance which reproachfully demands an explanation. It is,
however, manifestly a compendious model confession. And since Elihu with
כי establishes the execution of punishment from this, that it never
entered the mind of the עדם חנף thus to humble himself before God, so
נשׂאתי here cannot signify: I have repented (put up with and had to bear
what I have deserved); on the contrary, the confession begins with the
avowal: I have exalted myself (נשׂא, se efferre, in [Hos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md); [Psa
89:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#010).md), which is then followed by the
vow: I will not (in the future) do evil (חבל synon. עוה, as [Neh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#007.md), and probably also supra, [Job
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009).md), and the entreaty, [Job
34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032.md) : beside that which I behold
(elliptical object-clause, Ew. 333, b), i.e., what lies beyond my vision
(= נסתּרות or עלמים, [Psa 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013.md); [Psa
90:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#008), unacknowledged sins.md), teach me;
and the present vow has reference to acknowledged sins and sins that
have still to be acknowledged: if I have done wrong, I will do it no
more. Thus speaking - Elihu means - those high ones might have
anticipated the punishment of the All-just God, for favour instead of
wrath cannot be extorted, it is only reached by the way of lowly
penitence.

[Job 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 34:33</span></span>

33 Shall He recompense it as thou wilt? For thou hast found fault,

So that thou hast to determine, not I,

And what thou knowest speak out!

34 Men of understanding will say to me,

And a wise man who listeneth to me:

35 "Job speaketh without knowledge,

"And his words are without intelligence."

36 O would that Job were proved to the extreme

On account of his answers after the manner of evil men;

37 For he addeth transgression to his sin,

Among us he clappeth

And multiplieth his speeches against God.

The question put to Job, whether then from him or according to his idea
(עם in מעמּך as [Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010.md); [Job
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011), which see.md) shall God recompense
it (viz., as this "it" is to be understood according to [Job
34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032.md): man's evil-doing and actions in
general), Elihu proves from this, that Job has despised (shown himself
discontented with it) the divine mode of recompense, so that therefore
(this second כּי signifies also nam, but is, because extending further
on account of the first, according to the sense equivalent to ita ut) he
has to choose (seek out) another mode of recompense, not Elihu (who is
perfectly satisfied with the mode with which history furnishes us);
which is then followed by the challenge (דּבּר not infin., but as [Job
33:32](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#032).md): what (more corresponding to
just retribution) thou knowest, speak out then! Elihu on his part knows
that he does not stand alone against Job, the censurer of the divine
government of the world, but that men of heart (understanding) and
(every) wise man who listens to him will coincide with him in the
opinion that Job's talk is devoid of knowledge and intelligence (on the
form of writing השׂכּיל as [Jer 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015.md),
vid., Ges. 53, rem. 2).

In [Job 34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036.md) we will for the present
leave the meaning of אבי undecided; יבּחן is certainly intended as
optative: let Job be tried to the extreme or last, i.e., let his trial
by affliction continue until the matter is decided (comp. [Hab
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004).md), on account of the opposition
among men of iniquity, i.e., after the manner of such (on this Beth of
association comp. בּקּשׁשׁים, [Job
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#014).md), for to חטּאת, by which the
purpose of his affliction is to be cleared up, he adds פּשׁע, viz., the
wickedness of blasphemous speeches: among us (therefore without fear) he
claps (viz., his hands scornfully together, יספּוק only here thus
absolute instead of ישׂפּק כּפּיו fo dae, [Job
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023.md), comp. בשׂפק [Job
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018.md) with ספקו [Job
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#022).md)

(Note: The mode of writing with ס instead of שׂ is limited in the book
of Job, according to the Masora, to [Job
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026.md), [Job
34:37](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#037)..md)

and multiplies (ירב, fut. apoc. Hiph. as [Job
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#017.md), and instead of the full fut.,
as ישׂר, [Job 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027).md) his speeches
against God, i.e., exceeds himself in speeches which irreverently
dictate to and challenge God.

But we now ask, what does that אבי, [Job
34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036.md), signify? According to the
accentuation with Rebia, it appears to be intended to signify pater mi
(Jer.), according to which Saad. (jâ rabbı̂) and Gecat. (munchiı̂, my
Creator) translate it. This would be the only passage where an Old
Testament saint calls God אבי; elsewhere God is called the Father of
Israel, and Israel as a people, or the individual comprehending himself
with the nation, calls Him אבינו. Nevertheless this pater mi for Elihu
would not be inappropriate, for what the writer of the Epistle to the
Hebrews, [Heb 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007.md), says to believers
on the ground of [Pro 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md) : εἰς
παιδείαν ὑπομένετε, ye suffer for the purpose of paternal discipline, is
Elihu's fundamental thought; he also calls God in [Job
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#022.md); [Job
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#003.md), which a like reference to
himself, עשׂני and פעלי - this ejaculatory "my Father!" especially in
conjunction with the following wish, remains none the less
objectionable, and only in the absence of a more agreeable
interpretation should we, with Hirz., decide in its favour. It would be
disproportionately repulsive if [Job
34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036.md) still belonged to the assenting
language of another, and Elihu represented himself as addressed by אבי
(Wolfson, Maur.). Thus, therefore, אבי must be taken somehow or other
interjectionally. It is untenable to compare it with אבוי, [Pro
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#029.md), for אוי ואבוי (Arab. âh
wa-âwâh) is "ah! and alas!" The Aramaic בייא בייא, vae vae (Buxtorf,
col. 294), compared by Ges. to בּי, signifies just the same. The Targ.
translates צבינא, I wish; after which Kimchi, among moderns, Umbr.,
Schlottm., Carey, and others derive אבי from אבה, a wish (after the form
קצה, הזה), but the participial substantival-form badly suits this
signification, which is at once improbable according to the usage of the
language so far as we at present know it. This interpretation also does
not well suit the בי, which is to be explained at the same time. Ewald,
358, a, regards אבי as the fuller form of בּי, and thinks אבי is
dialectic = לבי = לוי = לוּ, but this is an etymological leger-demain.
The two Schultens (died 1750 and 1793) were on the right track when they
traced back אבי to בוא, but their interpretation: rem eo adducam ut (אבי
= אביא, as it is certainly not unfrequently written, e.g., [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md), with the assumption of a root
בי cognate with בא), is artificial and without support in the usage of
the language and in the syntax. Krber and Simonis opened up the right
way, but with inadequate means for following it out, by referring (vid.,
Ges. Thes. s.v. בּי) to the formula of a wish and of respect, bawwâk
allah, which, however, also is bajjâk. The Kamus interprets bajjâk,
though waveringly, by bawwâk, the meaning of which (may he give thee a
resting-place) is more transparent. In an annotated Codex of
Zamachschari hajjâk allah wa-bajjâk is explained: God preserve thy life
and grant thee to come to a place of rest, bawwaaka (therefore Arab.
bawâ = bawa'a) menzilan. That אבי (as also בּי) is connected with this
bajjâk since the latter is the Piel-form of an old verb bajja (vid.,
supra, p. 559), which with the forms Arab. bâ'a (whence Arab. bı̂‛at, a
sheltering house) and Arab. bw' (bwâ) has one root similar in
signification with בוא, the following contributions of Wetzstein will
show.

In elucidation of the present passage he observes: The expressions abı̂
tebı̂, jebı̂; nebı̂, tebû, jebû, are so frequent in Damascus, that they
very soon struck me, and on my first inquiry I always received the same
answer, that they are a mutilation of Arab. 'bgy, abghi, I desire, etc.
\[vid. supra, p. 580\], until one day a fugitive came into the
consulate, and with these words, abı̂ wâlidêk, seized me in that part of
the body where the Arabs wear the girdle (zunnâr), a symbolic action by
which one seeks some one's protection. Since the word here could not be
equivalent to abghi ("I desire" thy parents), I turned to the person
best acquainted with the idiom of the country, the scribe Abderrahmn
el-Mdni, which father had been a wandering minstrel in the camps for
twenty years; and he explained to me that abghi only signifies "I
desire;" on the contrary, abı̂, "I implore importunately, I pray for
God's sake," and the latter belongs to a defective verb, Arab. bayya,
from which, except the forms mentioned, only the part. anâ bâj, "I come
as a suppliant," and its plur. nahn bâjin, is used. The poet Musa Rr
from Krje in the south of Hauran, who lived with me six months in
Damascus in order to instruct me in the dialect of his district, assured
me that among the Beduins also the perf. forms bı̂t, bı̂nâ (I have, we
have entreated), and the fut. forms tabı̂n (thou, woman ... ), jaben
(they, the women ... ), and taben (ye women ... ), are used. In the year
1858, in the course of a journey in his native country, I came to Dms,
whither they had brought two strange Beduins who had been robbed of
their horses in that desert (Sahra Dms), and one of them had at the same
time received a mortal gunshot-wound. As I can to these men, who were
totally forsaken, the wounded man began to express his importunate
desire for a surgeon with the words jâ shêch nebı̂ ‛arabak, "Sir, we
claim the protection of thy Arabs," i.e., we adjure thee by thy family.
Naturally abı̂ occurs most frequently. It generally has its obj. in the
acc., often also with the praepos. Arab. ‛ly, exactly like Arab. dchl
(to enter, to flee anywhere and hide), which is its correct synonym and
usual substitute in common life. It is often used without an obj., and,
indeed, very variously. With women it is chiefly the introduction to a
question prompted by curiosity, as: abı̂ (ah, tell me), have you really
betrothed your daughter? Or the word is accompanied by a gesture by the
five fingers of the right hand, with the tips united, being stretched
out towards the hasty or impatient listener, as if one wished to show
some costly object, when abı̂ signifies as much as: I pray thee wait till
I have shown thee this precious thing, i.e., allow me to make one more
remark to thee in reference to the matter. Moreover, בּי (probably not
corrupted from אבי, but a derived nomen concretum in the sense of dachı̂l
or mustagı̂r, one seeking protection, protg, after the form אי, צי, from
בוה = בוא) still exists unaltered in Hauran and in the steppe. The
Beduin introduces an important request with the words anâ bı̂ ahlak, I am
a protg of thy family, or anâ bı̂ ‛irdak, I trust to thine honour, etc.;
while in Damascus they say, anâ dachı̂l ahlak, harı̂mak, aulâdak, etc. The
Beduin women make use of this bı̂ in a weakened signification, in order
to beg a piece of soap or sugar, and anâ bı̂ lihjetak, I pray by thy
beard, etc., is often heard.

If now we combine that אבי of Elihu with abghi (from Arab. bgâ, Hebr.
בּעה, Aram. בּעא, fut. יבעי, as בּי with בּעי) or with ab = אבא, from
the verb bajja = בוא (בי),

(Note: We cannot in any case, with Wetzst., explain the אבי אבי, [Kg2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012.md); [Kg2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md), according to the above, so that
the king of Israel adjured the dying prophet by the national army and
army of the faithful not to forsake him, as an Arab is now and then
adjured in most urgent and straitened circumstances "by the army of
Islam;" vid., on the other hand, [Kg2
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#021.md), comp. [Job
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013.md); [Job
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009) (בּנך.md). Here rather, if an Arabian
parallel be needed, the usual death wail, bi-abı̂ anta (thou wast dear as
a father to me), e.g., in Kosegarten, Chrestom. p. 140, 3, is to be
compared. אבי, [Sa1 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#012.md), might more
readily, with Ew. 101, c, be brought in here and regarded as belonging
to the North Palestine peculiarities of the book of Kings; but by a
comparison of the passages cited, this is also improbable.)

it always remains a remarkable instance in favour of the Arabic
colouring of the Elihu section similar to the rest of the book, - a
colouring, so to speak, dialectically Hauranitish; while, on the other
hand, even by this second speech, one cannot avoid the impression of a
great distance between it and the rest of the book: the language has a
lofty tone, without its special harshness, as there, being the necessary
consequence of a carefully concentrated fulness of thought; moreover,
here in general the usual regularity of the strophe-lines no longer
prevails, and also the usual symmetrical balance of thought in them.

If we confine our attention to the real substance of the speech, apart
from the emotional and rough accessories, Elihu casts back the reproach
of injustice which Job has raised, first as being contradictory to the
being of God, [Job 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md).; then he
seeks to refute it as contradicting God's government, and this he does
(1) apagogically from the unselfish love with which God's protecting
care preserves the breath of every living thing, while He who has
created all things might bring back all created things to the former
non-existence, [Job 34:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012); (2.md) by
induction from the impartial judgment which He exercises over princes
and peoples, and from which it is inferred that the Ruler of the world
is also all-just, [Job 34:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#016.md). From
this Elihu proves that God can exercise justice, and from that, that He
is omniscient, and sees into man's inmost nature without any judicial
investigation, [Job 34:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021.md);
inaccessible to human accusation and human defiance, He rules over
peoples and individuals, even over kings, and nothing turns His just
punishment aside but lowly penitence blended with the prayer for the
disclosure of unperceived sin, [Job
34:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md). For in His retributive rule
God does not follow the discontented demands of men arrogant and yet
devoid of counsel, [Job 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#033.md). It is
worthy of recognition, that Elihu does not here coincide with what has
been already said (especially [Job
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#015).md), without applying it to another
purpose; and that his theodicy differs essentially from that proclaimed
by the friends. It is not derived from mere appearance, but lays hold of
the very principles. It does not attempt the explanation of the many
apparent contradictions to retributive justice which outward events
manifest, as agreeing with it; it does not solve the question by mere
empiricism, but from the idea of the Godhead and its relation to the
world, and by such inner necessity guarantees to the mysteries still
remaining to human shortsightedness, their future solution.
