### [Psalms Chapter 112](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 112:0</span></span>

Alphabetical Song in Praise of Those Who Fear God

The alphabetical Hallelujah [Psa
111:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md), which celebrated the
government of God, is now followed by another coinciding with it in
structure (CTYXOC KB, i.e., 22 στίχοι, as the Coptic version correctly
counts), which celebrates the men whose conduct is ordered after the
divine pattern.

[Psalms 112:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 112:1</span></span>

As in the preceding Psalm. [Psa 112:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001.md)
here also sets forth the theme of that which follows. What is there said
in [Psa 112:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#003.md) concerning the
righteousness of God, [Psa 112:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#003.md) here
says of the righteousness of him who fears God: this also standeth fast
for ever, it is indeed the copy of the divine, it is the work and gift
of God ([Psa 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005).md), inasmuch as God's
salutary action and behaviour, laid hold of in faith, works a like form
of action and behaviour to it in man, which, as [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md) says, is, according to its
nature, love. The promise in [Psa
112:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004.md) sounds like [Isa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002.md). Hengstenberg renders: "There
ariseth in the darkness light to the upright who is gracious and
compassionate and just." But this is impossible as a matter of style.
The three adjectives (as in [Psa
111:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#004.md), pointing back to [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md), cf. [Psa
145:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008.md); [Psa
116:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#005).md) are a mention of God according
to His attributes. חנּוּן and רחוּם never take the article in Biblical
Hebrew, and צדּיק follows their examples here (cf. on the contrary, [Exo
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027).md). God Himself is the light which
arises in darkness for those who are sincere in their dealings with Him;
He is the Sun of righteousness with wings of rays dispensing "grace" and
"tender mercies," [Mal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md). The fact
that He arises for those who are compassionate as He is compassionate,
is evident from [Psa 112:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005.md). טוב being,
as in [Isa 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md); [Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017.md), intended of well-being,
prosperity, טּוב אישׁ is here equivalent to אשׁרי אישׁ, which is
rendered טוּביהּ דּגברא in Targumic phrase. חונן signifies, as in [Psa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026.md), [Psa
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021.md), one who charitably dispenses
his gifts around. [Psa 112:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005.md) is not an
extension of the picture of virtue, but, as in [Psa
127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005.md), a promissory prospect: he will
uphold in integrity (בּמשׁפּט, [Psa
72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002.md), [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007), and frequently.md), or rather (=
בּמּשׁפּט) in the cause ([Psa 143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002.md),
[Pro 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023), and frequently.md), the
things which depend upon him, or with which he has to do; for כּלכּל,
sustinere, signifies to sustain, i.e., to nourish, to sustain, i.e.,
endure, and also to support, maintain, i.e., carry through. This is
explanatorily confirmed in [Psa 112:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#006.md)
: he stands, as a general thing, imperturbably fast. And when he dies he
becomes the object of everlasting remembrance, his name is still blessed
([Pro 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007).md). Because he has a cheerful
conscience, his heart too is not disconcerted by any evil tidings ([Jer
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023).md): it remains נכון, erect,
straight and firm, without suffering itself to bend or warp; בּטח בּה,
full of confidence (passive, "in the sense of a passive state after a
completed action of the person himself," like זכוּר, [Psa
103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014).md); סמוּך, stayed in itself and
established. The last two designations are taken from [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md), where it is the church of the
last times that is spoken of. [Psa
91:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008.md) gives us information with
reference to the meaning of ראה בצריו; עד, as in [Psa
94:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#013.md), of the inevitable goal, on this
side of which he remains undismayed. [Co2
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#009.md), where Paul makes use of [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md) of the Psalm before us as an
encouragement to Christian beneficence, shows how little the assertion
"his righteousness standeth for ever" is opposed to the New Testament
consciousness. פּזּר of giving away liberally and in manifold ways, as
in [Pro 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024.md). רוּם, [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md), stands in opposition to the
egoistical הרים in [Psa 75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005.md) as a
vegetative sprouting up ([Psa 132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017).md).
The evil-doer must see this, and confounded, vex himself over it; he
gnashes his teeth with the rage of envy and chagrin, and melts away,
i.e., loses consistency, becomes unhinged, dies off (נמס, 3d praet.
Niph. as in [Exo 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#021.md), pausal form of
נמס = נמס). How often has he desired the ruin of him whom he must now
see in honour! The tables are turned; this and his ungodly desire in
general come to nought, inasmuch as the opposite is realized. On יראה,
with its self-evident object, cf. [Mic
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md). Concerning the pausal form וכעס,
vid., [Psa 93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md). Hupfeld wishes to
read תּקות after [Psa 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019.md), [Pro
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#028.md). In defence of the traditional
reading, Hitzig rightly points to [Pro
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#024.md) together with [Pro
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#028.md).
