### [Proverbs Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 24:1</span></span>

After this divergence (in [Pro
23:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#029).md) from the usual form of the
proverb, there is now a return to the tetrastich:

1 Envy not evil men,

And desire not to have intercourse with them.

2 For their heart thinketh of violence,

And their lips speak mischief.

The warning, not to envy the godless, is also found at [Pro
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031.md); [Pro
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#017.md); [Pro
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#019.md), but is differently constructed
in each of these passages. Regarding תּתאו with Pathach, vid., at [Pro
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#003.md). אנשׁי רעה (cf. רע, [Pro
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#005).md) are the wicked, i.e., such as
cleave to evil, and to whom evil clings. The warning is grounded in
this, that whoever have intercourse with such men, make themselves
partners in greater sins and evil: for their heart broodeth (write כּי
שׁד, Munach Dech) violence, i.e., robbery, plunder, destruction, murder,
and the like. With שׁד (in the Mishle only here and at [Pro
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#007.md), cf. שׁדּד, [Pro
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026).md) connects itself elsewhere חמס,
here (cf. [Hab 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#003).md) עמל, labor,
molestia, viz., those who prepare it for others by means of slanderous,
crafty, uncharitable talk.

[Proverbs 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 24:3</span></span>

The warning against fellowship with the godless is followed by the
praise of wisdom, which is rooted in the fear of God.

3 By wisdom is the house builded,

And by understanding is it established.

4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled

With all manner of precious and pleasant goods.

What is meant by the "building of the house" is explained at [Pro
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001.md). It is wisdom, viz., that which
originates from God, which is rooted in fellowship with Him, by which
every household, be it great or small, prospers and attains to a
successful and flourishing state; כּונן, as parallel word to בּנה ([Pro
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019.md); [Pro
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012).md), is related to it as statuere to
extruere; the Hithpal (as at [Num
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017).md) means to keep oneself in a
state of continuance, to gain perpetuity, to become established. That
ימּלאוּ by Athnach has not passed over into the pausal ימּלאוּ, arises
from this, that the Athnach, by the poetical system of accents, has only
the force of the prose accent Sakef; the clause completes itself only by
4b; the pausal form on that account also is not found, and it is
discontinued, because the Athnach does not produce any pausal effect
(vid., at [Psa 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006).md). The form of
expression in [Pro 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#004.md) is like [Pro
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#013.md); [Pro
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010.md). But the חדרים, of storerooms
(lxx as [Isa 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020), ταμιεῖα.md), and
נעים, like [Pro 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#018.md); [Pro
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#008.md), is peculiar to this collection.

[Proverbs 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 24:5</span></span>

The praise of wisdom is continued: it brings blessings in the time of
peace, and gives the victory in war.

5 A wise man is full of strength;

And a man of understanding showeth great power.

6 For with wise counsel shalt thou carry on successful war;

And safety is where counsellors are not wanting.

The ב of בּעוז (thus with Pathach in old impressions, Cod. 1294, Cod.
Jaman., and elsewhere with the Masoretic note לית ומלא) introduces, as
that of בכּח, [Psa 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md), the property
in which a person or thing appears; the article (cf. העזבים, [Pro
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#013), Gesen, 35, 2A.md) is that of
gender. The parallel מאמץ כח, a Greek translates by ὑπὲρ κραταιὸν ἰσχύΐ
= מאמּיץ כּח ([Job 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004.md); [Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026).md). But after 5a it lies nearer
that the poet means to express the power which lies in wisdom itself
([Ecc 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019).md), and its superiority to
physical force ([Pro 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#022).md); the lxx,
Syr., and Targ. also, it is true, translate 5a as if מעז (prae potente)
were the words used. אמּץ כּח means to strengthen the strength, and that
is ([Nah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002).md) equivalent to, to
collect the strength (to take courage), here and at [Amo
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014), to show strong (superior.md)
strength. The reason is gathered from [Pro
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#018.md) and [Pro
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014.md). The לך here added, Hitzig is
determined to read תּעשׂה: for with prudent counsel the war shall be
carried out by thee. The construction of the passive with ל of the
subject is correct in Heb. (vid., at [Pro
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020).md) as well as in Aram.,

(Note: Vid., Nldeke's Neusyrische Gram. p. 219, Anm., and p. 416.)

and עשׂה frequently means, in a pregnant sense: to complete, to carry
out, to bring to an end; but the phrase עשׂה מלחמה means always to carry
on war, and nothing further. לך is the dat. commod., as in נלחם ל, to
wage war (to contend) for any one, e.g., [Exo
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014.md). Instead of ברב, the lxx reads
בלב; regarding γεωργίου μεγάλου for מאמץ כח, without doubt a corrupt
reading, vid., Lagarde.

[Proverbs 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 24:7</span></span>

Till now in this appendix we have found only two distichs (vid., vol. i.
p. 17); now several of them follow. From this, that wisdom is a power
which accomplishes great things, it follows that it is of high value,
though to the fool it appears all too costly.

7 Wisdom seems to the fool to be an ornamental commodity;

He openeth not his mouth in the gate.

Most interpreters take ראמות for רמות (written as at [Ch1
6:58](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#058.md); cf. [Zac
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md); ראשׁ, [Pro
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004.md); קאם, [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014).md), and translate, as Jerome and
Luther: "Wisdom is to the fool too high;" the way to wisdom is to him
too long and too steep, the price too costly, and not to be afforded.
Certainly this thought does not lie far distant from what the poet would
say; but why does he say חכמות, and not חכמה? This חכמות is not a
numerical plur., so as to be translated with the Venet.: μετέωροι τῷ
ἄφρονι αἱ ἐπιστῆμαι; it is a plur., as [Psa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004.md) shows; but, as is evident from
the personification and the construction, [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md), one inwardly multiplying and
heightening, which is related to חכמה as science or the contents of
knowledge is to knowledge. That this plur. comes here into view as in
chap. 1-9 (vid., vol. i. p. 34), is definitely accounted for in these
chapters by the circumstance that wisdom was to be designated, which is
the mediatrix of all wisdom; here, to be designated in intentional
symphony with ראמות, whose plur. ending th shall be for that very
reason, however, inalienable. Thus ראמות will be the name of a costly
foreign bijouterie, which is mentioned in the Book of Job, where the
unfathomableness and inestimableness of wisdom is celebrated; vid., [Job
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018.md), where we have recorded what we
had to say at the time regarding this word. But what is now the meaning
of the saying that wisdom is to the fool a pearl or precious coral? Jol
Bril explains: "The fool uses the sciences like a precious stone, only
for ornament, but he knows not how to utter a word publicly," This is to
be rejected, because ראמות is not so usual a trinket or ornament as to
serve as an expression of this thought. The third of the comparison lies
in the rarity, costliness, unattainableness; the fool despises wisdom,
because the expenditure of strength and the sacrifices of all kinds
which are necessary to put one into the possession of wisdom deter him
from it (Rashi). This is also the sense which the expression has when
ראמות = רמות; and probably for the sake of this double meaning the poet
chose just this word, and not פנינים, גבישׁ, or any other name, for
articles of ornament (Hitzig). The Syr. has incorrectly interpreted this
play upon words: sapientia abjecta stulto; and the Targumist: the fool
grumbles (מתרעם) against wisdom.

(Note: This explanation is more correct than Levy's: he lifts himself up
(boasts) with wisdom.)

He may also find the grapes to be sour because they hang too high for
him; here it is only said that wisdom remains at a distance from him
because he cannot soar up to its attainment; for that very reason he
does not open his mouth in the gate, where the council and the
representatives of the people have their seats: he has not the knowledge
necessary for being associated in counselling, and thus must keep
silent; and this is indeed the most prudent thing he can do.

[Proverbs 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 24:8</span></span>

From wisdom, which is a moral good, the following proverb passes over to
a kind of σοφία δαιμονιώδης:

He that meditateth to do evil,

We call such an one an intriguer.

A verbal explanation and definition like [Pro
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#024) (cf. p. 29.md), formed like [Pro
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#021.md) from נבון. Instead of
בּעל־מזמּות \[lord of mischief\] in [Pro
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002.md), the expression is 'אישׁ מ (cf.
at [Pro 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024).md). Regarding מזמות in its
usual sense, vid., [Pro 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002.md). Such
definitions have of course no lexicographical, but only a moral aim.
That which is here given is designed to warn one against gaining for
himself this ambiguous title of a refined (cunning, versutus) man; one
is so named whose schemes and endeavours are directed to the doing of
evil. One may also inversely find the turning-point of the warning in
8b: "he who projects deceitful plans against the welfare of others,
finds his punishment in this, that he falls under public condemnation as
a worthless intriguer" (Elster). But מזמות is a ῥῆμα μέσον, vid., [Pro
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002.md); the title is thus equivocal, and
the turning-point lies in the bringing out of his kernel: מחשּׁב להרע =
meditating to do evil.

[Proverbs 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 24:9</span></span>

This proverb is connected by זמת with [Pro
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008.md), and by אויל with [Pro
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#007.md); it places the fool and the
mocker over against one another.

The undertaking of folly is sin;

And an abomination to men is the scorner.

Since it is certain that for 9b the subject is "the scorner," so also
"sin" is to be regarded as the subject of 9a. The special meaning
flagitium, as [Pro 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027.md), זמּה will
then not have here, but it derives it from the root-idea "to contrive,
imagine," and signifies first only the collection and forthputting of
the thoughts towards a definite end ([Job
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#011).md), particularly the refined
preparation, the contrivance of a sinful act. In a similar way we speak
of a sinful beginning or undertaking. But if one regards sin in itself,
or in its consequences, it is always a contrivance or desire of folly
(gen. subjecti), or: one that bears on itself (gen. qualitatis) the
character of folly; for it disturbs and destroys the relation of man to
God and man, and rests, as Socrates in Plato says, on a false
calculation. And the mocker (the mocker at religion and virtue) is תועבת
לאדם. The form of combination stands here before a word with ל, as at
[Job 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#002.md); [Job
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005.md), and frequently. but why does not
the poet say directly תועבת אדם? Perhaps to leave room for the double
sense, that the mocker is not only an abomination to men, viz., to the
better disposed; but also, for he makes others err as to their faith,
and draws them into his frivolous thoughts, becomes to them a cause of
abomination, i.e., of such conduct and of such thoughts as are an
abomination before God ([Pro 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#009.md),
[Pro 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#026).md).

[Proverbs 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 24:10</span></span>

The last of these four distichs stands without visible connection:

Hast thou shown thyself slack in the day of adversity,

Then is thy strength small.

The perf. 10a is the hypothetic, vid., at [Pro
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029.md). If a man shows himself remiss
([Pro 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#009).md), i.e., changeable,
timorous, incapable of resisting in times of difficulty, then shall he
draw therefrom the conclusion which is expressed in 10b. Rightly Luther,
with intentional generalization, "he is not strong who is not firm in
need." But the address makes the proverb an earnest admonition, which
speaks to him who shows himself weak the judgment which he has to
pronounce on himself. And the paronomasia צרה and צר may be rendered,
where possible, "if thy strength becomes, as it were, pressed together
and bowed down by the difficulty just when it ought to show itself
(viz., להרחיב לך), then it is limited, thou art a weakling." Thus
Fleischer accordingly, translating: si segnis fueris die angustiae,
angustae sunt vires tuae. Hitzig, on the contrary, corrects after [Job
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011), רוּחך "Klemm (klamm.md) ist dein
Mut" \[= strait is thy courage\]. And why? Of כסה \[strength\], he
remarks, one can say כשׁל \[it is weak\] ([Psa
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011).md), but scarcely צר \[strait,
straitened\]; for force is exact, and only the region of its energy may
be wide or narrow. To this we answer, that certainly of strength in
itself we cannot use the word כסה drow eht esu t in the sense here
required; the confinement (limitation) may rather be, as with a stream,
[Isa 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md), the increasing
(heightening) of its intensity. But if the strength is in itself
anything definite, then on the other hand its expression is something
linear, and the force in view of its expression is that which is here
called צר, i.e., not extending widely, not expanding, not inaccessible.
צר is all to which narrow limits are applied. A little strength is
limited, because it is little also in its expression.

[Proverbs 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 24:11</span></span>

Now, again, we meet with proverbs of several lines. The first here is a
hexastich:

11 Deliver them that are taken to death,

And them that are tottering to destruction, oh stop them!

12 If thou sayest, "We knew not of it indeed," -

It is not so: The Weigher of hearts, who sees through it,

And He that observeth thy soul, He knoweth it,

And requiteth man according to his work.

If אם is interpreted as a particle of adjuration, then אם־תּחשׂוך is
equivalent to: I adjure thee, forbear not (cf. [Neh
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#025.md) with [Isa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001).md), viz., that which thou hast to
do, venture all on it (lxx, Syr., Jerome). But the parallelism requires
us to take together מטים להרג (such as with tottering steps are led
forth to destruction) as object along with אם־תחשׂוך, as well as לקחים
למּות (such as from their condition are carried away to death, cf. [Exo
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011).md) as object to הצּל, in which all
the old interpreters have recognised the imper., but none the infin.
(eripere ... ne cesses, which is contrary to Heb. idiom, both in the
position of the words and in the construction). אם also is not to be
interpreted as an interrogative; for, thus expressed, an retinetis ought
rather to have for the converse the meaning: thou shalt indeed not do
it! (cf. e.g., [Isa 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016).md). And אם
cannot be conditional: si prohibere poteris (Michaelis and others), for
the fut. after אם has never the sense of a potential. Thus אם is, like
לוּ, understood in the sense of utinam, as it is used not merely
according to later custom (Hitzig), but from ancient times (cf. e.g.,
[Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md) with [Gen
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#013).md). כּי־תאמר (reminding

(Note: Vid., my hebrischen Rmerbrief, p. 14f.)

us of the same formula of the Rabbinical writings) introduces an
objection, excuse, evasion, which is met by הלא; introducing "so say I
on the contrary," it is of itself a reply, vid., [Deu
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#017.md). זה we will not have to interpret
personally (lxx τοῦτον); for, since [Pro
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md) speaks of several of them, the
neut. rendering (Syr., Targ., Venet., Luther) in itself lies nearer, and
זה, hoc, after ידע, is also in conformity with the usus loq.; vid., at
[Psa 56:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#010.md). But the neut. זה does not
refer to the moral obligation expressed in [Pro
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md); to save human life when it is
possible to do so, can be unknown to no one, wherefore Jerome (as if the
words of the text were אין לאל ידנוּ זה): vires non suppetunt. זה refers
to the fact that men are led to the tribunal; only thus is explained the
change of ידעתי, which was to be expected, into ידענוּ: the objection
is, that one certainly did not know, viz., that matters had come to an
extremity with them, and that a short process will be made with them. To
this excuse, with pretended ignorance, the reply of the omniscient God
stands opposed, and suggests to him who makes the excuse to consider: It
is not so: the Searcher of hearts (vid., at [Pro
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002).md), He sees through it, viz., what
goes on in thy heart, and He has thy soul under His inspection (נצר, as
[Job 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020.md) : lxx καὶ ὁ πλάσας; יצרו,
which Hitzig prefers, for he thinks that נצר must be interpreted in the
sense of to guard, preserve; Luther rightly); He knows, viz., how it is
with thy mind, He looks through it, He knows (cf. for both, [Psa
139:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001).md), and renders to man according
to his conduct, which, without being deceived, He judges according to
the state of the heart, out of which the conduct springs. It is to be
observed that [Pro 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md) speaks of one
condemned to death generally, and not expressly of one innocently
condemned, and makes no distinction between one condemned in war and in
peace. One sees from this that the Chokma generally has no pleasure in
this, that men are put to death by men, not even when it is done legally
as punishment for a crime. For, on the one side, it is true that the
punishment of the murderer by death is a law proceeding from the nature
of the divine holiness and the inviolability of the divine ordinance,
and the worth of man as formed in the image of God, and that the
magistrate who disowns this law as a law, disowns the divine foundation
of his office; but, on the other side, it is just as true that thousands
and thousands of innocent persons, or at least persons not worthy of
death, have fallen a sacrifice to the abuse or the false application of
this law; and that along with the principle of recompensative
righteousness, there is a principle of grace which rules in the kingdom
of God, and is represented in the O.T. by prophecy and the Chokma. It
is, moreover, a noticeable fact, that God did not visit with the
punishment of death the first murderer, the murderer of the innocent
Abel, his brother, but let the principle of grace so far prevail instead
of that of law, that He even protected his life against any avenger of
blood. But after that the moral ruin of the human race had reached that
height which brought the Deluge over the earth, there was promulgated to
the post-diluvians the word of the law, [Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md), sanctioning this inviolable right
of putting to death by the hand of justice. The conduct of God regulates
itself thus according to the aspect of the times. In the Mosaic law the
greatness of guilt was estimated not externally (cf. [Num
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031).md), but internally, a very
flexible limitation in its practical bearings. And that under certain
circumstances grace might have the precedence of justice, the parable
having in view the pardon of Absalom (2 Sam 14) shows. But a word from
God, like [Eze 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md), raises grace to
a principle, and the word with which Jesus ([Joh
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#011).md) dismisses the adulteress is
altogether an expression of this purpose of grace passing beyond the
purpose of justice. In the later Jewish commonwealth, criminal justice
was subordinated to the principle of predominating compassion; practical
effect was given to the consideration of the value of human life during
the trial, and even after the sentence was pronounced, and during a long
time no sentence of death was passed by the Sanhedrim. But Jesus, who
was Himself the innocent victim of a fanatical legal murder, adjudged,
it is true, the supremacy to the sword; but He preached and practised
love, which publishes grace for justice. He was Himself incarnate Love,
offering Himself for sinners, the Mercy which Jahve proclaims by [Eze
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md). The so-called Christian state
\["Citivas Dei"\] is indeed in manifest opposition to this. But
Augustine declares himself, on the supposition that the principle of
grace must penetrate the new ear, in all its conditions, that began with
Christianity, for the suspension of punishment by death, especially
because the heathen magistrates had abused the instrument of death,
which, according to divine right, they had control over, to the
destruction of Christians; and Ambrosius went so far as to impress it as
a duty on a Christian judge who had pronounced the sentence of death, to
exclude himself from the Holy Supper. The magisterial control over life
and death had at that time gone to the extreme height of bloody
violence, and thus in a certain degree it destroyed itself. Therefore
Jansen changes the proverb ([Pro
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011).md) with the words of Ambrosius
into the admonition: Quando indulgentia non nocet publico, eripe
intercessione, eripe gratia tu sacerdos, aut tu imperator eripe
subscriptionie indulgentiae. When Samuel Romilly's Bill to abolish the
punishment of death for a theft amounting to the sum of five shillings
passed the English House of Commons, it was thrown out by a majority in
the House of Lords. Among those who voted against the Bill were one
archbishop and five bishops. Our poet here in the Proverbs is of a
different mind. Even the law of Sinai appoints the punishment of death
only for man-stealing. The Mosaic code is incomparably milder than even
yet the Carolina. In expressions, however, like the above, a true
Christian spirit rules the spirit which condemns all blood-thirstiness
of justice, and calls forth to a crusade not only against the
inquisition, but also against such unmerciful, cruel executions even as

[Proverbs 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 24:13</span></span>

The proverb now following stands in no obvious relation with the
preceding. But in both a commencement is made with two lines, which
contain, in the former, the principal thought; in this here, its reason:

13 My son, eat honey, for it is good,

And honeycomb is sweet to thy taste.

14 So apprehend wisdom for thy soul;

When thou hast found it, there is a future,

And thy hope is not destroyed.

After its nearest fundamental thought, טוב, Arab. ṭejjib, means that
which smells and tastes well; honey (דּבשׁ, from דּבשׁ, to be thick,
consistent) has, besides, according to the old idea (e.g., in the
Koran), healing virtue, as in general bitterness is viewed as a property
of the poisonous, and sweetness that of the wholesome. נפתו is second
accus. dependent on אכל־, for honey and honeycomb were then spoken of as
different; נפת (from נפת, to pour, to flow out) is the purest honey
(virgin-honey), flowing of itself out of the comb. With right the
accentuation takes 13b as independent, the substantival clause
containing the reason, "for it is good:" honeycomb is sweet to thy
taste, i.e., applying itself to it with the impression of sweetness; על,
as at [Neh 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#005.md); [Psa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006) (Hitzig.md).

In the כּן of 14a, it is manifest that [Pro
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#013.md) is not spoken for its own sake.
To apprehend wisdom, is elsewhere equivalent to, to receive it into the
mind, [Pro 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002.md); [Ecc
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017.md) (cf. דעת בינה, [Pro
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001), and frequently.md), according to
which Bttcher also here explains: learn to understand wisdom. But כן
unfolds itself in 14bc: even as honey has for the body, so wisdom has
for the soul, beneficent wholesome effects. דעה חכמה is thus not
absolute, but is meant in relation to these effects. Rightly Fleischer:
talem reputa; Ewald: sic (talem) scito spaientiam (esse) animae tuae,
know, recognise wisdom as something advantageous to thy soul, and worthy
of commendation. Incorrectly Hitzig explains אם־מצאת, "if the
opportunity presents itself." Apart from this, that in such a case the
words would rather have been כּי תמצא, to find wisdom is always
equivalent to, to obtain it, to make it one's own, [Pro
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013.md); [Pro
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035.md); cf. [Pro
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005.md); [Pro
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#009.md). דּעה

(Note: Write דּעה with Illuj after the preceding Legarmeh, like 12b,
הוּא (Thorath Emeth, p. 28).)

stands for דּעה, after the form רדה; שׁבה (after Bttcher, 396, not
without the influence of the following commencing sound), cf. the
similar transitions of ā into ě placed together at [Psa
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#004.md); the form דּעה is also found, but
דּעה is the form in the Cod. Hilleli,

(Note: Vid., Strack's Prolegomena critica in V.T. (1872), p. 19.)

as confirmed by Moses Kimchi in Comm., and by David Kimchi, Michlol
101b. With ישׁו begins the apodosis (lxx, Jerome, Targ., Luther, Rashi,
Ewald, and others). In itself, וישׁ (cf. [Gen
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#006).md) might also continue the
conditional clause; but the explanation, si inveneris (eam) et ad
postremum ventum erit (Fleischer, Bertheau, Zckler), has this against
it, that ישׁ אחרית does not mean: the end comes, but: there is an end,
[Pro 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018.md); cf. [Pro
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#018.md); here: there is an end for thee,
viz., an issue that is a blessed reward. The promise is the same as at
[Pro 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018.md). In our own language we
speak of the hope of one being cut off; (Arab.) jaz'a, to be cut off, is
equivalent to, to give oneself up to despair.

[Proverbs 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 24:15</span></span>

15 Lie not in wait, oh wicked man, against the dwelling of the
righteous;

Assault not his resting-place.

16 For seven times doth the righteous fall and rise again,

But the wicked are overthrown when calamity falls on them.

The ארב \[lying in wait\] and שׁדּד \[practising violence\], against
which the warning is here given, are not directed, as at [Pro
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011.md); [Pro
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026.md), immediately against the person,
but against the dwelling-place and resting-place (רבץ, e.g., [Jer
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006), as also נוה, 3:33.md) of the
righteous, who, on his part, does injustice and wrong to no one; the
warning is against coveting his house, [Exo
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#017.md), and driving him by cunning and
violence out of it. Instead of רשׁע, Symmachus and Jerome have
incorrectly read רשׁע daer, and from this misunderstanding have here
introduced a sense without sense into [Pro
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#015.md); many interpreters (Lwenstein,
Ewald, Elster, and Zckler) translate with Luther appositionally: as a
wicked man, i.e., "with mischievous intent," like one stealthily lurking
for the opportunity of taking possession of the dwelling of another, as
if this could be done with a good intent: רשׁע is the vocative (Syr.,
Targ., Venet.: ἀσεβές), and this address (cf. [Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005)..md) sharpens the warning, for it
names him who acts in this manner by the right name. The reason, 16a,
sounds like an echo of [Job 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md). שׁבע
signifies, as at [Psa 119:164](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#164.md), seven
times; cf. מאה, [Pro 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#010.md). וקם (not
וקם) is perf. consec., as וחי, e.g., [Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022.md) : and he rises afterwards
(notwithstanding), but the transgressors come to ruin; בּרעה, if a
misfortune befall them (cf. [Pro
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032).md), they stumble and fall, and
rise no more.

[Proverbs 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 24:17</span></span>

Warning against a vindictive disposition, and joy over its satisfaction.

17 At the fall of thine enemy rejoice not,

And at his overthrow let not thine heart be glad;

18 That Jahve see it not, and it be displeasing to Him,

And He turns away His anger from Him.

The Chethı̂b, which in itself, as the plur. of category, אויביך, might be
tolerable, has 17b against it: with right, all interpreters adhere to
the Kerı̂ אויבך (with i from ē in doubled close syllable, as in the like
Kerı̂, [Sa1 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#005).md). וּבבּשׁלו, for
וּבהכּשׁלו, is the syncope usual in the inf. Niph. and Hiph., which in
Niph. occurs only once with the initial guttural (as בּעטף) or half
guttural (לראות). רעו is not adj. here as at [Sa1
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#003.md), but perf. with the force of a
fut. (Symmachus: καὶ μὴ ἀρέσῃ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ). The proverb extends the
duty of love even to an enemy; for it requires that we do good to him
and not evil, and warns against rejoicing when evil befalls him. Hitzig,
indeed, supposes that the noble morality which is expressed in [Pro
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017.md) is limited to a moderate extent
by the motive assigned in 18b. Certainly the poet means to say that God
could easily give a gracious turn for the better, as to the punishment
of the wicked, to the decree of his anger against his enemy; but his
meaning is not this, that one, from joy at the misfortune of others,
ought to desist from interrupting the process of the destruction of his
enemy, and let it go on to its end; but much rather, that one ought to
abstain from this joy, so as not to experience the manifestation of
God's displeasure thereat, but His granting grace to him against whom we
rejoice to see God's anger go forth.

(Note: This proverb, according to Aboth iv. 24, was the motto of that
Samuel with the surname הקטן, who formulated ברכת המינים (the
interpolation in the Schemone-Esre prayer directed against the
schismatics): he thus distinguished between private enemies and the
enemies of the truth.)

[Proverbs 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 24:19</span></span>

Warning against envying the godless for their external prosperity:

19 Be not enraged on account of evil-doers,

Envy not the godless;

20 For the wicked men shall have no future,

The light of the godless is extinguished.

Ver. 19 is a variation of [Psa 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md);
cf. also [Pro 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021.md) (where with
בכל־דרכיו following the traditional תבחר is more appropriate than תתחר,
which Hupfeld would here insert). תּתחר is fut. apoc. of התחרה, to be
heated (to be indignant), distinguished from the Tiphel תּחרה, to be
jealous. The ground and occasion of being enraged, and on the other
side, of jealousy or envy, is the prosperity of the godless, [Psa
73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003.md); cf. [Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md). This anger at the apparently
unrighteous division of fortune, this jealousy at the success in which
the godless rejoice, rest on short-sightedness, which regards the
present, and looks not on to the end. אחרית, merely as in the expression
'ישׁ אח, 14b (cf. [Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037).md), always
denotes the happy, glorious issue indemnifying for past sufferings. Such
an issue the wicked man has not; his light burns brightly on this side,
but one day it is extinguished. In 20b is repeated [Pro
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#009.md); cf. [Pro
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#020.md).

[Proverbs 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 24:21</span></span>

A warning against rebellious thoughts against God and the king:

21 My son, honour Jahve and the king,

And involve not thyself with those who are otherwise disposed;

22 For suddenly their calamity ariseth,

And the end of their years, who knoweth it?

The verb שׁנה, proceeding from the primary idea of folding (complicare,
duplicare), signifies transitively to do twice, to repeat, [Pro
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009.md); [Pro
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011.md), according to which Kimchi here
inappropriately thinks on relapsing; and intransitively, to change, to
be different, [Est 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#007.md); [Est
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#008.md). The Syr. and Targ. translate the
word שׁטיי, fools; but the Kal (טעמו) שׁנה occurs, indeed, in the Syr.,
but not in the Heb., in the meaning alienata est (mens ejus); and
besides, this meaning, alieni, is not appropriate here. A few, however,
with Saadia (cf. Deutsch-Morgenlndische Zeitschr. xxi. 616), the
dualists (Manichees), understand it in a dogmatic sense; but then שׁונים
must be denom. of שׁנים, while much more it is its root-word. Either
שׁונים means those who change, novantes = novarum rerum studiosi, which
is, however, exposed to this objection, that the Heb. שׁנה, in the
transitive sense to change, does not elsewhere occur; or it means,
according to the usus loq., diversos = diversum sentientes (C. B.
Michaelis and others), and that with reference to 21a: הממרים דבריהם
ומצותם (Meri, Immanuel), or משׁנים מנהג החכמה (Ahron b. Joseph). Thus
they are called (for it is a common name of a particular class of men)
dissidents, oppositionists, or revolutionaries, who recognise neither
the monarchy of Jahve, the King of kings, nor that of the earthly king,
which perhaps Jerome here means by the word detractoribus (=
detractatoribus). The Venet. incorrectly, σὺν τοῖς μισοῦσι, i.e.,
שׂונאים. with ב at [Pro 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010.md), התערב
meant to mix oneself up with something, here with עם, to mix oneself
with some one, i.e., to make common cause with him.

The reason assigned in [Pro 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022.md) is,
that although such persons as reject by thought and action human and
divine law may for a long time escape punishment, yet suddenly merited
ruin falls on them. איד is, according to its primary signification,
weighty, oppressive misfortune, vid., i. 27. In יקוּם it is thought of
as hostile power ([Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014).md); or the
rising up of God as Judge (e.g., [Isa
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010).md) is transferred to the means of
executing judgment. פּיד (= פּוד of פוד or פיד ro פו, Arab. fâd, fut.
jafûdu or jafı̂du, a stronger power of bâd, cogn. אבד) is destruction
(Arab. fied, fı̂d, death); this word occurs, besides here, only thrice in
the Book of Job. But to what does שׁניהם refer? Certainly not to Jahve
and the king (lxx, Schultens, Umbreit, and Bertheau), for in itself it
is doubtful to interpret the genit. after פיד as designating the
subject, but improper to comprehend God and man under one cipher. Rather
it may refer to two, of whom one class refuse to God, the other to the
king, the honour that is due (Jerome, Luther, and at last Zckler); but
in the foregoing, two are not distinguished, and the want of reverence
for God, and for the magistrates appointed by Him, is usually met with,
because standing in interchangeable relationship, in one and the same
persons. Is there some misprint then in this word? Ewald suggests
שׁניהם, i.e., of those who show themselves as שׁונים (altercatores)
towards God and the king. In view of קמיהם, [Exo
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025.md), this brevity of expression must
be regarded as possible. But if this were the meaning of the word, then
it ought to have stood in the first member (איד שׁניהם), and not in the
second. No other conjecture presents itself. Thus שׁניהם is perhaps to
be referred to the שׁונים, and those who engage with them: join thyself
not with the opposers; for suddenly misfortune will come upon them, and
the destruction of both (of themselves and their partisans), who knows
it? But that also is not satisfactory, for after the address שׁניכם was
to have been expected, 22b. Nothing remains, therefore, but to
understand שׁניהם, with the Syr. and Targ., as at [Job
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#011.md); the proverb falls into rhythms
פּתאם and פּיד, שׁונים and שׁניהם. But "the end of their year" is not
equivalent to the hour of their death (Hitzig), because for this פּידם
(cf. Arab. feid and fı̂d, death) was necessary; but to the expiring, the
vanishing, the passing by of the year during which they have succeeded
in maintaining their ground and playing a part. There will commence a
time which no one knows beforehand when all is over with them. In this
sense, "who knoweth," with its object, is equivalent to "suddenly
ariseth," with its subject. In the lxx, after [Pro
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022.md), there follow one distich of the
relations of man to the word of God as deciding their fate, one distich
of fidelity as a duty towards the king, and the duty of the king, and
one pentastich or hexastich of the power of the tongue and of the anger
of the king. The Heb. text knows nothing of these three proverbs. Ewald
has, Jahrb. xi. 18f., attempted to translate them into Heb., and is of
opinion that they are worthy of being regarded as original component
parts of chap. 1-29, and that they ought certainly to have come in after
[Pro 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022.md). We doubt this originality,
but recognise their translation from the Heb. Then follows in the lxx
the series of Prov; [Pro 30:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md),
which in the Heb. text bear the superscription of "the Words of Agur;"
the second half of the "Words of Agur," together with the "Words of
Lemuel," stand after [Pro 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#034.md) of the
Heb. text. The state of the matter is this, that in the copy from which
the Alexandrines translated the Appendix 30:1-31:9, stood half of it,
after the "Words of the Wise" \[which extend from [Pro
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md) to [Pro
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022.md)\], and half after the supplement
headed "these also are from wise men" \[[Pro
24:23-34](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md)\], so that only the
proverbial ode in praise of the excellent matron \[[Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md)\] remains as an appendix to the
Book of Hezekiah's collection, chap. 25-29.

[Proverbs 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 24:23</span></span>

The curse of partiality and the blessing of impartiality:

Respect of persons in judgment is by no means good:

24 He that saith to the guilty, "Thou art in the right,"

Him the people curse, nations detest.

25 But to them who rightly decide, it is well,

And upon them cometh blessing with good.

Partiality is either called שׂאת פנים, [Pro
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005.md), respect to the person, for the
partisan looks with pleasure on the פני, the countenance, appearance,
personality of one, by way of preference; or הכּר־פּנים, as here and at
[Pro 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021.md), for he places one person
before another in his sight, or, as we say, has a regard to him; the
latter expression is found in [Deu
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#017.md); [Deu
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#019.md). הכּיר (vid., [Pro
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#011).md) means to regard sharply,
whether from interest in the object, or because it is strange. בּל
Heidenheim regards as weaker than לא; but the reverse is the case (vid.,
vol. i. p. 204), as is seen from the derivation of this negative (=
balj, from בּלה, to melt, to decay); thus it does not occur anywhere
else than here with the pred. adj. The two supplements delight in this
בל, [Deu 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#029.md); [Deu
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007.md), 35. The thesis 23b is now
confirmed in [Pro 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#024.md) and [Pro
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#025.md), from the consequences of this
partiality and its opposite: He that saith (אמר, with Mehuppach Legarmeh
from the last syllable, as rightly by Athias, Nissel, and Michaelis,
vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 32) to the guilty: thou art right, i.e., he who
sets the guilty free (for רשׁע and צדּיק have here the forensic sense of
the post-bibl. חיּב and זכּי), him they curse, etc.; cf. the shorter
proverb, [Pro 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#015.md), according to
which a partial, unjust judge is an abomination to God. Regarding נקב
(קבב) here and at [Pro 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#026.md),
Schultens, under [Job 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008.md), is right;
the word signifies figere, and hence to distinguish and make prominent
by distinguishing as well as by branding; cf. defigere, to curse,
properly, to pierce through. Regarding זעם, vid., at [Pro
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014.md). עמּים and לאמּים (from עמם and
לאם, which both mean to bind and combine) are plur. of categ.: not
merely individuals, not merely families, curse such an unrighteous judge
and abhor him, but the whole people in all conditions and ranks of
society; for even though such an unjust judge bring himself and his
favourites to external honour, yet among no people is conscience so
blunted, that he who absolves the crime and ennobles the miscarriage of
justice shall escape the vox populi. On the contrary, it goes well
(ינעם, like [Pro 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md); [Pro
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#017.md), but here with neut. indef. subj.
as ייטב, [Gen 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#013), and frequently.md)
with those who place the right, and particularly the wrong, fully to
view; מוכיח is he who mediates the right, [Job
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033.md), and particularly who proves,
censures, punishes the wrong, [Pro
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md), and in the character of a judge
as here, [Amo 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md); [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md). The genitive connection
ברכּת־טוב is not altogether of the same signification as יין הטּוב, wine
of a good sort, [Sol 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010.md), and אושׁת
רע, a woman of a bad kind, [Pro 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024.md),
for every blessing is of a good kind; the gen. טוב thus, as at [Psa
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md), denotes the contents of the
blessing; cf. [Eph 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md), "with all
spiritual blessings," in which the manifoldness of the blessing is
presupposed.

[Proverbs 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 24:26</span></span>

Then follows a distich with the watchword נצחים:

26 He kisseth the lips

Who for the end giveth a right answer.

The lxx, Syr., and Targ. translate: one kisseth the lips who, or: of
those who...; but such a meaning is violently forced into the word (in
that case the expression would have been שׂפתי משׁיב or שׂפתים משׁיבים).
Equally impossible is Theodotion's χείλεσι καταφιληθήσεται, for ישּׁק
cannot be the fut. Niph. Nor is it: lips kiss him who... (Rashi); for,
to be thus understood, the word ought to have been למשׁיב. משׁיב is
naturally to be taken as the subj., and thus it supplies the meaning: he
who kisseth the lips giveth an excellent answer, viz., the lips of him
whom the answer concerns (Jerome, Venet., Luther). But Hitzig
ingeniously, "the words reach from the lips of the speaker to the ears
of the hearer, and thus he kisses his ear with his lips." But since to
kiss the ear is not a custom, not even with the Florentines, then a
welcome answer, if its impression is to be compared to a kiss, is
compared to a kiss on the lips. Hitzig himself translates: he commends
himself with the lips who...; but נשׁק may mean to join oneself, [Gen
41:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040.md), as kissing is equivalent to the
joining of the lips; it does not mean intrans. to cringe. Rather the
explanation: he who joins the lips together...; for he, viz., before
reflecting, closed his lips together (suggested by Meri); but נשׁק, with
שׂפתים, brings the idea of kissing, labra labris jungere, far nearer.
This prevails against Schultens' armatus est (erit) labia, besides נשׁק,
certainly, from the primary idea of connecting (laying together) (vid.,
[Psa 78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009)), to equip (arm.md) oneself
therewith; but the meaning arising from thence: with the lips he arms
himself... is direct nonsense. Fleischer is essentially right, Labra
osculatur (i.e., quasi osculum oblatum reddit) qui congrua respondet.
Only the question has nothing to do with a kiss; but if he who asks
receives a satisfactory answer, an enlightening counsel, he experiences
it as if he received a kiss. The Midrash incorrectly remarks under
דּברים נצחים, "words of merited denunciation," according to which the
Syr. translates. Words are meant which are corresponding to the matter
and the circumstances, and suitable for the end (cf. [Pro
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#009).md). Such words are like as if the

[Proverbs 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 24:27</span></span>

Warning against the establishing of a household where the previous
conditions are wanting:

Set in order thy work without,

And make it ready for thyself beforehand in the fields, -

After that then mayest thou build thine house.

The interchange of בּחוּץ and בּשּׂדה shows that by מלאכת השּׂדה
field-labour, [Ch1 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#026.md), is meant.
הכין, used of arrangement, procuring, here with מלאכה, signifies the
setting in order of the word, viz., the cultivation of the field. In the
parallel member, עתּדה, carrying also its object, in itself is
admissible: make preparations (lxx, Syr.); but the punctuation עתּדהּ
(Targ., Venet.; on the other hand, Jerome and Luther translate as if the
words were ועתדה השּׂדה) is not worthy of being contended against: set
it (the work) in the fields in readiness, i.e., on the one hand set
forward the present necessary work, and on the other hand prepare for
that which next follows; thus: do completely and circumspectly what thy
calling as a husbandman requires of thee - then mayest thou go to the
building and building up of thy house (vid., at [Pro
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#003.md), [Pro
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001).md), to which not only the building
and setting in order of a convenient dwelling, but also the bringing
home of a housewife and the whole setting up of a household belongs;
prosperity at home is conditioned by this - one fulfils his duty without
in the fields actively and faithfully. One begins at the wrong end when
he begins with the building of his house, which is much rather the
result and goal of an intelligent discharge of duty within the sphere of
one's calling. The perf., with ו after a date, such as אחר, עוד מעט, and
the like, when things that will or should be done are spoken of, has the
fut. signification of a perf. consec., [Gen
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#005.md); [Exo
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#006.md)., [Pro
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#004.md); Ewald, 344b.

[Proverbs 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 24:28</span></span>

Warning against unnecessary witnessing to the disadvantage of another:

Never be a causeless witness against thy neighbour;

And shouldest thou use deceit with thy lips?

The phrase עד־חנּם does not mean a witness who appears against his
neighbour without knowledge of the facts of the case, but one who has no
substantial reason for his giving of testimony; חנּם means groundless,
with reference to the occasion and motive, [Pro
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#030.md); [Pro
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#029.md); [Pro
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002.md). Other designations stood for
false witnesses (lxx, Syr., Targ.). Rightly Jerome, the Venet., and
Luther, without, however, rendering the gen. connection עד־חנם, as it
might have been by the adj.

In 28b, Chajg derives והפתּית from פּתת, to break in pieces, to crumble;
for he remarks it might stand, with the passing over of into , for
והפתּות \[and thou wilt whisper\]. But the ancients had no acquaintance
with the laws of sound, and therefore with naive arbitrariness regarded
all as possible; and Bttcher, indeed, maintains that the Hiphil of פתת
may be הפתּית as well as הפתּות; but the former of these forms with
could only be metaplastically possible, and would be הפתּית (vid.,
Hitzig under [Jer 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020).md). And what can
this Hiph. of פתת mean? "To crumble" one's neighbours (Chajg) is an
unheard of expression; and the meanings, to throw out crumbs, viz.,
crumbs of words (Bttcher), or to speak with a broken, subdued voice
(Hitzig), are extracted from the rare Arab. fatâfit (faṭafiṭ), for which
the lexicographers note the meaning of a secret, moaning sound. When we
see והפתית standing along with בּשׂפתיך, then before all we are led to
think of פתה \[to open\], [Pro 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#019.md);
Ps. 73:36. But we stumble at the interrog. ה, which nowhere else appears
connected with ו. Ewald therefore purposes to read והפתּית \[and will
open wide\] (lxx μηδὲ πλατύνου): "that thou usest treachery with thy
lips;" but from הפתה, to make wide open, [Gen
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027.md), "to use treachery" is, only for
the flight of imagination, not too wide a distance. On וה, et num, one
need not stumble; והלוא, [Sa2 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#035.md),
shows that the connection of a question by means of ו is not
inadmissible; Ewald himself takes notice that in the Arab. the
connection of the interrogatives 'a and hal with w and f is quite
common;

(Note: We use the forms âwa, âba, âthûmm, for we suppose the
interrogative to the copula; we also say fahad, vid., Mufaṣsal, p. 941.)

and thus he reaches the explanation: wilt thou befool then by thy lips,
i.e., pollute by deceit, by inconsiderate, wanton testimony against
others? This is the right explanation, which Ewald hesitates about only
from the fact that the interrog. ה comes in between the ו consec. and
its perf., a thing which is elsewhere unheard of. But this difficulty is
removed by the syntactic observation, that the perf. after
interrogatives has often the modal colouring of a conj. or optative,
e.g., after the interrog. pronoun, [Gen
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007.md), quis dixerit, and after the
interrogative particle, as here and at [Kg2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#009.md), iveritne, where it is to be
supplied (vid., at [Isa 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#008).md). Thus:
et num persuaseris (deceperis) labiis tuis, and shouldest thou practise
slander with thy lips, for thou bringest thy neighbour, without need, by
thy uncalled for rashness, into disrepute? "It is a question, âl'nakar
(cf. [Pro 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#005).md), for which 'a (not
hal), in the usual Arab. interrogative: how, thou wouldest? one then
permits the inquirer to draw the negative answer: "No, I will not do it"
(Fleischer).

[Proverbs 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 24:29</span></span>

The following proverb is connected as to its subject with the foregoing:
one ought not to do evil to his neighbour without necessity; even evil
which has been done to one must not be requited with evil:

Say not, "As he hath done to me, so I do to him:

I requite the man according to his conduct."

On the ground of public justice, the talio is certainly the nearest form
of punishment, [Lev 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#019.md).; but even
here the Sinaitic law does not remain in the retortion of the injury
according to its external form (it is in a certain manner practicable
only with regard to injury done to the person and to property), but
places in its stead an atonement measured and limited after a higher
point of view. On pure moral grounds, the jus talionis ("as thou to me,
so I to thee") has certainly no validity. Here he to whom injustice is
done ought to commit his case to God, [Pro
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#022.md), and to oppose to evil, not evil
but good; he ought not to set himself up as a judge, nor to act as one
standing on a war-footing with his neighbour ([Jdg
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#011).md); but to take God as his
example, who treats the sinner, if only he seeks it, not in the way of
justice, but of grace ([Exo 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006)..md).
The expression 29b reminds of [Pro
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012.md). Instead of לאדם, there is used
here, where the speaker points to a definite person, the phrase לאישׁ.
Jerome, the Venet., and Luther translate: to each one, as if the word
were vocalized thus, לאישׁ (Ps. 62:13).

[Proverbs 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 24:30</span></span>

A Mashal ode of the slothful, in the form of a record of experiences,
concludes this second supplement (vid., vol. i. p. 17):

30 The field of a slothful man I came past,

And the vineyard of a man devoid of understanding.

31 And, lo! it was wholly filled up with thorns;

Its face was covered with nettles;

And its wall of stones was broken down.

32 But I looked and directed my attention to it;

I saw it, and took instruction from it:

33 "A little sleep, a little slumber,

A little folding of the hands to rest.

34 Then cometh thy poverty apace,

And thy want as an armed man."

The line 29b with לאישׁ is followed by one with אישׁ. The form of the
narrative in which this warning against drowsy slothfulness is clothed,
is like [Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md). The distinguishing
of different classes of men by אישׁ and אדם (cf. [Pro
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#020).md) is common in proverbial poetry.
עברתּי, at the close of the first parallel member, retains its Pathach
unchanged. The description: and, lo! (הנּהו, with Pazer, after Thorath
Emeth, p. 34, Anm. 2) it was... refers to the vineyard, for נדר אבניו
(its stone wall, like [Isa 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020.md), "its
idols of silver") is, like [Num 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#024.md);
[Isa 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md), the fencing in of the
vineyard. עלה כלּו, totus excreverat (in carduos), refers to this as
subject, cf. in Ausonius: apex vitibus assurgit; the Heb. construction
is as [Isa 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md); [Isa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013.md); Gesen. 133, 1, Anm. 2. The
sing. קמּשׁון of קמּשׁונים does not occur; perhaps it means properly the
weed which one tears up to cast it aside, for (Arab.) kumâsh is matter
dug out of the ground.

(Note: This is particularly the name of what lies round about on the
ground in the Bedouin tents, and which one takes up from thence (from
ḳamesh, cogn. קבץ קמץ, ramasser, cf. the journal המגיד, 1871, p. 287b);
in modern Arab., linen and matter of all kinds; vid., Bocthor, under
linge and toffe.)

The ancients interpret it by urticae; and חרוּל, plur. חרלּים (as from
חרל), R. חר, to burn, appears, indeed, to be the name of the nettle; the
botanical name (Arab.) khullar (beans, pease, at least a leguminous
plant) is from its sound not Arab., and thus lies remote.

(Note: Perhaps ὄλυρα, vid., Lagarde's Gesamm. Abhandl. p. 59.)

The Pual כּסּוּ sounds like [Psa 80:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#011.md)
(cf. כּלּוּ, [Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020).md); the position
of the words is as this passage of the Psalm; the Syr., Targ., Jerome,
and the Venet. render the construction actively, as if the word were
כּסּוּ.

In [Pro 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#032.md), Hitzig proposes to read
ואחזה: and I stopped (stood still); but אחז is trans., not only at [Ecc
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#009.md), but also at [Ecc
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md) : to hold anything fast; not: to
hold oneself still. And for what purpose the change? A contemplating and
looking at a thing, with which the turning and standing near is here
connected, manifestly includes a standing still; ראיתי, after ואחזה, is,
as commonly after הביט (e.g., [Job
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#005.md), cf. [Isa
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#018).md), the expression of a lingering
looking at an object after the attention has been directed to it. In
modern impressions, ואחזה אנכי are incorrectly accentuated; the old
editions have rightly ואחזה with Reba; for not אנכי 'וא, but אנכי אשׁית
are connected. In [Pro 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017.md), this
prominence of the personal pronoun serves for the expression of
reciprocity; elsewhere, as e.g., [Gen
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#024.md); [Kg2
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#003.md), and particularly, frequently in
Hosea, this circumstantiality does not make the subject prominent, but
the action; here the suitable extension denotes that he rightly makes
his comments at leisure (Hitzig). שׁית לב is, as at [Pro
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md), the turning of attention and
reflection; elsewhere לקח מוּסר, to receive a moral, [Pro
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#010.md), [Jer
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028.md), is here equivalent to, to
abstract, deduce one from a fact, to take to oneself a lesson from it.
In [Pro 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033.md) and [Pro
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#034.md) there is a repetition of [Pro
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#009.md). Thus, as [Pro
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033.md) expresses, the sluggard speaks
to whom the neglected piece of ground belongs, and [Pro
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#034.md) places before him the result.
Instead of כמהלּך of the original passage \[[Pro
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#009.md)\], here מתהלך, of the coming of
poverty like an avenging Nemesis; and instead of וּמחסרך, here וּמחסריך
(the Cod. Jaman. has it without the י), which might be the plene written
pausal form of the sing. (vid., at [Pro
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#003.md), cf. [Pro
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011).md), but is more surely regarded as
the plur.: thy deficits, or wants; for to thee at one time this, and at
another time that, and finally all things will be wanting. Regarding the
variants ראשׁך and רישׁך (with א in the original passage, here in the
borrowed passage with י), vid., at [Pro
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004.md). כּאישׁ מגן is translated in the
lxx by ὥσπερ ἀγαθὸς δρομεύς (vid., at [Pro
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011).md); the Syr. and Targ. make from it
a גּברא טבלרא, tabellarius, a letter-carrier, coming with the speed of a
courier.
