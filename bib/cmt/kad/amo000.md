Amos

Introduction

The Prophet. - Amos (עמוס, i.e., Bearer or Burden), according to the
heading to his book, was "among the shepherds (nōqedı̄m) of Tekoah" when
the Lord called him to be a prophet; that is to say, he was a native of
Tekoah, a town situated on the borders of the desert of Judah, two hours
to the south of Bethlehem, the ruins of which have been preserved under
the ancient name (see at [Jos 15:59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#059.md),
lxx), and lived with the shepherds who fed their sheep in the steppe to
the east of Tekoah; of course not as a rich owner of flocks, but simply
as a shepherd. For even though nōqēd is applied to the Moabitish king in
[Kg2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md) as a rich owner of a choice
breed of sheep and goats, the word properly signifies only a rearer of
sheep, i.e., not merely the owner, but the shepherd of choice sheep, as
Bochart (Hieroz. i. p. 483, ed. Ros.) has proved from the Arabic. But
Amos himself affirms, in [Amo 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014.md),
that he was a simple shepherd. He there replies to the priest at Bethel,
who wanted to prevent him from prophesying in the kingdom of Israel: "I
am not a prophet, nor yet a prophet's pupil, but a herdman (bōqēd) am I,
and bōlēs shiqmı̄m, a gatherer of sycamores" (see at [Amo
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014).md), - i.e., one who fed upon this
fruit, which resembles figs, and is described by Pliny (hist. n. 13,
14), as praedulcis, but which, according to Strabo, xvii. 823 (ἄτιμος
κατὰ τὴν γεῦσιν), was very lightly esteemed as food, and also, according
to Dioscor., was ἄτιμος καὶ κακοστόμαχος, and which is only used in
Egypt as the food of the common people (Norden, Reise, p. 118).
Consequently we have to regard Amos as a shepherd living in indigent
circumstances, not as a prosperous man possessing both a flock of sheep
and a sycamore plantation, which many commentators, following the
Chaldee and the Rabbins, have made him out to be. Without having
dedicated himself to the calling of a prophet, and without even being
trained in the schools of the prophets, he was called by the Lord away
from the flock to be a prophet, to prophesy concerning Israel ([Amo
7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014).md), under the Judaean king
Uzziah and the Israelitish king Jeroboam II, i.e., within the twenty-six
years of the contemporaneous rule of these two kings, or between 810 and
783 b.c. Amos therefore commenced his prophetic labours about the same
time as Hosea, probably a few years earlier, and prophesied in Bethel,
the chief seat of the Israelitish image-worship ([Amo
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010).md). We cannot fix with any greater
exactness either the time of his appearing or the duration of his
ministry; for the notice in [Amo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md),
"two years before the earthquake," furnishes no chronological datum,
because the time of the earthquake is unknown. It is never mentioned in
the historical books of the Old Testament, though it can hardly be any
other than the terrible earthquake in the time of Uzziah, which the
people had not forgotten even after the captivity, inasmuch as Zechariah
was able to recal the flight that took place on that occasion ([Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005).md). As Amos has not given the date
of the earthquake, his evident intention was not to fix the time when
his ministry commenced, or when his book was composed, but simply to
point to the internal connection between this event and his own
prophetic mission. According to the teaching of Scripture, the earth
quakes when the Lord comes to judgment upon the nations (see at [Amo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008).md). The earthquake which shook
Jerusalem two years after the appearance of Amos as the prophet, was a
harbinger of the judgment threatened by Him against the two kingdoms of
Israel and the surrounding nations, - a practical declaration on the
part of God that He would verify the word of His servant; and the
allusion to this divine sign on the part of the prophet was an
admonition to Israel to lay to heart the word of the Lord which he had
announced to them. So far as the explanation and importance of his
prophecies were concerned, it was enough to mention the kings of Judah
and Israel in whose reigns he prophesied.

Under these kings the two kingdoms stood at the summit of their
prosperity. Uzziah had completely subdued the Edomites, had subjugated
the Philistines, and had even made the Ammonites tributary. He had also
fortified Jerusalem strongly, and had raised a powerful army; so that
his name reached as far as Egypt (2 Chronicles 26). And Jeroboam had
completely overcome the Syrians, and restored the original borders of
the kingdom from the country of Hamath to the Dead Sea ([Kg2
14:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md). After the power of the
Syrians had been broken, Israel had no longer any foe to fear, for
Assyria had not yet arisen as a conquering power. The supposition that
Calneh or Ctesiphon is represented in [Amo
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002.md) as having already been taken (by
the Assyrians), rests upon an incorrect interpretation, and is just as
erroneous as the inference, also drawn from the same passage, that
Hamath was conquered and Gath destroyed. Amos does not mention the
Assyrians at all; although in [Amo 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md)
he threatens the Syrians with transportation to Kir, and in [Amo
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027.md) predicts that the Israelites will
be carried into captivity beyond Damascus. In the existing state of
things, the idea of the approaching fall or destruction of the kingdom
of Israel was, according to human judgment, a very improbable one
indeed. The inhabitants of Samaria and Zion felt themselves perfectly
secure in the consciousness of their might ([Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001).md). The rulers of the kingdom
trusted in the strength of their military resources ([Amo
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013).md), and were only concerned to
increase their wealth by oppressing the poor, and to revel in earthly
luxuries and pleasures ([Amo 2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006.md);
[Amo 5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md); [Amo
6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004).md); so that the prophet denounces
woes upon those who are in security upon Zion and without care upon the
mountain of Samaria ([Amo 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001).md), and
utters the threat that the Lord will cause the sun to set at noon, and
bring darkness over the land in broad daylight ([Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009).md).

It was at such a time as this that the plain shepherd of Tekoah was sent
to Bethel, into the kingdom of the ten tribes, to announce to the
careless sinners the approach of the divine judgment, and the
destruction of the kingdom. And whilst it was in itself a strange event
for a prophet to be sent out of Judah into the kingdom of the ten
tribes, - so strange, in fact, that in all probability it had never
occurred since the kingdom had been founded, or at any rate, that no
second instance of the kind is recorded, from the time when the man of
God was sent out of Judah to Bethel in the reign of Jeroboam I (1 Kings
13), down to the time of Amos himself-it must have attracted universal
attention, for a man to rise up who belonged to the rank of a shepherd,
who had had no training at all for a prophet's vocation, but who
nevertheless proved, by the demonstration of the Spirit, that he was a
prophet indeed, and who foretold, in the strength of God, what
destruction awaited the covenant people, before there was the slightest
human probability of any such catastrophe.

The prophet's style of composition does indeed betray the former
shepherd in the use of certain words, which evidently belonged to the
dialect of the common people, - e.g., מעיק for מציק ([Amo
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013).md), בּושׁס for בּוסס ([Amo
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011).md), מתאב for מתעב rof מ ([Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008).md), מסרף for משׂרף ([Amo
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010).md), ישׂחק for יצחק ([Amo
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#009.md), [Amo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016).md), נשׁקה for נשׁקעה ([Amo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008).md), and in many figures and similes
drawn from nature and rural life; but for the rest, it indicates a close
acquaintance on the part of the prophet with the Mosaic law and the
history of his nation, and also considerable rhetorical power, wealth
and depth of thought, vivacity and vigour, more especially in the use of
bold antitheses, and a truly poetical roll, which rises by no means
unfrequently into actual rhythm; so that Lowth has already expressed the
following opinion concerning him (De poesi sacr. ed. Mich. p. 433):
"Aequus judex, de re non de homine quaesiturus, censebit, credo,
pastorem nostrum μηφὲν ὑστερηκέναι τῶν ὑπερλίαν προφητῶν sensuum
elatione et magnificentia spiritus prope summis parem, ita etiam
dictionis splendore et compositionis elegantia vix quoquam inferiorem."
Beyond these facts, which we gather from the prophet's won writings,
nothing further is known of the circumstances connected with his life.
After fulfilling his mission, he probably returned to Judah, his native
land, where his prophecies were most likely first committed to writing.
The apocryphal accounts of his death, in Pseud.-Epiphanius, c. 12, and
Pseudo-Doroth. (see Carpzov, p. 319), have no historical value whatever.

2\. The Book. - Although Amos was sent by the Lord to Bethel, to
prophesy to the people of Israel there, he does not restrict himself in
his prophecy to the kingdom of the ten tribes, but, like his younger
contemporary Hosea, notices the kingdom of Judah as well, and even the
surrounding nations, that were hostile to the covenant nation. His book
is not a mere collection of the addresses delivered in Bethel, but a
carefully planned, complete work, in which Amos, after the occurrence of
the earthquake in the time of Uzziah, gathered together all the
essential contents of the prophecies he had previously uttered at
Bethel. It consists of a lengthy introduction ([Amo
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001), 2.md) and two parts, viz., simple
prophetic addresses (ch. 4-6), and visions with short explanations (ch.
7). In the introduction the prophet proclaims, in the following manner,
the judgment about to fall upon Damascus, Philistia, Tyre, Edom, Ammon,
Moab, Judah, and Israel. The storm of the Lord, which bursts upon all
these kingdoms, remains suspended over the kingdom of Israel, which is
mentioned last. This is evident from the fact, that the sin of Israel is
depicted more fully than that of the other nations; and the threatening
of judgment is couched in such general terms, that it can only be
regarded as a provisional announcement, or as the introduction to the
body of the book by which it is followed. The first part contains an
extended address, divided into three sections by the recurrence of
שׁמעוּ (hear ye) in [Amo 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001.md); [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md), and [Amo
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md). The address consists of a "great
warning to repent," in which the prophet holds up before the sinful
Israelites, especially the rulers of the kingdom, the arts of injustice
and wickedness that are current among them, and proclaims a judgment
which embraces the destruction of the palaces and holy places, the
overthrow of the kingdom, and the transportation of the people. In [Amo
3:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001.md) the sin and punishment are
described in the most general form. In [Amo
4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md) the prophet sweeps away from
the self-secure sinners the false ground of confidence afforded by their
own worship, recals to their mind the judgments with which God has
already visited them, and summons them to stand before God as their
judge. In ch. 5 and [Amo 6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md), after
a mournful elegy concerning the fall of the house of Israel ([Amo
5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001).md), he points out to the penitent
the way to life coupled with the repeated summons to seek the Lord, and
that which is good ([Amo 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md), [Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006.md), [Amo
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014).md); and then, in the form of a woe,
for which a double reason is assigned ([Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md); [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001).md), he takes away all hope of
deliverance from the impenitent and hardened. Throughout the whole of
this address Amos prophesies chiefly to the ten tribes, whom he
repeatedly addresses, predicting ruin and exile. At the same time, he
not only addresses his words in the introduction ([Amo
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001).md) to all Israel of the twelve
tribes, whom Jehovah brought out of Egypt, but he also pronounces the
last woe ([Amo 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001).md) upon the secure
ones on Zion, and the careless ones on the mountain of Samaria; so that
his prophecy also applies to the kingdom of Judah, and sets before it
the same fate as that of the kingdom of the ten tribes, if it should
fall into the same sin. The second part contains five visions, and at
the close the proclamation of salvation. the first two visions ([Amo
7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001.md) and [Amo
7:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004).md) threaten judgments; the next
two ([Amo 7:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007.md); [Amo
8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001).md) point out the impossibility of
averting the judgment, and the ripeness of the people for it. Between
these, viz., in [Amo 7:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010.md), the
conversation between the prophet and the chief priest at Bethel is
related. The substance of the fourth vision is carried out still
further, in a simple prophetic address ([Amo
8:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004).md). Lastly, the fifth vision
([Amo 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001).md) shows the overthrow and
ruin of the whole of Israel, and is also still further expanded in a
plain address ([Amo 9:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002).md). To this
there is appended the promise of the restoration of the fallen kingdom
of God, of its extension through the adoption of the Gentiles, and of
its eternal glorification ([Amo
9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md). This conclusion corresponds
to the introduction ([Amo 1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md) and
2). Like all the nations that rise up in hostility to the kingdom of
God, even Judah and Israel shall fall victims to the judgment, on
account of their unrighteousness and idolatry, in order that the kingdom
of God may be purified from its dross, be exalted to glory, and so be
made perfect. This is the fundamental thought of the writings of Amos,
who was called by the Lord to preach this truth to the nation of Israel.
And just as the close of his book points back to the introduction ([Amo
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001) and 2.md), so also do the visions
of the second part correspond to the addresses of the first, embodying
the substance of the addresses in significant symbols. The parallel
between the fifth vision and the elegy struck up in [Amo
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md) is very conspicuous; and it is
also impossible to overlook the material agreement between the first and
second visions and the enumeration in [Amo
4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md), of the divine visitations that
had already fallen upon Israel; whilst the third and fourth visions set
clearly before the eye the irrevocable character of the judgments with
which careless and wanton sinners are threatened in ch. 3-6.

There is evidently no foundation for the assumption that the second part
contains "the true kernel of his work," namely, "the addresses which
Amos originally delivered at Bethel;" and that the first part, together
with the introduction (ch. 1-6) and the Messianic conclusion ([Amo
9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md), is purely a written
description, composed by Amos after his return from Bethel to Judah, to
give a further expansion to his original utterances (Ewald, Baur). This
by no means follows, either from the fact that the account of what the
prophet experienced at Bethel is inserted in the series of visions, as
it moves on step by step, and that the place in which it occurs (viz.,
ch. 7) is evidently its original position, or from the circumstance that
Amos commences his work with a saying of Joel (compare [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md) with [Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016).md), and evidently refers to Joel
([Joe 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018).md) even in the promise at the
close ([Amo 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013).md). For the position of
this account in ch. 7 proves nothing further than that Amos related
those visions in Bethel; and the allusion to Joel simply presupposes an
acquaintance with the predictions of this prophet. If there were no
previous addresses, the visions in ch. 7 and 8 would have nothing to
explain their occurrence, and would also be lacking in the requisite
clearness. Moreover, the work of Amos in Bethel cannot possibly be
limited to ch. 7-9. And lastly, the addresses in ch. 4-6 are throughout
so individual, so full of life, and so impressive, that they clearly
reflect the original oral delivery, even though it may be nothing more
than the essential substance of what was orally delivered, that has been
given here. Only [Amo 1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md) and 2
appears to have been really conceived in the form of a written
composition, and placed at the head of the book at the time when it was
first compiled, although certain thoughts that had been orally expressed
may lie at the foundation even there.

pp. 284-5.
