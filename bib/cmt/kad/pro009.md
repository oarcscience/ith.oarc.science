### [Proverbs Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 9:1</span></span>

The preceding discourse pronounces those happy who, having taken their
stand at the portal of Wisdom, wait for her appearance and her
invitation. There is thus a house of Wisdom as there is a house of God,
[Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md); and if now the discourse
is of a house of Wisdom, and of an invitation to a banquet therein (like
that in the parable, Matt 22, of the invitation to the marriage feast of
the king's son), it is not given without preparation:

1 Wisdom hath builded for herself an house,

Hewn out her seven pillars;

2 Hath slaughtered her beasts, mingled her wine;

Hath also spread her table;

3 Hath sent out her maidens; she waiteth

On the highest points of the city.

[Pro 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md)

Regarding חכמות, vid., at [Pro 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md).
It is a plur. excellentiae, which is a variety of the plur. extensivus.
Because it is the expression of a plural unity, it stands connected (as
for the most part also אלהים, Deus) with the sing. of the predicate. The
perfects enumerate all that Wisdom has done to prepare for her
invitation. If we had a parable before us, the perf. would have run into
the historical ותּשׁלח; but it is, as the תקרא shows, an allegorical
picture of the arrangement and carrying out of a present reality.
Instead of בּנתה לּהּ בּית there is בּנתה בּיתהּ, for the house is
already in its origin represented as hers, and 1b is to be translated:
she has hewn out her seven pillars (Hitzig); more correctly: her
pillars, viz., seven (after the scheme דבּתם רעה, [Gen
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#002).md); but the construction is closer.
שׁבעה is, altogether like [Exo 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037.md),
the accusative of the second object, or of the predicate after the
species of verba, with the idea: to make something, turn into something,
which take to themselves a double accusative, Gesen. 139, 2: excidit
columnas suas ita ut septem essent. Since the figure is allegorical, we
may not dispense with the interpretation of the number seven by the
remark, "No emphasis lies in the number" (Bertheau). First, we must
contemplate architecturally the house with seven pillars: "They are," as
Hitzig rightly remarks, "the pillars of the מסדּרון (porch) \[vid.
Bachmann under [Jdg 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#023.md), and Wetstein
under [Psa 144:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012.md), where חטב is used
of the cutting out and hewing of wood, as חצב of the cutting out and
hewing of stone\] in the inner court, which bore up the gallery of the
first (and second) floors: four of these in the corners and three in the
middle of three sides; through the midst of these the way led into the
court of the house-floor the area." But we cannot agree with Hitzig in
maintaining that, with the seven pillars of chap. 8 and 9, the author
looks back to the first seven chapters (Arab. âbwab, gates) of this
book; we think otherwise of the component members of this Introduction
to the Book of Proverbs; and to call the sections of a book "gates,
שׁערים," is a late Arabico-Jewish custom, of which there is found no
trace whatever in the O.T. To regard them also, with Heidenheim (cf.
Dante's Prose Writings, translated by Streckfuss, p. 77), as
representing the seven liberal arts (שׁבע חכמות) is impracticable; for
this division of the artes liberales into seven, consisting of the
Trivium (Grammar, Rhetoric, and Dialectics) and Quadrivium (Music,
Arithmetic, Geometry, and Astronomy), is not to be looked for within the
old Israelitish territory, and besides, these were the sciences of this
world which were so divided; but wisdom, to which the discourse here
refers, is wholly a religious-moral subject. The Midrash thinks of the
seven heavens (שׁבעה רקיעים), or the seven climates or parts of the
earth (שׁבעה ארצות), as represented by them; but both references require
artificial combinations, and have, as also the reference to the seven
church-eras (Vitringa and Chr. Ben. Michaelis), this against them, that
they are rendered probable neither from these introductory proverbial
discourses, nor generally from the O.T. writings. The patristic and
middle-age reference to the seven sacraments of the church passes
sentence against itself; but the old interpretation is on the right
path, when it suggests that the seven pillars are the seven gifts of the
Holy Ghost. The seven-foldness of the manifestation of the Spirit,
already brought near by the seven lamps of the sacred candelabra (the
מנורה), is established by [Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md)
(vid., l.c.); and that Wisdom is the possessor and dispenser of the
Spirit she herself testifies, [Pro
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023.md). Her Spirit is the "Spirit of
wisdom;" but at the same time, since, born of God, she is mediatrix
between God and the world, also the "Spirit of Jahve," He is the "spirit
of understanding," the "spirit of counsel," and the "spirit of might"
([Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md); for she says, [Pro
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#014.md), "Counsel is mine, and
reflection; I am understanding, I have strength." He is also the "spirit
of knowledge," and the "spirit of the fear of the Lord" ([Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md); for fear and the knowledge of
Jahve are, according to [Pro 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#014.md), the
beginning of wisdom, and essentially wisdom itself.

[Pro 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md)

If thus the house of Wisdom is the place of her fellowship with those
who honour her, the system of arrangements made by her, so as to
disclose and communicate to her disciples the fulness of her strength
and her gifts, then it is appropriate to understand by the seven pillars
the seven virtues of her nature communicating themselves
(apocalyptically expressed, the ἑπτὰ πνεύματα), which bear up and adorn
the dwelling which she establishes among men. Flesh and wine are figures
of the nourishment for the mind and the heart which is found with
wisdom, and, without asking what the flesh and the wine specially mean,
are figures of the manifold enjoyment which makes at once strong and
happy. The segolate n. verbale טבח, which [Pro
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#022.md) denoted the slaughtering or the
being slaughtered, signifies here, in the concrete sense, the
slaughtered ox; Michaelis rightly remarks that טבח, in contradistinction
to זבח, is the usual word for mactatio extrasacrificialis. Regarding מסך
יין, vid., under [Isa 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md); it is not
meant of the mingling of wine with sweet scents and spices, but with
water (warm or cold), and signifies simply to make the wine palatable
(as κεραννύναι, temperare); the lxx ἐκέρασεν εἰς κρατῆρα, κρατήρ is the
name of the vessel in which the mixing takes place; they drank not
ἄκρατον, but κεκερασμένον ἄκρατον, [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md). The frequently occurring phrase
ערך שׁלחן signifies to prepare the table (from שׁלּח, properly the
unrolled and outspread leather cover), viz., by the placing out of the
dishes (vid., regarding ערך, under [Gen
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009).md).

[Pro 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#003.md)

The verb קרא, when a feast is spoken of, means to invite; קראים, [Pro
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018.md) (cf. [Sa1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013), etc..md), are the guests. נערותיה
the lxx translates τοὺς ἑαυτῆς δούλους, but certainly here the disciples
are meant who already are in the service of Wisdom; but that those who
are invited to Wisdom are thought of as feminine, arises from the
tasteful execution of the picture. The invitation goes forth to be known
to all far and wide, so that in her servants Wisdom takes her stand in
the high places of the city. Instead of בּראשׁ, [Pro
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002.md); [Pro
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#021.md), there is used here the
expression על־גּפּי. We must distinguish the Semitic גּף (= ganf),
wings, from גנף = כנף, to cover, and גּף (= gaff or ganf), the bark,
which is derived either from גּפף or גּנף, Arab. jnf, convexus, incurvus
et extrinsecus gibber fuit, hence originally any surface bent outwards
or become crooked (cf. the roots cap, caf, קב כף גף גב, etc.), here the
summit of a height (Fl.); thus not super alis (after the analogy of
πτερύγιον, after Suidas = ἀκρωτήριον), but super dorsis (as in Lat. we
say δορσυμ μοντις, and also viae).

[Proverbs 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 9:4</span></span>

Now follows the street-sermon of Wisdom inviting to her banquet:

4 Who is simple? let him come hither!"

Whoso wanteth understanding, to him she saith:

5 "Come, eat of my bread,

And drink of the wine which I have mingled!

6 Cease, ye simple, and live,

And walk straight on in the way of understanding."

The question מי פּתי (thus with Munach, not with Makkeph, it is to be
written here and at [Pro 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016.md); vid.,
Baer's Torath Emeth, p. 40), quis est imperitus, is, as [Psa
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012.md), only a more animated expression
for quisquis est. The retiring into the background of the נערות
(servants), and the immediate appearance of Wisdom herself, together
with the interruption, as was to be expected, of her connected
discourses by the אמרה לּו, are signs that the pure execution of the
allegorical representation is her at an end. Hitzig seeks, by the
rejection of [Pro 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md), [Pro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md), [Pro
9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md), to bring in a logical
sequence; but these interpolations which he cuts out are yet far more
inconceivable than the proverbial discourses in the mouth of Wisdom,
abandoning the figure of a banquet, which besides are wholly in the
spirit of the author of this book. That Folly invites to her, [Pro
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016.md), in the same words as are used by
Wisdom, [Pro 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md), is not strange; both
address themselves to the simple (vid., on פּתי at [Pro
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004).md) and those devoid of understanding
(as the youth, [Pro 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#007).md), and seek to
bring to their side those who are accessible to evil as to good, and do
not dully distinguish between them, which the emulating devertat huc of
both imports. The fourth verse points partly backwards, and partly
forwards; 4a has its introduction in the תקרא of [Pro
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#003.md); on the contrary, 4b is itself the
introduction of what follows. The setting forth of the nom. absolutus
חסר־לב is conditioned by the form of 4a; the מי (cf. 4a) is continued
(in 4b) without its needing to be supplied: excors (= si quis est
excors) dicit ei (not dixit, because syntactically subordinating itself
to the תקרא). It is a nominal clause, whose virtual predicate (the
devoid of understanding is thus and thus addressed by her) as in [Pro
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016.md).

[Pro 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md)

The plur. of the address shows that the simple (inexperienced) and the
devoid of understanding are regarded as essentially one and the same
class of men. The בּ after לחם and שׁתה proceeds neither from the idea
of eating into (hewing into) anything, nor from the eating with
anything, i.e., inasmuch as one makes use of it, nor of pampering
oneself with anything (as ראה ב); Michaelis at last makes a right
decision (cf. [Lev 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#011.md); [Jdg
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016.md); [Job
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#025.md), and particularly לחם בּ, [Psa
141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004).md): communicationem et
participationem in re fruenda denotat; the lxx φάγετε τῶν ἐμῶν ἄρτων.
The attributive מסכתּי stands with backward reference briefly for
מסכתּיו. That Wisdom, [Pro 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md), offers
flesh and wine, but here presents bread and wine, is no contradiction,
which would lead us, with Hitzig, critically to reject [Pro
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md) and [Pro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md) as spurious; לחם is the most
common, all-comprehensive name for nourishment. Bertheau suitably
compares Jahve's invitation, [Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md), and that of Jesus, [Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md).

[Pro 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#006.md)

That פתאים is a plur. with abstract signification (according to which
the four Greek and the two Aramaean translations render it; the Graec.
Venet., however, renders τοὺς νηπίους) is improbable; the author forms
the abstr. [Pro 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#013.md) otherwise, and
the expression here would be doubtful. For פתאים is here to be rendered
as the object-accus.: leave the simple, i.e., forsake this class of men
(Ahron b. Joseph; Umbreit, Zckler); or also, which we prefer (since it
is always a singular thought that the "simple" should leave the
"simple"), as the vocative, and so that עזבוּ means not absolutely
"leave off" (Hitzig), but so that the object to be thought of is to be
taken from פתאים: give up, leave off, viz., the simple (Immanuel and
others; on the contrary, Rashi, Meri, and others, as Ewald, Bertheau,
decide in favour of פתאים as n. abstr.). Regarding וחיוּ, for et
vivetis, vid., [Pro 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#004.md). The lxx,
paraphrasing: ἵνα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα βασιλεύσητε. אשׁר is related to אשׁוּר
(אשׁוּר) is דּרך to דּרך; the Piel, not in its intrans. (vid., [Pro
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#014).md) but in its trans. sense ([Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017.md); [Isa
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012), etc..md), shows that the idea of
going straight out and forwards connects itself therewith. The
peculiarity of the פתי is just the absence of character.

[Proverbs 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 9:7</span></span>

In what now follows the discourse of Wisdom is continued; wherefore she
directs her invitation to the simple, i.e., those who have not yet
decided, and are perhaps susceptible of that which is better:

7 "He who correcteth a scorner draweth upon himself insult;

And he who communicateth instruction to a scorner, it is a dishonour to
him.

8 Instruct not a scorner, lest he hate thee;

Give instruction to the wise, so he will love thee.

9 Give to the wise, and he becomes yet wiser;

Give knowledge to the upright, and he gains in knowledge."

Zckler thinks that herewith the reason for the summons to the "simple"
to forsake the fellowship of men of their own sort, is assigned (he
explains 6a as Ahron b. Joseph: הפרדו מן הפתאים); but his remark, that,
under the term "simple," mockers and wicked persons are comprehended as
belonging to the same category, confounds two sharply distinguished
classes of men. לץ is the freethinker who mocks at religion and virtue
(vid., [Pro 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022).md), and רשׁע the
godless who shuns restraint by God and gives himself up to the unbridled
impulse to evil. The course of thought in [Pro
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md) and onwards shows why Wisdom,
turning from the wise, who already are hers, directs herself only to the
simple, and those who are devoid of understanding: she must pass over
the לץ and רשׁע dna , because she can there hope for no receptivity for
her invitation; she would, contrary to [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md), "give that which is holy to the
dogs, and cast her pearls before swine." יסר, παιδεύειν (with the
prevailing idea of the bitter lesson of reproof and punishment), and
הוכיח, ἐλέγχειν, are interchangeable conceptions, [Psa
94:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#010.md); the ל is here exponent of the
object (to bring an accusation against any one), as [Pro
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008.md), [Pro
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#012.md) (otherwise as [Isa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md); [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md), where it is the dat. commodi: to
bring unrighteousness to light, in favour of the injured). יסר לץ is
pointed with Mahpach of the penultima, and thus with the tone thrown
back. The Pasek, placed in some editions between the two words, is
masoretically inaccurate. He who reads the moral to the mocker brings
disgrace to himself; the incorrigible replies to the goodwill with
insult. Similar to the לקח לו here, is מרים tollit = reportat, [Pro
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025.md); [Pro
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027.md). In 7b מוּמו is by no means the
object governed by וּמוכיח: and he who shows to the godless his fault
(Meri, Arama, Lwenstein: מומו = על־מומו, and thus also the Graec. Venet.
μῶμον ἑαυτῷ, scil. λαμβάνει); plainly מומו is parallel with קלון. But
מומו does not also subordinate itself to לקח as to the object. parallel
קלון: maculam sibimet scil. acquirit; for, to be so understood, the
author ought at least to have written לו מוּם. Much rather מומו is here,
as at [Deu 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md), appos., thus pred.
(Hitzig), without needing anything to be supplied: his blot it is, viz.,
this proceeding, which is equivalent to מוּמא הוּא ליהּ (Targ.),
opprobrio ipsi est. Zckler not incorrectly compares [Psa
115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007.md) and [Ecc
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016.md), but the expression (macula ejus
= ipsi) lies here less remote from our form of expression. In other
words: Whoever correcteth the mockers has only to expect hatred (אל־תוכח
with the tone thrown back, according to rule; cf. on the contrary, [Jdg
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#025).md), but on the other hand, love
from the wise.

[Pro 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008.md)

The ו in ויאהבך is that of consequence (apodosis imperativi): so he will
love thee (as also Ewald now translates), not: that he may love thee
(Syr., Targ.), for the author speaks here only of the consequence, not
of something else, as an object kept in view. The exhortation influences
the mocker less than nothing, so much the more it bears fruit with the
wise. Thus the proverb is confirmed habenti dabitur, [Mat
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012.md); [Mat
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029.md).

[Pro 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#009.md)

If anything is to be supplied to תּן, it is לקח ([Pro
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#002).md); but תן, tradere, παραδιδόναι, is
of itself correlat. of לקח, accipere (post-bibl. קבּל), παραλαμβάνειν,
e.g., [Gal 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#009.md). הודיע ל = to
communicate knowledge, דעת, follows the analogy of הוכיח ל, to impart
instruction, תוכחת. Regarding the jussive form ויוסף in the apod.
imper., vid., Gesen. 128, 2. Observe in this verse the interchange of
חכם and צדיק! Wisdom is not merely an intellectual power, it is a moral
quality; in this is founded her receptivity of instruction, her
embracing of every opportunity for self-improvement. She is humble; for,
without self-will and self-sufficiency, she makes God's will her highest
and absolutely binding rule ([Pro
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007).md).

[Proverbs 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 9:10</span></span>

These words naturally follow:

10 "The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Jahve,

And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."

This is the highest principle of the Chokma, which stands ([Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007).md) as a motto at the beginning of
the Book of Proverbs. The lxx translate ראשׁית there ([Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007).md), and תּחלּת here, by ἀρχή. Gusset
distinguishes the two synonyms as pars optima and primus actus; but the
former denotes the fear of God as that which stands in the uppermost
place, to which all that Wisdom accomplishes subordinates itself; the
latter as that which begins wisdom, that which it proposes to itself in
its course. With יהוה is interchanged, [Pro
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005.md), אלהים, as here קדושׁים, as the
internally multiplicative plur. (Dietrich, Abhandlungen, pp. 12, 45), as
[Pro 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#003.md), [Jos
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#009.md); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md), of God, the "Holy, holy, holy"
([Isa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003).md), i.e., Him who is
absolutely Holy. Michaelis inaccurately, following the ancients, who
understood not this non-numerical plur.: cognitio quae sanctos facit et
sanctis propria est. The דּעת, parallel with יראת, is meant of lively
practical operative knowledge, which subordinates itself to this
All-holy God as the normative but unapproachable pattern.

[Proverbs 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 9:11</span></span>

The singular reason for this proverb of Wisdom is now given:

"For by me will thy days become many,

And the years of thy life will be increased."

Incorrectly Hitzig: "and years of life will increase to thee;" הוסיף is
always and everywhere (e.g., also [Job
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011).md) transitive. In the similar
passage, [Pro 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002.md), יוסיפו had as its
subject the doctrine of Wisdom; here חכמה and בינה it is not practicable
to interpret as subj., since 11a Wisdom is the subject discoursing - the
expression follows the scheme, dicunt eos = dicuntur, as e.g., [Job
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003.md); Gesen. 137 - a concealing of the
operative cause, which lies near, where, as [Pro
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#022.md), the discourse is of severe
judgment, thus: they (viz., the heavenly Powers) will grant to thee
years of life (חיּים in a pregnant sense, as [Pro
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002).md) in rich measure, so that
constantly one span comes after another. But in what connection of
consequence does this stand with the contents of the proverb, [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md)? The ancients say that the clause
with כי refers back to [Pro 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md). The
[Pro 9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007) (according also to Fl..md)
are, as it were, parenthetic. Hitzig rejects these verses as an
interpolation, but the connection of [Pro
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#011.md) with 5f. retains also something
that is unsuitable: "steps forward on the way of knowledge, for by me
shall thy days become many;" and if, as Hitzig supposes, [Pro
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012.md) is undoubtedly genuine, whose
connection with [Pro 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#011.md) is in no way
obvious, then also will the difficulty of the connection of [Pro
9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md) with the preceding and the
succeeding be no decisive mark of the want of genuineness of this course
of thought. We have seen how the progress of [Pro
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#006.md) to 7 is mediated: the invitation
of Wisdom goes forth to the receptive, with the exclusion of the
irrecoverable. And [Pro 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#011.md) is
related to [Pro 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md), as the proof of
the cause from the effect. It is the fear of God with which Wisdom
begins, the knowledge of God in which above all it consists, for by it
is fulfilled the promise of life which is given to the fear of God, [Pro
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#027.md); [Pro
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#027.md); [Pro
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#023.md), cf. [Deu
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040.md), and to humility, which is bound
up with it. [Pro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017.md).

[Proverbs 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 9:12</span></span>

This wisdom, resting on the fear of God, is itself a blessing to the
wise:

"If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself;

And if thou mockest, thou alone shalt bear it."

The lxx, with the Syr., mangle the thought of 12a, for they translate:
if thou art wise for thyself, so also thou wilt be wise for thy
neighbour. The dat. commodi לך means that it is for the personal
advantage of the wise to be wise. The contrast expressed by [Job
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002.md).: not profitable to God, but to
thyself (Hitzig), is scarcely intended, although, so far as the
accentuation is antithetic, it is the nearest. The perf. ולצתּ is the
hypothetical; Gesen. 126, 1. To bear anything, viz., anything sinful
(חטא or עון), is equivalent to, to atone for it, [Job
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#002.md), cf. [Num
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#013.md); [Eze
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#035.md). Also 12b is a contrast scarcely
aimed at. Wisdom is its own profit to man; libertinism is its own
disgrace. Man decides, whenever he prefers to be wise, or to be a mocker
of religion and of virtue, regarding his own weal and woe. With this
nota bene the discourse of Wisdom closes.

[Proverbs 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 9:13</span></span>

The poet now brings before us another figure, for he personifies Folly
working in opposition to Wisdom, and gives her a feminine name, as the
contrast to Wisdom required, and thereby to indicate that the seduction,
as the 13th proverbial discourse (chap. 7) has shown, appears especially
in the form of degraded womanhood:

13 The woman Folly \[Frau Thorheit\] conducts herself boisterously,

Wantonness, and not knowing anything at all;

14 And hath seated herself at the door of her house,

On a seat high up in the city,

15 To call to those who walk in the way,

Who go straight on their path.

The connection of אשת כּסילוּת is genitival, and the genitive is not, as
in אשׁת רע, [Pro 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024.md), specifying, but
appositional, as in בת־ציון (vid., under [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md). הומיּה \[boisterous\] is pred.,
as [Pro 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#011.md) : her object is sensual,
and therefore her appearance excites passionately, overcoming the
resistance of the mind by boisterousness. In 13b it is further said who
and how she is. פּתיּוּת she is called as wantonness personified. This
abstract פּתיּוּת, derived from פּתי, must be vocalized as אכזריּוּת;
Hitzig thinks it is written with a on account of the following u sound,
but this formation always ends in ijjûth, not ajjûth. But as from חזה as
well חזּיון = חזיון as חזון is formed, so from פּתה as well פּתוּת like
חזוּת or פּתוּת like לזוּת, רעוּת, as פּתיוּת (instead of which פּתיּוּת
is preferred) can be formed; Kimchi rightly (Michlol 181a) presents the
word under the form פּעלוּת. With וּבל ([Pro
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#007).md) poetic, and stronger than לאו,
the designation of the subject is continued; the words וּבל־ידעה מּה
(thus with Mercha and without Makkeph following, ידעה is to be written,
after Codd. and old editions) have the value of an adjective: and not
knowing anything at all (מה = τὶ, as [Num
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003.md); [Job
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#013.md), and here in the negative
clause, as in prose מאוּמה), i.e., devoid of all knowledge. The Targ.
translates explanatorily: not recognising טבתּא, the good; and the lxx
substitutes: she knows not shame, which, according to Hitzig, supposes
the word כּלמּה, approved of by him; but כלמה means always pudefactio,
not pudor. To know no כלמה would be equivalent to, to let no shaming
from without influence one; for shamelessness the poet would have made
use of the expression ובל־ידעה בּשׁת. In וישׁבה the declaration
regarding the subject beginning with הומיה is continued: Folly also has
a house in which works of folly are carried one, and has set herself
down by the door (לפּתח as לפי, [Pro
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#003).md) of this house; she sits there
על־כּסּא. Most interpreters here think on a throne (lxx ἐπὶ δίφρου, used
especially of the sella curulis); and Zckler, as Umbreit, Hitzig, and
others, connecting genitiv. therewith מרמי קרת, changes in 14b the
scene, for he removes the "high throne of the city" from the door of the
house to some place elsewhere. But the sitting is in contrast to the
standing and going on the part of Wisdom on the streets preaching
(Evagrius well renders: in molli ignavaque sella); and if כסא and
house-door are named along with each other, the former is a seat before
the latter, and the accentuation rightly separates by Mugrash כסא from
מרמי קרת. "According to the accents and the meaning, מרמי קרת is the
acc. loci: on the high places of the city, as [Pro
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002)." (Fl..md). They are the high points
of the city, to which, as Wisdom, [Pro
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#003.md), [Pro
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002.md), so also Folly, her rival
(wherefore [Ecc 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#006.md) does not
appertain to this place), invites followers to herself. She sits before
her door to call לעברי דרך (with Munach, as in Cod. 1294 and old
editions, without the Makkeph), those who go along the way (genitive
connection with the supposition of the accusative construction, transire
viam, as [Pro 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007)), to call (invite.md)
המישּׁרים (to be pointed with מ raphatum and Gaja going before,
according to Ben-Asher's rule; vid., Methegsetz. 20), those who make
straight their path, i.e., who go straight on, directly before them (cf.
[Isa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002).md). The participial
construction (the schemes amans Dei and amans Deum), as well as that of
the verb קרא (first with the dat. and then with the accus.),
interchange.

[Proverbs 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 9:16</span></span>

The woman, who in her own person serves as a sign to her house,
addresses those who pass by in their innocence (לתמּם, [Sa2
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#011).md):

16 "Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither!"

And if any one is devoid of understanding, she saith to him:

17 "Stolen waters taste sweet,

And the bread of secrecy is pleasant."

פּתי (folly, simplicity) has a side accessible to good and its contrary:
Wisdom is connected with the one side, and Folly with the other. And as
the חסר־לב offers a vacuum to Wisdom which may perhaps be filled with
the right contents, so is this vacuum welcome to Folly, because it meets
there no resistance. In this sense, [Pro
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016.md) is like [Pro
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md) (excepting the addition of a
connecting and of a concluding ו: et si quis excors, tum dicit ei); the
word is the same in both, but the meaning, according to the two
speakers, is different. That to which they both invite is the pleasure
of her fellowship, under the symbol of eating and drinking; in the one
case it is intellectual and spiritual enjoyment, in the other sensual.
That Wisdom offers ([Pro 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005).md) bread
and wine, and Folly water and bread, has its reason in this, that the
particular pleasure to which the latter invites is of a sensual kind;
for to drink water out of his own or out of another fountain is ([Pro
3:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015).md) the symbol of intercourse in
married life, or of intercourse between the unmarried, particularly of
adulterous intercourse. מים גּנוּבים (correct texts have it thus,
without the Makkeph) is sexual intercourse which is stolen from him who
has a right thereto, thus carnal intercourse with אושׁת אישׁ; and לחם
סתרים fleshly lust, which, because it is contrary to the law, must seek
(cf. furtum, secret love intrigue) concealment (סתרים, extensive plur.,
as מעמקּים; Bttcher, 694). Just such pleasure, after which one wipes his
mouth as if he had done nothing ([Pro
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#020).md), is for men who are without
wisdom sweet (מתק, [Job 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#012).md) and
pleasant; the prohibition of it gives to such pleasure attraction, and
the secrecy adds seasoning; and just such enjoyments the כסילות,
personified carnality, offers. But woe to him who, befooled, enters her
house!

[Proverbs 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 9:18</span></span>

He goes within:

18 And he knows not that the dead are there;

In the depths of Hades, her guests.

How near to one another the house of the adulteress and Hades are, so
that a man passes through the one into the other, is already stated in
[Pro 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md); [Pro
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027.md). Here, in the concluding words of
the introduction to the Book of Proverbs, addressed to youth, and for
the most part containing warning against sinful pleasure, these two
further declarations are advanced: the company assembled in the house of
lewdness consists of רפאים, i.e., (cf. p. 83) the old, worn-out, who are
only in appearance living, who have gone down to the seeming life of the
shadowy existence of the kingdom of the dead; her (כסילות) invited ones
(cf. [Pro 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#026), her slaughtered ones.md)
are in the depths of Hades (not in the valleys, as Umbreit, Lwenstein,
and Ewald translate, but in the depths, Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion,
ἐπὶ τοῖς βαθέσι; for עמקי is not only plur. to עמק, but also per
metaplasmum to עמק, [Pro 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003.md), as אמרי
to אמר), thus in שׁאול תּחתּית ([Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022).md); they have forsaken the
fellowship of the life and of the love of God, and have sunk into the
deepest destruction. The house of infamy into which Folly allures does
not only lead to hell, it is hell itself; and they who permit themselves
to be thus befooled are like wandering corpses, and already on this side
of death are in the realm of wrath and of the curse.

(Note: The lxx has considerable additions introduced after [Pro
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018.md), as also after [Pro
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012.md), of which we shall elsewhere
speak.)
