Haman's Elevation and His Design against the Jews - [Est
3:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001.md)

King Ahashverosh promoted Haman the Agagite above all the princes about
him, and commanded all his servants to fall down before him. This mark
of reverence was refused by Mordochai the Jew from religious scruples.
When intelligence of this was brought to Haman, he sought to obtain the
extermination of the Jews throughout the kingdom ([Est
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001).md). The twelfth month was
appointed by the casting of lots for this purpose; and Haman, by
exciting the suspicion of the king against the Jews as an exclusive and
law-opposing people, obtained from him an edict to this effect ([Est
3:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007).md), and sent it, by letters
sealed with the king's seal, by the hand of messengers into all the
provinces of the kingdom in the first month, that they might be ready to
carry it into execution in the twelfth month; whereat the city of Susa
was much perplexed ([Est 3:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012).md).

[Esther 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 3:1</span></span>

The elevation of Haman above all the princes of the kingdom is said in a
general manner to have taken place "after these things," i.e., after the
matters related in Est 2. גּדּל, to make great, to make any one a great
man; נשּׂא, elevated, is more precisely defined by the sentence
following: he set his seat above all the princes that were with him,
i.e., above the seat of all the princes about the king; in fact,
advanced him to the highest post, made him his grand vizier. Haman is
called the son of Hammedatha האגגי, the Agagite, or of the Agagites.
אגגי recalls אגג kings of the Amalekites, conquered and taken prisoner
by Saul, and hewn in pieces by Samuel, [Sa1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#008.md), [Sa1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033.md). Hence Jewish and Christian
expositors regard Haman as a descendant of the Amalekite king. This is
certainly possible, though it can by no means be proved. The name Agag
is not sufficient for the purpose, as many individuals might at
different times have borne the name אגג, i.e., the fiery. In 1 Sam 15,
too, Agag is not the nomen propr. of the conquered king, but a general
nomen dignitatis of the kings of Amalek, as Pharaoh and Abimelech were
of the kings of Egypt and Gerar. See on [Num
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007.md). We know nothing of Haman and his
father beyond what is said in this book, and all attempts to explain the
names are uncertain and beside the mark.

[Est 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#002.md)

All the king's servants that were in the gate of the king, i.e., all the
court officials, were to kneel before Haman and bow themselves to the
earth. So had the king commanded concerning him. This mark of reverence
was refused by Mordochai.

[Est 3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#003.md)

When the other officials of the court asked him from day to day, why he
transgressed the king's commandment, and he hearkened not unto them,
i.e., gave no heed to their words, they told it to Haman, "to see
whether Mordochai's words would stand; for he had told them that he was
a Jew." It is obvious from this, that Mordochai had declared to those
who asked him the reason why he did not fall down before Haman, that he
could not do so because he was a Jew, - that as a Jew he could not show
that honour to man which was due to God alone. Now the custom of falling
down to the earth before an exalted personage, and especially before a
king, was customary among Israelites; comp. [Sa2
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#004.md); [Sa2
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#028.md); [Kg1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#016.md). If, then, Mordochai refused to
pay this honour to Haman, the reason of such refusal must be sought in
the notions which the Persians were wont to combine with the action,
i.e., in the circumstance that they regarded it as an act of homage
performed to a king as a divine being, an incarnation of Oromasdes. This
is testified by classical writers; comp. Plutarch, Themist. 27; Curtius,
viii. 5. 5f., where the latter informs us that Alexander the Great
imitated this custom on his march to India, and remarks, 11: Persas
quidem non pie solum, sed etiam prudenter reges suos inter Deos colere;
majestatem enim imperii salutis esse tutelam. Hence also the Spartans
refused, as Herod. 7.136 relates, to fall down before King Xerxes,
because it was not the custom of Greeks to honour mortals after this
fashion. This homage, then, which was regarded as an act of reverence
and worship to a god, was by the command of the king to be paid to
Haman, as his representative, by the office-bearers of his court; and
this Mordochai could not do without a denial of his religious faith.

[Est 3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#005.md)

When, then, Haman, whose attention had been called to the fact, saw,
when next he went in unto the king, that Mordochai did not fall down
before him, he was full of wrath, and ([Est
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#006).md) thought scorn, i.e., in his pride
esteemed it too contemptible, to lay hands on Mordochai alone, i.e., to
execute him alone, for this opposition to the royal commands; for they
had showed him the people of Mordochai, i.e., had told him that as a Jew
Mordochai had refused this act of worship, and that the whole Jewish
nation thought and acted accordingly. Therefore he sought to destroy all
the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahashverosh, the
people of Mordochai. The subject Haman is repeated before ויבקּשׁ for
the sake of clearness, because it was not expressly named with ויּבן.
מרדּכי עם is in apposition to כּל־היּהוּדים: all the Jews as the people
of Mordochai, because they were the people of Mordochai and shared his
sentiments.

[Esther 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 3:7</span></span>

To ensure the success of this great undertaking, viz., the extermination
of all the Jews in the kingdom, Haman had recourse to the lot, that he
might thus fix on a propitious day for the execution of his project.
Astrology plays an important part among all ancient nations, nothing of
any magnitude being undertaken without first consulting its professors
concerning a favourable time and opportunity; comp. rem. on [Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md).

[Est 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007.md)

"In the first month, i.e., Nisan, in the twelfth year of King
Ahashverosh, they cast Pur, i.e., the lot, before Haman from day to day,
and from month to the twelfth month, i.e., the month Adar." The subject
of הפּיל is left indefinite, because it is self-evident that this was
done by some astrologer or magician who was versed in such matters.
Bertheau tries unnaturally to make Haman the subject, and to combine the
subsequent המן לפני with הגּורל: "Haman cast Pur, i.e., the lot, before
Haman," which makes Pur signify: the lot before Haman. המן לפני means in
the presence of Haman, so that he also might see how the lot fell. פּוּר
is an Old-Persian word meaning lot (sors); in modern Persian, bâra
signifies time, case (fois, cas), pâra or pâre, piece (morceau, pice),
and behr, behre, and behre, lot, share, fate; comp. Zenker, Turco-Arabic
and Persian Lexicon, pp. 162 and 229. The words "from day to day, from
month to the twelfth month," must not be understood to say, that lots
were cast day by day and month by month till the twelfth; but that in
the first month lots were at once cast, one after the other, for all the
days and months of the year, that a favourable day might be obtained. We
do not know the manner in which this was done, "the way of casting lots
being unknown to us." The words: from month to the twelfth month, are
remarkable; we should expect from month to month till the twelfth month.
Bertheau supposes that the words לחדשׁ ויּ פּל הגּורל על יום שׁלשׁה עשׂר
were omitted after וּמחדשׁ through the eye of the transcriber passing on
from the first לחדשׁ to the second. The text of the lxx actually
contains such words, and the possibility of such an oversight on the
part of a transcriber must certainly be admitted. In the book of Esther,
however, the lxx translation is no critical authority, and it is just as
possible that the author of the Hebrew book here expresses himself
briefly and indefinitively, because he was now only concerned to state
the month determined by lot for the undertaking, and intended to mention
the day subsequently.

[Est 3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#008.md)

Haman having by means of the lot fixed upon a favourable day for the
execution of the massacre, betook himself to the king to obtain a royal
decree for the purpose. He represented to the monarch: "There is a
people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the
provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws are different from all other
people (i.e., from the laws of all other people), and they keep not the
laws of the king, and it is not fitting for the king to leave them
alone. [Est 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#009.md). If it seem good to
the king, let it be written (i.e., let a written decree be published) to
destroy them; and I will weigh ten thousand talents of silver to those
who do the business, that they may bring them into the treasuries of the
king." This proposal was very subtilly calculated. First Haman casts
suspicion on the Jews as a nation scattered abroad and dwelling apart,
and therefore unsociable, - as refractory, and therefore dangerous to
the state; then he promises the king that their extermination will bring
into the royal treasury a very considerable sum of money, viz., the
property of the slaughtered. Ten thousand talents of silver, reckoned
according to the Mosaic shekel, are 3,750,000, according to the civil
shekel 1,875,000; see rem. on [Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014.md). המּלאכה עשׁי, those who execute
a work, builders in [Kg2 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#012.md), are
here and [Est 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#003.md) the king's men of
business, who carry on the king's business with respect to receipts and
disbursements, the royal financiers.

[Est 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#010.md)

The king agreed to this proposal. He drew his signet ring from his hand,
and delivered it to Haman, that he might prepare the edict in the king's
name, and give it by the impression of the royal seal the authority of
an irrevocable decree; see rem. on [Est
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008.md). "To the enemy of the Jews" is
added emphatically.

[Est 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#011.md)

Lest it should appear as though the king had been induced by the
prospect held out of obtaining a sum of money, he awards this to Haman.
"The silver be given to thee, and the people to do to them (let it be
done to them) as seemeth good to thee." והעם precedes absolutely: as for
the people of the Jews, etc.

[Esther 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 3:12</span></span>

Haman, without delay, causes the necessary writings to be prepared, and
sent into all the provinces of the kingdom. [Est
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012.md). "Then were called the king's
scribes in the first month, on the thirteenth day of it (בּו, in it, in
the said month); and there was written according to all that Haman
commanded, to the satraps of the king, and to the governors who (were
placed) over every province, and to the rulers of every people, to each
several province according to its writing, and to each different people
according to their language (comp. rem. on [Est
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#022).md); in the name of King Ahashverosh
was it written, and sealed with the king's seal." אחשׁדּרפּנים and פּחות
placed in juxtaposition, as in [Ezr
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#036.md), are the imperial officials.
Beside these are also named the שׂרים of every people, the native
princes of the different races. The writing was finished on the
thirteenth day of the month, because this day of the month had been
fixed upon as propitious by the lot.

[Est 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013.md)

And the letters were sent (נשׁלוח, infin. abs. Niph. instead of the
verb. fin.) by posts. הרצים are the post-riders, the aggaroi, who were
stationed on the high roads of the realm, generally four parasangs
apart, to transmit with the more speed the royal letters and messages.
Herod. 5.14, 8.98 (Berth.), comp. Brisson, de reg. Pers. princ. i. c.
238f. וגו להשׁמיד, to destroy, to kill, and cause to perish all Jews
from the youth to the old man, children and women, in one day, on the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and to deprive them of their spoil.
The three verbs are combined to give strength to the expression. שׁללם
is their property, which is called spoil because it was delivered up to
plunder. Haman having held out the prospect of a large sum as the result
of exterminating the Jews, and the king having bestowed this upon Haman,
the plundering of the Jews, thus permitted to all the inhabitants of the
kingdom who should assist in exterminating them, must be understood as
implying, that they would have to deliver a portion of the booty thus
obtained to Haman.

[Est 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#014.md)

The copy of the writing, that the law might be given in every province,
was opened to all people, that they might be ready by this day. This
verse does not announce a copy of the royal decree that had been
prepared and sent by the posts, which would in that case be replaced by
a mere allusion to its contents (Bertheau). The words contain no trace
of an announcement such as we find in [Ezr
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#011.md); [Ezr
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#011.md), but the historical notice, that
the copy of the writing which was sent as a law into the provinces was
גּלוּי, opened, i.e., sent unclosed or unsealed to all people. גּלוּי is
the predicate to the subject וגו פּתשׁגן (comp. on this word the note to
[Ezr 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#014).md), and between the subject
and predicate is inserted the infinitive clause וגו דּת להנּתן for the
purpose of once more briefly mentioning the contents and destination of
the כּתב: that a law might be given in every province. To attain this
object the more certainly, the copy of the decree, which was brought
into every province by the posts, was open or unsealed, that all people
might read its contents, and keep themselves in readiness for the
execution of what was therein commanded on the appointed day. הזּה ליּום
is the thirteenth day of the twelfth month named in the letter.

[Est 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#015.md)

The posts went forth hastening (דּחף like [Ch2
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#020).md) at the king's commandment, and
the decree was given (promulgated) in the citadel of Susa, - an
explanatory clause; and the king and Haman sat down to drink while the
messengers went forth with the decree, but the city of Susa, in which it
was first published, was in perplexity (on נבוכה comp. [Exo
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#003.md); [Joe
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#018).md). The cruel measure could not but
fill all peace-loving citizens with horror and anxiety. - Here the
question is forced upon us, why the decree should have been so
prematurely published. The scribes were summoned to prepare it on the
thirteenth day of the first month. For this purpose, even though many
copies had to be made in different languages, no very long time would be
required in a well-appointed government office. As soon as the scribes
had finished their work, the decree was sent out by the posts into all
quarters of the realm, and would arrive in even the most distant
provinces in three weeks at furthest. This would place almost eleven,
and in the remotest parts about ten months between the publication and
execution of the decree. What then was the motive for such an interval?
Certainly so long a time could not be required for preparing to carry it
out, nor is this hinted at in the text, as Bertheau supposes. Nor could
it be intended that the Jews should suffer a long period of anxiety. On
the contrary, the motive seems to have been, as Clericus and others have
already conjectured, to cause many Jews to leave their property and
escape to other lands, for the sake of preserving their lives. Thus
Haman would attain his object. He would be relieved of the presence of
the Jews, and be able to enrich himself by the appropriation of their
possessions. On the other hand, the providence of God overruling the
event in the interest of the Jews, is unmistakeably evident both in
Haman's haste to satisfy his desire for vengeance, and in the falling of
the lot upon so distant a day. It was only because there was so long an
interval between the publication of the decree and the day appointed by
lot for its execution, that it was possible for the Jews to take means
for averting the destruction with which they were threatened, as the
further development of the history will show.
