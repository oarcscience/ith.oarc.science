[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 19:0</span></span>

David Reinstated in His Kingdom - 2 Samuel 19:1-39

In his passionate and sinful sorrow on account of Absalom's death David
not only forgot altogether what it was his duty to do, in order to
recover the affections of the people, so that Joab was obliged to remind
him of this duty which was binding upon him as king ([Sa2
19:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001).md); but he even allowed himself
to be carried away into the most inconsiderate measures ([Sa2
19:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009).md), and into acts of imprudence
and injustice ([Sa2 19:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016.md), [Sa2
19:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024).md), which could not contribute
to the strengthening of his throne, however much the affection with
which he wished to reward the old man Barzillai for his faithful
services ([Sa2 19:31-40](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031).md) might show
that the king was anxious to promote the welfare of his subjects.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 19:1</span></span>

[Sa2 19:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md)

David's mourning, and Joab's reproof. - [Sa2
19:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md). When Joab was told that the
king was mourning and weeping for Absalom, he went to him into the house
to expostulate with him. [Sa2 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#005.md)
introduces the continuation of [Sa2
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001.md); [Sa2
19:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#002.md) contain parenthetical
sentences, describing the impression made upon the people by the king's
mourning. Through the king's deep trouble, the salvation (the victory)
upon that day became mourning for all the people who had fought for
David, and they went by stealth in to the city (לבוא יתגּנּב: they stole
to come, came by stealth), "as people steal away who have covered
themselves with shame, when they flee in battle."

[Sa2 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#004.md)

But the king had covered his face, and cried aloud, "My son Absalom,"
etc.

[Sa2 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#005.md)

Then Joab went into the house to the king, and said to him, "Thou hast
shamed this day the faces of all thy servants who have saved thy life,
and the life of thy sons and daughters, thy wives and concubines"
(covered them with shame, by deceiving their hope that thou wouldest
rejoice in the victory).

[Sa2 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#006.md)

לאהבה, "to love" (i.e., in that thou lovest) "those who hate thee, and
hatest those who love thee; for thou hast given to know to-day (through
thy conduct) that chiefs and servants (commanders and soldiers) are
nothing (are worth nothing); for I have perceived to-day (or I perceive
to-day) that if (לא for לוּ) Absalom were alive, and we had all
perished, that it would be right in thine eyes."

[Sa2 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#007.md)

"And now rise up, go out and speak to the heart of thy servants (i.e.,
speak to them in a friendly manner: [Gen
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#003.md); [Gen
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#021), etc..md): for I swear by Jehovah,
if thou go not out, verily not a man will stay with thee to-night; and
this will be worse to thee than all the evil that has come upon thee
from thy youth until now." Joab was certainly not only justified, but
bound in David's own interests, to expostulate with him upon his
conduct, and to urge him to speak in a friendly manner to the people who
had exposed their lives for him, inasmuch as his present conduct would
necessarily stifle the affection of the people towards their king, and
might be followed by the most serious results with reference to his
throne. At the same time, he did this in so heartless and lordly a
manner, that the king could not fail to be deeply hurt by his words.

[Sa2 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#008.md)

Nevertheless David was obliged to yield to his representations. "The
king rose up, and sat in the gate, and ... all the people came before
the king," i.e., the troops marched before the king, who (as we may
supply from the context) manifested his good-will in both looks and
words. But Israel, i.e., that portion of the people which had followed
Absalom, had returned to its tents (i.e., gone home: cf. [Sa2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017).md). This sentence forms the
transition to the account which follows.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 19:9</span></span>

Preliminaries to the return of David to Jerusalem. - [Sa2
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009.md), [Sa2
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#010.md). As the rebellion was entirely
crushed by Absalom's death, and the dispersion of his followers to their
respective homes, there arose a movement among all the tribes in favour
of David. "All the people were disputing (נדון, casting reproaches at
one another) in all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king has saved us
out of the hand of our enemies, ... and now he is fled out of the land
before Absalom. But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in
battle; and now why do ye keep still, to bring back the king?" This
movement arose from the consciousness of having done an injustice to the
king, in rising up in support of Absalom.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 19:11</span></span>

When these words of all Israel were reported to David, he sent to the
priests Zadok and Abiathar, saying, "Speak to the elders of Judah, why
will ye be the last to bring back the king to his palace? ... Ye are my
brethren, my bones and flesh (i.e., my blood relations): why then,"
etc.? The last clause of [Sa2 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011.md),
"the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house," is a
circumstantial clause inserted in the midst of David's words, to explain
the appeal to the men of Judah not to be the last. In the lxx, and some
Codices of the Vulgate, this sentence occurs twice, viz., at the end of
[Sa2 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#010.md), and also of [Sa2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011.md); and Thenius, Ewald, and Bttcher
regard the clause at the end of [Sa2
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#010.md) as the original one, and the
repetition of it at the close of [Sa2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011.md) as a gloss. But this is
certainly a mistake: for if the clause, "and the speech of all Israel
came to the king to his house (at Mahanaim)," ought to stand at the
close of [Sa2 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#010.md), and assigns the
reason for David's sending to Zadok and Abiathar, [Sa2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011.md) would certainly, or rather
necessarily, commence with המּלך ויּשׁלח: "The word of all Israel came
to the king, and then king David sent," etc. But instead of this, it
commences with שׁלח דּיד והמּלך, "But king David sent." This
construction of the sentence decidedly favour the correctness of the
Hebrew text; whereas the text of the Septuagint, apart altogether from
the tautological repetition of the whole of the sentence in question,
shows obviously enough that it is nothing more than a conjecture, by
which the attempt was made to remove the difficulty occasioned by the
striking position in which the circumstantial clause occurred.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 19:13</span></span>

"And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and flesh? so shall God do to
me, and so add, if thou shalt not be prince of the army (chief captain)
before me continually in the place of Joab."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 19:14</span></span>

Thus he (David) inclined the heart of all the people as of one man, and
they sent to the king, saying, "Return thou, with all thy servants." The
result of David's message to the priests is given summarily here. The
subject to ויּט is David, not Amasa or Zadok. So far as the fact itself
is concerned, it was certainly wise of David to send to the members of
his own tribe, and appeal to them not to be behind the rest of the
tribes in taking part in his restoration to the kingdom, lest it should
appear as though the tribe of Judah, to which David himself belonged,
was dissatisfied with his victory, since it was in that tribe that the
rebellion itself first broke out; and this would inevitably feed the
jealousy between Judah and the rest of the tribes. But it was not only
unwise, but unjust, to give to Amasa, the traitor-general of the rebels,
a promise on oath that he should be commander-in-chief in the place of
Joab; for even if the promise was only given privately at first, the
fact that it had been given could not remain a secret from Joab very
long, and would be sure to stir up his ambition, and lead him to the
commission of fresh crimes, and in all probability the enmity of this
powerful general would become dangerous to the throne of David. For
however Joab might have excited David's anger by slaying Absalom, and by
the offensive manner in which he had reproved the king for giving way to
his grief, David ought to have suppressed his anger in his existing
circumstances, and ought not to have rendered evil for evil, especially
as he was not only about to pardon Amasa's crime, but even to reward him
as one of his faithful servants.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 19:15</span></span>

Return of the king; and occurrences at the crossing of the Jordan. -
[Sa2 19:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#015.md). Pardon of Shimei. -
[Sa2 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#015.md), [Sa2
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016.md). When David reached the Jordan
on his return, and Judah had come to Gilgal "to meet him, to conduct the
king over the Jordan," i.e., to form an escort at the crossing, Shimei
the Benjaminite hastened down from Bahurim (see [Sa2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005)..md) with the men of Judah to meet
David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 19:17</span></span>

There also came along with Shimei a thousand men of Benjamin, and Ziba
the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and twenty
servants (see [Sa2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#010).md); and they
went over the Jordan before the king, viz., through a ford, and the
ferry-boat had crossed over to carry over the king's family, and to do
whatever seemed good to him, i.e., to be placed at the king's sole
disposal. And Shimei fell down before the king, בּעברו, i.e., "when he
(David) was about to cross over the Jordan," not "when Shimei had
crossed over the Jordan;" for after what has just been stated, such a
remark would be superfluous: moreover, it is very doubtful whether the
infinitive with בּ can express the sense of the pluperfect. Shimei said,
"Let not my lord impute to me any crime, and do not remember how thy
servant hath sinned."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 19:20</span></span>

"For thy servant knoweth (i.e., I know) that I have sinned, and behold I
have come to-day the first of the whole house of Joseph, to go to meet
my lord the king." By "the whole house of Joseph" we are to understand
the rest of the tribes with the exception of Judah, who are called "all
Israel" in [Sa2 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#012.md). There is no
reason for the objection taken by Thenius and Bttcher to the expression
בּית־יוסף. This rendering of the lxx (παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ καὶ οἴκου Ἰωσήφ)
does not prove that כּלישׂראל was the original reading, but only that
the translator thought it necessary to explain οἴκου Ἰωσήφ by adding the
gloss παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ; and the assertion that it was only in the
oratorical style of a later period, when the kingdom had been divided,
that Joseph became the party name of all that were not included in
Judah, is overthrown by [Kg1 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#028.md).
The designation of the tribes that opposed Judah by the name of the
leading tribe (Joseph: [Jos 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001).md) was
as old as the jealousy between these tribes and Judah, which did not
commence with the division of the kingdom, but was simply confirmed
thereby into a permanent distinction. Shimei's prayer for the
forgiveness of his sin was no more a proof of sincere repentance than
the reason which he adduced in support of his petition, namely that he
was the first of all the house of Joseph to come and meet David.
Shimei's only desire was to secure impunity for himself. Abishai
therefore replied ([Sa2 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#021).md), "Shall
not Shimei be put to death for this (זאת תּחת, for this, which he has
just said and done), because he hath cursed the anointed of Jehovah?"
(vid., [Sa2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005)..md). But David answered
([Sa2 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#022).md), "What have I to do with
you, ye sons of Zeruiah (cf. [Sa2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010).md), for ye become opponents to me
to-day?" שׂטן, an opponent, who places obstacles in the way ([Num
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022).md); here it signifies one who
would draw away to evil. "Should any one be put to death in Israel
to-day? for do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?" The
reason assigned by David here for not punishing the blasphemer as he had
deserved, by taking away his life, would have been a very laudable one
if the king had really forgiven him. But as David when upon his deathbed
charged his successor to punish Shimei for this cursing ([Kg1
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008).md), the favour shown him here was
only a sign of David's weakness, which was not worthy of imitation, the
more especially as the king swore unto him ([Sa2
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024).md) that he should not die.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 19:24</span></span>

David's conduct towards Mephibosheth admits still less of justification.

[Sa2 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024.md)

Mephibosheth, the son, i.e., grandson, of Saul, had also come down (from
Jerusalem to the Jordan) to meet David, and had not "made his feet and
his beard," i.e., had not washed his feet or arranged his beard (עשׂה,
as in [Deu 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#012).md), and had not washed
his clothes - all of them signs of deep mourning (cf. [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017).md) - since the day that the king
had gone (i.e., had fled from Jerusalem) until the day that he came
(again) in peace.

[Sa2 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#025.md)

"Now when Jerusalem (i.e., the inhabitants of the capital) came to meet
the king,"

(Note: Dathe and Thenius propose to alter ירוּשׁלים into מירוּשׁלים
(from Jerusalem), from a simple misunderstanding of the true meaning of
the words; for, as Bttcher has observed, the latter (from Jerusalem)
would be quite superfluous, as it is already contained in the previous
ירד. But Bttcher's emendation of בּא into בּאה, because Jerusalem or the
population of Jerusalem is a feminine notion, is equally unnecessary,
since towns and lands are frequently construed as masculines when the
inhabitants are intended (vid., Ewald, 318, a.). On the other hand, the
rendering adopted by the lxx, and by Luther, Michaelis, and Maurer, in
which ירוּשׁלים is taken as an accusative in the sense of "when
Mephibosheth came to Jerusalem to meet the king," is altogether wrong,
and has been very properly given up by modern expositors, inasmuch as it
is at variance not only with the word ירד, but also with [Sa2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#003.md) and [Sa2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#013.md), where Mephibosheth is said to
have lived in Jerusalem.)

David said to him (i.e., to Mephibosheth, who was with the deputation
from the capital which welcomed David at the Jordan), "Why wentest thou
not with me, Mephibosheth?" David was justified in putting this question
after what Ziba had told him concerning Mephibosheth ([Sa2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#003).md).

[Sa2 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#026.md)

Mephibosheth replied, "My lord king, my servant hath deceived me: for
thy servant thought I will have the ass saddled and go to the king; for
thy servant is lame." If we understand אחבּשׁד as signifying that
Mephibosheth had the ass saddled by a servant, and not that he saddled
it with his own hands, the meaning is obvious, and there is no ground
whatever for altering the text. חבשׁ is certainly used in this sense in
[Gen 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#003.md), and it is very common for
things to be said to be done by a person, even though not done with his
own hands. The rendering adopted by the lxx and Vulgate, "Thy servant
said to him (the servant), Saddle me the ass," is not true to the words,
though correct so far as the sense is concerned.

[Sa2 19:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#027.md)

"And he (Ziba) slandered thy servant to my lord the king." Mephibosheth
had not merely inferred this from David's words, and the tone in which
they were spoken, but had certainly found it out long ago, since Ziba
would not delay very long to put David's assurance, that all the
possessions of Mephibosheth should belong to him, in force against his
master, so that Mephibosheth would discover from that how Ziba had
slandered him. "And my lord the king is as the angel of God," i.e., he
sees all just as it really is (see at [Sa2
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#017).md); "and do what is good in thy
sight: for all my father's house (the whole of my family) were but men
of death against my lord the king (i.e., thou mightest have had us all
put to death), and thou didst set thy servant among thy companions at
table (see [Sa2 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#007.md), [Sa2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#011)); and what right or (what.md) more
have I still to cry (for help) to the king?" The meaning is, "I cannot
assert any claims, but will yield to anything you decide concerning me."
It must have been very evident to David from these words of
Mephibosheth, that he had been deceived by Ziba, and that he had formed
an unfounded prejudice against Mephibosheth, and committed an act of
injustice in handing over his property to Ziba. He therefore replied, in
evident displeasure ([Sa2 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029).md), "Why
talkest thou still of thine affairs? I have said, thou and Ziba shall
divide the field?" to which Mephibosheth answered ([Sa2
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#030).md), "He may take the whole, since
my lord the king has returned in peace to his own house." This reply
shows very clearly that an injustice had been done to Mephibosheth, even
if it is not regarded as an expression of wounded feeling on the part of
Mephibosheth because of David's words, but, according to the view taken
by Seb. Schmidt and others, as a vindication of himself, as said not to
blame the king for the opinion he had formed, but simply to defend
himself. But this completely overthrows the opinion held by Thenius and
O. v. Gerlach, that David's words in [Sa2
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#030.md) contain nothing more than a
revocation of his hasty declaration in [Sa2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004.md), and a confirmation of his first
decision in [Sa2 9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#007.md), and are to be
understood as signifying, "Let everything be as I settled it at first;
hold the property jointly," inasmuch as Ziba and his sons had of course
obtained their living from the produce of the land. Moreover, the words
"thou and Ziba divide the land" are directly at variance with the
promise in [Sa2 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#007.md), "I will restore
thee all the land of Saul thy father," and the statement in [Sa2
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#009.md), "I have given unto thy master's
son all that pertained to Saul, and to all his house." By the words, "I
have said, thou and Ziba divide the land," David retracted the hasty
decree in [Sa2 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004.md), so as to modify
to some extent the wrong that he had done to Mephibosheth, but he had
not courage enough to retract it altogether. He did not venture to
dispute the fact that Mephibosheth had really been calumniated by Ziba,
which was placed beyond all doubt by his mourning during the whole
period of David's flight, as described in [Sa2
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024.md). There is no ground for Winer's
statement, therefore, that "it is impossible now to determine whether
Mephibosheth was really innocent or not."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 19:31</span></span>

Barzillai comes to greet David. - [Sa2
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031.md). Barzillai the octogenarian "had
also come down from Roglim and gone across the Jordan with the king, to
escort him over the river." את־בּירדּן is the portion in, or over, the
Jordan. את is the sign of the accusative, "the piece in the Jordan," and
no further. This is the correct explanation as given by Bttcher, after
Gesenius and Maurer; and the Keri היּרדּן is a bad emendation.

[Sa2 19:32-37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#032.md)

As Barzillai had supplied the king with provisions during his stay in
Mahanaim (שׁיבה for ישׁיבה, like צואה for יצואה, and other words of the
same kind), because he was very wealthy (lit. great), David would gladly
have taken him with him to Jerusalem, to repay him there for his
kindness; but Barzillai replied ([Sa2
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#034)..md), "How many days are there of
the years of my life (i.e., how long shall I have yet to live), that I
should go up with the king to Jerusalem? I am now eighty years old; can
I (still) distinguish good and evil, or will thy servant taste what I
eat and drink, or listen again to the voice of the singing men and
singing women? and why should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord
the king? Thy servant would go over the Jordan with the king for a short
time (i.e., could not remain long with him), and why does the king wish
to repay me this favour?" ישׁב־נא: "Let thy servant return, that I may
die in my city (my home), at the grave of my parents; and behold thy
servant Chimham (i.e., according to the explanation given by Josephus,
Barzillai's son, who had come down with his father, as we may infer from
[Kg1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007).md) may go over with my lord the
king; and do to him what seemeth good to thee," i.e., show him favours
at thy pleasure.

[Sa2 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#038.md)

David consented to this, and said, "All that thou desirest of me I will
do to him." בּחר with על is a pregnant construction, signifying to
choose and impose, "choose upon me," i.e., the thing for me to grant
thee.

[Sa2 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#039.md)

Thus all the people went over the Jordan; and when the king had crossed
over, he kissed Barzillai (to take leave of him: vid., [Rut
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#009)); and he (Barzillai.md) blessed him,
and turned to his place (returned home). Barzillai only escorted the
king over the Jordan, and the conversation ([Sa2
19:31-38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031).md) probably took place as they
were crossing.

Quarrel between Israel and Judah about the restoration of the king. -
[Sa2 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#040.md). David went across to
Gilgal (in the plain of the Jordan: [Jos
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019).md), and Chimham (Chimhan is a
modified form for Chimham: [Sa2 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#037).md)
had gone over with him, and all the people of Judah had brought the king
over (the Keri העבירוּ is an easier reading than the Chethib ויּעבירוּ,
"and as for the people, they had," etc.), and also "half the people of
Israel," namely, beside the thousand Benjaminites who came with Shimei
([Sa2 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#017).md), other Israelites who
dwelt in the neighbourhood.

[Sa2 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#041.md)

All the men of Israel, i.e., the representatives of the other tribes of
Israel, came to meet the king in Gilgal; and being annoyed at the fact
that the men of Judah had anticipated them, they exclaimed, "Why have
our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away?" i.e., fetched thee thus
secretly without saying a word to us. "All David's men" were all his
faithful adherents who had fled with him from Jerusalem ([Sa2
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#017)..md).

[Sa2 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#042.md)

The men of Judah replied against (על) the men of Israel: "The king
stands near to us" (inasmuch as he belonged to their tribe), "and
wherefore then art thou angry at this matter? Have we eaten from the
king (i.e., derived any advantage from our tribe-relationship to him, as
the Benjaminites did from Saul, according to [Sa1
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#007).md), or received anything for
ourselves therefrom?" נשּׂאת is an infinitive abs. Niph. with a feminine
termination, borrowed from ה;ל literally, "or has taking been taken for
us."

[Sa2 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#043.md)

The Israelites were annoyed at this answer, and retorted, "I (Israel)
have ten portions in the king, and also more than thou in David; and
wherefore hast thou despised me?" They considered that they had ten
shares in the king, because they formed ten tribes, in opposition to the
one tribe of Judah, as the Levites did not come into consideration in
the matter. Although David was of the tribe of Judah, he was
nevertheless king of the whole nation, so that the ten tribes had a
larger share than one tribe. הקלּתני refers to the fact, that Judah took
no notice at all of the tribes of Israel when fetching back the king.
וגו ולא־היה, "and was not my speech the first to fetch back my king?"
(On the fact itself, see [Sa2
19:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#010)..md) לי is an emphatic dat.
commodi, and is to be taken in connection with להשׁיב, notwithstanding
the accents. "And the speech of the men of Judah became fiercer (more
violent) than the speech of the men of Israel." With these words the
historian sums up briefly the further progress of the dispute, for the
purpose of appending the account of Sheba's rebellion, to which it gave
rise.
