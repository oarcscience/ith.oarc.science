### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 9:1</span></span>

"For all this I brought to my consciousness, and all this I sought to
make clear to me, that the righteous, and the wise, and their deeds, are
in God's hands: neither love nor hatred stands in the knowledge of man,
all lies before them." With ki follows the verification of what is said
in [Ecc 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md), "is unable to find out,"
from the fact of men, even the best and the wisest of men, being on all
sides conditioned. This conditioning is a fact which he layeth to his
heart ([Ecc 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002).md), or (since he here
presents himself less as a feeling than as a thinking man, and the heart
as reflecting) which he has brought to his consciousness, and which he
has sought to bring out into clearness. ולבוּל has here not the force of
an inf. absol., so that it subordinates itself in an adverbial manner
(et ventilando quidem) - for it nowhere stands in the same rank with the
inf. absol.; but the inf. with ל (ל) has the force of an intentional
(with a tendency) fut., since the governing הייתי, as at [Ecc
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015.md), היה, and at [Hab
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017.md), יהיה, is to be supplied (vid.,
comm. on these passages, and under [Isa
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#014).md): operam dedi ut ventilarem
(excuterem), or shorter: ventilaturus fui. Regarding the form לבוּר,
which is metapl. for לבר, and the double idea of sifting (particularly
winnowing, ventilare) of the R. בר, vid., under [Ecc
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md). In the post-bibl. Heb. the words
להעמיד על בוריו would denote the very same as is here expressed by the
brief significant word לבוּר; a matter in the clearness of its actual
condition is called בוריו דבר על (from לברי, after the form חלי, purity,
vid., Buxtorf's Lex. Talm. col. 366). The lxx and Syr. have read ראה
ולבי instead of ולבור, apparently because they could not see their way
with it: "And my heart has seen all this." The expression "all this"
refers both times to what follows; asher is, as at [Ecc
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md), relat. conj., in the sense of
ὃτι, quod, and introduces, as at [Ecc
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md), cf. [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md), the unfolding of the זה - an
unfolding, viz., of the conditioning of man, which [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md) declared on one side of it, and
whose further verification is here placed in view with ki, [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md). The righteous, and the wise, and
their doings, are in God's hand, i.e., power ([Psa
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016.md); [Pro
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md); [Job
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#010), etc..md); as well their persons as
their actions, in respect of their last cause, are conditioned by God,
the Governor of the world and the Former of history; also the righteous
and the wise learn to feel this dependence, not only in their being and
in what befalls them, but also in their conduct; also this is not fully
attained, לאל ידם, they are also therein not sufficient of themselves.
Regarding 'avadēhěm, corresponding to the Aram. 'ovadēhon, vid., 'avad.

The expression now following cannot mean that man does not know whether
he will experience the love or hatred of God, i.e., providences of a
happy nature proceeding from the love of God, or of an unhappy nature
proceeding from the hatred of God (J. D. Michaelis, Knobel, Vaih.,
Hengst., Zckl.), for אהבה and שׂן are too general for this, - man is
thus, as the expression denotes, not the obj., but the subj. to both.
Rightly, Hitz., as also Ewald: "Since man has not his actions in his own
power, he knows not whether he will love or hate." Certainly this sounds
deterministic; but is it not true that personal sympathies and
antipathies, from which love and hatred unfold themselves, come within
the sphere of man, not only as to their objects, in consequence of the
divine arrangement, but also in themselves anticipate the knowledge and
the will of man? and is it less true that the love which he now
cherishes toward another man changes itself, without his previous
knowledge, by means of unexpected causes, into hatred, and, on the other
hand, the hatred into love? Neither love nor hatred is the product of a
man's self-determination; but self-determination, and with it the
function of freedom, begins for the first time over against those
already present, in their beginnings. In הכּל לף, "by all that is before
him," that is brought to a general expression, in which לפני has not the
ethical meaning proceeding from the local: before them, prae = penes eos
(vid., Song, under [Sol 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012).md), but the
purely local meaning, and referred to time: love, hatred, and generally
all things, stand before man; God causes them to meet him (cf. the use
of הקרה); they belong to the future, which is beyond his power. Thus the
Targ., Symm., and most modern interpreters; on the contrary, Luther:
"neither the love nor the hatred of any one which he has for himself,"
which is, linguistically, purely impossible; Kleinert: "Neither the love
nor the hatred of things does man see through, nor anything else which
is before his eyes," for which we ought at least to have had the words
לפניו גם הכל אשׁר; and Tyler: "Men discern neither love nor hatred in
all that is before them," as if the text were אשׁר בכל. The future can,
it is true, be designated by אחרית, and the past by לפנים, but according
to the most natural way of representation (vid., Orelli's Synon. der
Zeit, p. 14) the future is that which lies before a man, and the past
that which is behind him. The question is of importance, which of the
two words לף הכל has the accent. If the accent be on לף, then the
meaning is, that all lies before men deprived of their freedom; if the
accent be on הכל, then the meaning is, that all things, events of all
kinds, lie before them, and that God determines which shall happen to
them. The latter is more accordant with the order of words lying before
us, and shows itself to be that which is intended by the further
progress of the thoughts. Every possible thing may befall a man - what
actually meets him is the determination and providence of God. The
determination is not according to the moral condition of a man, so that
the one can guide to no certain conclusion as to the other.

[Ecclesiastes 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 9:2</span></span>

"All is the same which comes to all: one event happens to the righteous
and the wicked, to the good and the pure and the impure; to him that
sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as with the good, so is it
with the sinner; with him that sweareth, as with him that feareth an
oath." Hitzig translates: "All are alike, one fate comes on all," adding
the remark, that to make מקרה אחד at the same time pred. to הכל and
subm. to כאשר לכל was, for the punctator, too much. This translation is
indeed in matter, as well as in point of syntax, difficult to be
comprehended. Rather, with Ewald, translate: All is as if all had one
fate (death) but why then this useless hevel haasher, only darkening the
thought? But certainly, since in הכּל

(Note: The lxx, Syr., and Aq. have read together the end of [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md) and the beginning of [Ecc
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md). Here Jerome also is dependent on
this mode of reading: sed omnia in futurum servantur incerta (הבל).)

the past is again resumed, it is to be supposed that it does not mean
personally, omnes, but neut., omnia; and לכּל, on the contrary,
manifestly refers (as at [Ecc 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#003).md) to
persons. Herein agreeing with Ewald, and, besides, with Knobel, Zckl.,
and others, we accept the interpunction as it lies before us. The
apparently meaningless clause, omnia sicut omnibus, gives, if we
separate sicut into sic and ut, the brief but pregnant thought: All is
(thus) as it happens to all, i.e., there is no distinction of their
experiences nor of their persons; all of every sort happens in the same
way to all men of every sort. The thought, written in cyphers in this
manner, is then illustrated; the lameds following leave no doubt as to
the meaning of לכל. Men are classified according to their different
kinds. The good and the pure stand opposite the impure; טמא is thus the
defiled, [Hos 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#003.md), cf. [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md), in body and soul. That the
author has here in his mind the precepts of the law regarding the pure
and the impure, is to be concluded from the following contrast: he who
offers sacrifice, and he who does not offer sacrifice, i.e., he who not
only does not bring free-will offerings, but not even the sacrifices
that are obligatory. Finally, he who swears, and he who is afraid of an
oath, are distinguished. Thus, [Zac
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003.md), he who swears stands along with
him who steals. In itself, certainly, swearing an oath is not a sin; in
certain circumstances (vid., [Ecc 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002).md)
it is a necessary solemn act ([Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016).md). But here, in the passage from
Zechariah, swearing of an unrighteous kind is meant, i.e., wanton
swearing, a calling upon God when it is not necessary, and, it may be,
even to confirm an untruth, [Exo 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md).
Compare [Mat 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#034.md). The order of the
words יר שׁב (cf. as to the expression, the Mishnic חטא ירא) is as at
[Nah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001.md); [Isa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002.md); cf. above, [Ecc
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md). One event befalls all these men
of different characters, by which here not death exclusively is meant
(as at [Ecc 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019.md); [Ecc
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014).md), but this only chiefly as the
same end of these experiences which are not determined according to the
moral condition of men. In the expression of the equality, there is an
example of stylistic refinement in a threefold change; כּטוב כּח denotes
that the experience of the good is the experience of the sinner, and may
be translated, "wie der Gute so der Snder" as the good, so the sinner,
as well as "so der Gute wie der Snder" so the good as the sinner (cf.
Khler, under [Hag 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003).md). This sameness
of fate, in which we perceive the want of the inter-connection of the
physical and moral order of the world, is in itself and in its influence
an evil matter.

[Ecclesiastes 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 9:3</span></span>

"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that one event
happeneth to all: and also the heart of the children of men is full of
evil; and madness possesseth their heart during their life, and after it
they go to the dead." As זה, [Ecc 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md),
points to the asher following, in which it unfolds itself, so here to
the ki following. We do not translate: This is the worst thing (Jerome:
hoc est pessimum), which, after [Jos
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md); [Jdg
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015.md); [Sol
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008.md), would have required the words בכל
הרע - the author does not designate the equality of fate as the greatest
evil, but as an evil mixed with all earthly events. It is an evil in
itself, as being a contradiction to the moral order of the world; and it
is such also on account of its demoralizing influences. The author here
repeats what he had already, [Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md), said in a more special
reference, that because evil is not in this world visibly punished, men
become confident and bold in sinning. Vegam (referable to the whole
clause, at the beginning of which it is placed) stands beside zeh ra',
connecting with that which is evil in itself its evil influences. מלא
might be an adj., for this (only once, [Jer
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011).md), like the verb, is connected
with the accus., e.. [Deu 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023.md). But,
since not a statement but a factum had to be uttered, it is finite, as
at [Ecc 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md). Thus Jerome, after
Symm.: sed et cor filiorum hominum repletur malitia et procacitate juxta
cor eorum in vita sua. Keeping out of view the false sed, this
translation corresponds to the accenting which gives the conjunctive
Kadma to רע. But without doubt an independent substantival clause begins
with והו: and madness is in their heart (vid., [Ecc
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017).md) their life long; for, without
taking heed to God's will and to what is pleasing to God, or seeking
after instruction, they think only of the satisfaction of their
inclinations and lusts.

"And after that they go to the dead" - they who had so given themselves
up to evil, and revelled in fleshly lusts with security, go the way of
all flesh, as do the righteous, and the wise, and just, because they
know that they go beyond all restraining bounds. Most modern
interpreters (Hitz., Ew., etc.) render aharav, after [Jer
51:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#046.md), adverbially, with the suffix
understood neut.: afterwards (Jerome, post haec). but at [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md); [Ecc
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014.md), the suffix refers to man: after
him, him who liveth here = after he has laid down his life. Why should
it not be thus understood also here? It is true בּחיּ precedes it; but
in the reverse say, sing. and plur. also interchange in [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md); cf. [Ecc
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md). Rightly the Targ., as with
Kleinert and others, we also explain: after their (his) lifetime. A
man's life finally falls into the past, it lies behind him, and he goes
forth to the dead; and along with self-consciousness, all the pleasures
and joy of life at the same time come to an end.

[Ecclesiastes 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 9:4</span></span>

"For (to him) who shall be always joined to all the living, there is
hope: for even a living dog is better than a dead lion." The interrog.
אשׁר מי, quis est qui, acquires the force of a relative, quisquis
(quicunque), and may be interpreted, [Exo
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#033.md); [Sa2
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#012.md), just as here (cf. the simple
mi, [Ecc 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009).md), in both ways;
particularly the latter passage ([Sa2
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#011).md) is also analogous to the one
before us in the formation of the apodosis. The Chethı̂b יבחר does not
admit of any tenable meaning. In conformity with the usus loq., Elster
reads מי אשר יבחר, "who has a choice?" But this rendering has no
connection with what follows; the sequence of thoughts fails. Most
interpreters, in opposition to the usus loq., by pointing יבחר or יבּחר,
render: Who is (more correctly: will be) excepted? or also: Who is it
that is to be preferred (the living or the dead)? The verb בּחר
signifies to choose, to select; and the choice may be connected with an
exception, a preference; but in itself the verb means neither excipere
nor praeferre.

(Note: Luther translates, "for to all the living there is that which is
desired, namely, hope," as if the text were יבחר מה אשׁר.)

All the old translators, with right, follow the Kerı̂, and the Syr.
renders it correctly, word for word: to every one who is joined (שותף,
Aram. = Heb. חבר) to all the living there is hope; and this translation
is more probable than that on which Symm. ("who shall always continue to
live?") and Jerome (nemo est qui semper vivat et qui hujus rei habeat
fiduciam) proceed: Who is he that is joined to the whole? i.e., to the
absolute life; or as Hitzig: Who is he who would join himself to all the
living (like the saying, "The everlasting Jew")? The expression ישׁ בּטּ
does not connect itself so easily and directly with these two latter
renderings as with that we have adopted, in which, as also in the other
two, a different accentuation of the half-verse is to be adopted as
follows:

כּי מי אשׁר יחבּר אל־כּל־החיּים ישׁ בּטּחון

The accentuation lying before us in the text, which gives a great
disjunctive to יבחר as well as to הח, appears to warrant the Chethı̂b
(cf. Hitzig under [Eze 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#024).md), by
which it is possible to interpret יב ... מי as in itself an interrog.
clause. The Kerı̂ יח does not admit of this, for Dachselt's quis
associabit se (sc.,, mortius? = nemo socius mortuorum fieri vult) is a
linguistic impossibility; the reflex may be used for the pass., but not
the pass. for the reflex., which is also an argument against Ewald's
translation: Who is joined to the living has hope. Also the Targ. and
Rashi, although explaining according to the Midrash, cannot forbear
connecting אל כל־חה with יח, and thus dividing the verse at חה instead
of at יח. It is not, however, to be supposed that the accentuation
refers to the Chethı̂b; it proceeds on some interpretation, contrary to
the connection, such as this: he who is received into God's fellowship
has to hope for the full life (in eternity). The true meaning, according
to the connection, is this: that whoever (quicunque) is only always
joined (whether by birth or the preservation of life) to all the living,
i.e., to living beings, be they who they may, has full confidence, hope,
and joy; for in respect to a living dog, this is even better than a dead
lion. Symmachus translates: κυνὶ ζῶντι βέλτιόν ἐστιν ἤ λέοντι τεθνηκότι,
which Rosenm., Herzf., and Grtz approve of. But apart from the obliquity
of the comparison, that with a living dog it is better than with a dead
lion, since with the latter is neither good nor evil (vid., however,
[Ecc 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005).md), for such a meaning the
words ought to have been: chělěv hai tov lo min ha'aryēh hammeth.

As the verifying clause stands before us, it is connected not with ישׁ
בּטּ, but with אל כּל־ה, of that which is to be verified; the ל gives
emphatic prominence (Ewald, 310b) to the subject, to which the
expression refers as at [Psa 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md);
[Ch2 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#021.md) (cf. [Jer
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016).md), [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md) : A living dog is better than a
dead lion, i.e., it is better to be a dog which lives, than that lion
which is dead. The dog, which occurs in the Holy Scriptures only in
relation to a shepherd's dog ([Job
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001).md), and as for the rest, appears as
a voracious filthy beast, roaming about without a master, is the
proverbial emblem of that which is common, or low, or contemptible, [Sa1
17:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#043.md); cf. "dog's head," [Sa2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#008.md); "dead dog," [Sa1
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#015.md); [Sa2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#008.md); [Sa2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#009.md). The lion, on the other hand, is
the king, or, as Agur ([Pro 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#030).md)
calls it, the hero among beasts. But if it be dead, then all is over
with its dignity and its strength; the existence of a living dog is to
be preferred to that of the dead lion. The art. in 'הא הם is not that
denoting species (Dale), which is excluded by hammēth, but it points to
the carcase of a lion which is present. The author, who elsewhere
prefers death and nonentity to life, [Ecc
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md)., [Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md), appears to have fallen into
contradiction with himself; but there he views life pessimistically in
its, for the most part, unhappy experiences, while here he regards it in
itself as a good affording the possibility of enjoyment. It lies,
however, in the nature of his standpoint that he should not be able to
find the right medium between the sorrow of the world and the pleasure
of life. Although postulating a retribution in eternity, yet in his
thoughts about the future he does not rise above the comfortless idea of
Hades.

[Ecclesiastes 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 9:5</span></span>

He sarcastically verifies his comparison in favour of a living dog. "For
the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything, and
have no more a reward; for their memory is forgotten. Their love, as
well as their hatred and their envy, has long ago perished, and they
have part no more for ever in all that is done under the sun." The
description of the condition of death begins sarcastically and then
becomes elegiac. "They have no reward further," viz., in this upper
world, since there it is only too soon forgotten that they once existed,
and that they did anything worthy of being remembered; Koheleth might
here indeed, with his view shrouded in dark clouds, even suppose that
God also forgot them, [Job 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013.md). The
suff. of אהב, etc., present themselves was subjective, and there is no
reason, with Knobel and Ginsburg, to render them objectively: not merely
the objects of their love, and hatred, and envy, are lost to them, but
these their affections and strivings themselves have ceased (Rosenm.,
Hitzig, Zckl., and others), they lie (Kevar 'avadah) far behind them as
absolutely gone; for the dead have no part more in the history which is
unfolding itself amid the light of the upper world, and they can have no
more any part therein, for the dead as not living are not only without
knowledge, but also without feeling and desire. The representation of
the state after death is here more comfortless than anywhere else. For
elsewhere we read that those who have been living here spend in Sheol,
i.e., in the deep (R. של, to be loose, to hang down, to go downwards)
realm of the dead, as rephaim ([Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009), etc..md), lying beneath the upper
world, far from the love and the praise of God ([Psa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003.md); [Psa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010).md), a prospectless ([Job
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007.md)., [Job
14:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006.md); [Job
18:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#011).md), dark, shadowy existence;
the soul in Hades, though neither annihilated nor sleeping, finds itself
in a state of death no less than does the body in the grave. But here
the state of death is not even set forth over against the idea of the
dissolution of life, the complete annihilation of individuality, much
less that a retribution in eternity, i.e., a retribution executed, if
not here, yet at some time, postulated elsewhere by the author, throws a
ray of light into the night of death. The apocryphal book of the Wisdom
of Solomon, which distinguishes between a state of blessedness and a
state of misery measured out to men in the future following death, has
in this surpassed the canonical Book of Koheleth. In vain do the Targ.,
Midrash, and the older Christian interpreters refer that which is said
to the wicked dead; others regard Koheleth as introducing here the
discourse of atheists (e.g., Oetinger), and interpret, under the
influence of monstrous self-deception, [Ecc
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md) as the voice of the spirit
(Hengst.) opposing the voice of the flesh. But that which Koheleth
expresses here only in a particularly rugged way is the view of Hades
predominating in the O.T. It is the consequence of viewing death from
the side of its anger. Revelation intentionally permits this manner of
viewing it to remain; but from premises which the revelation sets forth,
the religious consciousness in the course of time draws always more
decidedly the conclusion, that the man who is united to God will fully
reach through death that which since the entrance of sin into the world
cannot be reached without the loss of this present life, i.e., without
death, viz., a more perfect life in fellowship with God. Yet the
confusion of the O.T. representation of Hades remains; in the Book of
Sirach it also still throws its deep shadows (17:22f.) into the
contemplation of the future; for the first time the N.T. solution
actually removes the confusion, and turns the scale in favour of the
view of death on its side of light. In this history of the ideas of
eternity moving forward amid many fluctuations to the N.T. goal, a
significant place belongs to the Book of Koheleth; certainly the
Christian interpreter ought not to have an interest in explaining away
and concealing the imperfections of knowledge which made it impossible
for the author spiritually to rise above his pessimism. He does not
rise, in contrast to his pessimism, above an eudaemonism which is
earthly, which, without knowing of a future life (not like the modern
pessimism, without wishing to know of a future life), recommends a
pleasant enjoyment of the present life, so far as that is morally
allowable:

[Ecclesiastes 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 9:7</span></span>

"Go, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for
long ago hath God accepted thy work. Let thy garments be always white;
and let not oil be wanting to thy head. Enjoy life with a wife whom thou
lovest through all the days of thy vain life, which He hath given thee
under the sun - through all thy vain days: for that is thy portion in
life, and in thy labour wherewith thou weariest thyself under the sun.
All that thy hand may find to do with thy might, that do; for there is
not work, and calculation, and knowledge, and wisdom, in the under
world, whither thou shalt go." Hengstenberg perceives here the
counterpart of the spirit; on the contrary, Oetinger, Mendelssohn, and
others, discover also here, and here for the first time rightly, the
utterance of an epicurean thought. But, in fact, this לך down to שׁ הולך
is the most distinct personal utterance of the author, his ceterum
censeo which pervades the whole book, and here forms a particularly
copious conclusion of a long series of thoughts. We recapitulate this
series of thoughts: One fate, at last the same final event, happens to
all men, without making any distinction according to their moral
condition, - an evil matter, so much the more evil, as it encourages to
wickedness and light-mindedness; the way of man, without exception,
leads to the dead, and all further prospect is cut off; for only he who
belongs to the class of living beings has a joyful spirit, has a spirit
of enterprise: even the lowest being, if it live, stands higher in
worth, and is better, than the highest if it be dead; for death is the
end of all knowledge and feeling, the being cut off from the living
under the sun. From this, that there is only one life, one life on this
side of eternity, he deduces the exhortation to enjoy the one as much as
possible; God Himself, to whom we owe it, will have it so that we enjoy
it, within the moral limits prescribed by Himself indeed, for this
limitation is certainly given with His approbation. Incorrectly, the
Targ., Rashi, Hengst. Ginsb., and Zckl. explain: For thy moral conduct
and effort have pleased Him long ago - the person addressed is some one,
not a definite person, who could be thus set forth as such a witness to
be commended. Rather with Grotius and others: Quia Deus favet laboribus
tuis h. e. eos ita prosperavit, ut cuncta quae vitam delectant abunde
tibi suppetant. The thought is wholly in the spirit of the Book of
Koheleth; for the fruit of labour and the enjoyment of this fruit of
labour, as at [Ecc 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md); [Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md), etc., is a gift from above; and
besides, this may be said to the person addressed, since 7a presupposes
that he has at his disposal heart-strengthening bread and
heart-refreshing wine. But in these two explanations the meaning of כּבר
is not comprehended. It was left untranslated by the old translators,
from their not understanding it. Rightly, Aben Ezra: For God wills that
thou shouldst thus to \[indulge in these enjoyments\]; more correctly,
Hitzig: Long ago God has beforehand permitted this thy conduct, so that
thou hast no room for scruples about it. How significant כבר is for the
thought, is indicated by the accentuation which gives to it Zakef: from
aforetime God has impressed the seal of His approbation on this thy
eating with joy, this thy drinking with a merry heart. - The assigning
of the reason gives courage to the enjoyment, but at the same time gives
to it a consecration; for it is the will of God that we should enjoy
life, thus it is self-evident that we have to enjoy it as He wills it to
be enjoyed.

[Ecc 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#008.md)

The white garments, לבּנים, are in contrast to the black robes of
mourning, and thus are an expression of festal joy, of a happy mood;
black and white are, according to the ancients, colour-symbols, the
colours respectively of sorrow and joy, to which light and darkness
correspond.

(Note: Cf. Shabbath 114a: "Bury me neither in white nor in black
garments: not in white, because perhaps I may not be one of the blessed,
and am like a bridegroom among mourners; not in black, because perhaps I
may be one of the blessed, and am like a mourner among bridegrooms."
Semachoth ii. 10: Him who is outside the congregation, they do not bury
with solemnity; the brothers and relatives of such must clothe and veil
themselves in white; cf. Joma 39b. Elsewhere white is the colour of
innocence, Shabbath 153a, Midrash under [Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011.md); and black the colour of guilt,
Kiddushin 40a, etc.)

Fragrant oil is also, according to [Pro
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#009.md), one of the heart-refreshing
things. Sorrow and anointing exclude one another, [Sa2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002.md); joy and oil stand in closest
mutual relation, [Psa 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008.md); [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md); oil which smooths the hair and
makes the face shine (vid., under [Psa
104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015).md). This oil ought not to be
wanting to the head, and thus the perpetuity of a happy life should
suffer no interruption.

[Ecc 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009.md)

In [Ecc 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009.md) most translators render:
Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest; but the author purposely does
not use the word האשּׁה, but אשּׁה; and also that he uses חיּים, and not
החיּים, is not without significance. He means: Bring into experience
what life, what happiness, is (cf. the indetermin. ideas, [Psa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#013).md) with a wife whom thou hast
loved (Jerome: quaecunque tibi placuerit feminarum), in which there lies
indirectly the call to choose such an one; whereby the pessimistic
criticism of the female sex, [Ecc
7:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md), so far as the author is
concerned, falls into the background, since eudaemonism, the other side
of his view of the world, predominates. The accus. designation of time,
"through all the days of the life of thy vanity (i.e., of thy transient
vain life)," is like [Ecc 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md), cf.
[Ecc 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md). It is repeated in "all the
days of thy vanity;" the repetition is heavy and unnecessary (therefore
omitted by the lxx, Targ., and Syr.); probably like והדרך, [Psa
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#005.md), a ditto; Hitzig, however, finds
also here great emphasis. The relative clause standing after the first
designation of time refers to "the days which He (האלהים, [Ecc
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007).md) has granted under the sun." Hu in
[Ecc 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009.md) refers attractionally to חלקך
(Jerome: haec est enim parts), as at [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md), cf. [Ecc
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002.md); היא of the Babyl. is therefore to
be rejected; this enjoyment, particularly of marriage joys, is thy part
in life, and in thy work which thou accomplishest under the sun, i.e.,
the real portion of gain allotted to thee which thou mayest and oughtest
to enjoy here below.

[Ecc 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010.md)

The author, however, recommends no continual dolce far niente, no idle,
useless sluggard-life devoted to pleasure, but he gives to his
exhortation to joy the converse side: "All that thy hand may reach
(i.e., what thou canst accomplish and is possible to thee, [Sa1
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#007.md); [Lev
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#008).md) to accomplish it with thy might,
that do." The accentuation is ingenious. If the author meant: That do
with all might (Jerome: instanter operare), then he would have said
bechol-kohhacha ([Gen 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#006).md). As the
words lie before us, they call on him who is addressed to come not short
in his work of any possibility according to the measure of his strength,
thus to a work straining his capacity to the uttermost. The reason for
the call, 10b, turns back to the clause from which it was inferred: in
Hades, whither thou must go (iturus es), there is no work, and reckoning
(vid., [Ecc 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025).md), and knowledge
(דּעתו)

(Note: Not ודעת, because the word has the conjunctive, not the
disjunctive accent, vid., under [Psa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#010.md). The punctuation, as we have
already several times remarked, is not consistent in this; cf. דּעתו,
[Ecc 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md), and וערב, [Psa
65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009.md), both of which are contrary to
the rule (vid., Baer in Abulwald's Rikma, p. 119, note 2).)

and no wisdom. Practice and theory have then an end. Thus: Enjoy, but
not without working, ere the night cometh when no man can work. Thus
spake Jesus ([Joh 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004).md), but in a
different sense indeed from Koheleth. The night which He meant is the
termination of this present life, which for Him, as for every man, has
its particular work, which is either accomplished within the limits of
this life, or is not accomplished at all.

[Ecclesiastes 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 9:11</span></span>

"Further, I came to see under the sun, that the race belongs not to the
swift, and the war not to the heroes, and also not bread to the wise
man, and not riches to the prudent, and not favour to men of knowledge;
for time and chance happeneth to them all." The nearest preceding רא, to
which this ורב ורא suitably connects itself, is at [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md). Instead of redii et videndo
quidem = rursus vidi (cf. [Ecc 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009.md) and
under [Ecc 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001).md), we had at [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md) the simpler expression, redii et
vidi. The five times repeated ל is that of property, of that, viz., by
virtue of which one is master of that which is named, has power over it,
disposes of it freely. The race belongs not to the swift (מרוץ, masc. to
מרוּצה, only here), i.e., their fleetness is yet no guarantee that on
account of it they will reach the goal. Luther freely: "To be fleet does
not help in running," i.e., running to an object or goal. "The war
belongs not to the heroes," means that much rather it belongs to the
Lord, [Sa1 17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047.md). - God alone gives
the victory ([Psa 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016).md). Even so the
gaining of bread, riches, favour (i.e., influence, reputation), does not
lie in wisdom, prudence, knowledge of themselves, as an indispensable
means thereto; but the obtaining of them, or the not obtaining of them,
depends on times and circumstances which lie beyond the control of man,
and is thus, in the final result, conditioned by God (cf. [Rom
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016).md);

(Note: But not [Jer 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022.md); this
passage, referred to by Bernstein, is of a different nature.)

time and fate happen to all whose ability appears to warrant the issue,
they both time and fate encounter them and bar to them the way; they are
in an inexplicable manner dependent on both, and helplessly subject to
them. As the idea of spiritual superiority is here expressed in a
threefold manner by הח (whence לה of the plur., also with the art. [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md); [Exo
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#004.md); [Est
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#013).md), 'הן, and היּ, so at [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md), the gifts of "wisdom,"
"counsel," and "knowledge" follow each other. 'Eth is here "time" with
its special circumstances (conjunctures), and pega', "accident,"
particularly as an adversity, disappointment of the word is used also
without any addition ([Kg1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018).md) of
misfortune (cf. שיר פגעים, [Psa 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md);
91). The masc. יק is regulated after וף; 'eth can, however, be used in
the masc., [Sol 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012.md); Bttch. 648,
viz., "with the misapprehension of its origin" (v. Orelli).

This limitation of man in his efforts, in spite of all his capacity, has
its reason in this, that he is on the whole not master of his own life:

[Ecclesiastes 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 9:12</span></span>

"For man also knoweth not his time: like the fishes which are caught in
an evil net, and like the birds which are caught in the snare - like
them are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it suddenly breaks
in upon them." The particles גּם כּי are here not so clearly connected
as at [Ecc 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md); [Ecc
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014.md), where, more correctly, the
pointing should be גּם כּי (ki with the conjunct. accent); ki rules the
sentence; and gam, as to its meaning, belongs to etḣ'itto. The
particular has its reason from the general: man is not master of his own
time, his own person, and his own life, and thus not of the fruits of
his capabilities and his actions, in spite of the previously favourable
conditions which appear to place the result beyond a doubt; for ere the
result is reached of which he appears to be able to entertain a
certainty, suddenly his time may expire, and his term of life be
exhausted. Jerome translate 'itto (cf. [Ecc
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017).md) rightly by finem suum; עת, with
the gen. following, frequently (vid., under [Job
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001).md) means the point of time when the
fate of any one is decided, - the terminus where a reckoning is made;
here, directly, the terminus ad quem. The suddenness with which men are
frequently overtaken with the catastrophe which puts an end to their
life, is seen by comparison with the fishes which are suddenly caught in
the net, and the birds which are suddenly caught in the snare. With שׁן
(that are caught) there is interchanged, in two variations of
expression, האחזות, which is incorrectly written, by v. d. Hooght,
Norzi, and others, האחזּ.

(Note: Vid., Ed. Knig, Gedanke, Laut u. Accent (1874), p. 72.)

מצו, a net, - of which the plur. form [Ecc
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md) is used, - goes back, as does the
similar designation of a bulwark ([Ecc
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#014).md), to the root-conception of
searching (hunting), and receives here the epithet "evil." Birds, צפּרים
(from a ground-form with a short terminal vowel; cf. Assyr. itṣtṣur,
from itṣpur), are, on account of their weakness, as at [Isa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#005.md), as a figure of tender love,
represented in the fem.

The second half of the verse, in conformity with its structure, begins
with כּהם (which more frequently occurs as כּמוהם). יוּק .)כּ is part.
Pu. for מיקּשׁים (Ewald, 170d); the particip. מ is rejected, and ק is
treated altogether as a guttural, the impracticable doubling of which is
compensated for by the lengthening of the vowel. The use of the part. is
here stranger than e.g., at [Pro
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#013.md); [Pro
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#032.md); the fact repeating itself is
here treated as a property. Like the fish and the birds are they, such
as are caught, etc. Otherwise Hitz.: Like these are they caught, during
the continuance of their life in the evil time ... ; but the being
snared does not, however, according to the double figure, precede the
catastrophe, but is its consequence. Rightly, Ginsb.: "Like these are
the sons of men ensnared in the time of misfortune." רעה might be adj.,
as at [Amo 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013.md); [Mic
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003.md); but since it lies nearer to refer
כּשׁתּ to ra'ah than to 'eth, thus ra'ah, like the frequently occurring
yom ra'ah ([Ecc 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014.md); cf. [Jer
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#017.md) with [Jer
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011).md), may be thought of as genit. An
example of that which is here said is found in the fatal wounding of
Ahab by means of an arrow which was not aimed at him, so that he died
"at the time of the going down of the sun," [Ch2
18:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#033.md).

[Ecclesiastes 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 9:13</span></span>

"Also this have I come to see as wisdom under the sun, and it appears
great to me." The Venet. construes falsely: "This also have I seen:
wisdom under the sun;" as also Hitzig, who reads זה (neut. as at [Ecc
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027).md). There is no reason thus to
break up the sentence which introduces the following experience. Zoh is
connected with hhochmah, but not as Luther renders it: "I have also seen
this wisdom," which would have required the words הח זאת, but, as Jerome
does: Hanc quoque sub sole vidi sapeintiam; this, however, since ־מג, as
at [Ecc 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015.md), cf. [Ecc
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#018.md), is attractionally related to
hhochmah as its pred., is = "also in this I saw wisdom," as the lxx
translates, or as Zckl.: "also this have I seen - come to find out as
wisdom," - also this, viz., the following incident narrated, in which
wisdom of exceeding greatness presented itself to me. As Mordecai is
called "great among the Jews," [Est
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003.md), so here Koheleth says that the
wisdom which came to light therein appeared to him great (אלי, as
elsewhere בּעיני or לפני).

Now follows an experience, which, however, has not merely a light side,
but also a dark side; for wisdom, which accomplished so great a matter,
reaped only ingratitude:

[Ecclesiastes 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 9:14</span></span>

"A little city, and men therein only a few, - to which a great king came
near, and he besieged it, and erected against it high bulwarks. And he
met therein a poor wise man, and who saved the city by his wisdom; and
no man thought of that poor man." What may be said as to the hist.
reference of these words has already been noticed. The "great king" is
probably an Asiatic monarch, and that the Persian; Jerome translates
verbally: Civitas parva et pauci in ea viri, venit contra eam - the
former is the subj., and the latter its pred.; the object stands first,
plastically rigid, and there then follows what happened to it; the
structure of the sentence is fundamentally the same as [Psa
104:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#025.md). The expression אל בּוא, which
may be used of any kind of coming to anything, is here, as at [Gen
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md), meant of a hostile approach. The
object of a siege and a hostile attack is usually denoted by על, [Kg2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md); [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md). Two Codd. of de Rossi's have the
word מצורים, but that is an error of transcription; the plur. of מצור is
fem., [Isa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004.md). מצודים is, as at [Ecc
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md), plur. of מצוד (from צוּד, to lie
in wait); here, as elsewhere, בּחן and דּיק is the siege-tower erected
on the ground or on the rampart, from which to spy out the weak points
of the beleaguered place so as to assail it.

The words following בהּ וּמצא are rendered by the Targ., Syr., Jerome,
Arab., and Luther: "and there was found in it;" most interpreters
explain accordingly, as they point to [Ecc
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#010.md), יאמר, dicat aliquis. But that מץ
taht in this sequence of thought is = ונמצא ([Job
42:15](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#015).md), is only to be supposed if it
were impossible to regard the king as the subject, which Ewald with the
lxx and the Venet. does in spite of 294b. It is true it would not be
possible if, as Vaih. remarks, the finding presupposed a searching; but
cf. on the contrary, e.g., [Deu 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md);
[Psa 116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md). We also say of one whom,
contrary to expectation, a superior meets with, that he has found his
match, that he has found his man. Thus it is here said of the great
king, he found in the city a poor wise man - met therein with such an
one, against whom his plan was shattered. חכם is the adjective of the
person of the poor man designated by ish miskēn (cf. [Ch2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013).md); the accents correctly indicate
this relation. Instead of וּמלּט־הוּא, the older language would use
וימלּט; it does not, like the author here, use pure perfects, but makes
the chief factum prominent by the fut. consec. The ē of millēt is that
of limmēd before Makkeph, referred back to the original a. The making
prominent of the subject contained in millat by means of hu is
favourable to the supposition that umatsa' has the king as its subject;
while even where no opposition (as e.g., at [Jer
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018).md) lies before us this pleonasm
belongs to the stylistic peculiarities of the book. Instead of adam lo,
the older form is ish lo; perhaps the author here wishes to avoid the
repetition of ish, but at [Ecc 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md) he
also uses adam instead of ish, where no such reason existed.

Threatened by a powerful assailant, with whom it could not enter into
battle, the little city, deserted by its men to a small remainder
capable of bearing arms (this idea one appears to be under the necessity
of connecting with מעט ... ואן), found itself in the greatest straits;
but when all had been given up as lost, it was saved by the wisdom of
the poor man (perhaps in the same way as Abel-beth-maacha, 2 Sam 20, by
the wisdom of a woman). But after this was done, the wise poor man
quickly again fell into the background; no man thought of him, as he
deserved to have been thought of, as the saviour of the city; he was
still poor, and remained so, and pauper homo raro vifit cum nomine
claro. The poor man with his wisdom, Hengst. remarks, is Israel. And
Wangemann (1856), generalizing the parable: "The beleaguered city is the
life of the individual; the great king who lays siege to it is death and
the judgment of the Lord." But sounder and more appropriate is the
remark of Luther: Est exemplum generale, cujus in multis historiis
simile reperitur; and: Sic Themistocles multa bona fecit suis civibus,
sed expertus summam intratitudinem. The author narrates an actual
history, in which, on the one hand, he had seen what great things wisdom
can do; and from which, on the other hand, he has drawn the following
lesson:

[Ecclesiastes 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 9:16</span></span>

"And I said: Better is wisdom than strength; but the wisdom of the poor
is despised, and his words are not heard." With the words, "I saw," the
author introduces his observations, and with "I said" his reflections.
Wisdom is better than strength, since it does more for the wise man, and
through him for others, than physical force, - more, as expressed in
[Ecc 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md), than ten mighty men. But
the respect which wisdom otherwise secures for a man, if it is the
wisdom of a poor man, sinks into despect, to which his poverty exposes
him, - if necessity arises, his service, as the above history shows, is
valued; but as a rule his words are unheeded, for the crowd estimate the
worth of him whom they willingly hear according to the outward respect
in which he is held.

To the lessons gathered from experience, are now added instructive
proverbs of kindred contents.

[Ecclesiastes 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 9:17</span></span>

"The words of the wise, heard in quiet, have the superiority above the
cry of a ruler among fools." Instead of tovim min, there stands here the
simple min, prae, as at [Ecc 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md), to
express the superiority of the one to the other. Hitzig finds in this
proverb the meaning that, as that history has shown, the words of the
wise, heard with tranquillity, gain the victory over the cry of a ruler
over fools. But (1) the contrast of נחת and זעקת require us to attribute
the tranquillity to the wise man himself, and not to his hearers; (2) מו
בּךּ is not a ruler over fools, by which it would remain questionable
whether he himself was not a fool (cf. [Job
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#026).md), but a ruler among fools (cf.
[Sa2 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#003.md), מו בּ, "a ruler among men;"
and [Pro 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#030.md), גּבּ בּ, "the hero
among beasts"), i.e., one who among fools takes the place of chief. The
words of the poor wise man pass by unheeded, they are not listened to,
because he does not possess an imposing splendid outward appearance, in
accordance with which the crowd estimate the value of a man's words; the
wise man does not seek to gain esteem by means of a pompous violent
deportment; his words נשׁ בּ are heard, let themselves be heard, are to
be heard (cf. e.g., [Sol 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012).md) in
quiet ([Isa 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015).md); for, trusting to
their own inward power of conviction, and committing the result to God,
he despises vociferous pomp, and the external force of earthly
expedients (cf. [Isa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002.md); [Mat
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#019).md); but the words of the wise,
which are to be heard in unassuming, passionless quietness, are of more
value than the vociferation with which a king among fools, an arch-fool,
a non plus ultra among fools, trumpets forth his pretended wisdom and
constrains his hearers.

The following proverb also leans on the history above narrated: "Better
is wisdom than weapons of war; and one sinner destroyeth much good." The
above history has shown by way of example that wisdom accomplishes more
than implements of war, כּלי ק = כּלי מל (Assyr. unut tahazi)

(Note: Vid., Fried. Delitzsch's Assyr. Stud. p. 129.)

i.e., than all the apparatus belonging to preparation for war. But the
much good which a wise man is accomplishing or has accomplished, one
sinner (חוטא)

(Note: The Syr. (not the Targ.) had חטא before it, and thus realized it,
which appears to correspond better with the parall. חכמה.)

by treachery or calumny may render vain, or may even destroy, through
mere malicious pleasure in evil. This is a synthetic distich whose two
parts may be interpreted independently. As wisdom accomplishes something
great, so a single villain may have a far-reaching influence, viz., such
as destroys much good.
