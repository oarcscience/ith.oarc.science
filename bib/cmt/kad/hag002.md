### [Haggai Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md)

[Haggai](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hag 2:0</span></span>

Glory of the New Temple, and the Blessings of the New Era - Haggai 2

This chapter contains three words of God, which Haggai published to the
people in the seventh and ninth months of the second year of Darius, to
strengthen them in their zeal for the building of the temple, and to
preserve them from discouragement. The first of these words ([Hag
2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001).md) refers to the relation in which
the new temple would stand to the former one, and was uttered not quite
four weeks after the building of the temple had been resumed.

[Haggai 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hag 2:1</span></span>

Glory of the New Temple- [Hag 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md) and
[Hag 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#002.md). "In the seventh month, on
the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the Lord came through
Haggai," viz., to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant of the nation,
that is to say, to the whole of the congregation that had returned from
exile; whereas the first appeal was only addressed to Zerubbabel and
Joshua (see the introduction to [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001).md), although it also applied to the
whole nation. Just as in the second year of the return from Babylon,
when the foundation for the temple, which was about to be rebuilt, was
laid in the reign of Cyrus, many old men, who had seen the temple of
Solomon, burst out into loud weeping when they saw the new foundation
([Ezr 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010)..md); a similar feeling of
mourning and despair appears to have taken possession of the people and
their rulers immediately after the work had been resumed under Darius,
and doubts arose whether the new building was really well-pleasing to
the Lord, and ought to be carried on. The occasion for this despondency
is not to be sought, as Hitzig supposes, in the fact that objections
were made to the continuance of the building ([Ezr
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003).md), and that the opinion prevailed
in consequence that the works ought to be stopped till the arrival of
the king's authority. For this view not only has no support whatever in
our prophecy, but is also at variance with the account in the book of
Ezra, according to which the governor and his companions, who had made
inquiries concerning the command to build, did not stop the building
while they sent word of the affair to the king ([Ezr
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#005).md). Moreover, the conjecture that
the people had been seized with a feeling of sadness, when the work had
so far advanced that they were able to institute a comparison between
the new temple and the earlier one (Hengstenberg), does not suffice to
explain the rapid alteration which took place in the feelings of the
people. The building could not have been so far advance din three weeks
and a half as that the contrast between the new temple and the former
one could be clearly seen, if it had not been noticed from the very
first; a fact, however, to which [Ezr
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012.md) distinctly refers. But although
it had been seen from the very beginning that the new building would not
come up to the glory of the former temple, the people could not from the
very outset give up the hope of erecting a building which, if not quite
equal to the former one in glory, would at all events come somewhat near
to it. Under these circumstances, their confidence in the work might
begin to vanish as soon as the first enthusiasm flagged, and a time
arrived which was more favourable for the quiet contemplation of the
general condition of affairs. This explanation is suggested by the time
at which the second word of God was delivered to the congregation
through the prophet. The twenty-first day of the seventh month was the
seventh day of the feast of tabernacles (cf. [Lev
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034)..md), the great festival of
rejoicing, on which Israel was to give practical expression to its
gratitude for the gracious guidance which it had received through the
wilderness, as well as for the blessing of the ingathering of all the
fruits of the ground, which ended with the gathering of the
orchard-fruits and with the vintage, by the presentation of numerous
burnt-offerings and other sacrifices (see my biblische Archologie, i. p.
415ff.). The return of this festal celebration, especially after a
harvest which had turned out very miserably, and showed no signs of the
blessing of God, could not fail to call up vividly before the mind the
difference between the former times, when Israel was able to assemble in
the courts of the Lord's house, and so to rejoice in the blessings of
His grace in the midst of abundant sacrificial meals, and the present
time, when the altar of burnt-sacrifice might indeed be restored again,
and the building of the temple be resumed, but in which there was no
prospect of erecting a building that would in any degree answer to the
glory of the former temple; and when the prophecies of an Isaiah or an
Ezekiel were remembered, according to which the new temple was to
surpass the former one in glory, it would be almost sure to produce
gloomy thoughts, and supply food for doubt whether the time had really
come for rebuilding the temple, when after all it would be only a
miserable hut. In this gloomy state of mind consolation was very
necessary, if the hardly awakened zeal for the building of the house of
God was not to cool down and vanish entirely away. To bring this
consolation to those who were in despair was the object of the second
word of God, which Haggai was to publish to the congregation. It runs as
follows:

[Haggai 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hag 2:3</span></span>

"Who is left among you, that saw this house in its former glory? and how
do ye see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes? [Hag
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#004.md). And now be comforted, Zerubbabel,
is the saying of Jehovah; and be comforted, Joshua son of Jozadak, thou
high priest; and be comforted all the people of the land, is the saying
of Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, is the saying of Jehovah of
hosts. [Hag 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005.md). The word that I
concluded with you at your coming out of Egypt, and my Spirit, stand in
the midst of you; fear ye not." The prophet, admitting the poverty of
the new building in comparison with the former one, exhorts them to
continue the work in comfort, and promises them that the Lord will be
with them, and fulfil His covenant promises. The question in [Hag
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md) is addressed to the old men, who
had seen Solomon's temple in all its glory. There might be many such men
still living, as it was only sixty-seven or sixty-eight years since the
destruction of the first temple. הנּשׁאר is the predicate to the subject
מי, and has the article because it is defined by the reflex action of
the relative clause which follows (compare Ewald, 277, a). The second
question, וּמה אתּם וגו, et qualem videtis, In what condition do ye see
it now? is appended to the last clause of the first question: the house
which ye saw in its former glory. There then follows with הלוא, in the
form of a lively assurance, the statement of the difference between the
two buildings. כּמהוּ כּאין, which has been interpreted in very
different ways, may be explained from the double use of the כ in
comparisons, which is common in Hebrew, and which answers to our as -
so: here, however, it is used in the same way as in [Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025.md) and [Gen
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#018.md); that is to say, the object to
be compared is mentioned first, and the object with which the comparison
is instituted is mentioned afterwards, in this sense, "so is it, as
having no existence," in which case we should either leave out the first
particle of comparison, or if it were expressed, should have to reverse
the order of the words: "as not existing (nothing), so is it in your
eyes." Koehler gives this correct explanation; whereas if כּמהוּ be
explained according to [Joe 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md), its
equal, or such an one, we get the unsuitable thought, that it is not the
temple itself, but something like the temple, that is compared to
nothing. Even in [Gen 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#018.md), to which
Ewald very properly refers as containing a perfectly equivalent phrase,
it is not a man equal to Joseph, but Joseph himself, who is compared to
Pharaoh, and described as being equal to him. Nevertheless they are not
to let their courage fail, but to be comforted and to work. Châzaq, to
be inwardly strong, i.e., to be comforted, 'Ash, to work or procure, as
in [Rut 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#019.md) and [Pro
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#013.md), in actual fact, to continue the
work of building bravely, without there being any necessity to supply
מלאכה from [Hag 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md). For Jehovah will
be with them (cf. [Hag 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013).md).

In confirmation of this promise the Lord adds, that the word which He
concluded with them on their coming out of Egypt, and His Spirit, will
continue among them. "The word" ('eth-haddâbhâr) cannot be either the
accusative of the object to the preceding verb ‛ăsū ([Hag
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#004).md), or to any verb we may choose to
supply, or the preposition 'ēth, with, or the accusative of norm or
measure (Luther, Calvin, and others). To connect it with ‛ăsū yields no
suitable meaning. It is not the word, which they vowed to the Lord, at
the conclusion of the covenant, that they are to do now, but the work
which they had begun, viz., the building of the temple, they are now to
continue. It is perfectly arbitrary to supply the verb zikhrū, remember
(Ewald and Hengstenberg), and to understand the prophet as reminding
them of the word "fear not" ([Exo
20:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#017).md). That word, "fear not," with
which Moses, not God, infused courage into the people, who were alarmed
at the terrible phenomenon with which Jehovah came down upon Sinai, has
no such central significance as that Haggai could point to it without
further introduction, and say that Jehovah had concluded it with them on
their coming out of Egypt. The word which the Lord concluded with Israel
when He led it out of Egypt, can only be the promise which established
the covenant, to the fulfilment of which God bound Himself in relation
to the people, when He led them out of Egypt, namely, the word that He
would make Israel into His own property out of all nations ([Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md); cf. [Jer
7:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md), and [Jer
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#004).md). It would quite agree with this
to take 'ēth as the accusative of the norm, and also to connect it as a
preposition, if this could only be shown to be in accordance with the
rules of the language. But although the accusative in Hebrew is often
used, in the relation of free subordination, "to express more precisely
the relation of measure and size, space and time, mode and kind" (cf.
Ewald, 204-206), it is impossible to find any example of such an
accusative of norm as is here assumed, especially with 'ēth preceding
it. But if 'ēth were a preposition instead of אתּכם, we should have
עמּכם, inasmuch as the use of את־הדּבר, as a parallel to אתּכם, makes
the words clumsy and awkward. The thought which Haggai evidently wishes
to express requires that haddâbhâr should stand upon the same line with
rūchı̄, so that 'eth-haddâbhâr is actually the subject to ‛ōmedeth, and
'ēth is simply used to connect the new declaration with the preceding
one, and to place it in subjection to the one which follows, in the
sense of "as regards," quoad (Ewald, 277, d, pp. 683-4), in which case
the choice of the accusative in the present instance may either be
explained from a kind of attraction (as in the Latin, urbem quam statuo
vestra est), as Hitzig supposes, or from the blending together of two
constructions, as Koehler maintains; that is to say, Haggai intended to
write את־הדּבר ורוּחי העמדתּי, but was induced to alter the proposed
construction by the relative clause אשׁר כּרתּי וגו attaching itself to
הדּבר. Consequently ‛ōmedeth, as predicate, not only belongs to rūchı̄,
but also to haddâbhâr, in the sense of to have continuance and validity;
and according to a later usage of the language, עמד is used for קוּם, to
stand fast (compare [Isa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008.md) with
[Dan 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014).md). The word, that Israel is
the property of Jehovah, and Jehovah the God of Israel, still stands in
undiminished force; and not only so, but His Spirit also still works in
the midst of Israel. Rūăch, in parallelism with the word containing the
foundation of the covenant, is neither the spirit of prophecy (Chald.,
J. D. Mich.), nor the spirit which once filled Bezaleel and his
companions ([Exo 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001.md)., [Exo
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001)..md), enabling them to erect the
tabernacle in a proper manner, and one well-pleasing to God (Luc.,
Osiander, and Koehler). Both views are too narrow; rūăch is the divine
power which accompanies the word of promise and realizes it in a
creative manner, i.e., not merely "the virtue with which God will
establish their souls, that they may not be overcome by temptations"
(Calvin), but also the power of the Spirit working in the world, which
is able to remove all the external obstacles that present themselves to
the realization of the divine plan of salvation. This Spirit is still
working in Israel ("in the midst of you"); therefore they are not to
fear, even if the existing state of things does not correspond to human
expectations. The omnipotence of God can and will carry out His word,
and glorify His temple. This leads to the further promise in [Hag
2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md), which gives the reason for the
exhortation, "Fear ye not."

[Haggai 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hag 2:6</span></span>

"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Once more, in a short time it comes to
pass, I shake heaven and earth, and the sea, and the dry. [Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md). And I shake all nations, and the
costly of all nations will come, and I shall fill this house with glory,
saith Jehovah of hosts. [Hag 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008.md). Mine
is the silver, and mine the gold, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts.
[Hag 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009.md). The last glory of this house
will be greater than the first, saith Jehovah of hosts; and in this
place shall I give peace, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts." Different
explanations have been given of the definition of the time עוד אחת מעט
היא. Luther, Calvin, and others, down to Ewald and Hengstenberg, follow
the Chaldee and Vulgate, and either take achath in the sense of the
indefinite article or as a numeral, "adhuc unum modicum est," or "it is
yet a little thither." But if achath belonged to מעט as a numeral
adjective, either in the one sense or the other, according to the
arrangement adopted without exception in Hebrew (for 'echâd is not an
adjective in [Dan 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013).md), it could not
stand before מעט, but must be placed after it. The difference of gender
also precludes this combination, inasmuch as מעט is not construed as a
feminine in a single passage. We must therefore take מעט היא as forming
an independent clause of itself, i.e., as a more precise definition of
עוד אחת. But 'achath does not mean one = one time, or a short space of
time (Burk, Hitzig, Hofmann); nor does it acquire this meaning from the
clause מעט היא; nor can it be sustained by arbitrarily supplying עת.
'Achath is used as a neuter in the sense of "once," as in [Exo
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md); [Kg2
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#010.md); [Job
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#005) (cf. Ewald, 269, b.md). מעט היא , a
little, i.e., a short time is it, equivalent to "soon," in a short time
will it occur (cf. [Hos 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010.md); [Psa
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010).md). The lxx have rendered it
correctly ἔτι ἅπαξ, only they have left out מעט היא. The words, "once
more and indeed in a short time I shake," etc., have not the meaning
which Koehl. attaches to the correct rendering, viz., "Once, and only
once, will Jehovah henceforth shake heaven and earth," in which the עוד
standing at the head is both moved from its place, and taken, not in the
sense of repetition or of continuance from the present to the future,
but simply in the sense of an allusion to the future; in other words, it
is completely deprived of its true meaning. For עוד never loses its
primary sense of repetition or return any more than the German noch
(still or yet), so as to denote an occurrence in the future without any
allusion whatever to an event that has already happened or is in
existence still, not even in [Sa2
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#036.md) and [Ch2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006.md), with which Koehler endeavours to
support his views, without observing that in these passages עוד is used
in a very different sense, signifying in 2 Sam. praeterea, and in 2
Chronicles "moreover." In the verse before us it is used with reference
to the previous shaking of the world at the descent of Jehovah upon
Sinai to establish the covenant with Israel, to which the author of the
Epistle to the Hebrews has quite correctly taken it as referring ([Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026).md).

On the other hand, the objection offered by Koehler, that that shaking
did not extend beyond Sinai and the Sinaitic region, either according to
the historical account in [Exo
19:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md), or the poetical descriptions
in [Jdg 5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md), and [Psa
68:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md), is incorrect. For not only in
the two poetical descriptions referred to, but also in [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md), the manifestation of God upon
Sinai is represented as a trembling or shaking of the earth, whereby the
powers of the heaven were set in motion, and the heavens dropped down
water. The approaching shaking of the world will be much more violent;
it will affect the heaven and the earth in all their parts, the sea and
the solid ground, and also the nations. Then will the condition of the
whole of the visible creation and of the whole of the world of nations
be altered. The shaking of the heaven and the earth, i.e., of the
universe, is closely connected with the shaking of all nations. It is
not merely a figurative representation of symbol, however, of great
political agitations, but is quite as real as the shaking of the
nations, and not merely follows this and is caused by it, but also
precedes it and goes side by side with it, and only in its completion
does it form the conclusion to the whole of the shaking of the world.
For earthquakes and movements of the powers of heaven are heralds and
attendants of the coming of the Lord to judgment upon the whole earth,
through which not only the outward form of the existing world is
altered, but the present world itself will finally be reduced to ruins
([Isa 24:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018).md), and out of the world
thus perishing there are to be created a new heaven and a new earth
([Isa 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md); [Pe2
3:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010).md). But if the shaking of heaven
and earth effects a violent breaking up of the existing condition of the
universe, the shaking of all nations can only be one by which an end is
put to the existing condition of the world of nations, by means of great
political convulsions, and indeed, according to the explanation given in
[Hag 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#022.md), by the Lord's overthrowing
the throne of the kingdoms, annihilating their power, and destroying
their materials of war, so that one falls by the sword of the other,
that is to say, by wars and revolutions, by which the might of the
heathen world is broken and annihilated. It follows from this, that the
shaking of the heathen is not to be interpreted spiritually, either as
denoting "the marvellous, supernatural, and violent impulse by which God
impels His elect to betake themselves to the fold of Christ" (Calvin),
or "the movement to be produced among the nations through the preaching
of the gospel, with the co-operation of the Holy Spirit." The impulse
given by the preaching of the gospel and the operation of the Holy
Spirit to such souls among the nations as desire salvation, to seek
salvation from the living God, is only the fruit of the shaking of the
heathen world, and is not to be identified with it; for the coming of
the chemdth kol-haggōyı̄m is defined by וּבאוּ with the Vav consec. as a
consequence of the shaking of the nations.

By chemdath kol-haggōyı̄m most of the earlier orthodox commentators
understood the Messiah, after the example of the Vulgate, et veniet
desideratus gentibus, and Luther's "consolation of the Gentiles." But
the plural בּאוּ is hardly reconcilable with this. If, for example,
chemdath were the subject of the clause, as most of the commentators
assume, we should have the singular וּבא. For the rule, that in the case
of two nouns connected together in the construct state, the verb may
take the number of the governed noun, applies only to cases in which the
governed noun contains the principal idea, so that there is a
constructio ad sensum; whereas in the case before us the leading idea
would be formed, not by kol-haggōyı̄m, but by chemdath, desideratus, or
consolation, as a designation of the Messiah. Hence Cocc., Mark, and
others, have taken chemdath as the accusative of direction: "that they
(sc., the nations) may come to the desire of all nations - namely, to
Christ." It cannot be objected to this, as Koehler supposes, that to
designate Christ as the desire of all nations would be either erroneous,
inasmuch as in the time of Haggai only a very few heathen knew anything
about Israel's hope of a Messiah, or perfectly unintelligible to his
contemporaries, especially if the meaning of the epithet were that the
heathen would love Him at some future time. For the latter remark is at
once proved to be untenable by the prophecy of Isaiah and Micah, to the
effect that all nations will flow to the mountain of God's house. After
such prophecies, the thought that the heathen would one day love the
Messiah could not be unintelligible to the contemporaries of our
prophet; and there is not the smallest proof of the first assertion. In
the year 520 b.c., when the ten tribes had already been scattered among
the heathen for 200 years, and the Judaeans for more than seventy years,
the Messianic hope of Israel could not be any longer altogether unknown
to the nations. It may with much better reason be objected to the former
view, that if chemdh were the accusative of direction, we should expect
the preposition 'el in order to avoid ambiguity. But what is decisive
against it is the fact, that the coming of the nations to the Messiah
would be a thought completely foreign to the context, since the Messiah
cannot without further explanation be identified with the temple.
Chemdâh signifies desire ([Ch2 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020).md),
then the object of desire, that in which a man finds pleasure and joy,
valuables. Chemdath haggōyı̄m is therefore the valuable possessions of
the heathen, or according to [Hag 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008.md)
their gold and silver, or their treasures and riches; not the best among
the heathen (Theod. Mops., Capp., Hitzig). Hence chemdath cannot be the
accusative of direction, since the thought that the heathen come to the
treasures of all the heathen furnishes no suitable meaning; but it is
the nominative or subject, and is construed as a collective word with
the verb in the plural. The thought is the following: That shaking will
be followed by this result, or produce this effect, that all the
valuable possessions of the heathen will come to fill the temple with
glory. Compare [Isa 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md), where the
words, "the possessions (riches) of the heathen (chēl gōyı̄m) will come
to thee," i.e., be brought to Jerusalem, express the same thought; also
[Isa 60:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011.md). With the valuable
possessions of the heathen the Lord will glorify His temple, or fill it
with kâbhōd. Kâbhōd without the article denotes the glory which the
temple will receive through the possessions of the heathen presented
there. The majority of the commentators have referred these words to the
glorification of the temple through the appearance of Jesus in it, and
appeal to [Exo 40:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md); [Kg1
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md); [Ch2
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013.md), according to which passages
the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle and Solomon's temple at their
dedication, so that they identify kâbhōd (glory) with kebhōd Yehōvâh
(glory of Jehovah) without reserve. But this is impracticable, although
the expression kâbhōd is chosen by the prophet with a reference to those
events, and the fulfilment of our prophecy did commence with the fact
that Jehovah came to His temple in the person of Jesus Christ ([Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md).

[Haggai 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hag 2:8</span></span>

Jehovah can fill this house with glory, because the silver and gold
which the heathen nations possess belong to Him. By shaking all kingdoms
He can induce the nations to present their treasures to Him as gifts for
the glorification of His house. Thus (the promise closes with this in
[Hag 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009).md), the later glory of this
house will be greater than the former was. Hâachărōn might be regarded
as belonging to habbayith hazzeh, in the sense of "the glory of this
latter house;" and the majority of the commentators have taken it so,
after the Itala, Vulgate, and Peschito. But it is quite as admissible to
connect it with kâbhōd, in the sense of "the later glory of this house,"
inasmuch as when one substantive is determined by another which is
connected with it in the construct state, the adjective belonging to the
nomen regens follows with the article (cf. [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md); [Ch1
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#027); and Ewald, 289, a.md). This is the
rendering adopted by Michaelis, Maurer, Hitzig, and others, after the
lxx. According to the first construction, the distinction would be drawn
between a former and a later house; according to the second, simply
between the earlier and later glory of the same house; and the passage
would be based upon the idea, that through all ages there was only one
house of Jehovah in Jerusalem existing under different forms. [Hag
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md) is decisive in favour of the
second view, for there an earlier glory is attributed to this house, and
contrasted with its present miserable condition. The first or former
glory is that of Solomon's temple, the later or last that of
Zerubbabel's. The difference of opinion as to the true rendering of the
words has no material influence upon the matter itself; except that, if
the latter view be adopted, the question so often discussed by earlier
writers - namely, whether by the second temple we are to understand the
temple of Zerubbabel or the temple as altered by Herod, which many have
erroneously taken to be the third - falls to the ground as perfectly
unmeaning. The final glory of the temple will also be a lasting one.
This is implied in the closing words of the promise: "And in this place
will I give peace." "This place" is not the temple, but Jerusalem, as
the place where the temple is built; and the "peace" is not spiritual
peace, but external peace, which does indeed in its perfect form include
spiritual peace as well. This is perfectly evident from the parallel
passages, [Mic 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004.md), [Joe
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017.md), and [Isa
60:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#018.md).

If we also take up the question as to the fulfilment of this prophecy,
we must keep the two features quite distinct - (a) the shaking of heaven
and earth and all nations; (b) the consequence of this shaking, the
coming of the heathen with their possessions to the glorification of the
temple - although they both stand in close connection. The earlier
commentators were no doubt generally right, when they sought for the
fulfilment in the establishment of the new covenant through Christ; they
simply erred in referring the predicted shaking of the nations and the
promised glorification of the temple in too one-sided and exclusive a
manner to the coming of Christ in the flesh, to His teaching in the
temple, and to the establishment of the kingdom of heaven through the
preaching of the gospel. They were thereby compelled, on the one hand,
to force upon the prophecy a meaning irreconcilable with the words
themselves, and, on the other hand, to seek for its fulfilment in
historical particulars to some extent of very subordinate importance.
Even the predicted nearness of the time ("it is a little while") does
not suit the exclusive reference to the establishment of the new
covenant, or the founding of the Christian church. The period of 520
years, which elapsed before the birth of Christ, cannot be called a
little or short time, as Calovius supposes, "in comparison with the time
that had passed since either the promulgation of the law or the
promulgation of the protevangelium," inasmuch as five hundred are not
מעט in relation to fifteen hundred, and the proposal to go back to the
protevangelium is evidently merely a loophole of perplexity. Nor can מעט
היא be explained on the hypothesis that the measure of time here is not
a human one, but the divine measure, according to which a thousand years
are equal to one day. "For whoever speaks to men, must speak of things
according to a human method of thinking; or if he do not, he must make
it clear that this is the case. The prophet lays stress upon the brevity
of the time, for the purpose of comforting. And only what is short in
the eyes of men is fitted for this" (Hengstenberg). The shaking of the
heathen world did not first begin with the birth of Christ, but
commenced shortly after the time of Haggai. It is true that under Darius
Hystaspes the Persian empire was still standing at the summit of its
power; but its shaking began under his successor Xerxes, and came very
plainly to light in his war against Greece. "Even then there were
forebodings that the time of this empire would soon be accomplished, and
the rapid conquests of Alexander gave fulfilment to this foreboding. And
even his power, which seemed destined to last for ever, very speedily
succumbed to the lot of all temporal things. Inde (says Livy) morte
Alexandri distractum in multa regna, dum ad se quisque opes rapiunt
lacerantes viribus, a summo culmine fortunae ad ultimum finem centum
quinquaginta annos stetit. The two most powerful kingdoms that grew out
of the monarchy of Alexander, viz., the Syrian and Egyptian, destroyed
one another. The Romans now attained to the government of the world; but
at the very time when they appeared to be at the summit of their
greatness, their shaking had very considerably advanced" (Hengstenberg).
The circumstance that the prophet mentions the shaking of heaven and
earth before the shaking of all the heathen, cannot furnish any valid
ground for objecting to these allusions; nor can it force us to the
conclusion that the words are only to be understood as denoting "great
political shakings, whereby the power of the heathen would be broken,
their pride humbled, and so the susceptibility for salvation be evoked
among them." For even if such events do shake the world, and are
poetically represented as earthquakes, even if they were regarded by the
nations as heralds of the approaching destruction of the world, because
the impression they produced upon the mind was as if heaven and earth
were falling to pieces; all this does not satisfy the words, which do
not express the subjective emotion, but announce real facts. The shaking
of heaven and earth, of the sea and of the dry land, is indeed partially
effected by violent earthquakes and wonderful signs in the sky, and was
typified by such judgments as the flood; but it is only fully
accomplished at the breaking up of the present condition of the world in
the destruction of this heaven and this earth.

The prophet mentions at the very outset the utmost and the last that God
will do, to clear away all existing hindrances to the completion of His
kingdom in glory, and then passes on to the shakings of the world of
nations which prepare the way for and lead on to this result, just as
Micah in [Mic 4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md) comes back from
the most remote future to the less remote, and then to the immediate
future. For the shakings of the heathen, by which their power will be
broken and the dissolution of heathenism and of the ungodly power of the
world will be effected, do not reach their end with the coming of Christ
and the establishment of the Christian church: but just as the kingdom
of the world maintains its standing by the side of the kingdom of heaven
established by Christ upon the earth, until the return of our Lord to
judgment; so does the shaking of the heathen and of the kingdoms of the
nations continue till every power which rises against the Almighty God
and His Christ is broken, and the world which has been thrown into
confusion by the sin of men, and is made subject to corruptibility on
their account, shall perish, and the new heaven and new earth wherein
dwelleth righteousness, for which we are looking, shall be established
([Pe2 3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012).md).

(Note: Aug. Koehler also assumes that the ultimate fulfilment of our
prophecy will not take place till the second coming of Christ, although
he is of opinion that, generally speaking, it has not been fulfilled in
the manner originally intended. Starting, for example, with the fact
that the fulfilment of the events predicted by Haggai and the coming of
the day of Jehovah are one and the same, and that according to [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md); [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md) the day of Jehovah was to be
preceded by the coming of a messenger, to prepare the way for Jehovah to
come to His temple, Koehler assumes that the fulfilment of these events
ought to have taken place with the coming of Jesus of Nazareth, to
establish the new covenant as the Messiah. But, inasmuch as Israel was
still without such moral preparation as would allow of the coming of
Jehovah being a blessing to it, and rejected its Messiah, there occurred
an event in connection with this rejection of Jesus on the part of
Israel, which not only put a stop to the fulfilment of the prophecies,
the realization of which had commenced with the coming of Jesus, but
introduced a partial modification. "The new covenant," he says, "which
was established by the Lord in His incarnation, was not at first a
blessing to Israel, but to the heathen world. Instead of setting up His
kingdom over the earth, with Zion as the centre, the Lord returned to
heaven, and there took possession of the throne above all thrones. But
Israel was smitten with the ban, and scattered among the heathen
nations. The sacred places which were to be glorified by the valuables
of all the heathen, had become unclean through Israel's sin, and were
given up to destruction in consequence." In his opinion there is a
coming of Jehovah still in the future. Jesus will return from heaven
again, but not till Israel shall have been converted to the Messiah it
rejected. Then will the prophecies of Haggai that remained unfulfilled
at the first coming of Jesus be accomplished, but in the only way that
is still possible, since the former holy places of Israel have been
destroyed, and the heathen world has already participated in the new
covenant, and has at any rate in part already become the people of God.
Consequently the events predicted by Haggai ([Hag
2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006).md) have not been fulfilled; for
the valuable possessions of all the heathen have not been applied to the
glorification of the sanctuary of Jehovah built by Zerubbabel, and there
has not been a place of peace created there in the midst of the
judgments that were to fall upon the heathen world. But the fault of
this rests purely upon Israel. And so also it is in the impenitence of
Israel that we have to look for the reason why the shaking of the heaven
and the earth, and all the heathen, which Haggai announced as מעט היא,
has been postponed for more than 500 years. This is Koehler's view. But
if there had really been any foundation in the Scriptures for this view,
and the predictions of our prophet had not been fulfilled in the manner
intended, the fault would not rest entirely in the impenitence of
Israel, but would fall in part upon God Himself, for having sent His
Son, not at the proper time, or when the time was accomplished, but too
early, namely, before Israel was in that moral condition which would
allow of the coming of the Messiah to become a blessing to it, whether
God was mistaken as to the proper time for sending His Son, or in His
judgment as to the moral condition of Israel. If Koehler had put this
clearly to his own mind, he would certainly have hesitated before he
built up a view on the basis of an erroneous idea of the day of the Lord
which necessarily leads to the denial not only of the divine prescience
or the πρόγνωσιη τοῦ Θεοῦ, but also of the supernatural character of the
old Testament prophecy.)

But if the shaking of the heathen commenced before the coming of Christ
in the flesh, and will continue till His second coming in glory, we must
not restrict the fulfilment of the predicted moral consequences of this
shaking - namely, that the heathen come and consecrate their possessions
to the Lord for the glorification of His house, to the conversion of the
heathen to Christ, and their entrance into the Christian church - but
must also regard the desire for the living God, awakened by the decay of
heathendom and its religions, which was manifested in the adoption of
Judaism by the more pious heathen, as a prelude to the fulfilment which
commenced with the spread of the gospel among the Gentiles, and must
include not only the presentation of dedicatory offerings τῶν ἀλλυφύλων
and of gifts ἔξωθεν ἐθνῶν, with which the temple was adorned according
to Josephus, de Bell. Jud. ii. 17, 3, but also the presents of king
Artaxerxes and his counsellors, which Ezra received on his return to
Jerusalem to carry with him for the temple ([Ezr
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#015)..md).

(Note: We must not, however, include the additions to Zerubbabel's
temple undertaken by Herod the Great for the sake of beautifying it,
because, although Herod was a Gentile by descent, the work was not
undertaken from any love to the Lord, but (as Calvin; and Hengstenberg,
Christol. iii. pp. 289-90, have already observed) with the intention of
securing the fulfilment of Haggai's prophecy, in order to prevent the
coming of the kingdom of God, his fear of which was that it would put an
end to his earthly sway. His intention is obvious enough from the
address communicated by Josephus (Ant. xv. 11, 1), through which Herod
endeavoured to win over the people to his plan. After telling them that
the temple built after the return of the fathers from exile was still
sixty cubits lower than that of Solomon, which he proposed to add, he
proceeded thus: "But since I am now by God's will your governor, and I
have had peace a long time, and have gained great riches and large
revenues, and, what is the principal thing of all, I am at amity with
and well regarded by the Romans, who, if I may so say, are the rulers of
the whole world," etc. The allusion to our prophecy, as Hengstenberg
says, is unmistakeable here. He tries to prove that all the conditions
which it lays down for the glorifying of the temple have now been
realized. "All nations," by whom the building of the temple is to be
promoted, are equivalent in his esteem to "the Romans, who are the
rulers of the whole world." He whom God has called to the government has
gold and silver enough. And the words "in this place will I give peace"
are now fulfilled. The manner in which he strained every nerve to fulfil
the words "the glory will be greater," is evident from 3, where it is
stated that "he laid out larger sums of money upon them than had been
done before him, till it seemed that no one else had so greatly adorned
the temple as he had done.")

Yea, even the command of king Darius Hystaspes to his vicegerent, which
no doubt reached Jerusalem after our prophecy had been uttered, not only
to allow the work at this house of God to continue, but also to deliver
to the elders of Judah what was required for the building as well as for
the requirements of the daily sacrificial worship out of the moneys
raised by taxation on this side the river ([Ezr
6:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#006).md), may at any rate be regarded
as a pledge of the certain fulfilment of the divine promise uttered by
Haggai.

But whilst the honour paid to the temple of Zerubbabel on the part of
the heathen and heathen princes by the presentation of sacrifices and
dedicatory offerings must not be overlooked, as preludes to the promised
filling of this house with the riches of the Gentiles, we must not look
to this outward glorification of the temple at Jerusalem for the true
fulfilment of our prophecy, even if it had exceeded Solomon's temple in
glory. This first took place with the coming of Christ, and that not in
the fact that Jesus visited the temple and taught in it, and as the
incarnate Logos, in whom the "glory of Jehovah" that filled the temple
of Solomon dwelt in its truest essence as δόξα ὡς μονογενοῦς παρὰ
πατρός, glorified the temple of stone with His presence, but by the fact
that Christ raised up the true temple of God not built with human hand
([Joh 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019).md), i.e., that He exalted the
kingdom of God shadowed forth in the temple at Jerusalem to its true
essence. We must draw a distinction between the substance and form, the
kernel and the shell, of the prophecy. The temple, as the place where
the Lord dwelt in the midst of Israel in a visible symbol of His
gracious presence, was the seat and concentration of the kingdom of God,
which had its visible embodiment in the temple so long as the old
covenant lasted. In this respect the rebuilding of the temple that had
been destroyed was a sign and pledge of the restoration of the kingdom
of God, which had been broken up through the banishment of Israel among
the heathen, and the attitude of those who returned from exile towards
the building of the temple was a sign of their internal attitude towards
the Lord and His kingdom. If, then, the old men who had seen the temple
in its former glory wept aloud at the laying of the foundation of the
new building, because in comparison with the former it was as nothing in
their eyes, this mourning was occasioned not so much by the fact that
the new temple would not be so beautiful and majestic a building as that
of Solomon had been, as by the fact that the poverty of the new building
set before their eyes the wretched condition of the kingdom of God. This
true or deeper ground for their mourning, which might very well give
rise to the question whether the Lord would restore His former gracious
relation to Israel, or at any rate would restore it now, is met by the
divine promise published by Haggai to the people, which attaches itself
in form to the existing circumstances, and accordingly promises for the
future a glorification of the temple which will outshine the glory of
the former one. If we look at the thought itself which is expressed in
this form, it is the following: The Lord will one day exalt His kingdom,
which is so deeply degraded and despised, to a glory which will far
surpass the glory of the kingdom of God at the time of Solomon, and that
by the fact that all the heathen nations will dedicate their possessions
to it. This glorification of the house of God commenced with the
introduction of the kingdom of heaven, which Jesus Christ preached, and
of which He laid the foundation in His church. And whilst the
stone-temple at Jerusalem built by Zerubbabel and splendidly finished by
Herod fell into ruins, because the Jews had rejected their Saviour, and
crucified Him, this has been carried on through the spread of the
kingdom of God among the nations of the earth, and will be completed at
the end of the course of this world; not, however, by the erection of a
new and much more glorious temple in Jerusalem, but in the founding of
the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God upon the new earth,
after the overthrow of all the powers of the world that are hostile to
God. This holy city will have the glory of God (ἡ δόξα τοῦ Θεοῦ = כּבוד
יהוה), but no temple; because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the
temple of it. Into this holy city of God will the kings of the earth
bring their glory and honour, and the heathen who are saved will walk
therein ([Rev 21:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010.md), [Rev
21:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022).md). Thus the promise covers the
entire development of the kingdom of God to the end of days.

This was the sense in which the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews
([Heb 12:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026).md) understood our
prophecy. In order, namely, to give emphasis to his admonition, not to
expose themselves to still severer punishment than fell upon those who
hardened themselves under the Old Testament against the incomplete
revelation of God, by rejecting the far more perfect revelation of God
in Christ, he quotes our prophecy, and shows from it ([Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026).md), that at the founding of the
old covenant only a comparatively small shaking of the earth took place;
whereas for the times of the new covenant there had been predicted a
shaking not only of the earth, but also of the heaven, which indicated
that what was moveable was to be altered, as made for that purpose, that
the immoveable might remain. The author of this epistle consequently
brings out the fundamental thought of our prophecy, in which its
fulfilment culminates, viz., that everything earthly must be shaken and
altered, that the immoveable, i.e., the βασιλεία ἀσάλευτος, may remain,
or in other words, that the whole of the earthly creation must perish,
in order that the kingdom of God may be shown to be immoveably
permanent. He does not, however, thereby represent the predicted shaking
of heaven and earth "as still in the future," as Koehler supposes; but,
as his words in [Heb 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md) (cf. [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md), "Wherefore we, receiving a
kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace," clearly show, he
takes it as having already commenced, and looks upon the whole period,
from the coming of Christ in the flesh till His coming again in glory,
as one continuum.

[Haggai 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hag 2:10</span></span>

Return of the Blessings of Nature. - [Hag
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md). On the 24th day of the ninth
month of the same year, that is to say, exactly three months after the
congregation had resumed the building of the temple (cf. [Hag
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015).md), and about two months after the
second prophecy ([Hag 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001).md), a new word
of the Lord was uttered through Haggai to the people. It was now time,
since the despondency which had laid hold of the people a few weeks
after the recommencement of the building had been dispelled by the
consolatory promises in vv. 6-9, and the work was vigorously pursued, to
confirm the people in the fidelity which they had manifested, by
bestowing upon them the blessing which had been withdrawn. To this end
Haggai received the commission to make it perfectly clear to the people,
that the curse which had rested upon them since the building of the
temple had been neglected, had been nothing but a punishment for their
indolence in not pushing forward the work of the Lord, and that from
that time forth the Lord would bestow His blessing upon them again. The
ninth month (Khislēv) corresponds very nearly to the period between the
middle of November and the middle of December, when the sowing of the
winter corps, that commenced after the feast of tabernacles, was
finished, and the autumnal rain (early rain) had set in, so that in the
abundant fall of this rain they might discern a trace of the divine
blessing.

[Haggai 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hag 2:11</span></span>

The word of God was as follows: [Hag
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#011.md). "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,
Ask now the priests for instruction, saying, [Hag
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012.md). Behold, one carries holy flesh
in the lappet of his garment, and touches with his lappet the bread, and
that which is boiled, the wine, and the oil, and any kind of food: does
it then become holy? And the priests answered and said, No. [Hag
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#013.md). And Haggai said, If one who is
unclean on account of a corpse touches all this, does it become unclean?
And the priests answered and said, It does become unclean. [Hag
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#014.md). Then Haggai answered and said,
So is this people, and so this nation before my face, is the saying of
Jehovah; and so is all the work of their hands, and what they offer to
me there: it is unclean." In order to impress most earnestly upon the
hearts of the people the fact that it was through their sin that they
brought upon themselves the failure of crops that had hitherto
prevailed, viz., as a punishment from God, the prophet proposes two
questions concerning holy and clean for the priests to answer, in order
that he may make an application of the answer they give to the moral
condition of the nation. Tōrâh in [Hag
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#011.md), without the article, is used in
its primary signification of instruction, and is governed by שׁעל,
accus. rei: to ask a person anything, for to ask or solicit anything
from him. The first question has reference to the communication of the
holiness of holy objects to other objects brought into contact with
them: whether, if a person carried holy flesh in the lappet of his
garment,

(Note: Luther: "in the geren of his dress." The gehren, or gehre, middle
high German gre, old high German kro (English goar), is a triangular
piece, forming the gusset of a dress or shirt, then that portion of the
dress in which it is inserted, viz., below the waist, probably derived
from the Gothic gis, and the conjectural root geisan = to thrust or
strike (Weigand, Germ. Dict.).)

and touched any food with the lappet, it would become holy in
consequence. Hēn, behold, pointing to an action as possible, has almost
the force of a conditional particle, "if," as in [Isa
54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015.md); [Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001) (cf. Ewald, 103, g.md). "Holy flesh"
is flesh of animals slain as sacrifices, as in [Jer
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015.md). Nâzı̄d, that which is boiled,
boiled food ([Gen 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#029.md); [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038)..md). The priests answer the
question laid before them quite correctly with "No;" for, according to
[Lev 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#020.md), the lappet of the dress
itself was made holy by the holy flesh, but it could not communicate
this holiness any further. The second question ([Hag
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#013).md) has reference to the spread of
legal defilement. טמא נפשׁ is not one who is unclean in his soul; but,
as [Lev 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#004.md) shows, it is synonymous
with טמא לנפשׁ in [Num 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#002.md); [Num
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#010.md), "defiled on a soul;" and this is
a contraction of טמא לנפר אדם, or טמא לנפשׁ מת, in [Num
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006), "defiled on (through.md) the soul
of a dead man" ([Num 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#006.md); [Lev
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#011.md) : see at [Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028).md), hence one who has been defiled
through touching a dead body. This uncleanness was one of the strongest
kinds; it lasted seven days, and could only be removed by his being
twice purified with sprinkling water, prepared from the ashes of the red
cow (see at Numbers 19). This question the priests also answered
correctly. According to [Num 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#022.md), he
who was defiled by touching a dead body made everything unclean that he
touched. The prophet now applies these provisions of the law to the
ethical relation in which the people stood to Jehovah. "So is this
people before me, saith Jehovah." הגּוי is quite synonymous with העם, as
in [Zep 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009.md), without any subordinate
meaning of a contemptuous kind, which could at the most be contained in
hazzeh (this), but in that case would apply to hâ‛âm just as well. Kēn,
ita, refers to the substance of the two legal questions in [Hag
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012.md) and [Hag
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#013.md). The nation, in its attitude
towards the Lord, resembles, on the one hand, a man who carries holy
flesh in the lappet of his garment, and on the other hand, a man who has
become unclean through touching a corpse. "Israel also possesses a
sanctuary in the midst of its land, - namely, the place which Jehovah
has chosen for His own abode, and favoured with many glorious promises.
But just as no kind of food, neither bread nor vegetables, neither wine
nor oil, is sanctified by the fact that a man touches it with his
sanctified garment, so will all this not be rendered holy by the fact
that it is planted in the soil of the land which surrounds and encloses
the sanctuary of Jehovah. For though the land itself becomes a holy land
in consequence, it cannot spread this holiness any further, nor
communicate it to what grows upon it. All that Israel raises on its holy
land, whether corn, wine, or oil, remains unholy or common. No special
blessing rests upon the fruits of this land, on account of the holiness
of the land itself, so as of necessity to produce fruitfulness as its
result; nor, on the other hand, does it in itself communicate any curse.
But if, as experience shows, a curse is resting notwithstanding upon the
productions of this land, it arises from the fact that they are unclean
because Israel has planted them. For Israel it utterly unclean on
account of its neglect of the house of Jehovah, like a man who has
become unclean through touching a corpse. Everything that Israel takes
hold of, or upon which it lays its hand, everything that it plants and
cultivates, is from the very first affected with the curse of
uncleanness; and consequently even the sacrifices which it offers there
upon the altar of Jehovah are unclean" (Koehler). Shâm, there, i.e.,
upon the altar built immediately after the return from Babylon ([Ezr
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003).md).

[Haggai 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hag 2:15</span></span>

The prophet explains these words in [Hag
2:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md) by representing the failure of
the crops, and the curse that has hitherto prevailed, as a punishment
from God for having been wanting in faithfulness to the Lord ([Hag
2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015).md), and promises that from that
time forward the blessing of God shall rest upon them again ([Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md), [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019).md). [Hag
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md). "And now, direct your heart from
this day and onward, before stone was laid to stone at the temple of
Jehovah. [Hag 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016.md). Before this was,
did one come to the heap of sheaves of twenty-(in measure), there were
ten: did he come to the vat to draw fifty buckets, there were twenty.
[Hag 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#017.md). I have smitten you with
blasting, and with mildew, and with hail, all the work of your hands;
and not one of you (turned) to me, is the saying of Jehovah." The object
to which they are to direct their heart, i.e., to give heed, is not to
be supplied from [Hag 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#005.md), [Hag
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#007), "to your ways" (Ros. and others.md),
but is contained substantially in [Hag
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016.md) and [Hag
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#017.md), and is first of all indicated in
the words "from this day," etc. They are to notice what has taken place
from this day onwards. נמעלה, lit., upwards, then further on. Here it is
used not in the sense of forwards into the future, but, as the
explanatory clause which follows (from before, etc.) clearly shows, in
that of backwards into the past. Mitterem, literally "from the not yet
of the laying ... onwards," i.e., onwards from the time when stone was
laid upon stone at the temple; in other words, when the building of the
temple was resumed, backwards into the past; in reality, therefore, the
time before the resuming of the building of the temple: for min and
mitterem cannot be taken in any other sense than in the parallel מיּום
which precedes it, and מהיותם which follows in [Hag
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016.md). The objection which Koehler
raises to this cannot be sustained. מהיותם, from their existence
(backwards). Most of the modern commentators take the suffix as
referring to a noun, yâmı̄m (days), to be supplied from [Hag
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md); but it appears much simpler to
take it as a neuter, as Mark and others do, in the sense of "before
these things were or were done, viz., this day, and this work of laying
stone upon stone," etc. The meaning is not doubtful, viz., looking
backwards from the time when the building of the temple was resumed, in
other words, before the point of time. בּא commences a new sentence, in
which facts that they had experienced are cited, the verb בּא being used
conditionally, and forming the protasis, the apodosis to which is given
in והיתה. If one came to a heap of sheaves of twenty measures (se'âh is
probably to be supplied: lxx σάτα), they became ten. A heap of sheaves
(‛ărēmâh as in [Rut 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#007).md), from which
they promised themselves twenty measures, yielded, when threshed, no
more than ten, i.e., only the half of what they expected. They
experienced just the same at the pressing of the grapes. Instead of
fifty buckets, which they expected, they obtained only twenty. Yeqebh
was the vat into which the juice flowed when pressed out of the grapes.
Châsaph, lit., to lay bare, here to draw out, as in [Isa
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014.md); and pūrâh, in [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md), the pressing-trough, here a
measure, probably the measure which was generally obtained from one
filling of the wine-press with grapes (lxx μετρητής). [Hag
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#017.md) gives the reason why so small a
result was yielded by the threshing-floor and wine-press. Jehovah smote
you with blasting and mildew. These words are a reminiscence of [Amo
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009.md), to which passage the last words
of the verse also refer. To the disease of the corn there is also added
the hail which smote the vines, as in [Psa
78:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#047.md). 'Eth kol-ma‛ăsēh, all the
labour of the hands, i.e., all that they had cultivated with great toil,
is a second accusative, "which mentions the portion smitten" (Hitzig).
The perfectly unusual construction אין־אתכם אלי does not stand for אין
בּכם א, non fuit in vobis qui (Vulg.), nor is אתכם used for אתּכם, "with
you;" but אין־אתכם either stands for אינכם, the suffix which was taken
as a verbal suffix used as an accusative being resolved into the
accusative (cf. Ewald, 262, d); or it is the accusative used in the
place of the subject, that is to say, את is to be taken in the sense of
"as regards," quoad (Ewald, 277, p. 683): "as far as you are concerned,
there was not (one) turning himself to me." אלי, to me, sc. turning
himself or being converted; though there is no necessity to supply
שׁבים, as the idea is implied in the word אל, as in [Hos
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003.md) and [Kg2
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#011.md).

[Haggai 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hag 2:18</span></span>

After this appeal to lay to heart the past time during which the
blessing had been withheld, Haggai called upon the people in [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md) and [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md) to fix their eyes upon the time
which was commencing with that very day. [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md). "Direct your heart, then, from
this day and onward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth
(month); namely, from the day when the foundation of the temple of
Jehovah was laid, direct your heart. [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md). Is the seed still in the
granary? and even to the vine, and pomegranate, and olive-tree, it has
not borne: from this day forward will I bless." The twenty-fourth day of
the ninth month was the day on which Haggai uttered this word of God
([Hag 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010).md). Hence ומעלה in [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md) is to be understood as denoting
the direction towards the future (Itala, Vulg., and many comm.). This is
evident partly from the fact, that only in that case can the repetition
of שׂימוּ לבבכם in [Hag 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018) (end.md),
and the careful announcement of the point of time (from the
twenty-fourth day, etc.), be simply and naturally explained, and partly
from the fact that min hayyōm hazzeh (from this day) is not explained
here, as in [Hag 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md), by a clause
pointing back to the past (like mitterem sūm in [Hag
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015).md), but simply by a precise notice
of the day referred to, and that in the last clause of [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md) this day is clearly described as
the commencement of a new era. For there can be no doubt whatever that
in min hayyōm hazzeh in [Hag 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md) the
terminus a quo mentioned in [Hag 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md)
is resumed. But the time mentioned in [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md), "from the day that the
foundation of the temple was laid," etc., and also the contents of the
first two clauses of [Hag 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md), to the
effect that there was no more seed in the granary, and that the vine,
etc., had not borne, do not appear to harmonize with this. To remove the
first of these difficulties, Ros., Maurer, Ewald, and others have taken
למן־היּום אשׁר־יסּד as the terminus ad quem, and connected it with the
foregoing terminus a quo: "observe the time," which reaches back from
the present day, the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, to the day when
the foundation of the temple was laid in the reign of Cyrus ([Ezr
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010).md). They have thus taken למן in the
sense of ועד. But it is now generally admitted that this is at variance
with the usage of the language; even Ewald and Gesenius acknowledge this
(see Ew., Lehrbuch, 218, b, and Ges. Thes. p. 807). למן is never
equivalent to עד or ועד, but invariably forms the antithesis to it
(compare, for example, [Jdg 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#030.md);
[Sa2 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006.md), and [Mic
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012).md). Now, since lemin hayyōm cannot
mean "to the time commencing with the laying of the foundation of the
temple," but must mean "from the day when the foundation of the temple
was laid," Hitzig and Koehler have taken למן היּום וגו as an explanatory
apposition to מיּום עשׂרים וגו, and assume that through this apposition
the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius,
is expressly designated as the day on which the foundation was laid for
the temple of Jehovah. But this assumption is not only in direct
contradiction to [Ezr 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md), where it
is stated that the foundation of the temple was laid in the reign of
Cyrus, in the second year after the return from Babylon, but also makes
the prophet Haggai contradict himself in a manner which can only be
poorly concealed by any quid pro quo at variance with the language,
viz., (a) by identifying the words of [Hag
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md), "when stone was laid to stone at
the temple of Jehovah," which, according to their simple meaning,
express the carrying on or continuance of the building, with the laying
of the foundation-stone, secondly (b), by understanding the statement,
"they did work at the house of Jehovah on the twenty-fourth day of the
sixth month" ([Hag 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014).md), not
according to its natural meaning as relating to their building upon the
foundation already laid, but as signifying the removal of the rubbish
and the procuring of wood and stone, that is to say, as referring to the
preparations for building; and lastly (c), by explaining אשׁר יסּד וגו
in [Hag 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md) as signifying the laying
of a fresh or second foundation. These assumptions are so forced, that
if there were not a simpler and easier way of removing the difficulty
raised, we would rather assume that there had been a corruption of the
text.

But the thing is not so desperate as this. In the first place, we must
pronounce the opinion that למן היּום וגו is an explanatory apposition to
מיּום עשׂרים וגו an unfounded one. The position of the athnach in ומעלה
furnishes no tenable proof of this. Nor can the assumption that lemin is
synonymous with min be sustained. In support of the statement, "that
lemin only differs from min in the greater emphasis with which it is
spoken," Ewald (218, b), has merely adduced this passage, [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md), which is supposed to exhibit
this with especial clearness, but in which, as we have just shown, such
an assumption yields no appropriate meaning. למן followed by עד or ועד
does indeed occur in several instances in such a connection, that it
appears to be used instead of the simple min. But if we look more
closely at the passages (e.g., [Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md); [Jdg
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#030.md); [Sa2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006).md), the ל is never superfluous; and
lemin is simply used in cases where the definition so introduced is not
closely connected with what goes before, but is meant to be brought out
as an independent assertion or additional definition, so that in all
such cases the ל "has the peculiar force of a brief allusion to
something not to be overlooked, a retrospective glance at the separate
parts, or a rapid summary of the whole, like our 'with regard to,' 'as
regards' (Lat. quoad);" and it only fails to correspond entirely to
this, "from the fact that ל is only expressible in the softest manner,
and indeed in our language can hardly be expressed in words at all,
though it quite perceptibly yields this sense" (Ewald, 310). למקצת is
also used in this sense in [Dan 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#018.md)
instead of מקצת ([Hag 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015).md), whilst in
other cases (e.g., in למרחוק in [Sa2
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#019).md) it indicates the direction to a
place or towards an object (Ewald, 218, b).

(Note: Koehler's objection to this explanation of lemērâchōq, viz., that
with the verb dibber, the object concerning which a person is spoken to,
is never introduced with the preposition ל, is groundless. "With verbs
of speaking ל yields the same double meaning as אל, according to the
context," i.e., it can denote the person spoken to, and the person or
thing to which the speaking refers, or about which a person is speaking
(cf. [Gen 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007.md); [Num
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023.md); [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md); [Mic
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md); [Jer
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md); [Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md); [Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md); [Psa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008); and Ewald, 217, c)..md)

In the verse before us, the ל before מן corresponds exactly to the
German anlangend, betreffend, concerning, as to, sc. the time, from the
day when the foundation of the temple was laid, and is used to give
prominence to this assertion, and by the prominence given to it to
preclude any close connection between the definition of the time so
introduced and what goes before, and to point to the fact that the
following definition contains a fresh subject of discourse. The
expression שׂימוּ לבבכם, which closes the sentence commencing with למן
היּום, and which would be somewhat tautological and superfluous, if the
day of the laying of the foundation of the temple coincided with the
twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, also points to this.

What space of time it is to which Haggai gives prominence in these
words, as one which they are to lay to heart, is shown in [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md), "Is the seed still in the
granary?" etc. That this question is not to be taken in the sense of a
summons to proceed now with good heart to sow the summer crops, which
were not sown till January, and therefore were still in the granary, as
Hitzig supposes, has been pointed out by Koehler, who also correctly
observes that the prophet first of all reminds his hearers of the
mournful state of things in the past (not "in the present," as he says),
that they may thoroughly appreciate the promise for the future. For even
if the question to be answered with "no," viz., whether the corn is
still in the granary, were to be referred to the present, what follows,
viz., that the fruit-trees have not borne, would not suit this, since
not having borne is a past thing, even if it merely related to the last
year, although there is no ground for any such limitation of the words.
And if in [Hag 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md) the prophet
directs the attention of his hearers to the past, we must also
understand the chronological datum immediately preceding as relating to
the past as well, and must assume that the words from למן היּום in [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md) to לא נשׂא in [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md) contain a parenthetical thought;
that is to say, we must assume that the prophet, in order to set clearly
before their minds the difference between the past when the building of
the temple was suspended, and the future commencing with that very day,
before promising the blessing of God to be enjoyed in the future,
directs another look at the past, and that from the time of the laying
of the foundation of the temple in the reign of Cyrus to his own time,
and reminds them once more of the want of blessing which they had
experienced from that time forth even to the present time. Koehler's
objection to this view cannot be sustained. He says, "The Jews are to
observe the time from that day forward, namely, from the twenty-fourth
day of the ninth month (backwards); the time from the laying of the
foundation of the temple in the reign of Cyrus (forwards).... Such a
mode of expression seems utterly out of place." But this only affects
the erroneous assumption, that the definition "from the day of the
laying of the foundation of the temple" is merely a more precise
explanation of the previous definition, from the twenty-fourth day of
the ninth month, and falls to the ground of itself as soon as these two
definitions are separated, as the expression and the matter in hand
require. The second objection - namely, that the day of the laying of
the foundation of the temple in the reign of Cyrus does not suit as a
terminus a quo for the commencement of the withdrawal of the divine
favour, or for the infliction of a curse upon the people, inasmuch as
the Jews were not punished because they laid the foundation for the
house of Jehovah, but simply because they neglected the house of God,
that is to say, because they desisted from the building they had already
begun - is one that would have some force if an interval of at least one
or more years had elapsed between the laying of the foundation of the
temple and the suspension of the building. But if the work of building
was interrupted immediately after the foundation had been laid, as is
evident from [Ezr 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md), as compared
with ch. 4, Haggai might with perfect propriety describe the whole time
from the laying of the foundation of the temple in the reign of Cyrus to
the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the second year of Darius as
a time without blessing, without there being any necessity for him
expressly to deduct the few weeks which elapsed between the laying of
the foundation-stone and the suspension of the work of building, any
more than the last three months, in which the work had been resumed
again. The last three months could hardly be taken into account, because
they fell for the most part in the period after the last harvest; so
that if this had proved to be a bad one, the cause would be still in
force. The prophet could therefore very properly inquire whether the
seed was still in the granary, to which they would be obliged to answer
No, because the miserable produce of the harvest was already either
consumed for the supply of their daily wants, or used up for the sowing
which was just ended. זרע, seed, is not what is sown, but what the
sowing yields, the corn, as in [Lev
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md); [Isa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003.md); [Job
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#012.md). Megūrâh = mammegūrâh in [Joe
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#017.md), a barn or granary, from gūr,
ἀγείρεσθαι, congregari. The following words, ועד־הגּפן וגו, are really
appended to the thought contained implicite in the first clause: the
corn has not borne, and even to the vine, etc., it has borne nothing.
נשׂא is indefinite: it has not borne = has borne nothing. It shall be
different in future. From this day, i.e., from the twenty-fourth day of
the ninth month, Jehovah will bless again, i.e., grant a blessing,
namely, so that fruitful seasons will come again, and fields and
fruit-trees bear once more. There is no necessity to supply a definite
object to אברך.

[Haggai 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">hag 2:20</span></span>

Renewal of the Promise of Salvation. - [Hag
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020.md). On the same day on which the
Lord promised to the people the return of the blessings of nature,
Haggai received a second revelation, which promised to the community the
preservation and care of the Davidic monarchy, represented for the time
by Zerubbabel, in the midst of the storms that were about to burst upon
the power of the world. [Hag 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021.md).
"Speak to Zerubbabel the governor of Judah thus: I shake the heaven and
the earth. [Hag 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#022.md). And I will
overthrow the throne of the kingdoms; and destroy the might of the
kingdoms of the nations; and will overthrow the war-chariots, and those
who ride in them: and horses and their riders shall fall, one by the
sword of the other. [Hag 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023.md). On that
day, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, will I take thee, Zerubbabel son
of Shealtiel, my servant, is the saying of Jehovah, and make thee as a
signet-ring: for I have chosen thee, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts."
אני מרעישׁ does not stand for הנני מרעישׁ, but the participial clause is
to be taken as a circumstantial clause: If I shake heaven and earth, I
overthrow (cf. Ewald, 341, c and d). The words point back to the shaking
of the world predicted in [Hag 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md),
[Hag 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md). When this shaking takes
place, then shall the throne of the kingdoms be thrown down, and their
might be destroyed. The singular כּסּא is used collectively, or rather
distributively: "every throne of the kingdoms." The throne is the symbol
of the monarchy, or of the government (cf. [Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027).md); not in this sense, however,
that "the prophet regarded all the kingdoms of the earth as one combined
power in contradistinction to the people of God, or as a single power,
as the power of the world, which was sitting as mistress at the time
upon the throne of the earth" (Koehler). The plural mamlâkhōth does not
agree with this, since every kingdom had both a king and a throne. The
continuance of this throne rests upon the strength (chōqez) of the
heathen kingdoms, and this again upon their military power, their
war-chariots, horses, and riders. These are to be overthrown and fall to
the ground, and indeed by one another's swords. One hostile kingdom will
destroy another, and in the last conflict the heathen hosts will
annihilate one another (compare [Eze
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#021.md); [Zac
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013).md). At that time, when the
dominion of the heathen had thus collapsed, Jehovah would take
Zerubbabel and set or make him as a signet-ring. The verb 'eqqach (will
I take) simply serves to introduce the following act as one of
importance, as for example in [Deu
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md) and [Kg2
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md). The meaning of the figurative
expression, to make Zerubbabel as a signet-ring, is evident from the
importance of the signet-ring in the eyes of an oriental, who is
accustomed to carry his signet-ring constantly about with him, and to
take care of it as a very valuable possession. It is introduced with the
same idea in the [Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md), "Lay me as
a signet-ring upon thy breast, as a signet-ring in thine arms;" and it
is in the same sense that Jehovah says of Jehoiachin in [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024.md), "Though Coniah the son of
Jehoiakim were even a signet-ring upon my right hand, i.e., a possession
from which it would be thought impossible that I should separate myself,
yet would I tear thee away from thence." Hence we obtain this thought
for our present passage, namely, that on the day on which Jehovah would
overthrow the kingdoms of the nations, He would make Zerubbabel like a
signet-ring, which is inseparable from its possessor; that is to say, He
would give him a position in which he would be and remain inseparably
connected with Him (Jehovah), would therefore not cast him off, but take
care of him as His valuable possession. This is the explanation given by
Koehler (after Calvin, Osiander, and others); and he has also refuted
the various explanations that differ from it. But in order clearly to
understand the meaning of this promise, we must look at the position
which Zerubbabel occupied in the community of Israel on its return from
exile. For we may at the outset assume that the promise did not apply to
his own particular person, but rather to the official post he held, from
the fact that what is here predicted was not to take place till after
the overthrow of the throne and might of all the kingdoms of the
heathen, and therefore could not take place in Zerubbabel's lifetime,
inasmuch as, although the fall of this or the other kingdom might be
looked for in the course of one generation, the overthrow of all
kingdoms and the coming of all the heathen to fill the temple of the
Lord with their possessions ([Hag 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007).md)
certainly could not. Zerubbabel was (Persian) governor in Judah, and had
no doubt been selected for this office because he was prince of Judah
([Ezr 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008).md), and as son of Shealtiel
was a descendant of the family of David (see at [Hag
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001).md). Consequently the sovereignty of
David in its existing condition of humiliation, under the sovereignty of
the imperial power, was represented and preserved in his appointment as
prince and governor of Judah, so that the fulfilment of the divine
promise of the eternal perpetuation of the seed of David and his kingdom
was then associated with Zerubbabel, and rested upon the preservation of
his family. Hence the promise points to the fact, that at the time when
Jehovah would overthrow the heathen kingdoms, He would maintain and take
good care of the sovereignty of David in the person of Zerubbabel. For
Jehovah had chosen Zerubbabel as His servant. With these words the
Messianic promise made to David was transferred to Zerubbabel and his
family among David's descendants, and would be fulfilled in his person
in just the same way as the promise given to David, that God would make
him the highest among the kings of the earth ([Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027).md). The fulfilment culminates in
Jesus Christ, the son of David and descendant of Zerubbabel ([Mat
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012.md); [Luk
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#027).md), in whom Zerubbabel was made the
signet-ring of Jehovah. Jesus Christ has raised up the kingdom of His
father David again, and of His kingdom there will be no end ([Luk
1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032).md). Even though it may appear
oppressed and deeply humiliated for the time by the power of the
kingdoms of the heathen, it will never be crushed and destroyed, but
will break in pieces all these kingdoms, and destroy them, and will
itself endure for ever ([Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md);
[Heb 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md); [Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md).
