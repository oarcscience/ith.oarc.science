The Book of Psalms

Introduction to the Psalter

Πάντα ὥσπερ ἐν μεγάλῳ τινὶ καὶ κοινῷ ταμιείῳ τῇ βίβλῳ τῶν ψαλμῶν
τεθησαύρισται.

Basil

1\. Position of the Psalter among the Hagiographa, and More Especially
among the Poetical Books

The Psalter is everywhere regarded as an essential part of the Kethubim
or Hagiographa; but its position among these varies. It seems to follow
from [Luk 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044.md) that it opened the
Kethubim in the earliest period of the Christina era.

(Note: Also from 2 Macc. 2:13, where τὰ τοῦ Δαυίδ appears to be the
designation of the כתובים according to their beginning; and from Philo,
De vita contempl. (opp. II 475 ed. Mangey), where he makes the following
distinction νόμους καὶ λόγια θεσπισθέντα διὰ προφητῶν καὶ ὕμνους καὶ τὰ
ἄλλα οἷς ἐπιστήμη καὶ εὐσέβεια συναύξονται καὶ τελειοῦνται.)

The order of the books in the Hebrew MSS of the German class, upon which
our printed editions in general use are based, is actually this: Psalms,
Proverbs, Job, and the five Megilloth. But the Masora and the MSS of the
Spanish class begin the Kethubim with the Chronicles which they
awkwardly separate from Ezra and Nehemiah, and then range the Psalms,
Job, Proverbs and the five Megilloth next.

(Note: In all the Masoretic lists the twenty four books are arranged in
the following order: 1) בראשׁית; 2) ואלה שׁמות; 3) ויקרא; 4) וידבר (also
במדבר); 5) אלה הדברים; 6) יהושׁע; 7) שׁופטים; 8) שׁמואל; 9) מלכים; 10)
ישׁעיה; 11) ירמיה; 12) יחזקאל; 13) תרי עשׂר; 14) דברי הימים; 15) תהלות;
16) איוב; 17) משׁלי; 18) רות; 19) שׁיר השׁירים; 20) קהלת; 21) קינות
(איכה); 22) אחשׁורושׁ (מגלה); 23) דניאל; 24) עזרא. The Masoretic
abbreviation for the three pre-eminently poetical books is accordingly,
not מתא but (in agreement with their Talmudic order) אםת (as also in
Chajug'), vid., Elia Levita, Masoreth ha-Masoreth p. 19. 73 (ed. Ven.
1538) ed. Ginsburg, 1867, p. 120, 248.)

And according to the Talmud (Baba Bathra 14b) the following is the right
order: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs; the Book of Ruth precedes the
Psalter as its prologue, for Ruth is the ancestor of him to whom the
sacred lyric owes its richest and most flourishing era. It is
undoubtedly the most natural order that the Psalter should open the
division of the Kethubim, and for this reason: that, according to the
stock which forms the basis of it, it represents the time of David, and
then afterwards in like manner the Proverbs and Job represent the
Chokma-literature of the age of Solomon. But it is at once evident that
it could have no other place but among the Kethubim.

The codex of the giving of the Law, which is the foundation of the old
covenant and of the nationality of Israel, as also of all its subsequent
literature, occupies the first place in the canon. Under the collective
title of נביאים, a series of historical writings of a prophetic
character, which trace the history of Israel from the occupation of
Canaan to the first gleam of light in the gloomy retributive condition
of the Babylonish Exile (Prophetae priores) is first attached to these
five books of the Thra; and then a series of strictly prophetical
writings by the prophets themselves which extend to the time of Darius
Nothus, and indeed to the time of Nehemiah's second sojourn in Jerusalem
under this Persian king (Prophetae posteriores). Regarded
chronologically, the first series would better correspond to the second
if the historical books of the Persian period (Chronicles with Ezra,
Nehemiah, and Esther) were joined to it; but for a very good reason this
has not been done. The Israelitish literature has marked out two sharply
defined and distinct methods of writing history, viz., the annalistic
and the prophetic. The so-called Elohistic and so-called Jehovistic form
of historical writing in the Pentateuch might serve as general types of
these. The historical books of the Persian period are, however, of the
annalistic, not of the prophetic character (although the Chronicles have
taken up and incorporated many remnants of the prophetic form of
historical writing, and the Books of the Kings, vice versa, many
remnants of the annalistic): they could not therefore stand among the
Prophetae priores. But with the Book of Ruth it is different. This short
book is so like the end of the Book of the Judges (ch. 17-21), that it
might very well stand between Judges and Samuel; and it did originally
stand after the Book of the Judges, just as the Lamentations of Jeremiah
stood after his prophecies. It is only on liturgical grounds that they
have both been placed with the so-called Megilloth (Canticles, Ruth,
Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther, as they are arranged in our
ordinary copies according to the calendar of the festivals). All the
remaining books could manifestly only be classed under the third
division of the canon, which (as could hardly have been otherwise in
connection with תורה and נביאים) has been entitled, in the most general
way, כתובים ,, - a title which, as the grandson of Ben-Sira renders it
in his prologue to Ecclesiasticus, means simply τὰ ἄλλα πάτρια βιβλία,
or τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν βιβλίων, and nothing more. For if it were intended to
mean writings, written ברוח הקדשׁ, - as the third degree of inspiration
which is combined with the greatest spontaneity of spirit, is styled
according to the synagogue notion of inspiration-then the words ברוח
הקדשׁ would and ought to stand with it.

2\. Names of the Psalter

At the close of the seventy-second Psalm (72:20) we find the
subscription: "Are ended the prayers of David, the Son of Jesse." The
whole of the preceding Psalms are here comprehended under the name
תּפלּות. This strikes one as strange, because with the exception of [Psa
17:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md) (and further on Ps 86; 90;
102; [Psa 142:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001).md) they are all
inscribed otherwise; and because in part, as e.g., [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) and [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), they contain no supplicatory
address to God and have therefore not the form of prayers. Nevertheless
the collective name Tephilloth is suitable to all Psalms. The essence of
prayer is a direct and undiverted looking towards God, and the
absorption of the mind in the thought of Him. Of this nature of prayer
all Psalms partake; even the didactic and laudatory, though containing
no supplicatory address-like Hannah's song of praise which is introduced
with ותתפלל ([Sa1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001).md). The title
inscribed on the Psalter is תּהלּים (ספר) for which תּלּים (apocopated
תּלּי deta) is also commonly used, as Hippolytus (ed. de Lagarde p. 188)
testifies: Ἑεβραῖοι περιέγραψαν τὴν βίβλον Σέφρα θελείμ.

(Note: In Eusebius, vi. 25: Σέφηρ Θιλλήν; Jerome (in the Preface to his
translation of the Psalms juxta Hebraicam veritatem) points it still
differently: SEPHAR THALLIM quod interpretatur volumen hymnorum.
Accordingly at the end of the Psalterium ex Hebraeo, Cod. 19 in the
Convent Library of St. Gall we find the subscription: Sephar Tallim Quod
interpretatur volumen Ymnorum explicit.)

This name may also seem strange, for the Psalms for the most part are
hardly hymns in the proper sense: the majority are elegiac or didactic;
and only a solitary one, Ps 145, is directly inscribed תהלה. But even
this collective name of the Psalms is admissible, for they all partake
of the nature of the hymn, to wit the purpose of the hymn, the
glorifying of God. The narrative Psalms praise the magnalia Dei, the
plaintive likewise praise Him, since they are directed to Him as the
only helper, and close with grateful confidence that He will hear and
answer. The verb הלּל includes both the Magnificat and the De profundis.

The language of the Masora gives the preference to the feminine form of
the name, instead of תהלים, and throughout calls the Psalter ספר תהלות
(e.g., on [Sa2 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#005).md).

(Note: It is an erroneous opinion of Buxtorf in his Tiberias and also of
Jewish Masoretes, that the Masora calls the Psalter הלילא (hallla). It
is only the so-called Hallel, Ps 113-119, that bears this name, for in
the Masora on [Sa2 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#005.md); [Psa
116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md) is called הברו דהלילא (the
similar passage in the Hallel) in relation to [Psa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005)..md)

In the Syriac it is styled ketobo demazmûre, in the Koran zabûr (not as
Golius and Freytag point it, zubûr), which in the usage of the Arabic
language signifies nothing more than "writing" (synon. kitâb: vid., on
[Psa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001).md), but is perhaps a corruption
of mizmor from which a plural mezâmir is formed, by a change of vowels,
in Jewish-Oriental MSS. In the Old Testament writings a plural of
mizamor does not occur. Also in the post-biblical usage mizmorı̂m or
mizmoroth is found only in solitary instances as the name for the
Psalms. In Hellenistic Greek the corresponding word ψαλμοί (from ψάλλειν
= זמּר) is the more common; the Psalm collection is called βίβλος ψαλμῶν
([Luk 20:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#042.md); [Act
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020).md) or ψαλτήριον, the name of the
instrument (psantêrı̂n in the Book of Daniel)

(Note: Νάβλα - say Eusebius and others of the Greek Fathers - παρ ̓
Ἑβραίοις λέγεται τὸ ψαλτήριον ὃ δὴ μόνον τῶν μουσικῶν ὀργάνων ὀρθότατον
καὶ μὴ συνεργούμενον εἰς ἦχον ἐκ τῶν κατωτάτω μερῶν, ἀλλ ̓ ἄνωθεν ἔχων
τὸν ὑπηχοῦντα χαλκόν. Augustine describes this instrument still more
clearly in [Psa 42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) and elsewhere:
Psalterium istud organum dicitur quod de superiore parte habet
testudinem, illud scilicet tympanum et concavum lignum cui chordae
innitentes resonant, cithara vero id ipsum lignum cavum et sonorum ex
inferiore parte habet. In the cithern the strings pass over the
sound-board, in the harp and lyre the vibrating body runs round the
strings which are left free (without a bridge) and is either curved or
angular as in the case of the harp, or encompasses the strings as in the
lyre. Harps with an upper sounding body (whether of metal or wood, viz.,
lignum concavum i.e., with a hollow and hence sonorous wood, which
protects the strings like a testudo and serves as tympanum) are found
both on Egyptian and on Assyrian monuments. By the psalterium described
by Augustine, Casiodorus and Isidorus understand the trigonum, which is
in the form of an inverted sharp-cornered triangle; but it cannot be
this that is intended because the horizontal strings of this instrument
are surrounded by a three-sided sounding body, so that it must be a
triangular lyre. Moreover there is also a trigon belonging to the
Macedonian era which is formed like a harp (vid., Weiss' Kostmkunde,
Fig. 347) and this further tends to support our view.)

being transferred metaphorically to the songs that are sung with its
accompaniment. Psalms are songs for the lyre, and therefore lyric poems
in the strictest sense.

3\. The History of Psalm Composition

Before we can seek to obtain a clear idea of the origin of the
Psalm-collection we must take a general survey of the course of the
development of psalm writing. The lyric is the earliest kind of poetry
in general, and the Hebrew poetry, the oldest example of the poetry of
antiquity that has come down to us, is therefore essentially lyric.
Neither the Epos nor the Drama, but only the Mashal, has branched off
from it and attained an independent form. Even prophecy, which is
distinguished from psalmody by a higher impulse which the mind of the
writer receives from the power of the divine mind, shares with the
latter the common designation of נכּא ([Ch1
24:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001).md), and the psalm-singer, משׁרר,
is also as such called חזה ([Ch1 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005.md);
[Ch2 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030.md); [Ch2
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015.md), cf. [Ch1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019) and freq..md); for just as the
sacred lyric often rises to the height of prophet vision, so the
prophetic epic of the future, because it is not entirely freed from the
subjectivity of the prophet, frequently passes into the strain of the
psalm.

The time of Moses was the period of Israel's birth as a nation and also
of its national lyric. The Israelites brought instruments with them out
of Egypt and these were the accompaniments of their first song (Ex 15) -
the oldest hymn, which re-echoes through all hymns of the following ages
and also through the Psalter (comp. [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md) with [Psa
118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md); [Exo
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003.md) with [Psa
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008.md); [Exo
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004.md), [Exo
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027.md) with [Psa
136:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#015.md); Ex 15: with [Psa
78:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#013.md), [Exo
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md) with [Psa
77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014.md); [Psa
86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008.md); [Psa
89:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#007.md).; [Exo
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#013.md), [Exo
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017.md) with [Psa
78:54](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#054.md), and other parallels of a
similar kind). If we add to these, Ps 90 and Deut 32, we then have the
prototypes of all Psalms, the hymnic, elegiac, and prophetico-didactic.
All three classes of songs are still wanting in the strophic symmetry
which characterises the later art. But even Deborah's song of victory,
arranged in hexastichs, - a song of triumph composed eight centuries
before Pindar and far outstripping him, - exhibits to us the strophic
art approximating to its perfect development. It has been thought
strange that the very beginnings of the poesy of Israel are so perfect,
but the history of Israel, and also the history of its literature, comes
under a different law from that of a constant development from a lower
to a higher grade. The redemptive period of Moses, unique in its way,
influences as a creative beginning, every future development. There is a
constant progression, but of such a kind as only to develope that which
had begun in the Mosaic age with all the primal force and fulness of a
divine creation. We see, however, how closely the stages of this
progress are linked together, from the fact that Hannah the singer of
the Old Testament Magnificat, was the mother of him who anointed, as
King, the sweet singer of Israel, on whose tongue was the word of the
Lord.

In David the sacred lyric attained its full maturity. Many things
combined to make the time of David its golden age. Samuel had laid the
foundation of this both by his energetic reforms in general, and by
founding the schools of the prophets in particular, in which under his
guidance ([Sa1 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#019)..md), in conjunction
with the awakening and fostering of the prophetic gift, music and song
were taught. Through these coenobia, whence sprang a spiritual awakening
hitherto unknown in Israel, David also passed. Here his poetic talent,
if not awakened, was however cultivated. He was a musician and poet
born. Even as a Bethlehemite shepherd he played upon the harp, and with
his natural gift he combined a heart deeply imbued with religious
feeling. But the Psalter contains as few traces of David's Psalms before
his anointing (vid., on [Psa 8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001.md);
[Psa 144:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001).md) as the New Testament
does of the writings of the Apostles before the time of Pentecost. It
was only from the time when the Spirit of Jahve came upon him at his
anointing as king of Israel, and raised him to the dignity of his
calling in connection with the covenant of redemption, that he sang
Psalms, which have become an integral part of the canon. They are the
fruit not only of his high gifts and the inspiration of the Spirit of
God ([Sa2 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#002).md), but also of his own
experience and of the experience of his people interwoven with his own.
David's path from his anointing onwards, lay through affliction to
glory. Song however, as a Hindu proverb says, is the offspring of
suffering, the חloka springs from the חoka. His life was marked by
vicissitudes which at one time prompted him to elegiac strains, at
another to praise and thanksgiving; at the same time he was the founder
of the kingship of promise, a prophecy of the future Christ, and his
life, thus typically moulded, could not express itself otherwise than in
typical or even consciously prophetic language. Raised to the throne, he
did not forget the harp which had been his companion and solace when he
fled before Saul, but rewarded it with all honour. He appointed 4000
Levites, the fourth division of the whole Levitical order, as singers
and musicians in connection with the service in the tabernacle on Zion
and partly in Gibeon, the place of the Mosaic tabernacle. These he
divided into 24 classes under the Precentors, Asaph, Heman, and Ethan =
Jeduthun (1 Chron 25 comp. [Ch1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017)..md), and multiplied the
instruments, particularly the stringed instruments, by his own invention
([Ch1 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md); [Neh
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#036).md)

(Note: I tended, says David in the Greek Psalter, at the close of Ps, my
father's sheep, my hands made pipes (ὄργανον = עוגב) and my fingers put
together (or: tuned) harps (ψαλτήριον = נבל) cf. Numeri Rabba c. xv. (f.
264a) and the Targum on [Amo 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005)..md).

In David's time there were three places of sacrifice: on Zion beside the
ark ([Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017)..md), in Gibeon beside the
Mosaic tabernacle ([Ch1 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039)..md) and
later, on the threshing-floor of Ornan, afterwards the Temple-hill ([Ch1
21:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#028).md). Thus others also were
stimulated in many ways to consecrate their offerings to the God of
Israel. Beside the 73 Psalms bearing the inscription לדוד, - Psalms the
direct Davidic authorship of which is attested, at least in the case of
some fifty, by their creative originality, their impassioned and
predominantly plaintive strain, their graceful flow and movement, their
ancient but clear language, which becomes harsh and obscure only when
describing the dissolute conduct of the ungodly-the collection contains
the following which are named after contemporary singers appointed by
David: 12 לאסף (Ps 50; 78:1-83:18), of which the contents and spirit are
chiefly prophetic, and 12 by the Levite family of singers, the בני־קרה
(Ps 42-49; 84:1-85:13; 87:1-88:18, including [Psa
43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001).md), bearing a predominantly regal
and priestly impress. Both the Psalms of the Ezrahite, Ps 88 by Heman
and Ps 89 by Ethan, belong to the time of Solomon whose name, with the
exception of Ps 72, is borne only by [Psa
127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md). Under Solomon psalm-poesy
began to decline; all the existing productions of the mind of that age
bear the mark of thoughtful contemplation rather than of direct
conception, for restless eagerness had yielded to enjoyable contentment,
national concentration to cosmopolitan expansion. It was the age of the
Chokma, which brought the apophthegm to its artistic perfection, and
also produced a species of drama. Solomon himself is the perfecter of
the Mashal, that form of poetic composition belonging strictly to the
Chokma, Certainly according to [Kg1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#012.md) \[Hebr.; [Kg1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032.md), Engl.\] he was also the author
of 1005 songs, but in the canon we only find two Psalms by him and the
dramatic Song of Songs. This may perhaps be explained by the fact that
he spake of trees from the cedar to the hyssop, that his poems, mostly
of a worldly character, pertained rather to the realm of nature than to
the kingdom of grace.

Only twice after this did psalm-poesy rise to any height and then only
for a short period: viz., under Jehoshaphat and under Hezekiah. Under
both these kings the glorious services of the Temple rose from the
desecration and decay into which they had fallen to the full splendour
of their ancient glory. Moreover there were two great and marvellous
deliverances which aroused the spirit of poesy during the reigns of
these kings: under Jehoshaphat, the overthrow of the neighbouring
nations when they had banded together for the exstirpation of Judah,
predicted by Jahaziel, the Asaphite; under Hezekiah the overthrow of
Sennacherib's host foretold by Isaiah. These kings also rendered great
service to the cause of social progress. Jehoshaphat by an institution
designed to raise the educational status of the people, which reminds
one of the Carlovingian missi ([Ch2
17:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007).md); Hezekiah, whom one may regard
as the Pisistratus of Israelitish literature, by the establishment of a
commission charged with collecting the relics of the early literature
([Pro 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001).md); he also revived the
ancient sacred music and restored the Psalms of David and Asaph to their
liturgical use ([Ch2 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#025)..md). And he
was himself a poet, as his מכתב (מכתם?) (Isa 38) shows, though certainly
a reproductive rather than a creative poet. Both from the time of
Jehoshaphat and from the time of Hezekiah we possess in the Psalter not
a few Psalms, chiefly Asaphic and Korahitic, which, although bearing no
historical heading, unmistakeably confront us with the peculiar
circumstances of those times.

(Note: With regard to the time of Jehoshaphat even Nic. Nonne has
acknowledge this in his Diss. de Tzippor et Deror (Bremen 1741, 4to.)
which has reference to [Psa 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004)..md)

With the exception of these two periods of revival the latter part of
the regal period produced scarcely any psalm writers, but is all the
more rich in prophets. When the lyric became mute, prophecy raised its
trumpet voice in order to revive the religious life of the nation, which
previously had expressed itself in psalms. In the writings of the
prophets, which represent the λεῖμμα χάριτος in Israel, we do indeed
find even psalms, as [Jon 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#001.md), [Isa
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md); [Hab
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001.md), but these are more imitations of
the ancient congregational hymns than original compositions. It was not
until after the Exile that a time of new creations set in.

As the Reformation gave birth to the German church-hymn, and the Thirty
years' war, without which perhaps there might have been no Paul
Gerhardt, called it into life afresh, so the Davidic age gave birth to
psalm-poesy and the Exile brought back to life again that which had
become dead. The divine chastisement did not fail to produce the effect
designed. Even though it should not admit of proof, that many of the
Psalms have had portions added to them, from which it would be manifest
how constantly they were then used as forms of supplication, still it is
placed beyond all doubt, that the Psalter contains many psalms belonging
to the time of the Exile, as e.g., Ps 102. Still far more new psalms
were composed after the Return. When those who returned from exile,
among whom were many Asaphites,

(Note: In Barhebraeus on Job and in his Chronikon several traditions are
referred to "Asaph the Hebrew priest, the brother of Ezra the writer of
the Scriptures.")

again felt themselves to be a nation, and after the restoration of the
Temple to be also a church, the harps which in Babylon hung upon the
willows, were tuned afresh and a rich new flow of song was the fruit of
this re-awakened first love. But this did not continue long. A sanctity
founded on good works and the service of the letter took the place of
that outward, coarse idolatry from which the people, now returned to
their fatherland, had been weaned while undergoing punishment in the
land of the stranger. Nevertheless in the era of the Seleucidae the
oppressed and injured national feeling revived under the Maccabees in
its old life and vigour. Prophecy had then long been dumb, a fact
lamented in many passages in the 1st Book of the Maccabees. It cannot be
maintained that psalm-poesy flourished again at that time. Hitzig has
recently endeavoured to bring forward positive proof, that it is
Maccabean psalms, which form the proper groundwork of the Psalter. He
regards the Maccabean prince Alexander Jannaeus as the writer of [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) and [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), refers Ps 44 to 1 Macc.
5:56-62, and maintains both in his Commentary of 1835-36 and in the
later edition of 1863-65 that from Ps 73 onwards there is not a single
pre-Maccabean psalm in the collection and that, from that point, the
Psalter mirrors the prominent events of the time of the Maccabees in
chronological order. Hitzig has been followed by von Lengerke and
Olshausen. They both mark the reign of John Hyrcanus (b.c. 135-107) as
the time when the latest psalms were composed and when the collection as
we now have it was made: whereas Hitzig going somewhat deeper ascribes
Ps 1-2; [Psa 150:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001.md) with others, and
the arrangement of the whole, to Hyrcanus' son, Alexander Jannaeus.

On the other hand both the existence and possibility of Maccabean psalms
is disputed not only by Hengstenberg, Hvernick, and Keil but also by
Gesenius, Hassler, Ewald, Thenius, Bttcher, and Dillmann. For our own
part we admit the possibility. It has been said that the ardent
enthusiasm of the Maccabean period was more human than divine, more
nationally patriotic than theocratically national in its character, but
the Book of Daniel exhibits to us, in a prophetic representation of that
period, a holy people of the Most High contending with the god-opposing
power in the world, and claims for this contest the highest significance
in relation to the history of redemption. The history of the canon,
also, does not exclude the possibility of there being Maccabean psalms.
For although the chronicler by [Ch1
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036.md) brings us to the safe conclusion
that in his day the Psalter (comp. τὰ τοῦ Δαυίδ, 2 Macc. 2:13)

(Note: In the early phraseology of the Eastern and Western churches the
Psalter is simply called David, e.g., in Chrysostom: ἐκμαθόντες ὅλον τὸν
Δαβίδ, and at the close of the Aethiopic Psalter: "David is ended.")

was already a whole divided into five books (vid., on [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001); 105:1-106:48.md): it might
nevertheless, after having been completely arranged still remain open
for later insertions (just as the ספר הישׁר cited in the [Jos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md) and 2 Sam 1, was an anthology
which had grown together in the course of time). When Judas Maccabaeus,
by gathering together the national literature, followed in the footsteps
of Nehemiah (2 Macc. 2:14: ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ Ἰούδας τὰ δεισκορπισμένα διὰ
τὸν πόλεμον τὸν γεγονότα ἡμῖν ἐπισυνήγαγε πάντα, καὶ ἔστι παρ ̓ ἡμῖν),
we might perhaps suppose that the Psalter was at that time enriched by
some additions. And when Jewish tradition assigns to the so-called Great
Synagogue (כנסת הגדולה) a share in the compilation of the canon, this is
not unfavourable to the supposition of Maccabean psalms, since this
συναγωγή μεγάλη was still in existence under the domination of the
Seleucidae (1 Macc. 14:28).

It is utterly at variance with historical fact to maintain that the
Maccabean period was altogether incapable of producing psalms worthy of
incorporation in the canon. Although the Maccabean period had no
prophets, it is nevertheless to be supposed that many possessed the gift
of poesy, and that the Spirit of faith, which is essentially one and the
same with the Spirit of prophecy, might sanctify this gift and cause it
to bear fruit. An actual proof of this is furnished by the so-called
Psalter of Solomon (Ψαλτήριον Σαλομῶντος in distinction from the
canonical Psalter of David)

(Note: First made known by De la Cerda in his Adversaria sacra (1626)
and afterwards incorporated by Fabricius in his Codex Pseudepigraphus V.
T. pp. 914ff. (1713).)

consisting of 18 psalms, which certainly come far behind the originality
and artistic beauty of the canonical Psalms; but they show at the same
time, that the feelings of believers, even throughout the whole time of
the Maccabees, found utterance in expressive spiritual songs. Maccabean
psalms are therefore not an absolute impossibility - no doubt they were
many; and that some of them were incorporated in the Psalter, cannot be
denied priori. But still the history of the canon does not favour this
supposition. And the circumstance of the lxx version of the Psalms
(according to which citations are made even in the first Book of the
Maccabees) inscribing several Psalms Ἀγγαίου καὶ Ζαχαρίου, while however
it does not assign the date of the later period to any, is against it.
And if Maccabean psalms be supposed to exist in the Psalter they can at
any rate only be few, because they must have been inserted in a
collection which was already arranged. And since the Maccabean movement,
though beginning with lofty aspirations, gravitated, in its onward
course, towards things carnal, we can no longer expect to find psalms
relating to it, or at least none belonging to the period after Judas
Maccabaeus; and from all that we know of the character and disposition
of Alexander Jannaeus it is morally impossible that this despot should
be the author of the first and second Psalms and should have closed the
collection.

4\. Origin of the Collection

The Psalter, as we now have it, consists of five books.

(Note: The Karaite Jerocham (about 950 a.d.) says מגלות (rolls) instead
of ספרים.)

Τοῦτό σε μὴ παρέλθοι, ὦ φιλόλογε - says Hippolytus, whose words are
afterwards quoted by Epiphanius - ὅτι καὶ τὸ ψαλτήριον εἰς πέντε διεῖλον
βιβλία οἱ Ἑβραῖοι, ὥστε εἶναι καὶ αὐτὸ ἄλλον πεντάτευχον. This accords
with the Midrash on [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) : Moses
gave the Israelites the five books of the Thτra and corresponding to
these (כנגדם) David gave them the book of Psalms which consists of five
books (ספר תהלים שׁישׁ בו חמשׁה ספרים). The division of the Psalter into
five parts makes it the copy and echo of the Thפra, which it also
resembles in this particular: that as in the Thפra Elohistic and
Jehovistic sections alternate, so here a group of Elohistic Psalms
(42-84) is surrounded on both sides by groups of Jehovistic (1-41,
85-150). The five books are as follow:-1-41, 42-72, 83-89, 90-106,
107-150.

(Note: The Karaite Jefeth ben Eli calls them אשׁרי ספר, כאיל ס etc.)

Each of the first four books closes with a doxology, which one might
erroneously regard as a part of the preceding Psalm (Ps 41:14; [Psa
72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018.md)., 89:53; [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048).md), and the place of the fifth
doxology is occupied by Ps as a full toned finale to the whole (like the
relation of Ps 139 to the so-called Songs of degrees). These doxologies
very much resemble the language of the liturgical Beracha of the second
Temple. The אמן ואמן coupled with ו (cf. on the contrary [Num
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#022.md) and also [Neh
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#006).md) is exclusively peculiar to them
in Old Testament writings. Even in the time of the writer of the
Chronicles the Psalter was a whole divided into five parts, which were
indicated by these landmarks. We infer this from [Ch1
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036.md). The chronicler in the free
manner which characterises Thucydides of Livy in reporting a speech,
there reproduces David's festal hymn that resounded in Israel after the
bringing home of the ark; and he does it in such a way that after he has
once fallen into the track of Ps 106, he also puts into the mouth of
David the beracha which follows that Ps. From this we see that the
Psalter was already divided into books at that period; the closing
doxologies had already become thoroughly grafted upon the body of the
Psalms after which they stand. The chronicler however wrote under the
pontificate of Johanan, the son of Eliashib, the predecessor of Jaddua,
towards the end of the Persian supremacy, but a considerable time before
the commencement of the Grecian.

Next to this application of the beracha of the Fourth book by the
chronicler, [Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020.md) is a
significant mark for determining the history of the origin of the
Psalter. The words: "are ended the prayers of David the son of Jesse,"
are without doubt the subscription to the oldest psalm-collection, which
preceded the present psalm-pentateuch. The collector certainly has
removed this subscription from its original place close after [Psa
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017.md), by the interpolation of the
beracha [Psa 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018.md), but left it, as
the same time, untouched. The collectors and those who worked up the
older documents within the range of the Biblical literature appear to
have been extremely conscientious in this respect and they thereby make
it easier for us to gain an insight into the origin of their work, - as,
e.g., the composer of the Books of Samuel gives intact the list of
officers from a later document [Sa2
8:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016.md) (which closed with that, so
far as we at present have it in its incorporated state), as well as the
list from an older document ([Sa2
20:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023).md); or, as not merely the
author of the Book of Kings in the middle of the Exile, but also the
chronicler towards the end of the Persian period, have transferred
unaltered, to their pages, the statement that the staves of the ark are
to be found in the rings of the ark "to this day," which has its origin
in some annalistic document ([Kg1 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008.md);
[Ch2 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#009).md). But unfortunately that
subscription, which has been so faithfully preserved, furnishes us less
help than we could wish. We only gather from it that the present
collection was preceded by a primary collection of very much more
limited compass which formed its basis and that this closed with the
Salomonic Ps 72; for the collector would surely not have placed the
subscription, referring only to the prayers of David, after this Psalm
if he had not found it there already. And from this point it becomes
natural to suppose that Solomon himself, prompted perhaps by the
liturgical requirements of the new Temple, compiled this primary
collection, and by the addition of Ps 72 may have caused it to be
understood that he was the originator of the collection.

But to the question whether the primary collection also contained only
Davidic songs properly so called or whether the subscribed designation
תהלות דוד is only intended a potiori, the answer is entirely wanting. If
we adopt the latter supposition, one is at a loss to understand for what
reason only Ps 50 of the Psalms of Asaph was inserted in it. For this
psalm is really one of the old Asaphic psalms and might therefore have
been an integral part of the primary collection. On the other hand it is
altogether impossible for all the Korahitic psalms [Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) to have belonged to it, for some
of them, and most undoubtedly [Psa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md) and [Psa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md) were composed in the time of
Jehoshaphat, the most remarkable event of which, as the chronicler
narrates, was foretold by an Asaphite and celebrated by Korahitic
singers. It is therefore, apart from other psalms which bring us down to
the Assyrian period (as [Psa 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001.md),
[Psa 67:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001).md) and the time of Jeremiah
(as Ps 71) and bear in themselves traces of the time of the Exile (as
[Psa 69:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#035).md), absolutely impossible
that the primary collection should have consisted of [Psa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), or rather (since [Psa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md) appears as though it ought to be
assigned to the later time of the kings, perhaps the time of Isaiah) of
[Psa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md). And if we leave the later
insertions out of consideration, there is no arrangement left for the
Psalms of David and his contemporaries, which should in any way bear the
impress of the Davidic and Salomonic mind. Even the old Jewish teachers
were struck by this, and in the Midrash on [Psa
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md) we are told, that when Joshua
ben Levi was endeavouring to put the Ps. in order, a voice from heaven
cried out to him: arouse not the slumberer (אל־תפיחי את־ישׁן) i.e., do
not disturb David in his grave! Why [Psa
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md) follows directly upon [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), or as it is expressed in the
Midrash פרשׁת אבשׁלום follows פרשׁת גוג ומגוג, may certainly be more
satisfactorily explained than is done there: but to speak generally the
mode of the arrangement of the first two books of the Psalms is of a
similar nature to that of the last three, viz., that which in my
Symbolae ad Psalmos illustrandos isagogicae (1846) is shown to run
through the entire Psalter, more according to external than internal
points of contact.

(Note: The right view has been long since perceived by Eusebius, who in
his exposition of [Psa 63:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md) (lxx
62), among other things expresses himself thus: ἐγὼ δὲ ἡγοῦμαι τῆς τῶν
ἐγγεγραμμένων διανοίας ἕνεκεν ἐφεξῆς ἀλλήλων τοὺς ψαλμοὺς κεῖσθαι κατὰ
τὸ πλεῖστον, οὕτως ἐν πολλοῖς ἐπιτηρήσας καὶ εὑρών, διὸ καὶ συνῆφθαι
αὐτοὺς ὡσανεὶ συγγένειαν ἔχοντας καὶ ἀκολουθίαν πρὸς ἀλλήλους· ἔνθεν μὴ
κατὰ τοὺς χρόνους ἐμφέρεσθαι, ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὴν τῆς διανοίας ἀκολουθίαν (in
Montfaucon's Collectio Nova, t. i. p. 300). This ἀκολουθία διανοίας is
however not always central and deep. The attempts of Luther (Walch, iv.
col. 646ff.) and especially of Solomon Gesner, to prove a link of
internal progress in the Psalter are not convincing.)

On the other side it cannot be denied that the groundwork of the
collection that formed the basis of the present Psalter must lie within
the limits of [Psa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md), for nowhere
else do old Davidic psalms stand so closely and numerously together as
here. The Third book ([Psa 73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001).md)
exhibits a marked difference in this respect. We may therefore suppose
that the chief bulk of the oldest hymn book of the Israelitish church is
contained in [Psa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md). But we must at
the same time admit, that its contents have been dispersed and newly
arranged in later redactions and more especially in the last of all; and
yet, amidst these changes the connection of the subscription, [Psa
72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020.md), with the psalm of Solomon was
preserved. The two groups [Psa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md),
[Psa 73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md), although not preserved in
the original arrangement, and augmented by several kinds of
interpolations, at least represent the first two stages of the growth of
the Psalter. The primary collection may be Salomonic. The after portion
of the second group was, at the earliest, added in the time of
Jehoshaphat, at which time probably the book of the Proverbs of Solomon
was also compiled. But with a greater probability of being in the right
we incline to assign them to the time of Hezekiah, not merely because
some of the psalms among them seem as though they ought to be referred
to the overthrow of Assyria under Hezekiah rather than to the overthrow
of the allied neighbouring nations under Jehoshaphat, but chiefly
because just in the same manner "the men of Hezekiah" appended an after
gleaning to the older Salomonic book of Proverbs ([Pro
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001).md), and because of Hezekiah it is
recorded, that he brought the Psalms of David and of Asaph (the bulk of
which are contained in the Third book of the Psalms) into use again
([Ch2 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#030).md). In the time of Ezra and
Nehemiah the collection was next extended by the songs composed during
and (which are still more numerous) after the Exile. But a gleaning of
old songs also had been reserved for this time. A Psalm of Moses was
placed first, in order to give a pleasing relief to the beginning of the
new psalter by this glance back into the earliest time. And to the 56
Davidic psalms of the first three books, there are seventeen more added
here in the last two. They are certainly not all directly Davidic, but
partly the result of the writer throwing himself into David's temper of
mind and circumstances. One chief store of such older psalms were
perhaps the historical works of an annalistic or even prophetic
character, rescued from the age before the Exile. It is from such
sources that the historical notes prefixed to the Davidic hymns (and
also to one in the Fifth book: [Psa
142:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001).md) come. On the whole there is
unmistakeably an advance from the earliest to the latest; and we may
say, with Ewald, that in [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) the
real bulk of the Davidic and, in general, of the older songs, is
contained, in [Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) predominantly
songs of the middle period, in [Psa
90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001.md) the large mass of later and very
late songs. But moreover it is with the Psalm-collection as with the
collection of the prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel: the
chronological order and the arrangement according to the matter are at
variance; and in many places the former is intentionally and
significantly disregarded in favour of the latter. We have often already
referred to one chief point of view of this arrangement according to
matter, viz., the imitation of the Thra; it was perhaps this which led
to the opening of the Fourth book, which corresponds to the Book of
Numbers, with a psalm of Moses of this character.

5\. Arrangement and inscriptions

Among the Fathers, Gregory of Nyssa has attempted to show that the
Psalter in its five books leads upward as by five steps to moral
perfection, ἀεὶ πρὸς τὸ ὑψηλότερον τὴν ψυχὴν ὑπερτιθεὶς, ὡς ἂν ἐπὶ τὸ
ἀκρότατον ἐφίκηται τῶν ἀγαθῶν;

(Note: Opp. ed. Paris, (1638) t. i. p. 288.)

and down to the most recent times attempts have been made to trace in
the five books a gradation of principal thoughts, which influence and
run through the whole collection.

(Note: Thus especially Sthelin, Zur Einleitung in die Psalmen, 1859,
4to.)

We fear that in this direction, investigation has set before itself an
unattainable end. Nevertheless, as we shall see, the collection bears
the impress of one ordering mind. For its opening is formed by a
didactic-prophetic couplet of psalms ([Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md), introductory to the whole
Psalter and therefore in the earliest times regarded as one psalm, which
opens and closes with אשׁרי; and its close is formed by four psalms
([Psa 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001).md) which begin and end with
הללו־יה. We do not include Ps for this psalm takes the place of the
beracha of the Fifth book, exactly as the recurring verse [Isa
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022.md) is repeated in 57:21 with fuller
emphasis, but is omitted at the close of the third part of this address
of Isaiah to the exiles, its place being occupied by a terrifying
description of the hopeless end of the wicked. The opening of the
Psalter celebrates the blessedness of those who walk according to the
will of God in redemption, which has been revealed in the law and in
history; the close of the Psalter calls upon all creatures to praise
this God of redemption, as it were on the ground of the completion of
this great work. Bede has already called attention to the fact that the
Psalter from [Psa 146:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md) ends in a
complete strain of praise; the end of the Psalter soars upward to a
happy climax. The assumption that there was an evident predilection for
attempting to make the number 150 complete, as Ewald supposes, cannot be
established; the reckoning 147 (according to a Haggadah book mentioned
in Jer. Sabbath xvi., parallel with the years of Jacob's life), and the
reckoning 149, which frequently occurs both in Karaitic and Rabbinic
MSS, have also been adopted; the numbering of the whole and of
particular psalms varies.

(Note: The lxx, like our Hebrew text, reckons 150 psalms, but with
variations in separate instances, by making 9 and 10, and 114 and 115
into one, and in place of these, dividing 116 and 147 each into two. The
combination of 9 and 10, of 114 and 115 into one has also been adopted
by others; 134 and 135, but especially 1 and 2, appear here and there as
one psalm. Kimchi reckons 149 by making Ps 114 and 115 into one. The
ancient Syriac version combines Ps 114 and 115 as one, but reckons 150
by dividing Ps 147.)

There are in the Psalter 73 psalms bearing the inscription לדוד, viz.,
(reckoning exactly) 37 in book 1; 18 in book 2; 1 in book 3; 2 in book
4; 15 in book 5. The redaction has designed the pleasing effect of
closing the collection with an imposing group of Davidic psalms, just as
it begins with the bulk of the Davidic psalms. And the Hallelujahs which
begin with [Psa 146:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md) (after the 15
Davidic psalms) are the preludes of the closing doxology. The Korahitic
and Asaphic psalms are found exclusively in the Second and Third books.
There are 12 Asaphic psalms: 50, 73-83, and also 12 Korahitic: 42, 43,
44-49, 84, 85, 87, 88, assuming that [Psa
43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md) is to be regarded as an
independent twin psalm to [Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)
and that Ps 88 is to be reckoned among the Korahitic psalms. In both of
these divisions we find psalms belonging to the time of the Exile and to
the time after the Exile ([Psa 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md),
[Psa 79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md), [Psa
85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001).md). The fact of their being found
exclusively in the Second and Third books cannot therefore be explained
on purely chronological grounds. Korahitic psalms, followed by an
Asaphic, open the Second book; Asaphic psalms, followed by four
Korahitic, open the Third book.

The way in which Davidic psalms are interspersed clearly sets before us
the principle by which the arrangement according to the matter, which
the collector has chosen, is governed. It is the principle of
homogeneousness, which is the old Semitic mode of arranging things: for
in the alphabet, the hand and the hollow of the hand, water and fish,
the eye and the mouth, the back and front of the head have been placed
together. In like manner also the psalms follow one another according to
their relationship as manifested by prominent external and internal
marks. The Asaphic psalm, Ps 50, is followed by the Davidic psalm, [Psa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md), because they both similarly
disparage the material animal sacrifice, as compared with that which is
personal and spiritual. And the Davidic psalm [Psa
86:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001.md) is inserted between the Korahitic
psalms [Psa 85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md) and [Psa
87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md), because it is related both to
[Psa 85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008.md) by the prayer: "Show me Thy
way, O Jahve" and "give Thy conquering strength unto Thy servant," and
to [Psa 87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md) by the prospect of the
conversion of the heathen to the God of Israel. This phenomenon, that
psalms with similar prominent thoughts, or even with only markedly
similar passage, especially at the beginning and the end, are thus
strung together, may be observed throughout the whole collection. Thus
e.g., [Psa 56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md) with the
inscription, "after (the melody): the mute dove among strangers," is
placed after Ps 55 on account of the occurrence of the words: "Oh that I
had wings like a dove!" etc., in that psalm; thus Ps 34 and 35 stand
together as being the only psalms in which "the Angel of Jahve" occurs;
and just so Ps 9 and [Psa 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md) which
coincide in the expression יתות בצרה.

Closely connected with this principle of arrangement is the circumstance
that the Elohimic psalms (i.e., those which, according to a peculiar
style of composition as I have shown in my Symbolae, not from the
caprice of an editor,

(Note: This is Ewald's view (which is also supported by Riehm in Stud.
u. Kirt. 1857 S. 168). A closer insight into the characteristic
peculiarity of the Elohim-psalms, which is manifest in other respects
also, proves it to be superficial and erroneous.)

almost exclusively call God אלהים, and beside this make use of such
compound names of God as יהוה צבאות, יהוה אלהים צבאות and the like) are
placed together without any intermixture of Jehovic psalms. In [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) the divine name יהוה predominates;
it occurs 272 times and אלהים only 15 times, and for the most part under
circumstances where יהוה was not admissible. With [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) the Elohimic style begins; the
last psalm of this kind is the Korahitic psalm [Psa
84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md), which for this very reason is
placed after the Elohimic psalms of Asaph. In the [Psa
85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md) יהוה again becomes prominent,
with such exclusiveness, that in the Psalms of the Fourth and Fifth
books יהוה occurs 339 times (not 239 as in Symbolae p. 5), and אלהים of
the true God only once ([Psa 144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009).md).
Among the psalms of David 18 are Elohimic, among the Korahitic 9, and
the Asaphic are all Elohimic. Including one psalm of Solomon and four
anonymous psalms, there are 44 in all (reckoning [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) and [Psa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001) as two.md). They form the middle
portion of the Psalter, and have on their right 41 and on their left 65
Jahve-psalms.

Community in species of composition also belongs to the manifold grounds
on which the order according to the subject-matter is determined. Thus
the משׂכּיל ([Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md), [Psa
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md), [Psa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md), [Psa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001).md) and מכתּם ([Psa
56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001).md) stand together among the
Elohim-psalms. In like manner we have in the last two books the המּצלות
שׁיר ([Psa 120:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001).md) and, divided into
groups, those beginning with הודוּ ([Psa
105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001).md) and those beginning and ending
with הללוּיהּ ([Psa 111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md), [Psa
146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001).md) - whence it follows that these
titles to the psalms are older than the final redaction of the
collection.

It could not possibly be otherwise than that the inscriptions of the
psalms, after the harmless position which the monographs of Sonntag
(1687), Celsius (1718), Irhof (1728) take with regard to them, should at
length become a subject for criticism; but the custom which has gained
ground since the last decade of the past century of rejecting what has
been historically handed down, has at present grown into a despicable
habit of forming a decision too hastily, which in any other department
of literature where the judgment is not so prejudiced by the drift of
the enquiry, would be regarded as folly. Instances like [Hab
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001.md) and [Sa2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#018.md), comp. [Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md), show that David and other
psalm-writers might have appended their names to their psalms and the
definition of their purport. And the great antiquity of these and
similar inscriptions also follows from the fact that the lxx found them
already in existence and did not understand them; that they also cannot
be explained from the Books of the Chronicles (including the Book of
Ezra, which belongs to these) in which much is said about music, and
appear in these books, like much besides, as an old treasure of the
language revived, so that the key to the understanding of them must have
been lost very early, as also appears from the fact that in the last two
books of the Psalter they are of more rare, and in the first three of
more frequent occurrence.

6\. The Strophe-System of the Psalms

The early Hebrew poetry has neither rhyme nor metre, both of which
(first rhyme and then afterwards metre) were first adopted by Jewish
poesy in the seventh century after Christ. True, attempts at rhyme are
not wanting in the poetry and prophecy of the Old Testament, especially
in the tephilla style, [Psa 106:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004.md)
cf. [Jer 3:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md), where the
earnestness of the prayer naturally causes the heaping up of similar
flexional endings; but this assonance, in the transition state towards
rhyme proper, had not yet assumed such an established form as is found
in Syriac.

(Note: Vid., Zingerle in the Deutsch. Morgenlnd. Zeitschrift. X. 110ff.)

It is also just as difficult to point out verses of four lines only,
which have a uniform or mixed metre running through them.
Notwithstanding, Augustine, Ep. cxiii ad Memorium, is perfectly
warranted in saying of the Psalms: certis eos constare numeris credo
illis qui eam linguam probe callent, and it is not a mere fancy when
Philo, Josephus, Eusebius, Jerome and others have detected in the Old
Testament songs, and especially in the Psalms, something resembling the
Greek and Latin metres. For the Hebrew poetry indeed had a certain
syllabic measure, since, - apart from the audible Sheb and the Chateph,
both of which represent the primitive shortenings, - all syllables with
a full vowel are intermediate, and in ascending become long, in
descending short, or in other words, in one position are strongly
accented, in another more or less slurred over. Hence the most manifold
rhythms arise, e.g., the anapaestic wenashlı̂cha mimrénnu abothémo ([Psa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003).md) or the dactylic áz jedabbér elêmo
beappó ([Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005).md). The poetic
discourse is freer in its movement than the Syriac poetry with its
constant ascending ( \_ \_́ ) or descending spondees ( ́\_ \_ ); it
represents all kinds of syllabic movements and thus obtains the
appearance of a lively mixture of the Greek and Latin metres. But it is
only an appearance - for the forms of verse, which conform to the laws
of quantity, are altogether foreign to early Hebrew poetry, as also to
the oldest poetry; and these rhythms which vary according to the
emotions are not metres, for, as Augustine says in his work De Musica,
"Omne metrum rhythmus, non omnis rhythmus etiam metrum est." Yet there
is not a single instance of a definite rhythm running through the whole
in a shorter or longer poem, but the rhythms always vary according to
the thoughts and feelings; as e.g., the evening song [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md) towards the end rises to the
anapaestic measure: ki-attá Jahawé lebadád, in order then quietly to
subside in the iambic: labétach tôshibéni.

(Note: Bellermann's Versuch ber die Metrik der Hebrer (1813) is
comparatively the best on this subject even down to the present time;
for Saalschtz (Von der Form der hebr. Poesie, 1825, and elsewhere)
proceeds on the erroneous assumption that the present system of
accentuation does not indicate the actual strong toned syllable of the
words-by following the pronunciation of the German and Polish Jews he
perceives, almost throughout, a spondaeo-dactylic rhythm (e.g., [Jdg
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018) lûle charáshtem beegláthi.md). But
the traditional accentuation is proved to be a faithful continuation of
the ancient proper pronunciation of the Hebrew; the trochaic
pronunciation is more Syrian, and the tendency to draw the accent from
the final syllable to the penult, regardless of the conditions
originally governing it, is a phenomenon which belongs only to the alter
period of the language (vid., Hupfeld in the Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr.
vi. 187).)

With this alternation of rise and fall, long and short syllables,
harmonizing in lively passages with the subject, there is combined, in
Hebrew poetry, and expressiveness of accent which is hardly to be found
anywhere else to such an extent. Thus e.g., [Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md) sounds like pealing thunder, and
[Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md) corresponds to it as the
flashing lightning. And there are a number of dull toned Psalms as [Psa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md), [Psa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md), [Psa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md), [Psa
59:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#001.md), [Psa
73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md), in which the description drags
heavily on and is hard to be understood, and in which more particularly
the suffixes in mo are heaped up, because the indignant mood of the
writer impresses itself upon the style and makes itself heard in the
very sound of the words. The non plus ultra of such poetry, whose very
tones heighten the expression, is the cycle of the prophecies of
Jeremiah [Jer 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md).

Under the point of view of rhythm the so-called parallelismus membrorum
has also been rightly placed: that fundamental law of the higher,
especially poetic, style for which this appropriate name as been coined,
not very long since.

(Note: Abenezra calls it כּפוּל duplicatum, and Kimchi שׁונות בּמלּות
ענין כּפל, duplicatio sententiae verbis variatis; both regard it as an
elegant form of expression (דוך צחות). Even the punctuation does not
proceed from a real understanding of the rhythmical relation of the
members of the verse to one another, and when it divides every verse
that is marked off by Silluk wherever it is possible into two parts, it
must not be inferred that this rhythmical relation is actually always
one consisting of two members merely, although (as Hupfeld has shown in
his admirable treatise on the twofold law of the rhythm and accent, in
the D. M. Z. 1852), wherever it exists it always consists of at least
two members.)

The relation of the two parallel members does not really differ from
that of the two halves on either side of the principal caesura of the
hexameter and pentameter; and this is particularly manifest in the
double long line of the caesural schema (more correctly: the diaeretic
schema) e.g., [Psa 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006.md), [Psa
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007.md) : They beheld, straightway they
marvelled,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

bewildered they took to flight. Trembling took hold upon them there

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

anguish, as a woman in travail. Here the one thought is expanded in the
same verse in two parallel members. But from the fact of the rhythmical
organization being carried out without reference to the logical
requirements of the sentence, as in the same psalm [Psa
48:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#004.md), [Psa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008.md) : Elohim in her palaces

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

was known as a refuge. With an east wind Thou breakest

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

the ships of Tarshish, we see that the rhythm is not called into
existence as a necessity of such expansion of the thought, but vice
versa this mode of expanding the thought results from the requirements
of the rhythm. Here is neither synonymous or identical (tautological),
nor antithetical, nor synthetical parallelism, but merely that which De
Wette calls rhythmical, merely the rhythmical rise and fall, the
diastole and systole, which poetry is otherwise (without binding itself)
wont to accomplish by two different kinds of ascending and descending
logical organization. The ascending and descending rhythm does not
usually exist within the compass of one line, but it is distributed over
two lines which bear the relation to one another of rhythmical
antecedent and consequent, of proodo's and epoodo's. This distich is the
simplest ground-form of the strophe, which is visible in the earliest
song, handed down to us, [Gen 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#023.md).
The whole Ps 119 is composed in such distichs, which is the usual form
of the apophthegm; the acrostic letter stands there at the head of each
distich, just as at the head of each line in the likewise distichic
pair, Ps 111-112. The tristich is an outgrowth from the distich, the
ascending rhythm being prolonged through two liens and the fall
commencing only in the third, e.g., [Psa
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md) (the ח of this alphabetical
Psalm):

Have not the sins of my youth and my transgressions in remembrance,

According to Thy mercy remember Thou me

For Thy goodness' sake, O Jahve!

This at least is the natural origin of the tristich, which moreover in
connection with a most varied logical organization still has the
inalienable peculiarity, that the full fall is reserved until the third
line, e.g., in the first two strophes of the Lamentations of Jeremiah,
where each line is a long line in two parts consisting of rise and fall,
the principal fall, however, after the caesura of the third long line,
closes the strophe:

Ah! how doth the city sit solitary, otherwise full of people! She is
become as a widow, the great one among nations, The princess among
provinces, she is become tributary. By night she weepeth sore and her
tears are upon her cheeks; There is not one to comfort her of all her
lovers, All her friends have betrayed her, they are become her enemies.
If we now further enquire, whether Hebrew poesy goes beyond these
simplest beginnings of the strophe-formation and even extends the
network of the rhythmical period, by combining the two and three line
strophe with ascending and descending rhythm into greater strophic
wholes rounded off into themselves, the alphabetical Ps 37 furnishes us
with a safe answer to the question, for this is almost entirely
tetrastichic, e.g.,

About evil-doers fret not thyself,

About the workers of iniquity be thou not envious.

For as grass they shall soon be cut down,

And as the green herb they shall wither,

but it admits of the compass of the strophe increasing even to the
pentastich, ([Psa 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025.md), [Psa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026).md) since the unmistakeable
landmarks of the order, the letters, allow a freer movement:

Now I, who once was young, am become old,

Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken

And his seed begging bread.

He ever giveth and lendeth

And his seed is blessed.

From this point the sure guidance of the alphabetical Psalms

(Note: Even the older critics now and then supposed that we were to make
these Ps. the starting point of our enquiries. For instance, Serpilius
says: "It may perhaps strike some one whether an opinion as to some of
the modes of the Davidic species of verse and poetry might not be formed
from his, so-to-speak, alphabetical psalms.")

fails us in investigating the Hebrew strophe-system. But in our further
confirmatory investigations we will take with us from these Psalms, the
important conclusion that the verse bounded by Sôph pasûk, the placing
of which harmonizes with the accentuation first mentioned in the
post-Talmudic tractate Sofrim,

(Note: Even if, and this is what Hupfeld and Riehm (Luth. Zeitschr.
1866, S. 300) advance, the Old Testament books were divided into verses,
פסוקים, even before the time of the Masoretes, still the division into
verses, as we now have it and especially that of the three poetical
books, is Masoretic.)

is by no means (as, since Kster, 1831, it has been almost universally
supposed) the original form of the strophe but that strophes are a whole
consisting of an equal or symmetrical number of stichs.

(Note: It was these stichs, of which the Talmud (B. Kiddushin 30 a)
counts eight more in the Psalter than in the Thra, viz., 5896, which
were originally called פסוקים. Also in Augustine we find versus thus
used like στίχος. With him the words Populus ejus et oves pascuae ejus
are one versus. There is no Hebrew MS which could have formed the basis
of the arrangement of the Psalms in stichs; those which we possess only
break the Masoretic verse, (if the space of the line admits of it) for
ease of writing into the two halves, without even regarding the general
injunction in c. xiv. of the tractate Sofrim and that of Ben-Bileam in
his Horajoth ha-Kore, that the breaks are to be regulated by the
beginnings of the verses and the two great pausal accents. Nowhere in
the MSS, which divide and break up the words most capriciously, is there
to be seen any trace of the recognition of those old פסוקים being
preserved. These were not merely lines determined by the space, as were
chiefly also the στίχοι or ἔπη according to the number of which, the
compass of Greek works was recorded, but liens determined by the sense,
κῶλα (Suidas: κῶλον ὁ ἀπηρτισμένην ἔννοιαν ἔχων στίχος), as Jerome wrote
his Latin translation of the Old Testament after the model of the Greek
and Roman orators (e.g., the MSS of Demosthenes), per cola et commata
i.e., in lines breaking off according to the sense.)

Hupfeld (Ps. iv. 450) has objected against this, that "this is
diametrically opposed to the nature of rhythm = parallelism, which
cannot stand on one leg, but needs two, that the distich is therefore
the rhythmical unit." But does it therefore follow, that a strophe is to
be measured according to the number of distichs? The distich is itself
only the smallest strophe, viz., one consisting of two lines. And it is
even forbidden to measure a greater strophe by the number of distichs,
because the rhythmical unit, of which the distich is the ground-form,
can just as well be tristichic, and consequently these so-called
rhythmical units form neither according to time nor space parts of equal
value. But this applies still less to the Masoretic verses. True, we
have shown in our larger Commentary on the Psalms, ii. 522f., in
agreement with Hupfeld, and in opposition to Ewald, that the
accentuation proceeds upon the law of dichotomy. But the Masoretic
division of the verses is not only obliged sometimes to give up the law
of dichotomy, because the verse (as e.g., [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md); [Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md); [Psa
92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009).md), does not admit of being
properly divided into two parts; and it subjects not only verses of
three members (as e.g., [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md); [Psa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002).md) in which the third member is
embellishingly or synthetically related to the other two - both are
phenomena which in themselves furnish proof in favour of the relative
independence of the lines of the verse - but also verses of four members
where the sense requires it (as [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md); [Psa
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016).md) and where it does not require
it (as [Psa 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015.md); [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006).md), to the law of dichotomy. And
these Masoretic verses of such various compass are to be the constituent
parts according to which strophes of a like cipher shall be measured! A
strophe only becomes a strophe by virtue of its symmetrical relation to
others, to the ear it must have the same time, to the eye the same form
and it must consequently represent the same number of lines (clauses).
The fact of these clauses, according to the special characteristic of
Hebrew poetry, moving on with that rising and falling movement which we
call parallelism until they come to the close of the strophe where it
gently falls to rest, is a thing sui generis, and, within the province
of the strophe, somewhat of a substitute for metre; but the strophe
itself is a section which comes to thorough repose by this species of
rhythmical movement. So far, then, from placing the rhythm on one leg
only, we give it its two: but measure the strophe not by the two feet of
the Masoretic verses or even couplets of verses, but by the equal, or
symmetrically alternating number of the members present, which consist
mostly of two feet, often enough however of three, and sometimes even of
four feet.

Whether and how a psalm is laid out in strophes, is shown by seeing
first of all what its pauses are, where the flow of thoughts and
feelings falls in order to rise anew, and then by trying whether these
pauses have a like or symmetrically correspondent number of stichs
(e.g., 6. 6. 6. 6 or 6. 7. 6. 7) or, if their compass is too great for
them to be at once regarded as one strophe, whether they cannot be
divided into smaller wholes of an equal or symmetrical number of stichs.
For the peculiarity of the Hebrew strophe does not consist in a run of
definite metres closely united to form one harmonious whole (for
instance, like the Sapphic strophe, which the four membered verses, [Isa
16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md), with their short closing
lines corresponding to the Adonic verse, strikingly resemble), but in a
closed train of thought which is unrolled after the distichic and
tristichic ground-form of the rhythmical period. The strophe-schemata,
which are thus evolved, are very diverse. We find not only that all the
strophes of a poem are of the same compass (e.g., 4. 4. 4. 4), but also
that the poem is made up of symmetrical relations formed of strophes of
different compass. The condition laid down by some,

(Note: For instance Meier in his Geschichte der poetischen
Nationalliteratur der Hebrer, S. 67, who maintains that strophes of
unequal length are opposed to the simplest laws of the lyric song and
melody. But the demands which melody imposes on the formation of the
verse and the strophe were not so stringent among the ancients as now,
and moreover - is not the sonnet a lyric poem?)

that only a poem that consists of strophes of equal length can be
regarded as strophic, is refuted not only by the Syriac

(Note: Vid., Zingerle in the Dm. M. Z. x. 123, 124.)

but also by the post-biblical Jewish poetry.

(Note: Vid., Zunz, Synagogale Poesie des Mittelalters, S. 92-94.)

We find the following variations: strophes of the same compass followed
by those of different compass (e.g., 4. 4. 6. 6); as in the chiasmus,
the outer and inner strophes of the same compass (e.g., 4. 6. 6. 4); the
first and third, the second and fourth corresponding to one another
(e.g., 4. 6. 4. 6); the mingling of the strophes repeated
antistrophically, i.e., in the inverted order (e.g., 4. 6. 7. 7. 6. 4);
strophes of equal compass surrounding one of much greater compass (e.g.,
4. 4. 10. 4. 4), what Kster calls the pyramidal schema; strophes of
equal compass followed by a short closing stanza (e.g., 3. 3. 2); a
longer strophe forming the base of the whole (e.g., 5. 3. 3. 7), and
these are far from being all the different figures, which the Old
Testament songs and more especially the Psalms present to us, when we
arrange their contents in stichs.

With regard to the compass of the strophe, we may expect to find it
consisting of as many as twelve lines according to the Syrian and the
synagogue poetry. The line usually consists of three words, or at least
only of three larger words; in this respect the Hebrew exhibits a
capacity for short but emphatic expressions, which are inadmissible in
German \[or English\]. This measure is often not uniformly preserved
throughout a considerable length, not only in the Psalms but also in the
Book of Job. For there is far more reason for saying that the strophe
lies at the basis of the arrangement of the Book of Job, than for G.
Hermanjn's observation of strophic arrangement in the Bucolic writers
and Kchly's in the older portions of Homer.

7\. Temple Music and Psalmody

The Thra contains no directions respecting the use of song and music in
divine worship except the commands concerning the ritualistic use of
silver trumpets to be blown by the priests (Numbers 10). David is really
the creator of liturgical music, and to his arrangements, as we see from
the Chronicles, every thing was afterwards referred, and in times when
it had fallen into disuse, restored. So long as David lived, the
superintendence of the liturgical music was in his hands ([Ch1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002).md). The instrument by means of
which the three choir-masters (Heman, Asaph, and Ethan-Jeduthun)
directed the choir was the cymbals (מצלתּים or צלצלים)

(Note: Talmudic צלצל. The usual Levitic orchestra of the temple of Herod
consisted of 2 Nabla players, 9 Cithern players and one who struck the
Zelazal, viz., Ben-Arza (Erachin 10 a, etc.; Tamid vii. 3), who also had
the oversight of the duchan (Tosiphta to Shekalim ii).)

which served instead of wands for beating time; the harps (נבלים)
represented the soprano, and the bass (the male voice in opposition to
the female) was represented by the citherns an octave lower ([Ch1
15:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017).md), which, to infer from the
word לנצּח used there, were used at the practice of the pieces by the
מנצּח appointed. In a Psalm where סלה is appended (vid., on [Psa
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001).md), the stringed instruments
(which הגּיון סלה [Job 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#017.md) definitely
expresses), and the instruments generally, are to join in

(Note: Comp. Mattheson's "Erlutertes Selah" 1745: Selah is a word
marking a prelude, interlude, or after-piece with instruments, a sign
indicating the places where the instruments play alone, in short a
so-called ritornello.)

in such a way as to give intensity to that which is being sung. To these
instruments, besides those mentioned in [Psa
150:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001.md); [Sa2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005.md), belonged also the flute, the
liturgical use of which (vid., on [Psa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001).md) in the time of the first as of
the second Temple is undoubted: it formed the peculiar musical
accompaniment of the hallel (vid., [Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001).md) and of the nightly
torch-light festival on the semi-festival days of the Feast of
Tabernacles (Succa 15 a). The trumpets (חצצרות) were blown exclusively
by the priests to whom no part was assigned in the singing (as probably
also the horn שׁופר [Psa 81:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004.md); [Psa
98:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#006.md); [Psa
150:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#003).md), and according to [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md). (where the number of the two
Mosaic trumpets appears to be raised to 120) took their turn unisono
with the singing and the music of the Levites. At the dedication of
Solomon's Temple the Levites sing and play and the priests sound
trumpets נגדּם, [Ch2 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006.md), and at the
inauguration of the purified Temple under Hezekiah the music of the
Levites and priests sound in concert until all the burnt offerings are
laid upon the altar fire, and then (probably as the wine is being poured
on) began (without any further thought of the priests) the song of the
Levites, [Ch2 29:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#026.md). In the second
Temple it was otherwise: the sounding of the trumpets by the priests and
the Levitical song with its accompanying music alternated, they were not
simultaneous. The congregation did not usually sing with the choir, but
only uttered their Amen; nevertheless they joined in the Hallel and in
some psalms after the first clause with its repetition, after the second
with hallelujah (Maimonides, Hilchoth Megilla, 3). [Ch1
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036.md) points to a similar arrangement
in the time of the first Temple. Just so does [Jer
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011.md) in reference to the "Give thanks
unto the Lord, for He is good." Antiphonal singing in the part of the
congregation is also to be inferred from [Ezr
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md). The Psalter itself is moreover
acquainted with an allotment of the עלמות, comp. משׁררות [Ezr

Nehemiah ([Neh 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027)..md) at the
dedication of the city walls placed the Levites in two great companies
which are there called תודות, in the midst of the procession moving
towards the Temple. In the time of the second Temple each day of the
week had its psalm. The psalm for Sunday was 24, for Monday 48, Tuesday
82, Wednesday 94, Thursday 81, Friday 93, the Sabbath 92. This
arrangement is at least as old as the time of the Ptolemies and the
Seleucidae, for the statements of the Talmud are supported by the
inscriptions of [Psa 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md); [Psa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md); [Psa
94:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001.md); [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md) in the lxx, and as respects the
connection of the daily psalms with the drink-offering, by Sir.
50:14-16. The psalms for the days of the week were sung, to wit, at the
time of the drink-offering (נסך) which was joined with the morning
Tamı̂d:

(Note: According to the maxim אין אומר שׁירה אלא על היין, "no one
singeth except over the wine.")

two priests, who stood on the right and left of the player upon the
cymbal (Zelazal) by whom the signal was given, sounded the trumpets at
the nine pauses (פרקים), into which it was divided when sung by the
Levites, and the people bowed down and worshipped.

(Note: B. Rosh ha-Shana, 31a. Tamd vii. 3, comp. the introduction to
[Psa 24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md); [Psa
92:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001) and Ps 94..md)

The Levites standing upon the suggestus (דּוּבן) - i.e., upon a broad
staircase consisting of a few steps, which led up from the court of the
laity to that of the priests-who were both singers and musicians, and
consequently played only on stringed instruments and instruments of
percussion, not wind-instruments, were at least twelve in number, with 9
citherns, 2 harps, and one cymbal: on certain days the flute was added
to this number.

(Note: According to B. Erachin 10a the following were the customary
accompaniments of the daily service: 1) 21 trumpet blasts, to as many as
48; (2) 2 nablas, to 6 at most; 2 flutes (חלילין), to 12 at most.
Blowing the flute is called striking the flute, הכּה החליל. On 12 days
of the year the flute was played before the altar: on the 14th of Nisan
at the slaying of the Passover (at which the Hallel was sung), on the
14th of Ijar at the slaying of the little Passover, on the 1st and 7th
days of the Passover and on the eight days of the Feast of Tabernacles.
The mouth-piece (אבּוּב according to the explanation of Maimonides) was
not of metal but a reed (comp. Arab. anbûb, the blade of the reed),
because it sounds more melodious. And it was never more than one flute
(אבוב יחידי, playing a solo), which continued at the end of a strain and
closed it, because this produces the finest close (חלּוּק). On the 12
days mentioned, the Hallel was sung with flute accompaniment. On other
days, the Psalm appointed for the day was accompanied by nablas, cymbals
and citherns. This passage of the treatise Erachin also tells who were
the flute-players. On the flute-playing at the festival of
water-drawing, vid., my Geschichte der jdischen Poesie S. 195. In the
Temple of Herod, according to Erachin 10b, there was also an organ. This
was however not a water-organ (הדוליס, hydraulis), but a wind-organ
(מגרפה) with a hundred different tones (מיני זמר), whose thunder-like
sound, according to Jerome (Opp. ed. Mart. v. 191), was heard ab
Jerusalem usque ad montem Oliveti et amplius, vid., Saalschtz, Archol.
i. 281-284.)

The usual suggestus on the steps at the side of the altar was changed
for another only in a few cases; for it is noticed as something special
that the singers had a different position at the festival of
water-drawing during the Feast of Tabernacles (vid., introduction to
[Psa 120:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001).md), and that the
flute-players who accompanied the Hallel stood before the altar, לפני
המזכח (Erachin 10a). The treble was taken by the Levite youths, who
stood below the suggestus at the feet of the Levites (vid., on [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001).md). The daily שׁיר הקרבן (i.e.,
the week-day psalm which concluded the morning sacrifice) was sung in
nine (or perhaps more correctly 3)

(Note: This is the view of Maimonides, who distributes the 9
trumpet-blasts by which the morning sacrifice, according to Succa 53b,
was accompanied, over the 3 pauses of the song. The hymn Haaznu, Deut
32, which is called הלוים שׁירת par excellence, was sung at the Sabbath
Musaph-sacrifice - each Sabbath a division of the hymn, which was
divided into six parts - so that it began anew on every seventh Sabbath,
vid., J. Megilla, sect. iii, ad fin.)

pauses, and the pauses were indicated by the trumpet-blasts of the
priests (vid., on Ps 38; [Psa 81:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#004).md).
Beside the seven Psalms which were sung week by week, there were others
appointed for the services of the festivals and intervening days (vid.,
on Ps 81), and in Biccurim 3, 4 we read that when a procession bearing
the firstfruits accompanied by flute playing had reached the hill on
which the Temple stood and the firstfruits had been brought up in
baskets, at the entrance of the offerers into the Azara, [Psa
30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md) was struck up by the Levites.
This singing was distinct from the mode of delivering the Tefilla (vid.,
on Ps 44 ad fin.) and the benediction of the priests (vid., on [Psa
67:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001).md), both of which were
unaccompanied by music. Distinct also, as it seems, from the mode of
delivering the Hallel, which was more as a recitative, than sung
(Pesachim 64a, קראוּ את ההלל). It was probably similar to the Arabic,
which delights in shrieking, long-winded, trilling, and especially also
nasal tones. For it is related of one of the chief singers that in order
to multiply the tones, he placed his thumb in his mouth and his fore
finger ביו הנימין (between the hairs, i.e., according to Rashi: on the
furrow of the upper lip against the partition of the nostrils), and thus
(by forming mouth and nose into a trumpet) produced sounds, before the
volume of which the priests started back in astonishment.

(Note: Vid., B. Joma 38b and J. Shekalim v. 3, comp. Canticum Rabba on
Canticles [Psa 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006)..md)

This mode of psalm-singing in the Temple of Herod was no longer the
original mode, and if the present accentuation of the Psalms represents
the fixed form of the Temple song, it nevertheless does not convey to us
any impression of that before the Exile. It does, however, neither the
one nor the other.

The accents are only musical, and indirectly interpunctional, signs for
the chanting pronunciation of the synagogue. And moreover we no longer
possess the key to the accents of the three metrical (i.e., consisting
of symmetrical stichs and strophes) books as musical signs. For the
so-called Sarkatables (which give the value of the accents as notes,
beginning with Zarka, זרקא), e.g., at the end of the second edition of
Ngelsbach's Gramm., relate only to the reading of the pentateuchal and
prophetic pericope, - consequently to the system of prose accents. In
the German synagogue there is no tradition concerning the value of the
so-called metrical accents as notes, for the Psalms were not recited
according to the accents; but for all the Psalms, there are only two
different modes, at least in the German ritual, viz., 1) the customary
one according to which verse after verse is recited by the leader and
the congregation, as e.g., [Psa 95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md);
[Psa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001) every Friday evening; and 2.md)
that peculiar to Ps 119 in which the first seven verses of the eight are
recited alternately by the leader and the congregation, but the eighth
as a concluding verse is always closed by the congregation with a
cadence. This psalmody does not always follow the accents. We can only
by supposition approximately determine how the Psalms were to be recited
according to them. For we still possess at least a few statements of
Ben-Asher, Shemtob and Moses Provenzalo (in his grammatical didactic
poem בּשׁם קדמון) concerning the intonation of single metrical accents.
Pazzer and Shalshleth have a like intonation, which rises with a trill;
though Shalshleth is more prolonged, about a third longer than that of
the prose books. Legarme (in form Mahpach or Azla followed by Psik) has
a clear high pitch, before Zinnor, however, a deeper and more broken
tone; Rebia magnum a soft tone tending to repose. By Silluk the tone
first rises and then diminishes. The tone of Mercha is according to its
name andante and sinking into the depths; the tone of Tarcha corresponds
to adagio. Further hints cannot be traced: though we may infer with
respect to Ole we-jored (Mercha mahpachatum) and Athnach, that their
intonation ought to form a cadence, as that Rebia parvum and Zinnor
(Zarka) had an intonation hurrying on to the following distinctive
accent. Further, if we place Dechi (Tiphcha initiale) and Rebia
gereshatum beside the remaining six servi among the notes, we may indeed
produce a sarka-table of the metrical accentuation, although we cannot
guarantee its exact agreement with the original manner of singing.

Following Gerbert (De musica sacra) and Martini (Storia della musica),
the view is at present very general that in the eight Gregorian tones
together with the extra tone (tonus peregrinus),

(Note: Vid., Friedr. Hommel's Psalter nach der deutschen Uebersetzung D.
M. Luthers fr den Gesang eingerichtet, 1859. The Psalms are there
arranged in stichs, rightly assuming it to be the original mode and the
most appropriate, that antiphonal song ought to alternate not according
to the verses, as at the present day in the Romish and English church,
but according to the two members of the verse.)

used only for [Psa 113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md) (=[Psa
114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001) in the Hebrew numeration.md), we
have a remnant of the ancient Temple song; and this in itself is by no
means improbable in connection with the Jewish nationality of the
primitive church and its gradual severance at the first from the Temple
and synagogue. In the convents of Bethlehem, which St. Paula founded,
psalms were sung at six hours of prayer from early morn till midnight,
and she herself was so well versed in Hebrew, ut Psalmos hebraice
caneret et sermonem absque ulla Latinae linguae proprietate personaret
(Ep. 108 ad Eustoch. c. 26). This points to a connection between the
church and synagogue psalm-melodies in the mos orientalium partium, the
oriental psalmody, which was introduced by Ambrose into the Milanese
church. Nevertheless, at the same time the Jewish element has undergone
scarcely any change; it has been developed under the influence of the
Greek style, but is, notwithstanding, still recognizable.

(Note: Vid., Saalschtz, Geschichte und Wrdigung der Musik bei den
Hebrern, 1829, S. 121, and Otto Strauss, Geschichtliche Betrachtung ber
den Psalter als Gesang-und Gebetbuch, 1859.)

Pethachja of Ratisbon, the Jewish traveller in the 12th century, when in
Bagdad, the ancient seat of the Geonim (גאונים), heard the Psalms sung
in a manner altogether peculiar;

(Note: Vid., Literaturblatt des Orients, 4th years, col. 541.)

and Benjamin of Tudela, in the same century, became acquainted in Bagdad
with a skilful singer of the Psalms used in divine worship. Saadia on
[Psa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md), infers from על־השׁמינית that
there were eight different melodies (Arab. 'l-hân). And eight נגינית are
also mentioned elsewhere;

(Note: Steinschneider, Jewish Literature p. 336f.)

perhaps not without reference to those eight church-tones, which are
also found among the Armenians.

(Note: Petermann, Ueber die Musik der Armenier in the Deutsche Morgenl.
Zeitschrift v. 368f.)

Moreover the two modes of using the accents in chanting, which are
attested in the ancient service-books,

(Note: Zunz, Synagogale Poesie, S. 115.)

may perhaps be not altogether unconnected with the distinction between
the festival and the simpler ferial manner in the Gregorian style of
church-music.

8\. Translations of the Psalms

The earliest translation of the Psalms is the Greek Alexandrine version.
When the grandson of the son of Sirach came to Egypt in the year 132
b.c., not only the Law and the Prophets, but also the Hagiographa were
already translated into the Greek; of course therefore also the Psalms,
by which the Hagiographa are directly named in [Luk
24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044). The story of the lxx (lxxII.md)
translators, in its original form, refers only to the Thra; the
translations of the other books are later and by different authors. All
these translators used a text consisting only of consonants, and these
moreover were here and there more or less indistinct; this text had
numerous glosses, and was certainly not yet, as later, settled on the
Masoretic basis. This they translated literally, in ignorance of the
higher exegetical and artistic functions of the translator, and
frequently the translation itself is obscure. From Philo, Josephus and
the New Testament we see that we possess the text of this translation
substantially in its original form, so that criticism, which since the
middle of the last century has acquired many hitherto unknown helps,

(Note: To this period belong 1) the Psalterium Veronense published by
Blanchini 1740, the Greek text in Roman characters with the Italic at
the side belonging to the 5th or 6th century (vid., Tischendorf's
edition of the lxx, 1856, Prolegg. p. lviii.f.); 2) the Psalterium
Turicense purpureum described by Breitinger 1748, Greek Text likewise of
the 5th or 6th century (vid., ibid. p. lix.f.); 3) Palmorum Fragmenta
papyraccea Londinensia (in the British Museum), [Psa
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002.md); 20:14-34:6, of the 4th century,
given in Tischendorf's Monumenta Sacra Inedita. Nova Collectio t. i.; 4)
Fragmenta Psalmorum Tischendorfiana [Psa
141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007.md), [Psa
142:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001.md), [Psa
144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md), of the 5th or 4th century in
the Monumenta t. ii. There still remain unused to the present time 1)
the Psalterium Graeco-Latinum of the library at St. Gall, Cod. 17 in
4to, Greek text in uncial characters with the Latin at the side; 2)
Psalterium Gallico-Romano-Hebraico-Graecum of the year 909, Cod. 230 in
the public library at Bamberg (vid., a description of this MS by
Schnfelder in the Serapeum, 1865, No. 21) written by Solomon, abbot of
St. Gall and bishop of Constance (d. 920), and brought to Bamberg by the
emperor Henry II (d. 1024), who had received it as a gift when in St.
Gall; as regards the criticism of the text of the lxx it is of like
importance with the Veronense which it resembles.)

more especially also in the province of the Psalms, will not need to
reverse its judgment of the character of the work. Nevertheless, this
translation, as being the oldest key to the understanding of the
language of the Old Testament writings, as being the oldest mirror of
the Old Testament text, which is not to be excepted from modest critical
investigation, and as an important check upon the interpretation of
Scripture handed down in the Talmud, in the Midrash, and in that portion
of the national literature in general, not originating in Egypt, - is
invaluable.

In one other respect this version claims a still greater significance.
Next to the Book of Isaiah, no book is so frequently cited in the New
Testament as the Psalter. The Epistle to the Hebrews has grown up
entirely from the roots of the language of the Old Testament psalms. The
Apocalypse, the only book which does not admit of being referred back to
any earlier formula as its basis, is nevertheless not without references
to the Psalter: [Psa 2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md) in
particular has a significant part in the moulding of the apocalyptic
conceptions and language. These New Testament citations, with few
exceptions (as [Joh 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018).md), are based
upon the lxx, even where this translation (as e.g., [Psa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md); [Psa
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006.md); [Psa
116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010).md), only in a general way,
correctly reproduces the original text. The explanation of this New
Testament use of the lxx is to be found in the high esteem in which this
translation was held among the Jewish people: it was accounted, not only
by the Hellenistic, but also by the Palestinian Jews, as a providential
and almost miraculous production; and this esteem was justified by the
fact, that, although altogether of unequal birth with the canonical
writings, it nevertheless occupies a position in the history of divine
revelation which forms a distinct epoch. For it was the first
opportunity afforded to the gentile world of becoming acquainted with
the Old Testament revelation, and thus the first introduction of Japheth
into the tents of Shem. At the same time therewith, a distinct breaking
down of the barriers of the Old Testament particularism was effected.
The Alexandrine translation was, therefore, an event which prepared the
way for that Christianity, in which the appointment of the religion of
Israel to be the religion of the world is perfected. This version, at
the outset, created for Christianity the language which it was to use;
for the New Testament Scriptures are written in the popular Greek
dialect (κοινή) with an Alexandrine colouring. And in a general way we
may say that Alexandrinism moulded the forms beforehand, which
Christianity was afterwards to fill up with the substance of the gospel.
As the way of Jesus Christ lay by Egypt ([Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015).md), so the way of Christianity also
lay by Egypt, and Alexandria in particular.

Equally worthy of respect on account of its antiquity and independence,
though not of the same importance as the lxx from a religio-historical
point of view, is the Targum or Chaldee version of the Psalms: a version
which only in a few passages assumed the form of a paraphrase with
reference to Midrash interpretations. The date of its composition is
uncertain. But as there was a written Targum to the Book of Job

(Note: Vid., Tosefta to Sabb. xvi. Jer. Sabb. xiv. 1, Bab. Sabb. 115a,
Sofrim v., 15.)

even during the time of the Temple, there was also a Targum of the
Psalms, though bearing in itself traces of manifold revisions, which
probably had its origin during the duration of the Temple. In
distinction from the Targums of Onkelos to the Pentateuch and of
Jonathan to the minor Prophets the Targum of the Psalms belongs to the
so-called Jerusalem group,

(Note: Vid., Geiger, Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel, S. 166f.)

for the Aramaic idiom in which it is written-while, as the Jerusalem
Talmud shows, it is always distinguished in no small degree from the
Palestinian popular dialect as being the language of the
literature-abounds in the same manner as the former in Greek words (as
אנגּלין ἄγγελοι, אכסדרין ἐξέδραι, קירים κύριος), and like it also
closely approximates, in sound and formation, to the Syriac. From this
translation which excels the lxx in grammatical accuracy and has at its
basis a more settled and stricter text, we learn the meaning of the
Psalms as understood in the synagogue, as the interpretation became
fixed, under the influence of early tradition, in the first centuries of
the Christian era. The text of the Targum itself is at the present day
in a very neglected condition. The most correct texts are to be found in
Buxtorf and Norzi's Bibles. Critical observations on the Targums of the
Hagiographa are given in the treatise עוטה אור by Benzion Berkowitz
(Wilna, 1843).

The third most important translation of the Psalms is the Peshı̂to, the
old version of the Syrian church, which was made not later than in the
second century. Its author translated from the original text, which he
had without the vowel points, and perhaps also in a rather incorrect
form: as is seen from such errors as [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015) (אמונתך instead of תמונתך.md), [Psa
83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012.md) (שדמו ואבדמי dele eos et perde
eos instead of שיתמו נדיבמו), [Psa
139:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#016.md) (גמלי retributionem meam
instead of גלמי). In other errors he is influenced by the lxx, as [Psa
56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009.md) (בנגדך lxx ἐνώπιόν σου instead of
בנאדך), he follows this version in such departures from the better text
sometimes not without additional reason, as [Psa
90:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005.md) (generationes eorum annus erunt,
i.e., זראותיו שׁנה יהיו, lxx τὰ ἐξουδενώματα αὐτῶν ἔτη ἔσονται), [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md) (populus tuus gloriosus, i.e.,
נדבוּת עמך in the sense of נדיבה, [Job
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#015.md), nobility, rank, lxx μετὰ σοῦ ἡ
ἀρχή). The fact that he had the lxx before him beside the original text
is manifest, and cannot be done away by the supposition that the text of
the Peshto has been greatly distorted out of the later Hexaplarian
translation; although even this is probable, for the lxx won such
universal respect in the church that the Syrians were almost ashamed of
their ancient version, which disagreed with it in many points, and it
was this very circumstance which gave rise in the year 617 a.d. to the
preparation of a new Syriac translation from the Hexaplarian lxx-text.
It is not however merely between the Peshto and the lxx, but also
between the Peshto and the Targum, that a not accidental mutual relation
exists, which becomes at once apparent in [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) (e.g., in the translation of
לצים by ממיקני and of תורת by נמוסא) and hardly admits of explanation by
the use of the Christian Peshto on the part of Jewish Targumist.

(Note: Although more recently we are told, Hai Gaon (in Babylonia) when
he came upon a difficult passage in his Academical lectures on the
Psalms enquired of the patriarch of the Eastern church how he
interpreted it, vid., Steinschneider, Jewish Literature, p. 125f.)

It may be more readily supposed that the old Syriac translator of the
Psalms, of whom we are now speaking, was a Jewish Christian and did not
despise the welcome assistance of the Targum, which was already at hand,
in whatever form it might be. It is evident that he was a Christian from
passages like [Psa 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md); [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md), also from [Psa
68:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#019.md) comp. with [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md); [Jer
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md) comp. with [Heb
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md); and his knowledge of the Hebrew
language, with which, as was then generally the case, the knowledge of
Greek was united, shows that he was a Jewish Christian. Moreover the
translation has its peculiar Targum characteristics: tropical
expressions are rendered literally, and by a remarkable process of
reasoning interrogative clauses are turned into express declarations:
[Psa 88:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md) is an instance of this
with a bold inversion of the true meaning to its opposite. In general
the author shuns no violence in order to give a pleasing sense to a
difficult passage e.g., [Psa 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006.md),
[Psa 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006.md). The musical and historical
inscriptions, and consequently also the סלה (including הגיון סלה [Psa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017).md) he leaves untranslated, and the
division of verses he adopts is not the later Masoretic. All these
peculiarities make the Peshto all the more interesting as a memorial in
exegetico-historical and critical enquiry: and yet, since Dathe's
edition, 1768, who took the text of Erpenius as his ground-work and
added valuable notes,

(Note: The fragments of the translation of the Ps., which are cited
under the name ὁ Σύρος, Dathe has also there collected in his preface.)

scarcely anything has been done in this direction.

In the second century new Greek translations were also made. The high
veneration which the lxx had hitherto enjoyed was completely reversed
when the rupture between the synagogue and the church took place, so
that the day when this translation was completed as no longer compared
to the day of the giving of the Law, but to the day of the golden calf.
Nor was it possible that it should be otherwise than that its defects
should become more and more perceptible. Even the New Testament writers
found it requiring correction here and there, or altogether unfit for
use, for the Palestinian text of the Old Testament which had been handed
down, was not merely as regards the consonants but also as to
pronunciation substantially the same as that which has been fixed by the
Masoretes since the sixth century. Consequently Aquila of Pontus (a
proselyte from heathenism to Judaism) in the first half of the 2nd
century, made a Greek translation of the Old Testament, which imitated
the original text word for word even at the risk of un-Greek
expressions, and in the choice of the Greek words used is determined by
the etymology of the Hebrew words. Not to lose any of the weighty words
he translates the first sentence of the Thra thus: Ἐν κεφαλαίῳ ἔκτισεν ὁ
Θεὸς σὺν (את) τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ σὺν (את) τὴν γῆν. In the fragments of the
translation of the Psalms, one of which has been preserved in the
Talmudic literature (vid., on Ps. 48:15), we do not meet with such
instances of violence in favour of literalness, although also even there
he forces the Greek into the form of the Hebrew, and always renders the
words according to their primary meaning (e.g., דביר χρηματιστήριον,
מגלה εἴλημα, פתח ἄνοιγμα, רהב ὅρμημα, אמן πεπιστευμένως), sometimes
unhappily and misled by the usage the language had acquired in his time.
In some passages he reads the text differently from our present pointing
(e.g., [Psa 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004) ὅταν ὑψωθῇ.md), but he
moreover follows the tradition (e.g., סלה ἀεὶ, שׁדי ἱκανός, מכתם τοῦ
ταπεινόφρονος καὶ ἁπλοῦ = מך ותם) and also does not despise whatever the
lxx may offer that is of any worth (e.g., במנים ἐν χορδαῖς), as his
translation throughout, although an independent one, relies more or less
upon the pioneering work of its predecessor, the lxx. His talent as a
translator is unmistakeable. He has perfect command of the Hebrew, and
handles the treasures of the Greek with a master-hand. For instance, in
the causative forms he is never in difficulty for a corresponding Greek
word (הפיל πτωματίζειν, הריץ δρομοῦν, השׂכיל ἐπιστημοῦν and the like).
The fact that he translated for the synagogue in opposition to the
church is betrayed by passages like [Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md); [Psa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017.md); [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md) and perhaps also [Psa
84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md), comp. [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), where he prefers ἠλειμμένου to
Χριστοῦ: nevertheless one must not in this respect charge him with evil
intentions throughout. Even Jerome, on calmer reflection, moderated his
indignation against Aquila's translation to a less harsh judgment: ut
amicae menti fatear, quae ad nostram fidem pertineant roborandam plura
reperio, and praised it even at the expense of the translations of
Theodotion and Symmachus: Isti Semichristiani Judaice transtulerunt, et
Judaeus Aquila interpretatus est ut Christianus.

The translation of Theodotion is not an original work. It is based upon
the lxx and brings this version, which was still the most widely used,
into closer relation to the original text, by making use of Aquila's
translation. The fragments that are preserved to us of passages
independently translated contain nothing pre-eminently characteristic.
Symmachus also takes the lxx as his basis, but in re-moulding it
according to the original text he acts far more decidedly and
independently than Theodotion, and distinguishes himself from Aquila by
endeavouring to unite literalness with clearness and verbal accuracy:
his translation of the Psalms has even a poetic inspiration about it.
Both Aquila and Symmachus issued their translations twice, so that some
passages are extant translated in a twofold form (vid., [Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003).md).

Beside the lxx Aq. Symm. and Theod. there are also a fifth, sixth and
seventh Greek translation of the Psalms. The fifth is said to have been
found in Jericho under the emperor Caracalla, the sixth in Nicopolis
under the emperor Alexander Severus. The former, in its remains, shows a
knowledge of the language and tradition, the latter is sometimes ([Psa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md); [Hab
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013).md) paraphrastic. A seventh is also
mentioned besides, it is not like Theodotion. In the Hexapla of Origen,
which properly contains only six columns (the Hebrew text, the Hebr.
text in Greek characters, Aq., Symm., lxx, Theod.), in the Ps. and
elsewhere a Quinta (Ε), Sexta (ς), and Septima (Ζ) are added to these
six columns: thus the Hexapla (apart from the Seventh) became an
Octapla. Of the remains of these old versions as compiled by Origen,
after the labours of his predecessors Nobilius and Drusius, the most
complete collection is that of Bernard de Montfaucon in his Hexaplorum
Origenis quae supersunt (2 vols. folio, Paris 1713); the rich gleanings
since handed down from many different quarters

(Note: Thus e.g., Montfaucon was only able to make use of the Psalter-MS
Cod. Vat. 754 for 16 Psalms; Adler has compared it to the end and found
in it valuable Hexapla fragments (vid., Repert. fr Bibl. u. Morgenl.
Lit. xiv. S. 183f.). The Psalm-commentary of Barhebraeus and the
Psalterium Mediolanense have also been begun to be worked with this
object; but as yet, not the Syriac Psalter of the Medici library
mentioned by Montfaucon, Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum i. 240 and supposed
to be based upon the Quinta.)

are unfortunately still scattered and uncollated.

Euthymius Zigadenus mentions beside the lxx, Aq., Symm., Theod., V, and
VI, as a Seventh version that of Lucian which attempts to restore the
original Septuagint-text by a comparison with the original text. Lucian
died as a martyr 311 a.d. in Nicomedia, whither he had been dragged from
Antioch. The autograph of this translation was found in Nicomedia,
hidden in a small rough-plastered tower.

(Note: Comp. the Athanasian synopsis in Montfaucon, Hexapla t. 1 p. 59
and the contribution from a Syriac MS in the Repertorium fr Bibl. u.
Morgenl. Lit. ib. (1784) S. 48f.)

We are as little able to form a conception of this Septuagint-recension
of Lucian as of that of the contemporary Egyptian bishop Hesychius,
since not a single specimen of either is extant. It would be interesting
to know the difference of treatment of the two critics from that of
Origen, who corrected the text of the κοινή after the Hebrew original by
means of Theodotion's, obelis jugulans quae abundare videbantur, et quae
deerant sub asteriscis interserens, which produced a confusion that
might easily have been foreseen.

From the Old Latin translation, the so-called Itala, made from the lxx,
we possess the Psalter complete: Blanchini has published this
translation of the Psalms (1740) from the Veronese Psalter, and
Sabbatier in the second volume of his Latinae Versiones Antiquae (1751)
from the Psalter of the monastery of St. Germain. The text in Faber
Stapulensis' Quincuplex Pslaterium (1509) is compiled from Augustine;
for Augustine, like Hilary, Ambrose, Prosper, and Cassiodorus, expounds
the Psalms according to the old Latin text. Jerome first of all
carefully revised this in Rome, and thus originated the Psalterium
Romanum, which has been the longest retained by the church of Milan and
the Basilica of the Vatican. He then in Bethlehem prepared a second more
carefully revised edition, according to the Hexaplarian Septuagint-text

(Note: Illud breviter admoneo - says Jerome, Ep. cvi. ad Sunniam et
Fretelam - ut sciatis, aliam esse editionem, quam Origenes et
Caesareensis Eusebius omnesque Graeciae tractatores Koinee'n id est,
Communem appellant atque Vulgatam et a plerisque nunc Λουκιανός dicitur;
aliam Septuaginta Interpretum, quae in Ἑξαπλοῖς codicibus reperitur et a
nobis in Latinum sermonem fideliter versa est et Hierosolymae atque in
Orientis ecclesiis decantatur.)

with daggers (as a sign of additions in the lxx contrary to the
original) and asterisks (a sign of additions in the lxx from Theodotion
in accordance with the original), and this second edition which was
first adopted by the Gallican churches obtained the name of the
Psalterium Gallicanum. It is not essentially different from the Psalter
of the Vulgate, and appeared, with its critical signs, from a MS of
Bruno, bishop of Wrzburg (died 1045), for the first time in the year
1494 (then edited by Cochleus, 1533): both Psalters, the Romish and the
Gallican, are placed opposite one another in Faber's Quincuplex
Psalterium, in t. x. p. 1 of the Opp. Hieronymi, ed. Vallarsi and
elsewhere.

The Latin Psalters, springing from the common or from the Hexaplarian
Septuagint-text, as also the Hexapla-Syriac and the remaining Oriental
versions based upon the lxx and the Peshto, have only an indirectly
exegetico-historical value. On the contrary Jerome's translation of the
Psalter, juxta Hebraicam veritatem, is the first scientific work of
translation, and, like the whole of his independent translation of the
Old Testament from the original text, a bold act by which he has
rendered an invaluable service to the church, without allowing himself
to be deterred by the cry raised against such innovations. This
independent translation of Jerome has become the Vulgate of the church:
but in a text in many ways estranged from its original form, with the
simple exception of the Psalter. For the new translation of this book
was opposed by the inflexible liturgical use it had attained; the texts
of the Psalterium Romanum and Gallicanum maintained their ground and
became (with the omission of the critical signs) an essential portion of
the Vulgate. On this account it is the more to be desired that Jerome's
Latin Psalter ex Hebraeo (Opp. ed. Vallarsi t. ix. p. 333) were made
more generally known and accessible by a critical edition published
separately. It is not necessary to search far for critical helps for
such an undertaking. There is an excellent MS, Cod. 19, in the library
of St. Gall, presented by the abbot Hartmot (died 895).

Origen and Jerome learnt the language of the Old Testament from Jewish
teachers. All the advantages of Origen's philological learning are lost
to us, excepting a few insignificant remains, with his Hexapla: this
gigantic bible which would be the oldest direct monument of the Old
Testament text if it were but extant. Whereas in Jerome's Old Testament
translated from the original text (canon Hebraicae veritatis) we have
the maturest fruit of the philological attainments of this
indefatigable, steady investigator inspired with a zeal for knowledge.
It is a work of the greatest critical and historical value in reference
to language and exegesis. The translation of the Psalter is dedicated to
Sophronius who had promised to translate it into Greek: this Greek
translation is not preserved to us.

Jerome's translation of the Psalter has not its equal either in the
synagogue or the church until the time of Saadia Gaon of Fajum, the
Arabian translator of the Psalms. Two MSS of his translation of the
Psalms are to be found at Oxford; but the most important, which also
contains his annotations complete, is in Munich. Schnurrer (1791)
contributed [Psa 16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md); 40 and [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) to Eichhorn's Biblioth. der
Bibl. Lit. iii, from Cod. Pocock. 281, then Haneberg (1840) Ps 68 and
several others from the Munich Cod.; the most extensive excerpts from
Cod. Pocock. 281 and Cod. Huntingt. 416 (with various readings from Cod.
Mon. appended) are given by Ewald in the first vol. of his Beitrge zur
ltesten Ausleg. u. Spracherklrung des A. T. 1844. The gain which can be
drawn from Saadai for the interpretation of the Psalms, according to the
requirements of the present day, is very limited; but he promises a more
interesting and rich advantage to philology and the history of exegesis.
Saadia stands in the midst of the still ever mysterious process of
development out of which the finally established and pointed text of the
Old Testament came forth. He has written a treatise on the punctuation
(ניקוד) to which Rashi refers in [Psa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010.md), but in his treatment of the Old
Testament text shows himself to be unfettered by its established
punctuation. His translation is the first scientific work on the Psalms
in the synagogue. The translation of Jerome is five hundred years older,
but only the translation of Luther has been able to stand side by side
with it and that because he was the first to go back to the fountain
head of the original text.

The task, which is assigned to the translator of the sacred Scriptures,
was recognised by Luther as by no one before him, and he has discharged
it as no one up to the present day since his time has done. What Cicero
said of his translation of the two controversial speeches of Demosthenes
and Aeschines holds good also of Luther: Non converti ut interpres, sed
ut orator, sententiis iisdem et earum formis tanquam figuris, verbis ad
nostram consuetudinem aptis: in quibus non verbum pro verbo necesse
habui reddere, sed genus omnium verborum vimque servavi; non enim ea me
adnumerare lectori putavi oportere, sed tanquam adpendere - he has lived
in thought and feeling in the original text in order not to reproduce it
literally with a slavish adherence to its form, but to re-mould it into
good and yet spiritually renewed German and at the same time to preserve
its spirit free and true to its deepest meaning. This is especially the
case with his translation of the Psalms, in which even Moses Mendelssohn
has thought it to his advantage to follow him. To deny that here and
there it is capable of improvement by a more correct understanding of
the sense and in general by greater faithfulness to the original
(without departing from the spirit of the German language), would
indicate an ungrateful indifference to the advance which has been made
in biblical interpretation - an advance not merely promised, but which
we see actually achieved.

9\. History of the Exposition of the Psalms

If we now take a glance over the history of the exposition of the
Psalms, we shall see from it how late it was before the proper function
of scientific exposition was recognised. We begin with the apostolic
exposition. The Old Testament according to its very nature tends towards
and centres in Christ. Therefore the innermost truth of the Old
Testament has been revealed in the revelation of Jesus Christ. But not
all at once: His passion, resurrection, and ascension are three steps of
this progressive opening up of the Old Testament, and of the Psalms in
particular. Our Lord himself, both before and after His resurrection,
unfolded the meaning of the Psalms from His own life and its
vicissitudes; He showed how what was written in the Law of Moses, in the
Prophets and in the Psalms was fulfilled in Him; He revealed to His
disciples the meaning τοῦ συνιέναι τάς γραφάς [Luk
24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044.md). Jesus Christ's exposition of
the Psalms is the beginning and the goal of Christian
Psalm-interpretation. This began, as that of the Christian church, and
in fact first of all that of the Apostles, at Pentecost when the Spirit,
whose instrument David acknowledges himself to have been ([Sa2
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#002).md), descended upon the Apostles as
the Spirit of Jesus, the fulfiller and fulfilment of prophecy. This
Spirit of the glorified Jesus completed what, in His humiliation and
after His resurrection, he had begun: He opened up to the disciples the
meaning of the Psalms. How strongly they were drawn to the Psalms is
seen from the fact that they are quoted about seventy times in the New
Testament, which, next to Isaiah, is more frequently than any other Old
Testament book. From these interpretations of the Psalms the church will
have to draw to the end of time. For only the end will be like the
beginning and even surpass it. But we must not seek in the New Testament
Scriptures what they are not designed to furnish, viz., an answer to
questions belonging to the lower grades of knowledge, to grammar, to
contemporary history and to criticism. The highest and final questions
of the spiritual meaning of Scripture find their answer here; the
grammatico-historico-critical under-structure, - as it were, the
candlestick of the new light, - it was left for succeeding ages to
produce.

The post-apostolic, patristic exposition was not capable of this. The
interprets of the early church with the exception of Origen and Jerome
possessed no knowledge of the Hebrew tongue, and even these two not
sufficient to be able to rise to freedom from a dependence upon the lxx
which only led them into frequent error. Of Origen's Commentary and
Homilies on the Ps. we possess only fragments translated by Rufinus, and
his ὑπόμνημα εἰς τοὺς ψαλμοὺς (edited complete by Kleopas, 1855, from a
MS in the monastery of Mar-Saba). Jerome, contra Rufinum i. 19, indeed
mentions Commentarioli on the Ps. by himself, but the Breviarium in
Psalterium (in t. vii. p. ii. of his Opp. ed. Vallarsi) bearing his name
is allowed not to be genuine, and is worthless as regards the history of
the text and the language. The almost complete Commentary (on Ps 1-119
according to the Hebrew reckoning) of Eusebius, made known by Montfaucon
(Collectio nova Patrum et Scriptorum Graec. t. i.) is unsuspected.
Eusebius, though living in Palestine and having a valuable library at
command, is nevertheless so ignorant of the Hebrew, that he considers it
is possible Μαριαμ (מרחם) in [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) may refer to Mary. But by
contributions from the Hexapla he has preserved many acceptable
treasures of historical value in connection with the translation, but of
little worth in other respects, for the interpretation is superficial,
and capriciously allegorical and forced. Athanasius in his short
explanation of the Psalms (in t. i. p. ii. of the Benedictine edition)
is entirely dependent on Philo for the meaning of the Hebrew names and
words. His book: πρὸς Μαρκελλῖνον εἰς τὴν ἑρμηνείαν τῶν ψαλμῶν (in the
same vol. of the Benedictine edition) is a very beautiful essay. It
treats of the riches contained in the Psalms, classifies them according
to their different points of view, and gives directions how to use them
profitably in the manifold circumstances and moods of the outward and
inner life. Johann Reuchlin has translated this little book of
Athanasius into Latin, and Jrg Spalatin from the Latin of Reuchlin into
German (1516. 4to.). Of a similar kind are the two books of Gregory of
Nyssa εἰς τὴν ἐπιγραφὴν τῶν ψαλμῶν (Opp. ed. Paris, t. i.), which treat
of the arrangement and inscriptions; but in respect of the latter he is
so led astray by the lxx, that he sets down the want of titles of 12 Ps.
(this is the number according to Gregory), which have titles in the lxx,
to Jewish ἀπιστία and κακία. Nevertheless there are several valuable
observations in this introduction of the great Nyssene. About
contemporaneously with Athanasius, Hilarius Pictaviensis, in the Western
church, wrote his allegorizing (after Origen's example) Tractatus in
librum Psalmorum with an extensive prologue, which strongly reminds one
of Hippolytus'. We still have his exposition of Ps. 1, 2, 9, 13, 14, 51,
52, 53-69, 91, 118-150 (according to the numbering of the lxx);
according to Jerome (Ep. ad Augustin. cxii)

(Note: The following Greek expositors of the Psalms are mentioned there:
1) Origen, 2) Eusebius of Caesarea, 3) Theodore of Heraclea (the
Anonymus in Corderius' Catena), 4) Asterius of Scythopolis, 5)
Apollinaris (Apolinarios) of Laodicea, 6) Didymus of Alexandria. Then
the following Latin expositors: 1) Hilary of Poictiers, who translated
or rather remodelled Origen's Homilies on the Psalms (Jerome himself
says of him, Ep. lvii. ad Pammach.: captivos sensus in suam linguam
victoris jure transposuit), 2) Eusebius of Vercelli, translator of the
commentary of Eusebius of Caesarea, and 3) Ambrose, who was partly
dependent upon Origen. Of Apollinaris the elder, we have a Μετάφρασις
τοῦ ψαλτῆρος διὰ στὶχων ἡρωΐκῶν preserved to us. He has also translated
the Pentateuch and other Old Testament books into heroic verse.)

it is transferred from Origen and Eusebius. It is throughout ingenious
and pity, but more useful to the dogmatic theologian than the exegete
(t. xxvii., xxviii. of the Collectio Patrum by Caillau and Guillon).

(Note: Vid., the characteristics of this commentary in Reinkens,
Hilarius von Poitiers (1864) S. 291-308.)

Somewhat later, but yet within the last twenty years of the fourth
century (about 386-397), come Ambrose's Enarrationes in [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), 35-40, [Psa
43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md), 45, [Psa
47:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md), [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md), [Psa
61:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md), 118 (in t. ii. of the
Benedictine edition). The exposition of [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) is likewise an introduction to
the whole Psalter, taken partly from Basil. He and Ambrose have
pronounced the highest eulogiums on the Psalter. The latter says:
Psalmus enim benedictio populi est, Dei laus, plebis laudatio, plausus
omnium, sermo universorum, vox Ecclesiae, fidei canora confessio,
auctoritatis plena devotio, libertatis laetitia, clamor jucunditatis,
laetitiae resultatio. Ab iracundia mitigat, a sollicitudine abdicat, a
maerore allevat. Nocturna arma, diurna magisteria; scutum in timore,
festum in sanctitate, imago tranquillitatis, pignus pacis atque
concordiae, citharae modo ex diversis et disparibus vocibus unam
exprimens cantilenam. Diei ortus psalmum resultat, psalmum resonat
occasus. After such and similar prefatory language we are led to expect
from the exposition great fervour and depth of perception: and such are
really its characteristics, but not to so large an extent as might have
been the case had Ambrose - whose style of writing is as musical as that
of Hilary is stiff and angular - worked out these expositions, which
were partly delivered as sermons, partly dictated, and his own hand.

The most comprehensive work of the early church on the Psalms was that
of Chrysostom, which was probably written while at Antioch. We possess
only the exposition of 58 Ps. or (including [Psa
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md) and [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md), which in their present form
do not belong to this work) 60 Ps. (in t. v. of Montfaucon's edition).
Photius and Suidas place this commentary on the Psalms in the highest
rank among the works of Chrysostom. It is composed in the form of
sermons, the style is brilliant, and the contents more ethical than
dogmatic. Sometimes the Hebrew text according to the Hexapla is quoted,
and the Greek versions which depart from the original are frequently
compared, but, unfortunately, generally without any name. There is
hardly any trace in it of the renowned philologico-historical tendency
of the school of Antioch. Theodoret (in t. ii. p. ii. of the Halle
edition) was the first to set before himself the middle course between
an extravagant allegorising and an unspiritual adherence to the literal
historical sense (by which he doubtless has reference to Theodore of
Mopsuestia), and thus to a certain extent he makes a beginning in
distinguishing between the province of exegesis and practical
application. But this scientific commencement, with even more of the
grammatico-historical tendency, is still defective and wanting in
independence. For example, the question whether all the Psalms are by
David or not, is briefly decided in the affirmative, with κρατείτω τῶν
πλειόνων ἡ ψῆφος.

(Note: In the Talmud R. Meir, Pesachim 117 a, adopts the view that David
is the author of all the Ps.: כל תשׁבחות שׁבספר תהלים כולן דוד אמרן,
which in Bathra 14b ten authors are supposed: דוד כתב ספר תהלים על ידי
ערשׂה זקנים, vid., on this Midrash to [Sol
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004.md) and [Ecc
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md). In the former passage לתלפיות is
explained as an emblematic name of the Psalter: ספר שׁאמרוהו לו פיות
הרבה, the book of David, to which the mouths of many have contributed.
And there are two modern commentaries, viz., by Klauss, 1832, and
Randegger, 1841, which are written with the design of proving all the
Psalms to be Davidic.)

The designed, minute comparison of the Greek translators is most
thankworthy; in other respect, this expositor, like the Syrians
generally, is wanting in the mystic depth which might compensate for the
want of scientific insight. All this may be also said of Euthymius
Zigadenus (Zigabgenues): his commentary on the Psalms (in Greek in t.
iv. of the Venetian edition of the Opp. Theophylacti), written at the
desire of the emperor Alexius Comnenus, is nothing but a skilful
compilation, in the preparation of which he made good use of the
Psalm-catena, likewise a compilation, of the somewhat earlier Νικήτας
Σερρῶν,

(Note: This information is found in the modern Greek edition of
Euthemius' Commentary on the Ps. by Nicodemos the Agiorite (2 vols.
Constantinople 1819-21), which also contains extracts from this catena
of Nicetas Serronius.)

which is to be found on Mount Athos and is still unprinted.

The Western counterpart to Chrysostom's commentary are Augustine's
Enarrationes in Psalmos (in t. iv. of the Benedictine edition). The
psalm-singing in the Milaneses church had contributed greatly to
Augustine's conversion. But his love to his Lord was fired still more by
the reading of the Psalms when he was preparing himself in solitude for
his baptism. His commentary consists of sermons which he wrote down in
part himself and in part dictated. Only the thirty-two sermones on Ps
118 (119), which he ventured upon last of all, were not actually
delivered. He does not adopt the text of Jerome as his basis, but makes
use of the older Latin version, the original text of which he sought to
establish, and here and there to correct, by the lxx; whereas Arnobius,
the Semi-Pelagian, in his paraphrastic Africano-Latin commentary on the
Psalms (first edition by Erasmus, Basileae, Forben. 1522, who, as also
Trithemnius, erroneously regarded the author as one and the same with
the Apologist) no longer uses the so-called Itala, but takes Jerome's
translation as his basis. The work of Augustine far surpassing that of
Chrysostom in richness and depth of thought, has become, in the Western
church, the chief mine of all later exposition of the Psalms.
Cassiodorus in his Expositiones in omnes Psalmos (in t. ii. of the
Bened. ed.) draws largely from Augustine, though not devoid of
independence.

What the Greek church has done for the exposition of the Psalms has been
garnered up many times since Photius in so-called Σειραί, Catenae. That
of Nicetas archbishop of Serra in Macedonia (about 1070), is still
unprinted. One, extending only to Ps 50, appeared at Venice 1569, and a
complete one, edited by Corderius, at Antwerp 1643 (3 vols., from Vienna
and Munich MSS). Folckmann (1601) made extracts from the Catena of
Nicetas Heracleota, and Aloysius Lippomanus began a Catena from Greek
and Latin writers on the largest scale (one folio vol. on [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001), Romae 1585.md). The defects to be
found in the ancient exposition of the Psalms are in general the same in
the Greek and in the Western expositors. To their want of acquaintance
with the text of the original was added their unmethodical, irregular
mode of procedure, their arbitrary straining of the prophetic character
of the Psalms (as e.g., Tertullian, De spectaculis, takes the whole of
[Psa 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) as a prophecy concerning
Joseph of Arimathea), their unhistorical perception, before which all
differences between the two Testaments vanish, and their misleading
predilection for the allegorical method. In all this, the meaning of the
Psalms, as understood by the apostles, remains unused; they appropriate
it without rightly apprehending it, and do not place the Psalms in the
light of the New Testament fulfilment of them, but at once turn them
into New Testament language and thoughts. But the church has never found
such rapturous delight in the Psalms, which it was never weary of
singing day and night, never used them with richer results even to
martyrdom, than at that period. Instead of profane popular songs, as one
passed through the country one might hear psalms resounding over the
fields and vineyards. Quocunque te verteris, writes Jerome to the widow
of Marcellus from the Holy Land, arator stivam tenens Alleluja decantat,
sudans messor psalmis se avocat et curva attondens vitem falce vinitor
aliquid Davidicum canit. Haec sunt in hac provincia carmina, hae (ut
vulgo dicitur) amatoriae cantiones, hic pastorum sibilus, haec arma
culturae. The delights of country life he commends to Marcella in the
following among other words: Vere ager floribus pingitur et inter
querulas aves Psalmi dulcius cantabuntur. In Sidonius Apollinaris we
find even psalm-singing in the mouth of the men who tow the boats, and
the poet takes from this a beautiful admonition for Christians in their
voyage and journey through this life:

Curvorum hinc chorus helciariorum

Responsantibus Alleluja ripis

Ad Christum levat amicum celeusma.

Sic, sic psallite, nauta et viator!

And how many martyrs have endured every form of martyrdom with psalms
upon their lips! That which the church in those days filed to furnish in
writing towards the exposition of the Psalms, it more than compensated
for by preserving the vitality of the Psalms with its blood. Practice
made far more rapid progress than theory.

(Note: Vid., besides the essay by Otto Strauss, already mentioned:
Armknecht, Die heilige Psalmodie oder der psalmodirende Knig David und
die singende Urkirche, 1855; and W. von Glick, Das Psalterium nach
seinem Hauptinhalte in seiner wissenschaftlichen und praktischen
Bedeutung (a Catholic prize essay) 1858; partly also Rudelbach's
Hymnologische Studien in the Luther. Zeitschrift 1855, 4, 1856, 2. and
especially no penitential psalm-singing Zckler's Geschichte der Askese
(1863) S. 256-264.)

These patristic works are patterns for every age of the true fervour
which should characterise the expositor of the Psalms.

The mediaeval church exposition did not make any essential advance upon
the patristic. After Cassiodorus, came Haymo (d. 853) and Remigius of
Auxerre (d. about 900), still less independent compilers; the commentary
of the former, edited by Erasmus, appeared Trib. 1531, of the latter,
first Colon. 1536, and then in the Bibl. maxima Lugdunensis. That of
Petrus Lombardus (d. about 1160) is a catena taken directly from earlier
expositors from Jerome to Alcuin. Of a more independent character are
the commentaries of Thomas Aquinas, who however only completed 51 Ps.,
and Alexander of Hales, if the Commentary which appeared under his name
(Venet. 1496) is not rather to be attributed to cardinal Hugo. Besides,
these, Bonaventura (d. 1274) and Albertus Magnus (d. 1280) stand out
prominently in the Middle Ages as expositors of the Psalms; and on the
border of the Middle Ages Michael Ayguanus (about 1400) whose commentary
has been frequently reprinted since its first appearance, Mediol. 1510.
If you know one of these expositors, you know them all. The most that
they have to offer us is an echo of the earlier writers. By their
dependence on the letter of the Vulgate, and consequently indirectly of
the lxx, they only too frequently light upon a false track and miss the
meaning. The literalis sensus is completely buried in mysticae
intelligentiae. Without observing the distinction between the two
economies, the conversion of the Psalms into New Testament language and
thought, regardless of the intermediate steps of development, is here
continued. Thus, for example, Albertus Magnus in his commentary (Opp. t.
vii.), on the principle: Constat, quod totus liber iste de Christo, at
once expounds Beatus vir ([Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md),
and the whole Ps., de Christo et ejus corpore ecclesia. But as we find
in the Fathers occasional instances of deep insight into the meaning of
passages, and occasional flashes of thought of lasting value, so even
here the reading, especially of the mystics, will repay one. - The
greatest authority in psalm-exposition for the Middle Ages was
Augustine. From Augustine, and perhaps we may add from Cassiodorus,
Notker Labeo (d. 1022), the monk of St. Gall, drew the short annotations
which, verse by verse, accompany his German translation of the Psalms
(vol. ii. of H. Hattemer's Denkmahle des Mittelalters). In like manner
the Latin Psalter-catena of bishop Bruno of Wrzburg (d. 1045), mentioned
above, is compiled from Augustine and Cassiodorus, but also from Jerome,
Bede and Gregory. And the Syriac annotations to the Psalms of Gregory
Barhebraeus (d. 1286), - of which Tullberg and Koraen, Upsala 1842, and
Schrter, Breslau 1857, have published specimens, - are merely of
importance in connection with the history of exposition, and are
moreover in no way distinguished from the mediaeval method.

The mediaeval synagogue exposition is wanting in the recognition of
Christ, and consequently in the fundamental condition required for a
spiritual understanding of the Psalms. But as we are indebted to the
Jews for the transmission of the codex of the Old Testament, we also owe
the transmission of the knowledge of Hebrew to them. So far the Jewish
interpreters give us what the Christian interpreters of the same period
were not able to tender. The interpretations of passages from the Psalms
scattered up and down in the Talmud are mostly unsound, arbitrary, and
strange. And the Midrash on the Ps., bearing the title טוב שׁוחר (vid.,
Zunz, Vortrge, 266ff.), and the Midrash-catenae entitled ילקוט, of which
at present only ילקוט שׁמעוני (by Simeon Kara ha-Darshan) is known, and
ילקוט מכירי (by Machir b. Abba-Mari), contain far more that is
limitlessly digressive than what is to the point and usable. This class
of psalm-exposition was always employed for the thoroughly practical end
of stimulating and edifying discourse. It is only since about 900 a.d.,
when indirectly under Syro-Arabian influence, the study of grammar began
to be cultivated among the Jews, that the exposition and the application
of Scripture began to be disentangled. At the head of this new era of
Jewish exegesis stands Saadia Gaon (d. 941-2), from whose Arabic
translation and annotations of the Ps. Haneberg (1840) and Ewald (1844)
have published extracts. The Karaites, Salmon b. Jerocham and Jefeth,
both of whom have also expounded the Psalms, are warm opponents of
Saadia; but Jefeth whose commentary on the Psalms

(Note: It is to be found in MS partly in Paris, partly in St.
Petersburg: the former having been brought thither from Egypt by Munk in
1841 and the latter by Tischendorf in 1853.)

has been in part made known by Bargs (since 1846), nevertheless already
recognises the influence of grammar, which Saadia raised to the dignity
of a science, but which Salmon utterly discards. The next great
expositor of the Psalms is Rashi (i.e., Rabbi Salomo Isaaki) of Troyes
(d. 1105), who has interpreted the whole of the Old Testament (except
the Chronicles) and the whole of the Talmud;

(Note: But on some parts of the Talmud, e.g., the tractate Maccoth, we
have not any commentary by Rashi.)

and he has not only treasured up with pithy brevity the traditional
interpretations scattered about in the Talmud and Midrash, but also
(especially in the Psalms) made use of every existing grammatico-lexical
help. Aben-Ezra of Toledo (d. 1167) and David Kimchi of Narbonne (d.
about 1250) are less dependent upon tradition, which for the most part
expended itself upon strange interpretations. The former is the more
independent and genial, but seldom happy in his characteristic fancies;
the latter is less original, but gifted with a keener appreciation of
that which is simple and natural, and of all the Jewish expositors he is
the pre-eminently grammatico-historical interpreter. Gecatilia's (Mose
ha-Cohen Chiquitilla) commentary on the Psalms written in Arabic is only
known to us from quotations, principally in Aben-Ezra. In later
commentaries, as those of Mose Alshch (Venice 1601) and Joel Shob
(Salonica 1569), the simplicity and elegance of the older expositors
degenerates into the most repulsive scholasticism. The commentary of
Obadia Sforno (d. at Bologna 1550), Reuchlin's teacher, is too much
given to philosophising, but is at least withal clear and brief. Their
knowledge of the Hebrew gives all these expositors a marked advantage
over their Christian contemporaries, but the veil of Moses over their
eyes is thicker in proportion to their conscious opposition to
Christianity. Nevertheless the church has not left these preparatory
works unused. The Jewish Christians, Nicolaus de Lyra (d. about 1340),
the author of the Postillae perpetuae, and Archbishop Paul de Santa
Maria of Burgos (d. 1435), the author of the Additiones ad Lyram, took
the lead in this respect. Independently, like the last mentioned
writers, Augustinus Justinianus of Genoa, in his Octaplus Psalterii
(Genoa, 1516, folio), drew chiefly from the Midrash and Sohar. The
preference however was generally given to the use of Aben-Ezra and
Kimchi; e.g., Bucer, who acknowledges his obligation to these, says:
neque enim candidi ingenii est dissimulare, per quos profeceris.
Justinianus, Pagninus, and Felix were the three highest authorities on
the original text at the commencement of the Reformation. The first two
had gained their knowledge of the original from Jewish sources and Felix
Pratensis, whose Psalterium ex hebreo diligentissime ad verbum fere
translatum, 1522, appeared under Leo X, was a proselyte.

We have now reached the threshold of the Reformation exposition.
Psalmody in the reigning church had sunk to a lifeless form of service.
The exposition of the Psalms lost itself in the dependency of
compilation and the chaos of the schools. Et ipsa quamvis frigida
tractatione Psalmorum - says Luther in his preface to Bugenhagen's Latin
Psalter - aliquis tamen odor vitae oblatus est plerisque bonae mentis
hominibus, et utcunque ex verbis illis etiam non intellectis semper
aliquid consolationis et aurulae senserunt e Psalmis pii, veluti ex
roseto leniter spirantis. Now, however, when a new light dawned upon the
church through the Reformation - the light of a grammatical and deeply
spiritual understanding of Scripture, represented in Germany by Reuchlin
and in France by Vatablus - then the rose-garden of the Psalter began to
breathe forth its perfumes as with the renewed freshness of a May day;
and born again from the Psalter, German hymns resounded from the shores
of the Baltic to the foot of the Alps with all the fervour of a newly
quickened first-love. "It is marvellous" - says the Spanish Carmelite
Thomas Jesu, - "How greatly the hymns of Luther helped forward the
Lutheran cause. Not only the churches and schools echo with them, but
even the private houses, the workshops, the markets, streets, and
fields." For converted into imperishable hymns (by Luther, Albinus,
Franck, Gerhardt, Jonas, Musculus, Poliander, Ringwaldt, and many more)
the ancient Psalms were transferred anew into the psalmody of the German
as of the Scandinavian

(Note: The Swedish hymns taken from the Psalms have been recently
remodelled for congregational use and augmented by Runeberg (Oerebro
1858).)

Lutheran church. In the French church Clment Marot translated into verse
30 Ps., then 19 more (1541-43) and Theodore Beza added the rest (1562).

(Note: Vid., Flix Bovet, Les Psaumes de Marot et de Bze, in the Lausanne
magazine, Le Chrtien Evanglique, 1866, No. 4.)

Calvin introduced the Psalms in Marot's version as early as 1542 into
the service of the Geneva church, and the Psalms have since continued to
be the favorite hymns of the Reformed church. Goudimel, the martyr of
St. Bartholemew's night and teacher of Palestrina, composed the melodies
and chorales. The English Established church adopted the Psalms direct
as they are, as a portion of its liturgy, the Congregational church
followed the example of the sister-churches of the Continent. And how
industriously the Psalter was moulded into Greek verse, as by Olympia
Morata (d. 1555)

(Note: Vid., examples in Bonnet's life of Olympia Morata. Germ. transl.
by Merschmann 1860 S. 131-135.)

and under the influence of Melanthon

into Latin! The paraphrases of Helius Eoban Hesse (of whom Martin Herz,
1860, has given a biographical sketch),

(Note: His Psalms (to which Veit Dietrich wrote notes) passed through
forty editions in seventy years.)

Joh. Major, Jacob Micyllus (whose life Classen has written, 1859), Joh.
Stigel (whose memory has been revived by Paulus Cassel 1860), Gre.
Bersmann (d. 1611), and also that begun by Geo. Buchanan during his
sojourn in a Portuguese monastery, are not only learned performances,
but productions of an inward spiritual need; although one must assent to
the judgment expressed by Harless, that the best attempts of this kind
only satisfy one in proportion as we are able first of all to banish the
remembrance of the original from our mind.

But since the time of the Reformation the exegetical functions of
psalm-exposition have been more clearly apprehended and more happily
discharged than ever before. In Luther, who opened his academical
lectures in 1514 with the Ps. (in Latin in Luther's own hand writing in
Wolfenbttel) and began to publish a part of them in 1519 under the title
Operationes in duas Psalmorum decades, the depth of experience of the
Fathers is united to the Pauline recognition (which he gave back to the
church) of the doctrine of free grace. It is true, he is not entirely
free from the allegorising which he rejected in thesi, and, in general,
from a departure a sensu literae, and there is also still wanting in
Luther the historical insight into the distinctive character of the two
Testaments; but with respect to experimental, mystical, and withal
sound, understanding he is incomparable. His interpretations of the
Psalms, especially of the penitential Ps. and of Ps 90, excel every
thing hitherto produced, and are still a perpetual mine of wealth.
Bugenhagen's exposition of the Psalms (Basel 1524, 4to. and freq.)
continued the interrupted work of Luther, who in a brief but forcible
preface says in its praise, that it is the first worthy of the name of
an exposition. Penetration and delicacy of judgment distinguish the
interpretation of the five books of the Psalms by Aretius Felinus i.e.,
Martin Bucer (1529, 4to. and freq.). The Autophyes (= a se et per se
Existens), by which throughout he translates יהוה, gives it a remarkable
appearance. But about the same time, as an exegete, Calvin came forward
at the side of the German reformer. His commentary (first published at
Geneva 1564) combines with great psychological penetration more
discernment of the types and greater freedom of historical perception,
but is not without many errors arising from this freedom. Calvin's
strict historical method of interpretation becomes a caricature in Esrom
Rdinger, the schoolmaster of the Moravian brethren, who died at Altorf
in 1591 without being able, as he had intended, to issue his commentary,
which appeared in 1580-81, in a new and revised form. His is an original
work which, after trying many conjectures, at last assigns even the
first Psalm to the era of the Seleucidae.

Within the range of the post-Reformation exposition the first that meets
us is Reinhard Bakius, the persevering and talented pastor of Magdeburg
and Grimma during the Thirty-years' war, whose Comm. exegetico-practicus
on the Ps. (in the first edition by his son 1664) is a work of extensive
reading and good sense, in many respects a welcome supplement to Luther,
crammed full of all kinds of notable things about the Psalms, under
which, however, the thread of simple exposition is lost. Martin Geier
keeps the work of the exposition most distinctly before him, adhering
more closely to it and restraining himself from digression. His lectures
on the Psalms delivered at Leipzig extended over a period of eighteen
years. Deep piety and extensive learning adorn his commentary (1668),
but the free spirit of the men of the Reformation is no longer here.
Geier is not capable of turning from dogmatics, and throwing himself
into the exegesis: a traditional standard of exegesis had become fixed,
to overstep which was accounted as heterodox. In the Reformed church
Cocceius stands prominently forward (d. 1669). He was an original and
gifted man, but starting from false principles of hermeneutics, too fond
of an eschatological literalness of interpretation.

Not only the two Protestant churches, but also the Romish church took
part in the advancing work of psalm-exposition. Its most prominent
expositors from 1550-1650 are Genebrardus, Agellius, and De Muis, all of
whom possessing a knowledge of the Semitic languages, go back to the
original, and Gallarmin, who brings to the work not merely uncommon
natural talents, but, within the limits of papistical restraint, a deep
spiritual penetration. Later on psalm-exposition in the Romish church
degenerated into scholasticism. This is at its height in Le Blanc's
Psalmorum Davidicorum Analysis and in Joh. Lorinus' Commentaria in
Psalmos (6 folio vols. 1665-1676). In the protestant churches, however,
a lamentable decline from the spirit of the men of the Reformation in
like manner manifested itself. The Adnotationes uberiores in Hagiographa
(t. i. 1745, 4to.: Ps. and Prov.) of Joh. Heinrich Michaelis are a mass
of raw materials: the glossarial annotations groan beneath the burden of
numberless unsifted examples and parallel passages. What had been done
during the past sixteen hundred years remains almost entirely unnoticed;
Luther is not explored, even Calvin within the pale of his own church no
longer exerts any influence over the exposition of Scripture. After
1750, the exposition of Scripture lost that spiritual and ecclesiastical
character which had gained strength in the seventeenth century, but had
also gradually become torpid; whereas in the Romish church, as the
Psalm-expositions of De Sacy, Berthier and La Harpe show, it never sank
so low as to deny the existence of revealed religion. That love for the
Ps., which produced the evangelical hymn-psalter of that truly Christian
poet and minister Christoph Karl Ludwig von Pfeil (1747),

(Note: Vid., his Life by Heinr. Jerz (1863), 111-117.)

prefaced by Bengel, degenerated to a merely literary, or at most
poetical, interest, - exegesis became carnal and unspiritual. The
remnant of what was spiritual in this age of decline, is represented by
Burk in his Gnomon to the Ps. (1760) which follows the model of Bengel,
and by Chr. A. Crusius in the second part of his Hypomnemata ad
Theologiam Propheticam (1761), a work which follows the track newly
opened up by Bengel, and is rich in germs of progressive knowledge
(vid., my Biblisch-prophetische Theologie, 1845). We may see the
character of the theology of that age from Joh. Dav. Michaelis'
translation of the Old Testament, with notes for the unlearned (1771),
and his writings on separate Psalms. From a linguistic and historical
point of view we may find something of value here; but besides, only
wordy, discursive, tasteless trifling and spiritual deadness. It has
been the honour of Herder that he has freed psalm-exposition from this
want of taste, and the merit of Hengstenberg (first of all in his
Lectures), that he has brought it back out of this want of spirituality
to the believing consciousness of the church.

The transition to modern exposition is marked by Rosenmller's Scholia to
the Ps. (first published in 1798-1804), a compilation written in pure
clear language with exegetical tact and with a thankworthy use of older
expositors who had become unknown, as Rdinger, Bucer, and Agellius, and
also of Jewish writers. De Wette's commentary on the Psalms (first
published in 1811, 5th edition by Gustav Baur, 1856) was far more
independent and forms an epoch in exegesis. De Wette is precise and
clear, and also not without a perception of the beautiful; but his
position in relation to the Scripture writers is too much like that of a
reviewer, his research too sceptical, and his estimate of the Ps. does
not sufficiently recognise their place in the history of redemption. He
regards them as national hymns, partly in the most ordinary patriotic
sense, and when his theological perception fails him, he helps himself
out with sarcasm against the theocratic element, which he carries to the
extreme of disgust. Nevertheless, De Wette's commentary opens up a new
epoch so far as it has first of all set in order the hitherto existing
chaos of psalm-exposition, and introduced into it taste and grammatical
accuracy, after the example of Herder and under the influence of
Gesenius. He is far more independent than Rosenmller, who though not
wanting in taste and tact, is only a compiler. In investigating the
historical circumstances which gave rise to the composition of the
different psalms, De Wette is more negative than assumptive. Hitzig in
his historical and critical commentary (1835. 36), which has appeared
recently in a revised form (Bd. 1, 1863, Bd. 2. Abth. 1, 1864, Abth. 2,
1865), has sought to supplement positively the negative criticism of De
Wette, by ascribing to David fourteen Ps. of the seventy three that bear
the inscription לדוד, assigning all the Ps. from the 73 onwards,
together with 1, 2, 60 (these three, as also 142-144, 150, by Alexander
Jannaeus) to the Maccabean period (e.g., 138-141 to Alexander's father,
John Hyrcanus), and also inferring the authors (Zechariah, [Ch2
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005); Isaiah, Jeremiah.md) or at least
the date of composition of all the rest.

Von Lengerke, in his commentary compiled half from Hengstenberg, half
from Hitzig (1847), has attached himself to this so-called positive
criticism, which always arrives at positive results and regards
Maccabean psalms as the primary stock of the Psalter. Von Lengerke
maintains that not a single Ps. can with certainty be ascribed to David.
Olshausen (in his Comment. 1853), who only leaves a few Ps., as 2, 20,
21, to the time of the kings prior to the Exile, and with a propensity,
which he is not able to resist, brings down all the others to the time
of the Maccabees, even to the beginning of the reign of John Hyrcanus,
also belongs to the positive school. Whereas Hupfeld in his commentary,
1855-1862 (4 vols.), considers it unworthy of earnest investigation, to
lower one's self to such "childish trifling with hypotheses" and remains
true to De Wette's negative criticism: but he seeks to carry it out in a
different way. He also maintains that none of the Ps. admit of being
with certainty ascribed to David; and proceeds on the assumption, that
although only a part of the inscriptions are false, for that very reason
none of them can be used by us.

We stand neither on the side of this scepticism, which everywhere
negatives tradition, nor on the side of that self-confidence, which
mostly negatives it and places in opposition to it its own positive
counter-assumptions; but we do not on this account fail to recognise the
great merit which Olshausen, Hupfeld and Hitzig have acquired by their
expositions of the Psalms. In Olshausen we prize his prominent talent
for critical conjectures; in Hupfeld grammatical thoroughness, and solid
study so far as it is carried; in Hitzig the stimulating originality
everywhere manifest, his happy perspicacity in tracing out the
connection of the thoughts, and the marvellous amount of reading which
is displayed in support of the usage of language and of that which is
admissible according to syntax. The commentary of Ewald (Poetische
Bcher, 1839, 40. 2nd edition 1866), apart from the introductory portion,
according to its plan only fragmentarily meets the requirements of
exposition, but in the argument which precedes each Ps. gives evidence
of a special gift for piercing the emotions and throbbings of the heart
and entering into the changes of feeling.

None of these expositors are in truly spiritual rapport with the spirit
of the psalmists. The much abused commentary of Hengstenberg 1842-1847
(4 vols. 2nd edition 1849-1852) consequently opened a new track, in as
much as it primarily set the exposition of the Psalms in its right
relation to the church once more, and was not confined to the
historico-grammatical function of exposition. The kindred spirited works
of Umbreit (Christliche Erbauung aus dem Psalter 1835) and Stier
(Siebenzig Psalmen 1834. 36), which extend only to a selection from the
Psalms, may be regarded as its forerunners, and the commentary of
Tholuck (1847) who excludes verbal criticism and seeks to present the
results of exegetical progress in a practical form for the use of the
people, as its counterpart. For the sake of completeness we may also
mention the commentary of Kster (1837) which has become of importance
for its appreciation of the artistic form of the Psalms, especially the
strophe-system, and Vaihinger's (1845). Out of Germany, no work on the
Psalms has appeared which could be placed side by side with those of
Hengstenberg, Hupfeld and Hitzig. And yet the inexhaustible task demands
the combined work of many hands. Would that the examples set by Bjrk, by
Perret-Gentil, Armand deo Mestral and J. F. Thrupp, of noble rivalry
with German scholarship might find many imitators in the countries of
the Scandinavian, Latin, and English tongues! Would that the zealous
industry of Bade and Reinke, the noble endeavours so Schegg and Knig,
might set an example to many in the Romish church! Would that also the
Greek church on the basis of the criticism of the lxx defended by
Pharmakides against Oikonomos, far surpassing the works on the Ps. of
Nicodimos and Anthimos, which are drawn from the Fathers, might continue
in that rival connection with German scholarship of which the
Prolegomena to the Psalm-commentary of the Jerusalem patriarch Anthimos,
by Dionysios Kleopas (Jerusalem 1855. 4to.) give evidence! Non plus
ultra is the watchword of the church with regard to the word of God, and
plus ultra is its watchword with regard to the understanding of that
word. Common work upon the Scriptures is the finest union of the severed
churches and the surest harbinger of their future unity. The exposition
of Scripture will rear the Church of the Future.

10\. Theological Preliminary Considerations

The expositor of the Psalms can place himself on the standpoint of the
poet, or the standpoint of the Old Testament church, or the standpoint
of the church of the present dispensation - a primary condition of
exegetical progress is the keeping of these three standpoints distinct,
and, in accordance therewith, the distinguishing between the two
Testaments, and in general, between the different steps in the
development of the revelation, and in the perception of the plan, of
redemption. For as redemption itself has a progressive history, so has
the revelation and growing perception of it a progressive history also,
which extends from paradise, through time, on into eternity. Redemption
realizes itself in a system of facts, in which the divine purpose of
love for the deliverance of sinful humanity unfolds itself, and the
revelation of salvation is given in advance of this gradually developing
course of events in order to guarantee its divine authorship and as a
means by which it may be rightly understood. In the Psalms we have five
centuries and more of this progressive realizing, disclosing, and
perception of salvation laid open before us. If we add to this the fact
that one psalm is by Moses, and that the retrospective portions of the
historical psalms refer back even to the patriarchal age, then, from the
call of Abraham down to the restoration of Israel's position among the
nations after the Exile, there is scarcely a single event of importance
in sacred history which does not find some expression in the Psalter.
And it is not merely facts external to it, which echo therein in lyric
strains, but, because David, - next to Abraham undoubtedly the most
significant character of sacred history in the Old Testament, - is its
chief composer, it is itself a direct integral part of the history of
redemption. And it is also a source of information for the history of
the revelation of redemption, in as much as it flowed not from the
Spirit of faith merely, but mainly also from the Spirit of prophecy:
but, pre-eminently, it is the most important memorial of the progressive
recognition of the plan of salvation, since it shows how, between the
giving of the Law from Sinai and the proclamation of the Gospel from
Sion, the final, great salvation was heralded in the consciousness and
life of the Jewish church.

We will consider 1) the relation of the Psalms to the prophecy of the
future Christ. When man whom God had created, had corrupted himself by
sin, God did not leave him to that doom of wrath which he had chosen for
himself, but visited him on the evening of that most unfortunate of all
days, in order to make that doom the disciplinary medium of His love.
This visitation of Jahve Elohim was the first step in the history of
redemption towards the goal of the incarnation, and the so-called
protevangelium was the first laying of the foundation of His verbal
revelation of law and gospel - a revelation in accordance with the plan
of salvation, and preparing the way towards this goal of the incarnation
and the recovery of man. The way of this salvation, which opens up its
own historical course, and at the same time announces itself in a form
adapted to the human consciousness, runs all through Israel, and the
Psalms show us how this seed-corn of words and acts of divine love has
expanded with a vital energy in the believing hearts of Israel. They
bear the impress of the period, during which the preparation of the way
of salvation was centred in Israel and the hope of redemption was a
national hope. For after mankind was separated into different nations,
salvation was confined within the limits of a chosen nation, that it
might mature there, and then bursting its bounds become the property of
the human race. At that period the promise of the future Mediator was in
its third stage. The hope of overcoming the tendency in mankind to be
led astray into evil was attached to the seed of the woman, and the hope
of a blessing for all peoples, to the seed of Abraham: but, at this
period, when David became the creator of psalm-poesy for the sanctuary
service, the promise had assumed a Messianic character and pointed the
hope of the believing ones towards the king of Israel, and in fact to
David and his seed: the salvation and glory of Israel first, and
indirectly of the nations, was looked for from the mediatorship of
Jahve's Anointed.

The fact that among all the Davidic psalms there is only a single one,
viz., [Psa 110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), in which David (as
in his last words [Sa2 23:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001).md) looks
forth into the future of his seed and has the Messiah definitely before
his mind, can only be explained by the consideration, that he was
hitherto himself the object of Messianic hope, and that this hope was
first gradually (especially in consequence of his deep fall) separated
from himself individually, and transferred to the future. Therefore when
Solomon came to the throne the Messianic desires and hopes of Israel
were directed towards him, as Ps 72 shows; they belonged only to the one
final Christ of God, but they clung for a long time enquiringly and with
a perfect right (on the ground of 2 Sam 7) to the direct son of David.
Also in Ps 45 it is a son of David, contemporary with the Korahite
singer, to whom the Messianic promise is applied as a marriage
benediction, wishing that the promise may be realized in him.

But it soon became evident that He, in whom the full realization of the
idea of the Messiah is to be found, had not yet appeared either in the
person of this king or of Solomon. And when in the later time of the
kings the Davidic line became more and more inconsistent with its
vocation in the sacred history, then the hope of the Messiah was
completely weaned of its expectation of immediate fulfilment, and the
present became merely the dark ground from which the image of the
Messiah, as purely future, stood forth in relief. The בן־דוד, in whom
the prophecy of the later time of the kings centres, and whom also [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md) sets forth before the kings of
the earth that they may render homage to Him, is an eschatological
character (although the אחרית was looked for as dawning close upon the
border of the present). In the mouth of the congregation Ps 45 and 132,
since their contents referred to the future, have become too
prophetically and eschatologically Messianic. But it is remarkable that
the number of these psalms which are not merely typically Messianic is
so small, and that the church of the period after the Exile has not
enriched the Psalter with a single psalm that is Messianic in the
stricter sense. In the later portion of the Psalter, in distinction from
the strictly Messianic psalms, the theocratic psalms are more numerously
represented, i.e., those psalms which do not speak of the kingdom of
Jahve's Anointed which shall conquer and bless the world, not of the
Christocracy, in which the theocracy reaches the pinnacle of its
representation, but of the theocracy as such, which is complete inwardly
and outwardly in its own representation of itself, - not of the advent
of a human king, but of Jahve Himself, with the kingdom of God manifest
in all its glory. For the announcement of salvation in the Old Testament
runs on in two parallel lines: the one has as its termination the
Anointed of Jahve, who rules all nations out of Zion, the other, the
Lord Himself sitting above the Cherubim, to whom all the earth does
homage. These two lines do not meet in the Old Testament; it is only the
fulfilment that makes it plain, that the advent of the Anointed one and
the advent of Jahve is one and the same. And of these two lines the
divine is the one that preponderates in the Psalter; the hope of Israel,
especially after the kingship had ceased in Israel, is directed
generally beyond the human mediation directly towards Jahve, the Author
of salvation. The fundamental article of the Old Testament faith funs
ישׁועתה ליהוה (Ps. 3:9; [Jon 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#010).md).
The Messiah is not yet recognised as a God-man. Consequently the Psalms
contain neither prayer to Him, nor prayer in His name. But prayer to
Jahve and for Jahve's sake is essentially the same. For Jesus is in
Jahve. Jahve is the Saviour. And the Saviour when he shall appear, is
nothing but the visible manifestation of the ישׁועה of this God ([Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006).md).

In considering the goal of the Old Testament history in its relation to
the God-man, we distinguish five classes of psalms which are directed
towards this goal. After 2 Sam 7 the Messianic promise is no longer in a
general way connected with the tribe of Judah, but with David; and is
referred not merely to the endless duration of his kingdom, but also to
one scion of his house, in whom that to which God has appointed the seed
of David in its relation to Israel first, and from Israel to all the
other nations, shall be fully realised, and without whom the kingdom of
David is like a headless trunk. Psalms in which the poet, looking beyond
his own age, comforts himself with the vision of this king in whom the
promise is finally fulfilled, we call eschatological psalms, and in fact
directly eschatologically Messianic psalms. These connect themselves not
merely with the already resisting prophetic utterances, but carry them
even further, and are only distinguished from prophecy proper by their
lyric form; for prophecy is a discourses and the psalms are spiritual
songs.

The Messianic character of the Psalms is, however, not confined to
prophecy proper, the subject of which is that which is future. Just as
nature exhibits a series of stages of life in which the lower order of
existence points to the next order above it and indirectly to the
highest, so that, for instance, in the globular form of a drop we read
the intimation of the struggle after organism, as it were, in the
simplest barest outline: so also the progress of history is typical, and
not only as a whole, but also most surprisingly in single traits, the
life of David is a vaticinium reale of the life of Him, whom prophecy
calls directly עבדי דוד [Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md).,
[Psa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024.md). and דוד מלכם [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md); [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md), as the David who is, as it were,
raised from the dead in a glorified form. Those psalms in which David
himself (or even a poet throwing himself into David's position and mood)
gives expression in lyric verse to prominent typical events and features
of his life, we call typically Messianic psalms. This class, however, is
not confined to those, of which David is directly or indirectly the
subject, for the course of suffering of all the Old Testament saints,
and especially of the prophets in their calling (vid., on [Psa
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020). and Ps 69.md), was to a certain
extent a τύπος τοῦ μέλλοντος. All these psalms, not less than those of
the first class, may be quoted in the New Testament with the words ἵνα
πληρωθῇ, with this difference only, that in the former it is the
prophetic word, in the latter the prophetic history, that is fulfilled.
The older theologians, especially the Lutheran, contended against the
supposition of such typological citations of the Old Testament in the
New: they were destitute of that perception of the organic element in
history granted to our age, and consequently were lacking in the true
counterpoise to their rigid notions of inspiration.

But there is also a class of Psalms which we call typico-prophetically
Messianic, viz., those in which David, describing his outward and inward
experiences, - experiences even in themselves typical, - is carried
beyond the limits of his individuality and present condition, and utters
concerning himself that which, transcending human experience, is
intended to become historically true only in Christ. Such psalms are
typical, in as much as their contents is grounded in the individual, but
typical, history of David; they are, however, at the same time
prophetic, in as much as they express present individual experience in
laments, hopes, and descriptions which point far forward beyond the
present and are only fully realised in Christ. The psychological
possibility of such psalms has been called in question; but they would
only be psychologically impossible, if one were obliged to suppose that
David's self-consciousness must under such circumstances pass over into
that of his antitype; but it is in reality quite otherwise. As the poet
in order to describe his experiences in verse, idealises them, i.e.,
seizes the idea of them at the very root, and, stripping off all that is
adventitious and insignificant, rises into the region of the ideal: so
David also in these psalms idealises his experiences, which even in
itself results in the reduction of them to all that is essential to
their continuance as types. This he does, however, not from his own
poetic impulse, but under the inspiration of the Spirit of God; and a
still further result which follows from this is, that the description of
his typical fortunes and their corresponding states of feeling is
moulded into the prophetic description of the fortunes and feelings of
his antitype.

Beside these three classes of Messianic psalms one may regard psalms
like [Psa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md) and [Psa
72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md) as a fourth class of indirectly
eschatologically Messianic psalms. They are those in which, according to
the time of their composition, Messianic hopes are referred to a
contemporary king, but without having been fulfilled in him; so that, in
the mouth of the church, still expecting their final accomplishment,
these psalms have become eschatological hymns and their exposition as
such, by the side of their chronological interpretation, is fully
warranted.

A fifth class is formed by the eschatologically Jehovic psalms, which
are taken up with describing the advent of Jahve and the consummation of
His kingdom, which is all through brought about by judgment (vid., [Psa
93:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001).md). The number of these psalms in
the Psalter greatly preponderates. They contain the other premiss to the
divine-human end of the history of salvation. There are sudden flashes
of light thrown upon this end in the prophets. But it remains reserved
to the history itself to draw the inference of the unio personalis from
these human and divine premises. The Redeemer, in whom the Old Testament
faith reposed, is Jahve. The centre of the hope lay in the divine not in
the human king. That the Redeemer, when He should appear, would be God
and man in one person was alien to the mind of the Old Testament church.
And the perception of the fact that He would be sacrifice and priest in
one person, only penetrates in single rays into the Old Testament
darkness, the cynosure of which is יהוה, and יהוה only.

Coming now to consider 2) the relation of the Psalms to the legal
sacrifice, we shall find this also different from what we might expect
from the stand-point of fulfilment. Passages certainly are not wanting
where the outward legal sacrifice is acknowledged as an act of worship
on the part of the individual and of the congregation ([Psa
66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015); Ps 51:21.md); but those occur more
frequently, in which in comparison with the λογικὴ λατρεία it is so
lightly esteemed, that without respect to its divine institution it
appears as something not at all desired by God, as a shell to be cast
away, and as a form to be broken in pieces ([Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md), [Psa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md), [Psa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018).md). But it is not this that
surprises us. It is just in this respect that the psalms contribute
their share towards the progress of sacred history. It is that process
of spiritualisation which beings even in Deuteronomy, and which is
continued by reason of the memorable words of Samuel, [Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md). It is the spirit of the New
Testament, growing more and more in strength, which here and in other
parts of the Psalter shakes the legal barriers and casts off the
στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου as a butterfly does its chrysalis shell. But what is
substituted for the sacrifice thus criticised and rejected? Contrition,
prayer, thanksgiving, yielding one's self to God in the doing of His
will, as [Pro 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003.md) to do justly, [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md) kindness, [Mic
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md) acting justly, love, and
humility, [Jer 7:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md) obedience. This
it is that surprises one. The disparaged sacrifice is regarded only as a
symbol not as a type; it is only considered in its ethical character,
not in its relation to the history of redemption. Its nature is unfolded
only so far as it is a gift to God (קרבן), not so far as the offering is
appointed for atonement (כפרה); in one word: the mystery of the blood
remains undisclosed. Where the New Testament mind is obliged to think of
the sprinkling with the blood of Jesus Christ, it is, in [Psa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009.md), the sprinkling of the legal
ritual of purification and atonement that is mentioned, and that
manifestly figuratively but yet without the significance of the figure.
Whence is it? - Because the sacrifice with blood, as such, in the Old
Testament remains a question to which Isaiah, in [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md), gives almost the only distinct
answer in accordance with its historical fulfilment; for passages like
[Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)., [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md) are themselves questionable and
enigmatical. The prophetic representation of the passion and sacrifice
of Christ is only given in direct prophetic language thus late on, and
it is only the evangelic history of the fulfilment that shows, how
exactly the Spirit which spoke by David has moulded that which he says
concerning himself, the type, into correspondence with the antitype. The
confidence of faith under the Old Testament, as it finds expression in
the Psalms, rested upon Jahve even in reference to the atonement, as in
reference to redemption in general. As He is the Saviour, so is He also
the one who makes the atonement (מכפר), from whom expiation is earnestly
sought and hoped for ([Psa 79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009.md); [Psa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004.md); [Psa
78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038.md); [Psa
85:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#003) and other passages.md). It is Jahve
who at the end of His course of the redemptive history is the God-man,
and the blood given by Him as the medium of atonement ([Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011).md) is, in the antitype, His own
blood.

Advancing from this point, we come to examine 3) the relation of the
Psalms to the New Testament righteousness of faith and to the New
Testament morality which flows from the primary command of infinite
love. Both with respect to the atonement and to redemption the Psalms
undergo a complete metamorphosis in the consciousness of the praying New
Testament church - a metamorphosis, rendered possible by the unveiling
and particularising of salvation that has since taken place, and to
which they can without any reserve be accommodated. There are only two
points in which the prayers of the Psalms appear to be difficult of
amalgamation with the Christian consciousness. These are the moral
self-confidence bordering on self-righteousness, which is frequently
maintained before God in the Psalms, and the warmth of feeling against
enemies and persecutors which finds vent in fearful cursings. The
self-righteousness here is a mere appearance; for the righteousness to
which the psalmists appeal is not the merit of works, not a sum of good
works, which are reckoned up before God as claiming a reward, but a
godly direction of the will and a godly form of life, which has its root
in the surrender of one's whole self to God and regards itself as the
operation and work of justifying, sanctifying, preserving and ruling
grace ([Psa 73:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025.md)., [Psa
25:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#005.md); [Psa
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014) and other passages.md). There is
not wanting an acknowledgement of the innate sinfulness of our nature
([Psa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007).md), of the man's exposure to
punishment before God apart from His grace ([Psa
143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002).md), of the many, and for the most
part unperceived, sins of the converted ([Psa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013).md), of the forgiveness of sins as
a fundamental condition to the attainment of happiness ([Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)..md), of the necessity of a new
divinely-created heart ([Psa 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012).md),
in short, of the way of salvation which consists of penitential
contrition, pardon, and newness of life.

On the other hand it is not less true, that in the light of the
vicarious atonement and of the Spirit of regeneration it becomes
possible to form a far more penetrating and subtle moral judgment of
one's self; it is not less true, that the tribulation, which the New
Testament believer experiences, though it does not produce such a strong
and overwhelming sense of divine wrath as that which is often expressed
in the psalms, nevertheless sinks deeper into his inmost nature in the
presence of the cross on Golgotha and of the heaven that is opened up to
him, in as much as it appears to him to be sent by a love that chastens,
proves, and prepares him for the future; and it is not less true, that
after the righteousness of God - which takes over our unrighteousness
and is accounted even in the Old Testament as a gift of grace - lies
before us for believing appropriation as a righteousness redemptively
wrought out by the active and passive obedience of Jesus, the
distinctive as well as the reciprocally conditioned character of
righteousness of faith and of righteousness of life is become a more
clearly perceived fact of the inner life, and one which exercises a more
powerful influence over the conduct of that life.

(Note: Cf. Kurtz, Zur Theologie der Psalmen, III: The self-righteousness
of the psalmists, in the Dorpater Zeitschrift 1865 S. 352-358: "The Old
Testament righteousness of faith, represented by the evangelium visibile
of the sacrificial worship, had not as yet the fundamental and primary,
helpful position assigned to it, especially by Paul, in the New
Testament, but only a more secondary position; justification is
conceived not as a condition of the sanctification which is to be
striven after, but as a supplementing of that which is wanting in the
sanctification thus defectively striven after.)

Nevertheless even such personal testimonies, as [Psa
17:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md), do not resist conversion into
New Testament forms of thought and experience, for they do not hinder
the mind from thinking specially, at the same time, of righteousness of
faith, of God's acts which are performed through the medium of
sacraments, and of that life resulting from the new birth, which
maintains itself victorious in the old man; moreover the Christian ought
to be himself earnestly warned by them to examine himself whether his
faith is really manifest as an energising power of a new life; and the
difference between the two Testaments loses its harshness even here, in
the presence of the great verities which condemn all moral infirmity,
viz., that the church of Christ is a community of the holy, that the
blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin, and that whosoever is
born of God doth not commit sin.

But as to the so-called imprecatory psalms,

(Note: Cf. Kurtz, ibid. IV: The imprecatory Psalms, ibid. S. 359-372 and
our discussions in the introductions to Ps 35 and 109, which belong to
this class.)

in the position occupied by the Christian and by the church towards the
enemies of Christ, the desire for their removal is certainly outweighed
by the desire for their conversion: but assuming, that they will not be
converted and will not anticipate their punishment by penitence, the
transition from a feeling of love to that of wrath is warranted in the
New Testament (e.g., [Gal 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012).md), and
assuming their absolute Satanic hardness of heart the Christian even may
not shrink from praying for their final overthrow. For the kingdom of
God comes not only by the way of mercy but also of judgment; and the
coming of the kingdom of God is the goal of the Old as well as of the
New Testament saint (vid., Ps 9:21; [Psa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014) and other passages.md), and every
wish that judgment may descend upon those who oppose the coming of the
kingdom of God is cherished even in the Psalms on the assumption of
their lasting impenitence (vid., [Psa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013.md)., [Psa
109:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#017).md). Where, however, as in Ps 69
and Ps 109, the imprecations go into particulars and extend to the
descendants of the unfortunate one and even on to eternity, the only
justification of them is this, that they flow from the prophetic spirit,
and for the Christian they admit of no other adoption, except as,
reiterating them, he gives the glory to the justice of God, and commends
himself the more earnestly to His favour.

Also 4) the relation of the Psalms to the Last Things is such, that in
order to be used as prayer expressive of the New Testament faith they
require deepening and adjusting. For what Julius Africanus says of the
Old Testament: οὐδέπω δέδοτο ἐλπίς ἀναστάσεως σαφής, holds good at least
of the time before Isaiah. For Isaiah is the first to foretell, in one
of his latest apocalyptic cycles ([Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001).md), the first resurrection, i.e.,
the re-quickening of the martyr-church that has succumbed to death ([Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019).md), just as with an extended
vision he foretells the termination of death itself ([Psa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008).md); and the Book of Daniel-that Old
Testament apocalypse, sealed until the time of its fulfilment-first
foretells the general resurrection, i.e., the awakening of some to life
and others to judgment ([Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002).md).
Between these two prophecies comes Ezekiel's vision of Israel's return
from the Exile under the figure of a creative quickening of a vast field
of corpses ([Psa 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001).md) - a figure
which at least assumes that what is represented is not impossible to the
wonder-working power of God, which is true to His promises. But also in
the latest psalms the perception of salvation nowhere appears to have
made such advance, that these words of prophecy foretelling the
resurrection should have been converted into a dogmatic element of the
church's belief. The hope, that the bones committed, like seed, to the
ground would spring forth again, finds expression first only in a bold,
but differently expressed figure ([Psa
141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007).md); the hopeless darkness of Shel
([Psa 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md); [Psa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#010.md); [Psa
88:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011).md) remained unillumined, and
where deliverance from death and Hades is spoken of, what is meant is
the preservation of the living, either experienced (e.g., [Psa
86:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#013)) or hoped for (e.g., 118:17.md)
from falling a prey to death and Hades, and we find in connection with
it other passages which express the impossibility of escaping this
universal final destiny ([Psa 89:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#049).md).
The hope of eternal life after death is nowhere definitely expressed, as
even in the Book of Job the longing for it is never able to expand into
a hope, because no light of promise shines into that night, which reigns
over Job's mind, - a night, which the conflict of temptation through
which he is passing makes darker than it is in itself. The pearl which
appears above the waves of temptation is only too quickly swallowed up
again by them.

Also in the Psalms we find passages in which the hope of not falling a
prey to death is expressed so broadly, that the thought of the final
destiny of all men being inevitable is completely swallowed up by the
living one's confidence of living in the strength of God (Ps 56:14 and
esp. [Psa 16:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009).md); passages in which
the covenant relation with Jahve is contrasted with this present life
and its possession, in such a manner that the opposite of a life
extending beyond the present time is implied ([Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)., [Psa
63:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#004).md); passages in which the end of
the ungodly is compared with the end of the righteous as death and life,
defeat and triumph ([Psa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015).md), so
that the inference forces itself upon one, that the former die although
they seem to live for ever, and the latter live for ever although they
die at once; and passage in which the psalmist, though only by way of
allusion, looks forward to a being borne away to God, like Enoch and
Elijah ([Psa 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md); [Psa
73:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#024).md). Nowhere, however, is there any
general creed to be found, but we see how the belief in a future life
struggles to be free, at first only, as an individual conclusion of the
believing mind from premises which experience has established. And far
from the grave being penetrated by a glimpse of heaven, it has, on the
contrary, to the ecstasy of the life derived from God, as it were
altogether vanished; for life in opposition to death only appears as the
lengthening of the line of the present ad infinitum. Hence it is that we
no more find in the Psalms than in the Book of Job a perfectly
satisfactory theodicy with reference to that distribution of human
fortunes in this world, which is incompatible with God's justice. - Ps
7, Ps 49, Ps 73 certainly border on the right solution of the mystery,
but it stops short at mere hint and presage, so that the utterances that
touch upon it admit of different interpretation.

(Note: Vid., Kurtz, ibid. II: The doctrine of retribution in the Psalms,
ibid. S. 316-352.)

But on the other hand, death and life in the mind of the psalmists are
such deep-rooted notions (i.e., taken hold of at the very roots, which
are grounded in the principles of divine wrath and divine love), that it
is easy for the New Testament faith, to which they have become clear
even to their back ground of hell and heaven, to adjust and deepen the
meaning of all utterances in the Psalms that refer to them. It is by no
means contrary to the meaning of the psalmist when, as in passages like
[Psa 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md), Gehenna is substituted for
Hades to adapt it to the New Testament saint; for since the descent of
Jesus Christ into Hades there is no longer any limbus patrum, the way of
all who die in the Lord is not earthwards but upwards, Hades exists only
as the vestibule of hell. The psalmists indeed dread it, but only as the
realm of wrath or of seclusion from god's love, which is the true life
of man. Nor is it contrary to the idea of the poets to think of the
future vision of God's face in all its glory in [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md) and of the resurrection morn in
[Psa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md); for the hopes expressed
there, though to the Old Testament consciousness they referred to this
side the grave, are future according to their New Testament fulfilment,
which is the only truly satisfying one. There is, as Oetinger says, no
essential New Testament truth not contained in the Psalms either νοΐ́
(according to its unfolded meaning), or at least πνεύματι. The Old
Testament barrier encompasses the germinating New Testament life, which
at a future time shall burst it. The eschatology of the Old Testament
leaves a dark background, which, as is designed, is divided by the New
Testament revelation into light and darkness, and is to be illumined
into a wide perspective extending into the eternity beyond time.
Everywhere, where it begins to dawn in this eschatological darkness of
the Old Testament, it is the first morning rays of the New Testament
sun-rise which is already announcing itself. The Christian also here
cannot refrain from leaping the barrier of the psalmists, and
understanding the Psalms according to the mind of the Spirit whose
purpose in the midst of the development of salvation and of the
perception of it, is directed towards its goal and consummation. Thus
understood the Psalms are the hymns of the New Testament Israel as of
the Old. The church by using the language of the Psalms in supplication
celebrates the unity of the two Testaments, and scholarship in
expounding them honours their distinctiveness. Both are in the right;
the former in regarding the Psalms in the light of the one great
salvation, the latter in carefully distinguishing the eras in the
history, and the steps in the perception, of this salvation.

The Fifteen Songs of Degrees, or Gradual Psalm - Ps. 120-134

These songs are all inscribed שׁיר המּעלות. The lxx, according to the
most natural signification of the word, renders: ᾠδὴ τῶν ἀναβαθμων; the
Italic and Vulgate, canticum graduum (whence the liturgical term
"gradual Psalms"). The meaning at the same time remains obscure. When,
however, Theodotion renders ᾆσμα τῶν ἀναβάσεων, Aquila and Symmachus ᾠδὴ
εἰς τάς ἀναβάσεις (as though it were absolutely למּעלות, as in [Psa
121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001).md), it looks even like an
explanation. The fathers, more particularly Theodoret, and in general
the Syria church, associate with it the idea of ἡ ἀπὸ Βαβυλῶνος
ἐπάνοδος. Ewald has long advocated this view. In his Introduction to Die
poetischen Bcher des Alten Bundes (1839), and elsewhere, he translated
it "Songs of the Pilgrim caravans" or "of the homeward marches," and
explained these fifteen Psalms as old and new travelling songs of those
returning from the Exile. The verb עלה certainly is the usual word for
journeying to Palestine out of the Babylonian low country, as out of the
country of the Egyptian Nile Valley. And the fact that the Return from
the Exile is called המּעלה מבּבל in [Ezr
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009.md) is enticing. Some of these Psalms,
as [Psa 121:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md), [Psa
123:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md), [Psa
129:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001.md), [Psa
130:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md), Ps 132, [Psa
133:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md), are also suited to this
situation, or can at least be adapted to it. But [Psa
120:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md), if it is to be referred to
the Exile, is a song that comes out of the midst of it; [Psa
126:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md) might, so far as its first
half is concerned, be a travelling song of those returning, but
according to its second half it is a prayer of those who have returned
for the restoration of the whole of Israel, based upon thanksgiving; and
[Psa 122:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md) assumes the existence and
frequenting of the Temple and of the holy city, and [Psa
134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md) the full exercise of the
Temple-service. It is also inconvenient that מעלה, which in itself only
expresses a journey up, not a journey homewards, is without any closer
definition; and more particularly since, in connection with this form of
the word, the signification of a something (a step, a sun-dial, rising
thoughts. [Eze 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#005).md) is at least just
as natural as that of an action. שׁיר העלים would have been at once
palpable. And what is meant by the plural? The interpretation of the
plural of the different caravans or companies in which the exiles
returned, assumes a usus loquendi with which we are altogether
unacquainted.

Relatively more probable is the reference to the pilgrimage-journeyings
at the three great feasts - according to a later Hebrew expression, the
שׁלשׁ רגלים. This going up to Jerusalem required by the Law is also
usually called עלה. So Agellius (1606), Herder, Eichhorn, Maurer,
Hengstenberg, Keil, and others, and so now even Ewald in the second
edition (1866) of the Introduction to Die Dichter des Alten Bundes, so
Kamphausen, and Reuss in his treatise Chants de Plerinage ou petit
Psautier des Plerins du second temple (in the Nouvelle Revue de
Thologie, i. 273-311), and Liebusch in the Quedlinburg Easter Programm,
1866: "The pilgrim songs in the Fifth Book of the Psalter." But מעלה in
this signification is without precedent; and when Hupfeld says in
opposition to this, "the fact that a noun accidentally does not occur in
the Old Testament does not matter, since here at any rate it is a
question of the interpretation of a later usage of the language," we may
reply that neither does the whole range of the post-biblical Hebrew
exhibit any trace of this usage. Thenius accordingly tries another way
of doing justice to the word. He understands מעלות of the different
stations, i.e., stages of the journey up, that are to be found in
connection with the festive journeys to high-lying Jerusalem. But the
right name for "stations" would be מסּעות or מעמדות; and besides, the
notion borrowed from the processions to Mount Calvary is without
historical support in the religious observances of Israel. Thus, then,
the needful ground in language and custom for referring this title of
the Psalms to the journeyings up to the feasts is taken from under us;
and the consideration that the first three and the last three songs are
suited to the hymn-book of a festal pilgrimage, and that they all bear
in them, as Liebusch has demonstrated, the characteristic features of
the spiritual national song, is not able to decide the doubtful meaning
of מעלות.

We will now put the later Jewish interpretation to the proof. According
to Middoth ii. 5, Succa 15b, a semi-circular staircase with fifteen
steps led out of the court of the Israelitish men (עזרת ישראל) down into
the court of the women (עזרת נשׁים), and upon these fifteen steps, which
correspond to the fifteen gradual Psalms, the Levites played musical
instruments on the evening of the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles
in connection with the joyful celebration of the water-drawing,

(Note: Vid., my Geschichte der jdischen Poesie, S. 193f.)

and above them in the portal (upon the threshold of the Nicanor-gate or
Agrippa-gate)

(Note: It was called the Nicanor-gate in the Temple of Zerubbabel, and
the Agrippa-gate in the Temple of Herod: in both of them they ascended
to its threshold by fifteen steps; vid., Unruh, Das alte Jerusalem und
seine Bauwerke (1861), S. 137, cf. 194.)

stood two priests with trumpets. It has been said that this is a
Talmudic fable invented on behalf of the inscription שׁיר המעלות, and
that the fifteen steps are not out of [Eze
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#026.md), [Eze
40:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#031.md) by reading the two verses
together. This aspersion is founded on ignorance. For the Talmud does
not say in that passage that the fifteen Psalms have taken their name
from the fifteen steps; it does not once say that these Psalms in
particular were read aloud upon the fifteen steps, but it only places
the fifteen steps on a parallel with the fifteen Psalms; and, moreover,
interprets the name שׁיר המעלות quite differently, viz., from a legend
concerning David and Ahithophel, Succa 53a, Maccoth 11a (differently
rendered in the section Chelek of the tractate Sanhedrin in the
Jerusalem Talmud). This legend to which the Targum inscription relates
(vid., Buxtorf, Lex. Talmud. s.v. קפא) is absurd enough, but it has
nothing to do with the fifteen steps. It is not until a later period
that Jewish expositors say that the fifteen Psalms had their name from
the fifteen steps.

(Note: Lyra in his Postillae, and Jacob Leonitius in his Hebrew Libellus
effigiei templi Salomonis (Amsterdam 1650, 4to), even say that the
Levites sang one of the fifteen songs of degrees on each step. Luther
has again generalized this view; for his rendering "a song in the higher
choir" is intended to say, cantores harum odarum stetisse in loco
eminentiori (Bakius).)

Even Hippolytus must have heard something similar when he says (p. 190,
ed. Lagarde): πάλιν τε αὐτοῦ εἰσί τινες τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν ᾠδαί, τὸν ἀριθμὸν
πεντεκαίδεκα, ὅσοι καὶ οἱ ἀναβαθμοὶ τοῦ ναοῦ, τάχα δελοῦσαι τάς
ἀναβάσεις περιέχεσθαι ἐν τῷ ἑβδόμῳ καὶ ὀγδόῳ ἀριθμῷ, upon which Hilary
relies: esse autem in templo gradus quindecim historia nobis locuta est;
viz., 15 (7 + 8) steps leading out of the court of the priests into the
Holy of holies. In this, then, the allegory in which the interpretation
of the church delighted for a long time seemed naturally at hand, viz.,
as Otmar Nachtgal explains, "Song of the steps or ascents, which
indicate the spirit of those who ascend from earthly things to God." The
furtmaier Codex in Maihingen accordingly inscribes them "Psalm of the
first step" (Psalm der ersten staffeln), and so on. If we leave this
sensus anagogicus to itself, then the title, referred to the fifteen
steps, would indeed not be inappropriate in itself (cf. Graduale or
Gradale in the service of the Romish Church), but is of an external
character such as we find nowhere else.

(Note: Hitzig, in his Commentary (1865), has attempted a new combination
of these Psalms, in regard to the number of verses of 120 and 121 (7 +
8) and their total number, with the steps of the temple.)

Gesenius has the merit of having first discerned the true meaning of the
questioned inscription, inasmuch as first in 1812 (Hallische Lit.
Zeitschrift, 1812, Nr. 205), and frequently since that time, he has
taught that the fifteen songs have their name from their step-like
progressive rhythm of the thoughts, and that consequently the name, like
the triolet (roundelay) in Western poetry, does not refer to the
liturgical usage, but to the technical structure. The correctness of
this view has been duly appraised more particularly by De Wette, who
adduces this rhythm of steps or degrees, too, among the more artificial
rhythms. The songs are called Songs of degrees or Gradual Psalms as
being songs that move onward towards a climax, and that by means of
plokee' epiplokee'), i.e., a taking up again of the immediately
preceding word by way of giving intensity to the expression; and they
are placed together on account of this common characteristic, just like
the Michtammim, which bear that name from a similar characteristic. The
fact, as Liebusch objects, that there is no trace of מעלות in this
figurative signification elsewhere, is of no consequence, since in the
inscriptions of the Psalms in general we become acquainted with a
technical language which (apart from a few echoes in the Chronicles) is
without example elsewhere, in relation to poetical and musical
technology. Neither are we refuted by the fact that this as it were
climbing movement of the thoughts which plants upon a preceding word,
and thus carried itself forward, is not without example even outside the
range of these fifteen songs in the Psalter itself (e.g., [Psa
93:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md), [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001).md), as also elsewhere ([Isa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012.md)., [Psa
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#005.md)., and more particularly in the
song of Deborah, [Jdg 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#003.md), [Jdg
5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005), etc..md), and that it is not
always carried out in the same manner in the fifteen Psalms. It is quite
sufficient that the parallelism retires into the background here as
nowhere else in fifteen songs that are linked together (even in [Psa
125:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md), [Psa
127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md), [Psa
128:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001), Ps 132.md); and the onward
course is represented with decided preference as a gradation or advance
step by step, that which follows being based upon what goes before, and
from that point advancing and ascending still higher.
