Zephaniah

Introduction

Person of the Prophet. - Zephaniah's family is traced back in the
heading to his book through four members, namely, to his
great-great-grandfather Hezekiah; from which it has been justly
inferred, that inasmuch as the father only is mentioned as a general
rule, Hezekiah must have been a celebrated man, and that in all
probability the king of that name is intended. For the only other person
of such a name mentioned in the earlier history is an Ephraimite called
Yehizkiyâh in [Ch2 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md), and he can
hardly be the person intended. The circumstance that Hezekiah is not
described as the king of that name by the predicate hammelekh or melekh
Yehūdâh, furnishes no decided argument against this assumption, but may
probably be explained on the ground that the predicate "king of Judah"
follows immediately afterwards in connection with Josiah's name. There
is still less force in the objection, that in the genealogy of the kings
only two generations occur between Hezekiah and Josiah, inasmuch as
Manasseh reigned for fifty-five years, that is to say, for nearly two
generations. The name Zephaniah (Tsephanyâh), i.e., he whom Jehovah
hides or shelters, not "speculator et arcanorum Dei cognitor," as Jerome
explains it according to an erroneous derivation from tsâphâh instead of
tsâphân, occurs again as the name of a priest ([Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md); [Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025), etc..md), as well as of other
persons (cf. [Zac 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010.md), [Zac
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014.md); [Ch1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#021).md). The lxx write it Σοφονίας,
Sophonias, according to their usual custom of expressing צ by σ, and the
Sheva by a short vowel which is regulated by the full vowel that
follows; they have also changed the a into o, as in the case of Γοδολίου
for Gedalyâh in [Zep 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001.md). Nothing
further is known concerning the prophet's life. The statement in Ps.
Doroth. and Ps. Epiph., that he sprang "from the tribe of Simeon, from
the mountain of Sarabath" (al. Baratha or Sabartharam), is quite
worthless. The date at which he lived is determined by the statement in
the heading to his book, to the effect that he prophesied under king
Josiah the son of Amos, who reigned from 641 to 610 b.c. This agrees
both with the place assigned to his book in the series of the minor
prophets, namely, between Habakkuk and Haggai, and also by the contents
of his prophecies. According to [Zep
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013.md)., where he predicts the
destruction of the kingdom of Asshur and the city of Nineveh, the
Assyrian empire was still in existence in his time, and Nineveh was not
yet conquered, which took place, according to our discussions on Nahum
(pp. 380ff.), at the earliest, in the closing years of Josiah's reign,
and possibly not till after his death. Moreover, his description of the
moral depravity which prevailed in Jerusalem coincided in many respects
with that of Jeremiah, whose labours as a prophet commenced in the
thirteenth year of Josiah. Along with the worship of Jehovah ([Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md); cf. [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020).md), he speaks of idolatry ([Zep
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md); cf. [Jer
7:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#017).md), of false swearing by
Jehovah, and swearing by the idols ([Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md); [Jer
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md); [Jer
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009.md), and [Jer
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md); [Jer
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#016).md), of the wicked treatment of the
thorâh ([Zep 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md); [Jer
8:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008).md), of the fruitlessness of all
the admonitions that have hitherto been addressed to Judah ([Zep
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002.md); [Jer
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030.md); [Jer
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028).md), and of the deep moral
corruption that has pervaded all ranks - the royal family, the princes,
the prophets, and the priests ([Zep
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md), [Zep
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#008.md); [Zep
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md); cf. [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008.md), [Jer
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026).md). He describes the nation as a
shameless one ([Zep 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md); [Zep
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005.md); cf. [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md); [Jer
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#015.md); [Jer
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#012).md), and Jerusalem as a rebellious
city (מוראה, [Zep 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md); cf. [Jer
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017.md); [Jer
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023).md), as stained with blood and the
abominations of idolatry ([Zep 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md);
cf. [Jer 2:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#022.md), [Jer
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#034).md), and as oppressive towards
widows and orphans, and with its houses full of unrighteous possessions
([Zep 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md) and [Zep
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#009.md); cf. [Jer
5:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#027.md); [Jer
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#006).md).

The only point open to dispute is whether Zephaniah's prophecy belonged
to the first or the second half of the thirty-first year of Josiah's
reign. Whilst Ewald supposes that Zephaniah wrote at a time when "not
even any preparation had yet been made in Jerusalem for that important
and thorough reformation of religion which king Josiah attempted with
such energetic decision and such good results in the second half of his
reign" (2 Kings 22-23), most of the other commentators infer from [Zep
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md), where the extermination of the
remnant of Baal is predicted, and with greater propriety, that Josiah's
reformation of religion had already commenced, and that the outward
predominance of idolatry was already broken down when Zephaniah uttered
his prophecies. For the prophet could not well speak of a remnant of
Baal before the abolition of the idolatry introduced into the kingdom by
Manasseh and Amon had really commenced. But Ewald and Hvernick reply to
this, that the prophet announces that even the remnant and the name of
idolatry are to disappear, so that nothing at all will remain, and that
this presupposes that in the time of the prophet not only the remnant of
the worship of Baal was in existence, but the Baal-worship itself. But
however correct the former remark may be, there is no ground for the
conclusion drawn from it. The destruction of Baal, even to the very
remnant and name, does not warrant the assumption that the worship of
Baal still existed in undiminished power and extent at the time when the
threat was uttered, but could be fully explained if there were only
remnants of it left to which the expression "remnant of Baal" primarily
refers. If nothing had been hitherto done for the abolition of idolatry,
Zephaniah would certainly have spoken differently and more strongly than
he does in [Zep 1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md), concerning the
abomination of it. If, for example, according to [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md), sacrifices were still offered
upon the roofs to the army of heaven, the existence of the
Jehovah-worship is also presupposed in the reproof in [Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md), "the priests pollute the
sanctuary;" and in the words "them that swear by Jehovah, and swear by
their king" ([Zep 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005).md),
Jehovah-worship and idolatry are mentioned as existing side by side. We
cannot therefore regard the opinion, that "throughout the whole of the
prophecy there is no trace of any allusion to Josiah's reformation," as
a well-founded one. According to the more precise account given in the
Chronicles, Josiah commenced the reformation of worship in the twelfth
year of his reign ([Ch2 34:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003).md), and
in the eighteenth year he had the temple repaired. It was then that the
book of he law was discovered, the reading of which affected the king so
much, that he not only appointed a solemn passover, but after the feast
was over had all the remaining traces of idolatry in Jerusalem and Judah
completely obliterated ([Kg2 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024).md).
Now, as Zephaniah's prophecy presupposes the maintenance of the
temple-worship, it can only have been uttered after the purification of
the temple from the abominations of idolatry that were practised in its
courts, and in all probability was not uttered till after the completion
of the repairs of the temple, and the celebration of the solemn passover
in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign. The time cannot be determined
more exactly.

The threat in [Zep 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#008.md), that the
judgment shall fall upon the princes, and even upon the king's sons,
does not warrant us in concluding that the sons of Josiah had reached a
sufficient age to have occasioned the announcement of punishment, by
sinful acts for which they themselves were accountable, which would not
apply to the twelfth year of the king's reign, when Jehoiakim was six
years old, Jehoahaz four years, and when Zedekiah was not yet born, but
only to the eighteenth year, when Jehoiakim had reached his twelfth year
and Jehoahaz his tenth. For "the king's sons" are not necessarily the
sons of the reigning sovereign only, but may also include the sons of
the deceased kings, Manasseh and Amon; and this general threat of
judgment announced against all ranks may be understood without
hesitation as relating to all princes or persons of royal blood. The
character of the prophecy as a whole also furnishes no decisive points
bearing upon the question, whether it was uttered or composed before or
after the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign. For the tendency to promote
the work of religious reformation which had already commenced, by means
of strong prophetic encouragements, in order that it might lead to a
division, and therefore to decision for the Lord ([Zep
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md), which Hvernick and several
other commentators claim for our prophecy, can no more be proved to
exist in the writing before us, than the conjecture expressed by
Delitzsch in Herzog's Cyclopaedia, that the prophet did not come forward
with his threat till the efforts of the pious king to exterminate
utterly the worship of Baal had reached their highest point, without
securing their end; inasmuch as it is in accordance with the position of
things and the character of prophecy, that when human efforts have done
their utmost without securing the desired result, Jehovah interposes and
threatens what still remains of Baal with His outstretched arm of
punishment. For however correct the remark (of Delitzsch) may be, that
in the form in which the prophecy lies before us it contains no trace of
any intention to promote the work taken in hand by the king, and that
the state of the nation as reflected therein is not a progressive one in
process of reformation, but appears rather to be a finished one and ripe
for judgment; the latter only applies to the mass of the nation, who
were incorrigible, and therefore ripe for judgment, and does not
preclude the existence of a better kernel, to which the prophet could
still preach repentance, and cry, "Seek ye the Lord, seek humility;
perhaps ye may be hidden in the day of Jehovah" ([Zep
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003).md). But the nation was in this state
not only after the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, but also before
it; and the efforts of the pious king to exterminate idolatry, and to
raise and revive the worship of Jehovah, could effect no further
alteration in this, than that individuals out of the corrupt mass were
converted, and were saved from destruction. The measure of the sin,
which was inevitable followed by the destruction of the kingdom of
Judah, had been already filled by Manasseh, and Josiah's reformation
could only effect a postponement, and not avert the threatened judgment
(compare [Kg2 12:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#010.md) with [Kg2
23:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026).md).

2\. The Book of Zephaniah does not contain two or three prophetic
addresses, but the quintessence of the oral proclamations of the prophet
condensed into one lengthened prophecy, commencing with the threat of
judgment (ch. 1), proceeding to an exhortation to repentance (ch.
2-3:8), and concluding with a promise of the salvation which would
flourish for the remnant of Israel after the termination of the judgment
([Zep 3:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009).md). This is arranged in
three sections. The first section consists of the first chapter; the
second reaches from [Zep 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md) to [Zep
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md); and the third comprises [Zep
3:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md). This division is indicated by
both the contents and the form of the announcement: by the contents,
since the first two parts threaten the judgment and assign the reason,
whilst the third follows with the promise; by the form, inasmuch as the
thought in [Zep 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#018.md), "All the earth
shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy," is repeated as a refrain
in [Zep 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md), and the hōi in [Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005.md) answers to the hōi in [Zep
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md), the former announcing the
judgment upon the nations, the latter the judgment upon Jerusalem, which
assigns the motive for the summons to repentance in [Zep
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md). Zephaniah proclaims the
judgment upon the whole earth, upon all the heathen nations, and upon
Judah and Jerusalem, in the following order: In the first part of his
prophecy he threatens the near approach of the judgment upon the whole
earth ([Zep 1:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#002).md) and upon Judah
([Zep 1:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#008).md), and depicts its
terrible character ([Zep 1:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#014).md); and
in the second part (ch. 2-3:8) he exhorts the people to repent, and the
righteous to persevere ([Zep 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001).md),
and assigns a reason for this exhortation, by announcing that the Lord
will judge the heathen nations both near and at hand and far off for the
reproach which they have cast upon His people, and by destroying their
power lead them to reverence His name ([Zep
2:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004).md), and will also bring His
righteousness to light in Jerusalem and Judah by the destruction of the
ungodly ([Zep 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001).md). Then (the
announcement of salvation commences thus in [Zep
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009).md) will the nations serve Jehovah
with one accord, and lead His scattered people to Him. The remnant of
Israel will be made into a humble nation of God by the destruction of
the wicked one out of the midst of it; and being sheltered by its God,
it will rejoice in undisturbed happiness, and be exalted to "a name and
praise" among all the nations of the earth ([Zep
3:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011).md).

Zephaniah's prophecy has a more general character, embracing both
judgment and salvation in their totality, so as to form one complete
picture. It not only commences with the announcement of a universal
judgment upon the whole world, out of which the judgment rises that will
fall upon Judah on account of its sins, and upon the world of nations on
account of its hostility to the people of Jehovah; but it treats
throughout of the great and terrible day of Jehovah, on which the fire
of the wrath of God consumes the whole earth ([Zep
1:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#014.md); [Zep
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#002.md); [Zep
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008).md). But the judgment, as a
revelation of the wrath of God on account of the general corruption of
the world, does not form the centre of gravity or the sole object of the
whole of the predictions of our prophet. The end and goal at which they
aim are rather the establishment of divine righteousness in the earth,
and the judgment is simply the means and the way by which this the aim
of all the development of the world's history is to be realized. This
comes clearly out in the second and third sections. Jehovah will
manifest Himself terribly to the nations, to destroy all the gods of the
earth, that all the islands of the nations may worship Him ([Zep
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011).md). By pouring out His wrath upon
nations and kingdoms, He will turn to the peoples a pure lip, so that
they will call upon His name and serve Him with one shoulder ([Zep
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008).md). The idolaters, the wicked, and
the despisers of God will be destroyed out of Judah and Jerusalem, that
the righteousness of Jehovah may come to the day ([Zep
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001).md). The humble, who do God's
righteousness, are to seek Jehovah, to strive after righteousness and
humility, and to wait for the Lord, for the day when He will arise, to
procure for Himself worshippers of His name among the nations through
the medium of the judgment, and to gather together His dispersed people,
and make the remnant of Israel into a sanctified and blessed people of
God ([Zep 3:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011).md).

It is in this comprehensive character of his prophecy that we find the
reason why Zephaniah neither names, nor minutely describes, the
executors of the judgment upon Judah, and even in the description of the
judgment to be inflicted upon the heathen nations ([Zep
2:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004).md) simply individualizes the idea
of "all the nations of the earth," by naming the nearer and more remote
nations to the west and east, the south and north of Judah. He does not
predict either this or that particular judgment, but extends and
completes in comprehensive generality the judgment, by which God
maintains His kingdom on the earth. This peculiarity in Zephaniah's
prophecy has been correctly pointed out by Bucer (in his commentary,
1528), when he says of the book before us: "If any one wishes all the
secret oracles of the prophets to be given in a brief compendium, let
him read through this brief Zephaniah." There are many respects in which
Zephaniah links his prophecy to those of the earlier prophets, both in
subject-matter and expression; not, however, by resuming those
prophecies of theirs which had not been fulfilled, or were not
exhausted, during the period of the Assyrian judgment upon the nations,
and announcing a fresh and more perfect fulfilment of them by the
Chaldaeans, but by reproducing in a compendious form the fundamental
thoughts of judgment and salvation which are common to all the prophets,
that his contemporaries may lay them to heart; in doing which he
frequently appropriates striking words and pregnant expression taken
from his predecessors, and applies them to his own purpose. Thus, for
example, the expression in [Zep 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md) is
compiled from earlier prophetic words: "Be silent before the Lord
Jehovah (from [Hab 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020).md), for the day
of Jehovah is at hand ([Joe 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md) and
others); for Jehovah has prepared a sacrificial slaughter ([Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006).md), has consecrated His invited
ones ([Isa 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003).md)." (For further
remarks on this point, see my Lehrbuch der Einleitung, p. 307). In this
respect Zephaniah opens the series of the less original prophets of the
Chaldaean age of judgment, who rest more upon the earlier types; whilst
in more material respects his predecessor Habakkuk acted as pioneer to
the prophets of this period.

Ewald's view bears evidence of a strong misapprehension of the nature of
the prophecy generally, and of the special peculiarities of the prophecy
before us. "The book of Zephaniah," he says, "must have originated in a
great commotion among the nations, which threw all the kingdoms round
about Judah far and wide into a state of alarm, and also threatened to
be very dangerous to Jerusalem," - namely, on account of the invasion of
Upper and Hither Asia by the Scythians, which is mentioned by Herodotus
in i. 15, 103-6, iv. 10ff. For there is not a trace discoverable in the
whole book of any great commotion among the nations. The few allusions
to the fact that a hostile army will execute the judgment upon Jerusalem
and Judah (in [Zep 1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012.md), [Zep
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#016.md), and [Zep
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#015).md) do not presuppose anything of
the kind; and in the threatening of the judgment upon Philistia, Moab
and Ammon, Cush, and Asshur with Nineveh, Jehovah only is named as
executing it ([Zep 2:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004).md). Moreover,
neither Herodotus nor the historical books of the Old Testament mention
any conquest of Jerusalem by the Scythians; whilst, even according to
the account given by Herodotus, the Scythian hordes neither destroyed
Nineveh nor made war upon the Cushites (Aethiopians), as would be
predicted by Zephaniah ([Zep 2:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#012).md),
if he had the Scythians in his eye; and lastly, Jeremiah, upon whose
prophecies Ewald, Hitzig, and Bertheau have principally based their
Scythian hypothesis, knows nothing of the Scythians, but simply expects
and announces that the judgment upon Judah and Jerusalem will come from
the Chaldaeans. Zephaniah found the historical occasion for his prophecy
in the moral depravity of Judah and Jerusalem, in the depth to which his
people had fallen in idolatry, and in their obstinate resistance to all
the efforts made by the prophets and the pious king Josiah to stem the
corruption, and thus avert from Judah the judgment threatened even by
Moses and the earlier prophets, of the dispersion of the whole nation
among the heathen. On the ground of the condition of his people, and the
prophetic testimonies of his predecessors, Zephaniah, under the impulse
of the Spirit of God, predicted the near approach of the great and
terrible day of Jehovah, which came upon Judah and the heathen nations
far and wide through the instrumentality of the Chaldaeans. For
Nebuchadnezzar laid the foundation of the empire which devastated Judah,
destroyed Jerusalem with its temple, and led the degenerate covenant
nation into exile. This empire was perpetuated in the empires of the
Persians, the Macedonians, and the Romans, which arose after it and took
its place, and in whose power Judah continued, even after the return of
one portion of the exiles to the land of their fathers, and after the
restoration of the temple and the city of Jerusalem during the Persian
rule; so that the city of God was trodden down by the heathen even to
the time of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, whereby the
desolation of the holy land, which continues to the present day, was
produced, and the dispersion of the Jews to all quarters of the globe
accomplished, and both land and people were laid under the ban, from
which Israel can only be liberated by its conversion to Jesus Christ,
the Saviour of all nations, and from which it will assuredly be redeemed
by virtue of the promise of the faithful covenant God. For the
exegetical literature, see my Lehrbuch der Einleitung, pp. 305-6.
