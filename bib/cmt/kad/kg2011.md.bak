[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 11:1</span></span>

The Government of Athaliah (cf. [Ch2
22:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010).md). After the death of Ahaziah
of Judah, his mother Athaliah, a daughter of Ahab and Jezebel (see at
[Kg2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md) and [Kg2
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026).md), seized upon the government, by
putting to death all the king's descendants with the exception of Joash,
a son of Ahaziah of only a year old, who had been secretly carried off
from the midst of the royal children, who were put to death, by
Jehosheba, his father's sister, the wife of the high priest Jehoiada,
and was first of all hidden with his nurse in the bed-chamber, and
afterwards kept concealed from Athaliah for six years in the high
priest's house. The ו before ראתה is no doubt original, the subject,
Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah, being placed at the head absolutely, and
a circumstantial clause introduced with וראתה: "Athaliah, when she saw
that, etc., rose up." המּמלכה כּל־זרע, all the royal seed, i.e., all the
sons and relations of Ahaziah, who could put in any claim to succeed to
the throne. At the same time there were hardly any other direct
descendants of the royal family in existence beside the sons of Ahaziah,
since the elder brothers of Ahaziah had been carried away by the Arabs
and put to death, and the rest of the closer blood-relations of the male
sex had been slain by Jehu (see at [Kg2
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#013).md). - Jehosheba (יהושׁבע, in the
Chronicles יהושׁבעת), the wife of the high priest Jehoiada ([Ch2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011).md), was a daughter of king Joram
and a sister of Ahaziah, but she was most likely not a daughter of
Athaliah, as this worshipper of Baal would hardly have allowed her own
daughter to marry the high priest, but had been born to Joram by a wife
of the second rank. ממותים (Chethb), generally a substantive, mortes
([Jer 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004.md); [Eze
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#008).md), here an adjective: slain or set
apart for death. The Keri מוּמתים is the participle Hophal, as in [Ch2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011.md). הם בּחדר is to be taken in
connection with תּגנב: she stole him (took him away secretly) from the
rest of the king's sons, who were about to be put to death, into the
chamber of the beds, i.e., not the children's bed-room, but a room in
the palace where the beds (mattresses and counterpanes) were kept, for
which in the East there is a special room that is not used as a
dwelling-room (see Chardin in Harm. Beobb. iii. p. 357). This was the
place in which at first it was easiest to conceal the child and its
nurse. ויּסתּרוּ, "they (Jehosheba and the nurse) concealed him," is not
to be altered into ותּסתּירהוּ after the Chronicles, as Thenius
maintains. The masculine is used in the place of the feminine, as is
frequently the case. Afterwards he was concealed with her (with
Jehosheba) in the house of Jehovah, i.e., in the home of the high-priest
in one of the buildings of the court of the temple.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 11:4</span></span>

Dethronement of Athaliah and Coronation of Joash (compare the account in
2 Chron 23, which is more elaborate in several points).

(Note: In both accounts we have only short extracts preserved from a
common and more complete original, the extracts having been made quite
independently of one another and upon different plans. Hence the
apparent discrepancies, which have arisen partly from the incompleteness
of the two abridged accounts, and partly from the different points of
view from which the extracts were made, but which contain no
irreconcilable contradictions. The assertion of De Wette, which has been
repeated by Thenius and Bertheau, that the chronicler distorted the true
state of the case to favour the Levites, rests upon a misinterpretation
of our account, based upon arbitrary assumptions, as I have already
shown in my apologetischer Versuch ber die Chronik (p. 361ff.).)

[Kg2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004.md)

In the seventh year of Athaliah's reign, Jehoiada sent for the captains
of the king's body-guard to come to him into the temple, and concluded a
covenant with them, making them swear and showing them the king's son,
namely, to dethrone the tyrant Athaliah and set the king's son upon the
throne. המּאיות שׂרי, centuriones, military commanders of the
executioners and runners, i.e., of the royal body-guard. The Chethb
מאיות may be explained from the fact that מאה is abridged from מאיה
(vid., Ewald, 267, d.). On ורצים כּרי = והפּלתי הכּרתי ([Kg1
1:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#038).md) see the Comm. on [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018.md); and on ל as a periphrasis of the
genitive, see Ewald, 292, a. In [Ch2
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001.md) the chronicler not only gives
the names of these captains, but relates still more minutely that they
went about in the land and summoned the Levites and heads of families in
Israel to Jerusalem, probably under the pretext of a festal celebration;
whereupon Jehoiada concluded a covenant with the persons assembled, to
ensure their assistance in the execution of his plan.

[Kg2 11:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005.md)

Jehoiada then communicated to those initiated into the plan the
necessary instructions for carrying it out, assigning them the places
which they were to occupy. "The third part of you that come on the
Sabbath (i.e., mount guard) shall keep the guard of the king's house
(ושׁמרי is a corruption of ושׁמרוּ), and the third part shall be at the
gate Sur, and the third part at the gate behind the runners, and (ye)
shall keep guard over the house for defence; and the two parts of you,
(namely) all who depart on the Sabbath, shall keep the guard of the
house of Jehovah for the king; and ye shall surround the king round
about, every one with his weapons in his hand; and whoever presses into
the ranks shall be slain, and shall be with the king when he goes out
and in," i.e., in all his steps. The words השּׁבּת בּאי השּׁבּ and
השּׁבּת יצאי, "those coming and those going out on the Sabbath," denote
the divisions of the watch, those who performed duty on the Sabbath and
those who were relieved on the Sabbath; not the military guard at the
palace however, but the temple-guard, which consisted of Levites. For
David had divided the priests and Levites into classes, every one of
which had to perform service for a week and was relieved on the Sabbath:
compare 1 Chron 23-26 with Josephus (Ant. vii. 14, 7), who expressly
says that every one of the twenty-four classes of priests had to attend
to the worship of God "for eight days, from Sabbath to Sabbath," also
with [Luk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md). On the other hand, we
do not know that there was any similar division and obligation to serve
in connection with the royal body-guard or with the army. The current
opinion, that by those who come on the Sabbath and those who go out on
the Sabbath we are to understand the king's halberdiers or the guard of
the palace, is therefore proved to be unfounded and untenable. And if
there could be any doubt on the matter, it would be removed by [Kg2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007.md) and [Kg2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#010.md). According to [Kg2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007.md), two parts of those who went away
(were relieved) on the Sabbath were to undertake the guarding of the
house of Jehovah about the king, i.e., to keep guard over that room in
the temple where the king then was. Could Jehoiada have used the royal
body-guard, that was being relieved from guarding the palace, for such a
purpose as this? Who can imagine that this is a credible thing?
According to [Kg2 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#010.md), Jehoiada gave
to the captains over a hundred the weapons of king David, which were in
the house of Jehovah. Did the palace-guard then return without weapons?
In [Ch2 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#004.md), "those coming on the
Sabbath" are correctly described as the priests and Levites coming on
the Sabbath, i.e., the priests and Levites who entered upon their week's
duty at the temple on the Sabbath. According to this explanation of the
words, which is the only one that can be grammatically sustained, the
facts were as follows: "When Jehoiada had initiated the captains of the
royal halberdiers, and with their help the heads of families of the
people generally, into his plan of raising the youthful Joash to the
throne and dethroning Athaliah, he determined to carry out the affair
chiefly with the help of the priests and Levites who entered upon their
duty in the temple on the Sabbath, and of those who left or were relived
at the same time, and entrusted the command over these men to the
captains of the royal halberdiers, that they might occupy the approaches
to the temple with the priests and Levites under their command, so as to
prevent the approach of any military from the king's palace and protect
the youthful king. These captains had come to the temple without
weapons, to avoid attracting attention. Jehoiada therefore gave them the
weapons of king David that were kept in the temple.

With regard to the distribution of the different posts, the fact that
two-thirds are spoken of first of all in [Kg2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005.md), [Kg2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#006.md), and then two parts in [Kg2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007.md), occasions no difficulty. For the
two-thirds mentioned in [Kg2 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005.md),
[Kg2 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#006.md) were those who came on the
Sabbath, whereas the "two divisions" (היּדות שׁתּי) referred to in [Kg2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007.md) were all who went away on the
Sabbath. Consequently the priests and Levites, who came on the Sabbath
and entered upon the week's service, were divided into three sections;
and those who should have been relieved, but were detained, into two.
Probably the number of those who came this time to perform service at
the temple was much larger than usual, as the priests were initiated
into Jehoiada's secret; so that it was possible to make three divisions
of those who arrived, whereas those who were about to depart could only
be formed into two. The three divisions of those who were entering upon
duty are also distinctly mentioned in the Chronicles; whereas, instead
of the two divisions of those who were relieved, "all the people" are
spoken of. The description of the different posts which were assigned to
these several companies causes some difficulty. In general, so much is
clearly indicated in [Kg2 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007.md) and
[Kg2 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#008.md), that the two divisions of
those who were relieved on the Sabbath were to keep guard over the young
king in the house of Jehovah, and therefore to remain in the inner
spaces of the temple-court for his protection; whereas the three
divisions of those who were entering upon duty were charged with the
occupation of the external approaches to the temple. One-third was to
"keep watch over the king's house," i.e., to observe whatever had to be
observed in relation to the king's palace; not to occupy the king's
palace, or to keep guard in the citadel at the palace gate (Thenius),
but to keep watch towards the royal palace, i.e., to post themselves so
that no one could force a way into the temple, with which the indefinite
המּלך בּבית in the Chronicles harmonizes, if we only translate it
"against (at) the king's house." The idea that the palace was guarded is
precluded not only by [Kg2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013.md),
according to which Athaliah came out of the palace to the people to the
house of Jehovah, which she would not have been able to do if the palace
had been guarded, but also by the circumstance that, according to [Kg2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019.md), the chief men were in the
temple with the whole of the (assembled) people, and did not go out of
the house of Jehovah into the king's house till after the anointing of
Joash and the death of Athaliah. The other third was to station itself
at the gate Sur (סוּר), or, according to the Chronicles, Yesod (יסוד),
foundation-gate. There is no doubt as to the identity of the gate Sur
and the gate Yesod; only we cannot decide whether one of these names has
simply sprung from a copyist's error, or whether the gate had two
different names. The name יסוד שׁער, foundation-gate, suggests a gate in
the outer court of the temple, at the hollow of either the Tyropoeon or
the Kedron; for the context precludes our thinking of a palace gate. The
third division was to be posted "at the gate behind the runners;" or, as
it is stated in [Kg2 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019.md), "at the
gate of the runners." It is very evident from [Kg2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019.md) that this gate led from the
temple-court to the royal palace upon Zion, and was therefore on the
western side of the court of the temple. This also follows from [Kg2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004.md) of the Chronicles, according to
which this division was to act as "doorkeepers of the thresholds"
(הסּפּים לשׁערי), i.e., to keep guard at the gate of the thresholds. For
we may safely infer, from a comparison with [Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md), that הסּפּים were the thresholds
of the ascent to the temple. The last clause, "and shall keep guard over
the house for defence," refers to all three divisions, and serves to
define with greater precision the object for which they were stationed
there. מסּח is not a proper name (lxx, Luther, and others), but an
appellative in the sense of defence or resistance, from נסח, depellere.
The meaning is, that they were to guard the house, to keep off the
people, and not to let any of the party of Athaliah force a way into the
temple. - In [Kg2 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#007.md), הש יצאי כּל is
an explanatory apposition to בּכם ot היּדות וּשׁתּי, "and the two parts
in (of) you," namely, all who go out on the Sabbath, i.e., are relieved
from duty. Their task, to observe the watch of the house of Jehovah with
regard to the king, is more precisely defined in [Kg2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#008.md) as signifying, that they were to
surround the king with weapons in their hands, and slay every one who
attempted to force a way into their ranks. וּבבאו בּצאתו, i.e., in all
his undertakings, or in all his steps; ובוא צאת being applied to the
actions and pursuits of a man, as in [Deu
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#006.md); [Deu
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#002.md), etc. (see the Comm. on [Num
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#017).md). Thenius has explained this
incorrectly: "in his going out of the temple and entering into the
palace."

[Kg2 11:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#009.md)

The execution of these plans. The high priest gave the captains "the
spears and shields (שׁלטים: see at [Sa2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#007)) which (belonged.md) to king David,
that were in the house of Jehovah," i.e., the weapons which David had
presented to the sanctuary as dedicatory offerings. Instead of החנית we
ought probably to read החניתת (cf. [Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003.md); [Isa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004).md), after the החניתים of the
Chronicles, since the collective force of הנית is very improbable in
prose, and a ת might easily drop out through a copyist's error. Jehoiada
gave the captains weapons from the temple, because, as has been already
observed, they had come unarmed, and not, as Thenius imagines, to
provide them with old and sacred weapons instead of their ordinary ones.
In [Kg2 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#011.md) the position of all the
divisions is given in a comprehensive manner, for the purpose of
appending the further course of the affair, namely, the coronation of
the king. "Thus the halberdiers stood, every one with his weapons in his
hand, from the right wing of the house to the left wing, towards the
altar (of burnt-offering) and the (temple-) house, round about the
king," i.e., to cover the king on all sides. For it is evident that we
are not to understand סביב על־המּלך as signifying the encircling of the
king, from the statement in [Kg2
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012.md), according to which Jehoiada did
not bring out the king's son till after the men had taken up their
positions. The use of הרצים, to signify the captains with the armed
priests and Levites put under their command for this purpose, is an
uncommon one, but it may be explained from the fact that רצים had
retained the general meaning of royal halberdiers; and the priests and
Levites under the command of the captains of the royal body-guard by
this very act discharged the duty of the royal body-guard itself. The
chronicler has used the indefinite expression כּל-haa\`aam, the whole of
the people assembled in the temple-court.

[Kg2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012.md)

After the approaches to the temple had all been occupied in this manner,
Jehoiada brought out the king's son from his home in the temple; or, he
brought him forth, set the crown upon him, and handed him the testimony,
i.e., the book of the law, as the rule of his life and action as king,
according to the precept in [Deu
17:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018.md). ואת־העדוּת is connected with
את־הנּזר עליו יתּן, because עליו יתּן has the general meaning "delivered
to him, handed him," and does not specially affirm the putting on of the
crown. ימליכוּ, they made him king. The subject is the persons present,
through, as a matter of course, the anointing was performed by Jehoiada
and the priests, as the Chronicles expressly affirm. Clapping the hands
was a sign of joyful acclamation, like the cry, "Long live the king"
(cf. [Kg1 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039).md).

[Kg2 11:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013.md)

Death of Athaliah. - [Kg2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#013.md), [Kg2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014.md). As soon as Athaliah heard the
loud rejoicing of the people, she came to the people into the temple,
and when she saw the youthful king in his standing-place surrounded by
the princes, the trumpeters, and the whole of the people, rejoicing and
blowing the trumpets, she rent her clothes with horror, and cried out,
Conspiracy, conspiracy! העם הרצין does not mean the people running
together, but the original reading in the text was probably והעם הרצין,
the people and the halberdiers, and the Vav dropped out through an
oversight of the copyist. By הרצין we are to understand the captains of
the halberdiers with the armed Levites, as in [Kg2
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#011.md); and העם is the people who had
assembled besides (cf. [Kg2 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019).md). In
the Chronicles המּלך והמהללים הרצים is in apposition to העם: the noise
of the people, the halberdiers, and those who praised the king. The
עמּוּד, upon which the king stood, was not a pillar, but an elevated
standing-place (suggestus) for the king at the eastern gate of the inner
court (בּמּבוא, [Ch2 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#013.md) compared
with [Eze 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#002).md), when he visited the
temple on festive occasions (cf. [Kg2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003).md), and it was most probably
identical with the brazen scaffold (כּיּור) mentioned in [Ch2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013.md), which would serve to explain
כּמּשׁפּט, "according to the right" (Angl. V. "as the manner was").
השּׂרים are not merely the captains mentioned in [Kg2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004.md), [Kg2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#009.md), and [Kg2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#010.md), but these together with the
rest of the assembled heads of the nation (האבות ראשׁי, [Ch2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002).md). החצצרות, the trumpets, the
trumpeters. The reference is to the Levitical musicians mentioned in
[Ch1 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#008.md); [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024.md), etc.; for they are
distinguished from וגו כּל־העם, "all the people of the land rejoicing
and blowing the trumpets," i.e., not all the military men of the land
who were present in Jerusalem (Thenius), but the mass of the people
present in the temple (Bertheau).

[Kg2 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#015.md)

Jehoiada then commanded the captains החיל פּקדי, those placed over the
army, i.e., the armed men of the Levites, to lead out Athaliah between
the ranks, and to slay every one who followed her, i.e., who took her
part (המת, inf. abs. instead of imperative); for, as is added
supplementarily in explanation of this command, the priest had
(previously) said: "Let her not be slain in the house of Jehovah." The
temple was not to be defiled with the blood of the usurper and
murderess.

[Kg2 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#016.md)

Thus they made way for her on both sides, or, according to the correct
explanation given by the Chaldee, ידים להּ ישׂימוּ, they formed lines
(Spalier, fences) and escorted her back, and she came by the way of the
horses' entrance into the palace, and was there put to death. הסּוּסים
מבוא is explained in the Chronicles by הסּוּסים שׁער מבוא, entrance of
the horse-gate. The entrance for the horses, i.e., the way which led to
the royal mews, is not to be identified with the horse-gate mentioned in
[Neh 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#028.md); for this was a gate in the
city wall, whereas the road from the temple to the royal mews, which
were no doubt near the palace, was inside the wall.

[Kg2 11:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md)

Renewal of the covenant, extermination of the worship of Baal, and
entrance of the king into the palace. - [Kg2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md). After Jehoash was crowned and
Athaliah put to death, Jehoiada concluded the covenant (1) between
Jehovah on the one hand and the king and people on the other, and (2)
between the king and the people. The former was simply a renewal of the
covenant which the Lord had made with Israel through Moses (Ex 24),
whereby the king and the people bound themselves ליהוה לעם להיות, i.e.,
to live as the people of the Lord, or to keep His law (cf. [Deu
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md); [Deu
27:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#009).md), and was based upon the
"testimony" handed to the king. This covenant naturally led to the
covenant between the king and the people, whereby the king bound himself
to rule his people according to the law of the Lord, and the people
vowed that they would be obedient and subject to the king as the ruler
appointed by the Lord (cf. [Sa2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003).md).
The renewal of the covenant with the Lord was necessary, because under
the former kings the people had fallen away from the Lord and served
Baal. The immediate consequence of the renewal of the covenant,
therefore, was the extermination of the worship of Baal, which is
mentioned at once in [Kg2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md),
although its proper place in order of time is after [Kg2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md). All the people (הארץ כּל־עם, as
in [Kg2 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014).md) went to the temple of
Baal, threw down his altars, broke his images (the columns of Baal and
Astarte) rightly, i.e., completely (היטב as in [Deu
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021).md), and slew the priest Mattan,
probably the chief priest of Baal, before his altars. That the temple of
Baal stood within the limits of the sanctuary, i.e., of the temple of
Jehovah (Thenius), cannot be shown to be probable either from [Ch2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007.md) or from the last clause of this
verse. (For [Ch2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007.md) see the fuller
remarks on [Kg2 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#005)..md) The words "and
the priest set overseers over the house of Jehovah" do not affirm that
Jehoiada created the office of overseer over the temple for the purpose
of guarding against a fresh desecration of the temple by idolatry
(Thenius), but simply that he appointed overseers over the temple,
namely, priests and Levites entrusted with the duty of watching over the
performance of worship according to the precepts of the law, as is more
minutely described in [Kg2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md), [Kg2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019.md).

And he took the captains, and they brought the king down out of the
house of Jehovah, etc. The word יקּח is not to be pressed, but simply
affirms that Jehoiada entrusted the persons named with the duty of
conducting the king into his palace. Beside the captains over a hundred
(see at [Kg2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004).md) there are mentioned
והרצים הכּרי, i.e., the royal halberdiers (the body-guard), who had
passed over to the new king immediately after the fall of Athaliah and
now followed their captains, and הארץ כּל־עם, all the rest of the people
assembled. Instead of the halberdiers there are mentioned in the
Chronicles בּעם המּושׁלים האדּירים, the nobles and lords in the nation-a
completion implied in the facts themselves, since Jehoiada had drawn the
heads of the nation into his plan, and on the other hand the express
allusion to the body-guard might be omitted as of inferior importance.
We cannot infer from ירידוּ that the bridge between Moriah and Zion was
not yet in existence, as Thenius supposes, but simply that the bridge
was lower than the temple-courts. Instead of הרצים שׁער, the gate of the
runners (i.e., of the halberdiers), we find in the Chronicles העליון
שׁער, the upper gate, which appears to have been a gate of the temple,
according to [Kg2 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035.md) and [Ch2
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003.md). The statement that they came by
the way of the runners' gate into the house of the king is not at
variance with this, for it may be understood as meaning that it was by
the halberdiers' gate of the temple that the entry into the palace was
carried out. - In [Kg2 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#020.md) this
account is concluded with the general remark that all the people
rejoiced, sc. at the coronation of Joash, and the city was quiet, when
they slew Athaliah with the sword. This is the way, so far as the sense
is concerned, in which the last two clauses are to be connected.
