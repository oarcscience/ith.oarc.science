### [Jeremiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 43:1</span></span>

The march of the people to Egypt. - When Jeremiah had thus ended all the
words which the Lord had announced to him for the people, then came
forward Azariah (probably an error for Jezaniah, see on [Jer
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001).md) the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the
son of Kareah, and the rest of the insolent men, and said to Jeremiah,
"Thou dost utter falsehood; Jahveh our God hath not sent thee unto us,
saying, Ye must not go to Egypt to sojourn there; [Jer
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#003.md). But Baruch the son of Neriah
inciteth thee against us, in order to give us into the hand of the
Chaldeans, to kill us, and to take us captive to Babylon." אמרים is not
the predicate to כּל־האנשׁים, but forms a resumption of ויּאמר, with
which it thus serves to connect its object, Jeremiah, and from which it
would otherwise be pretty far removed. Azariah (or, more correctly,
Jezaniah) occupies the last place in the enumeration of the captains,
[Jer 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008.md), and in [Jer
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md) is also named after Johanan, who
is the only one specially mentioned, in what follows, as the leader on
the march. From this we may safely conclude that Jezaniah was the chief
speaker and the leader of the opposition against the prophet. To avoid
any reference to the promise they had made to obey the will of God, they
declare that Jeremiah's prophecy is an untruth, which had been suggested
to him, not by God, but by his attendant Baruch, with the view of
delivering up the people to the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 43:4</span></span>

Thereupon Johanan and the other captains took "all the remnant of Judah,
that had returned from all the nations whither they had been driven, to
dwell in the land of Judah-the men and women and children, the king's
daughters, and all the souls whom Nebuzaradan, chief of the body-guard,
had committed to Gedaliah...and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son
of Neriah, - and went to the land of Egypt - for they did not hearken to
the voice of Jahveh - and came to Tahpanhes." In this enumeration of
those who were conducted to Egypt, Hitzig, Graf, and others distinguish
two classes: (1) the men, women, children, etc., who had been in Mizpah
with Gedaliah, and had been led to Gibeon, after the murder of the
latter, by Ishmael, but had afterwards been brought to Bethlehem by
Johanan and the other captains ([Jer
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#006.md), cf. [Jer
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007.md); [Jer
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010.md), [Jer
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016)); (2.md) those who had returned
from the foreign countries whither they had fled, but who had hitherto
lived in the country, scattered here and there, and who must have joined
the company led by Johanan to Bethlehem during the ten days of halt at
that resting-place ([Jer 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#005.md), cf.
[Jer 40:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011).md). There is no
foundation, however, for this distinction. Neither in the present
chapter is there anything mentioned of those who had been dispersed
through the land joining those who had marched to Bethlehem; nor are the
Jews who had returned from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries to
their own home distinguished, in Jer 40 and 41, as a different class
from those who had been with Gedaliah in Mizpah; but on the other hand,
according to [Jer 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#012.md), these
returned Jews also came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered grapes and
fruit. Besides, in these verses the distinction can only be made after
the insertion into the text of the conjunction ו before את־הגּברים. To
"all the remnant of Judah who had returned from the nations" belong the
men, women, children, etc., whom Nebuzaradan had committed to the care
of Gedaliah. The enumeration in [Jer
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#006.md) gives only one specification of
the "whole remnant of Judah," as in [Jer
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016.md). "And all the souls;" as if it
were said, "and whoever else was still left alive;" cf. [Jos
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md). Tahpanhes was a frontier town
of Egypt on the Pelusian branch of the Nile, and named Δάφναι by the
Greeks; see on [Jer 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016.md). Here, on the
borders of Egypt, a halt was made, for the purpose of coming to further
resolutions regarding their residence in that country. Here, too,
Jeremiah received a revelation from God regarding the fate now impending
on Egypt.

[Jeremiah 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 43:8</span></span>

Prediction regarding Egypt. - [Jer
43:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008.md). "And the word of the Lord came
to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, [Jer
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#009.md). Take in thine hand large stones,
and hide them in the clay in the brick-kiln, which is at the entrance to
the house of Pharaoh in Taphanhes, in the eyes of the Jews; [Jer
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010.md). And say to them: Thus saith
Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will send and take
Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and will place his
throne over these stones which I have hidden, and he shall stretch his
tapestry over them. [Jer 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011.md). And he
shall come and smite the land of Egypt, (he who is) for death, to death,
- (he who is) for captivity, to captivity, - (he who is) for the sword,
to the sword. [Jer 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012.md). And I will
kindle fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them
and carry them away; and he shall wrap the land of Egypt round him as
the shepherd wraps his cloak round him, and thence depart in peace. [Jer
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013.md). And he shall destroy the
pillars of Beth-shemesh, which is in the land of Egypt, and the houses
of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire."

This prophecy is introduced by a symbolical action, on which it is
based. But in spite of the fact that the object of the action is stated
in the address which follows, the action itself is not quite plain from
the occurrence of בּמּלבּן, whose usual meaning, "brick-kiln" (cf. [Nah
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#014).md), does not seem suitable here.
Eichhorn and Hitzig think it absurd that there should be found before
the door of a royal habitation a brick-kiln on which a king was to place
his throne. From the Arabic malbin, which also signifies a rectangular
figure like tile or brick, and is used of the projecting entablature of
doors, - from the employment, also, in the Talmud of the word מלבּן to
signify a quadrangular tablet in the form of a tile, - Hitzig would
claim for the word the meaning of a stone floor, and accordingly
renders, "and insert them with mortar into the stone flooring." But the
entablatures over doors, or quadrangular figures like bricks, are
nothing like a stone flooring or pavement before a palace. Besides, in
the way of attaching to the word the signification of a "brick-kiln," -
a meaning which is well established, - or even of a brickwork, the
difficulties are not so great as to compel us to accept interpretations
that have no foundation. We do not need to think of a brick-kiln or
brickwork as being always before the palace; as Neumann has observed, it
may have indeed ben there, although only for a short time, during the
erecting of some part of the palace; nor need it have been just at the
palace gateway, but a considerable distance away from it, and on the
opposite side. Alongside of it there was lying mortar, an indispensable
building material. טמן, "to hide," perhaps means here not merely to
embed, but to embed in such a way that the stones could not very readily
be perceived. Jeremiah was to press down the big stones, not into the
brick-kiln, but into the mortar which was lying at (near) the
brick-kiln, - to put them, too, before the eyes of the Jews, inasmuch as
the meaning of this act had a primary reference to the fate of the Jews
in Egypt. The object of the action is thus stated in what follows:
Jahveh shall bring the king of Babylon and set his throne on these
stones, so that he shall spread out his beautiful tapestry over them.
שׁפרוּר (Qeri שׁפריר), an intensive form of שׁפר, שׁפרה, "splendour,
beauty," signifies a glittering ornament, - here, the decoration of the
throne, the gorgeous tapestry with which the seat of the throne was
covered. The stones must thus form the basis for the throne, which the
king of Babylon will set up in front of the palace of the king of Egypt
at Tahpanhes. But the symbolical meaning of this action is not thereby
exhausted. Not merely is the laying of the stones significant, but also
the place where they are laid, - at the entrance, or opposite Pharaoh's
palace. This palace was built of tiles or bricks: this is indicated by
the brick-kiln and the mortar. The throne of the king of Babylon, on the
contrary, is set up on large stones. The materials of which the palace
and the throne are formed, shadow forth the strength and stability of
the kingdom. Pharaoh's dominion is like crumbling clay, the material of
bricks; the throne which Nebuchadnezzar shall set up opposite the
clay-building of the Pharaohs rests on large stones, - his rule will be
powerful and permanent. According to Jeremiah's further development of
the symbol in [Jer 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011.md).,
Nebuchadnezzar will come to Egypt (the Kethib באה is to be read בּאה,
"he came down," to Egypt, בּוא being construed with the accus.), and
will smite the land together with its inhabitants, so that every man
will receive his appointed lot, viz., death by pestilence, imprisonment,
and the sword, i.e., death in battle. On the mode of representation
here, cf. [Jer 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002.md).

[Jeremiah 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 43:12</span></span>

He shall burn the temples of the gods of Egypt, and carry away the
idols. The first person הצּתּי, for which lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate have
the third, must not be meddled with; it corresponds to שׂמתּי in [Jer
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010.md). What Nebuchadnezzar does as
Jahveh's servant (עבדּי, [Jer 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010).md)
is done by God. The suffixes in שׂרפם and שׁבּם are assigned in such a
way that the one is to be referred to the temples, the other to the
idols; see on [Jer 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md). - ועטה has
been variously interpreted. עטה with the accus. מעיל or שׂלמה means the
envelope one's self with a garment, put on a garment, wrap the cloak
round; cf. [Sa1 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#014.md); [Psa
109:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#019.md); [Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md), etc. This is the meaning of the
verb here, as is shown by the clause expressing the comparison. The
point of likeness is the easiness of the action. Ewald has very well
explained the meaning of the whole: "As easily as any shepherd in the
open field wraps himself in his cloak, so will he take the whole of
Egypt in his hand, and be able to throw it round him like a light
garment, that he may then, thus dressed as it were with booty, leave the
land in peace, without a foe, - a complete victor." Other explanations
of the word are far-fetched, and lexically untenable.

[Jeremiah 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 43:13</span></span>

In conclusion, mention is further made of the destruction of the famous
temple of the Sun at Heliopolis, to show the fulfilment of the prophecy
that all Egypt would fall under the power of Nebuchadnezzar. בּית שׁמשׁ,
"House of the Sun," is the Hebrew rendering of the Egyptian Pe-râ, i.e.,
House of the Sun, the sacred name of the city vulgarly called On; see on
[Gen 41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045.md). It lay north-east from
Cairo, near the modern village of Matarieh, and thus pretty far inland;
it was renowned for its magnificent temple, dedicated to Râ, the
Sun-god. At the entrance to this building stood several larger and
smaller obelisks, of which the two larger, added to the two older ones
by Pheron the son of Sesostris, were about 150 feet high. One of these
the Emperor Augustus caused to be brought to Rome; the other was thrown
down in the year 1160; while one of the more ancient but smaller
obelisks still stands in its original position, raising its head in the
midst of a beautiful garden over a mass of dense foliage. These obelisks
are signified by מצּבות. The additional clause, "which is in the land of
Egypt," does not belong to Beth-shemesh, as if it were appended for the
purpose of distinguishing the city so named from Beth-shemesh in the
land of Judah; the words are rather connected with מצּבות, and
correspond with אלהי מצרים in the parallel member of the verse. The
obelisks of the most famous temple of the Egyptian Sun-god are well
known as the most splendid representatives of the glory of the Egyptian
idolatry: the destruction of these monuments indicates the ruin of all
the sanctuaries of the ancient kingdom of the Pharaohs. The last clause
is a kind of re-echo from [Jer 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012.md);
ישׂרף is strengthened by the addition of בּאשׁ for the purpose of giving
a sonorous ending to the whole. - The king of Egypt is not named in the
prophecy, but according to [Jer 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md)
it is Pharaoh-Hophra, who is to be given into the power of
Nebuchadnezzar.

When we inquire as to the fulfilment of this prediction, we find M.
Duncker, in his Gesch. des Alterthums, i. 841, giving a reply in these
words: "Nebuchadnezzar did not fulfil these expectations (of Jeremiah,
[Jer 43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008.md); [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md), and of Ezekiel, [Jer
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032).md). He contented himself with
having repelled the renewed attack of Egypt. The establishment of his
dominion in Syria did not depend on his conquering Egypt; but Syria must
obey him, throughout its whole extent. The capture of Jerusalem followed
the siege of the island-town of Tyre (b.c. 586), the last city that had
maintained its independence. The army of the Chaldean slay thirteen
years before Tyre without being able to bring the king Ethbaal (Ithobal)
under subjection. At last, in the year 573, a treaty was concluded, in
which the Tyrians recognised the supremacy of the king of Babylon." That
Tyre was brought into subjection is inferred by Duncker (in a note, p.
682), first, from the generally accepted statement of Berosus, that the
whole of Phoenicia was subdued by Nebuchadnezzar (Josephus' Ant. x. 11.
1, and contra Ap. i. 19); secondly, from Josephus' statement (contra Ap.
i. 21), that the kings Merbal and Hiram had been brought by the Tyrians
from Babylon; and lastly, from the fact that, with the close of the
siege, the reign of Ithobal ends and that of Baal begins. "It would thus
appear that Ithobal was removed, and his family carried to Babylon."
These facts, which are also acknowledged by Duncker, sufficiently show
(what we have already pointed out in Ezekiel) that the siege of Tyre
ended with the taking of this island-city. For, unless the besieged city
had been taken by storm, or at least compelled to surrender, the king
would not have let himself be dethroned and carried to Babylon. - But
whence has Duncker derived the information that Nebuchadnezzar had no
concern with the subjugation of Egypt, but merely with the establishment
of his authority in Syria? Although Nebuchadnezzar began the siege of
the island-city of Tyre soon after the destruction of Jerusalem, and
required thirteen years to reduce it, yet it does not by any means
follow from this that he had only to do with the strengthening of his
authority in Syria, and no connection with the subjugation of Egypt; all
that we can safely infer is, that he thought he could not attempt the
conquest of Egypt with any certain prospect of success until he had
subdued the whole of Syria. Besides, so long as such an one as
Pharaoh-Hophra occupied the throne of Egypt, - who had not only sent an
army to Zedekiah king of Judah to raise the siege of Jerusalem, but also
(according to Herodotus, ii. 161, who draws from Egyptian sources) led
an army to Sidon and fought a naval battle with the Tyrians; who (as
Diod. Sic. i. 68 relates, also following Egyptian tradition) set out for
Cyprus with abundant war-material and a strong army and fleet, and took
Sidon by storm, while the rest of the towns submitted through fear; who,
moreover, had defeated the Phoenicians and Cyprians in a naval
engagement, and had returned to Egypt with immense spoil; - how could
Nebuchadnezzar possibly think that his rule in Syria was firmly
established? Such statements as those now referred to even Duncker does
not venture to reject. We must, however, view them with a regard to the
usual exaggerations by which the Egyptians were accustomed to extol the
deeds of their Pharaohs; but after making all due allowance, we are led
to this, that, after the fall of Tyre, Hophra sought to prevent the
island of Cyprus as well as Tyre from becoming a dependency of
Nebuchadnezzar. Could Nebuchadnezzar leave unmolested such an enemy as
this, who, on the first suitable opportunity, would attempt to wrest the
whole of Syria from him? So short-sighted a policy we could not
attribute to such a conqueror as Nebuchadnezzar. Much more considerate
is the judgment previously expressed regarding this by Vitringa, on Isa
19: "Etiamsi omnis historia hic sileret, non est probabile,
Nebucadnezarem magnum dominatorem gentium, post Palaestinam et
Phoeniciam subactam, non tentasse Aegyptum, et si tentaverit, tentasse
frustra; et qu parte Aegyptum occupavit, eam non vastasse et desolasse."

It is also to be borne in mind that the conquest of Egypt by
Nebuchadnezzar, which is denied by Hitzig and Graf as well as Duncker,
as it formerly was by Volney, is vouched for by the trustworthy
testimony of Berosus (in Josephus, contra Ap. i. 19), who says that
Nebuchadnezzar took Egypt (κρατῆσαι Αἰγύπτου, ̓Αραβίας, κ.τ.λ.); the
denial, too, rests on a mere inference from the account given by
Herodotus from the traditions of the priests regarding the reign of
Apris (Hophra). If the witness of Berosus regarding the conquest of
Syria and Phoenicia be trustworthy, why should his testimony concerning
Egypt be unreliable? The account of Josephus (Ant. x. 9. 7), that
Nebuchadnezzar, in the fifth year after the capture of Jerusalem, and
the twenty-third year of his reign, invaded Egypt, killed the king
(Hophra), put another in his place, and led captive to Babylon the Jews
that had fled to Egypt, - this account will not admit of being brought
forward (as has often been attempted, and anew, of late, by Mrc. von
Niebuhr, Assur und Babel, S. 215) as sufficient testimony for a
successful campaign carried on by Nebuchadnezzar against Egypt during
the siege of Tyre. The difficulty in the way of proving that such a
campaign actually took place is not so much that the death of Hophra in
battle with Nebuchadnezzar, or his execution afterwards, contradicts all
authenticated history, as that the particular statements of Josephus
regarding this campaign, both as to the date and the carrying away to
Babylon of the Jews that had fled to Egypt, are simply conclusions drawn
from a combination of [Jer 43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008.md) and
[Jer 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md) with [Jer
52:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#020.md); besides, the execution of King
Hophra by Nebuchadnezzar is foretold neither by Jeremiah nor by Ezekiel.
Ezekiel, in Jer 29-32, merely predicts the decline of the Egyptian
influence, the breaking of the arm of Pharaoh, i.e., of his military
power, and his fall into Sheol; but he does it in so ideal a manner,
that even the words of [Jer 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#013.md),
"there shall be no more a prince out of the land of Egypt," - i.e.,
Egypt shall lose all her princes, just as her idols have been destroyed,
- even these words cannot well be applied to the execution of
Pharaoh-Hophra. But Jeremiah, in [Jer
43:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001.md) and in [Jer
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md)., predicts merely the downfall
of the pride and power of Pharaoh, and the conquest, devastation, and
spoiling of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar. And even in the words of [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030), "I (Jahveh.md) will deliver
Pharaoh-Hophra into the hand of his enemies, and of those who seek his
life, just as I delivered Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar his enemy, and of those who sought after his life," there
is nothing definitely stated regarding Hophra's being executed by
Nebuchadnezzar, or killed in battle with him. Such a reference cannot be
made out from the words, even though we lay no emphasis on the plural
"his enemies," in contrast with the expression "Nebuchadnezzar his
enemy," and, according to [Jer 46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026.md),
understand Nebuchadnezzar and his servants as being included under the
"enemies;" for certainly Zedekiah was not killed by Nebuchadnezzar, but
merely taken prisoner and carried to Babylon. Besides, there was no need
of special proof that the prophecies of Jeremiah regarding Egypt declare
much more important matters than merely an expedition of Chaldean
soldiers to Egypt, as well as the plunder of some cities and the
carrying away of the Jews who resided there; and that, in Jer 44, what
the Jews who went to Egypt against the will of God are threatened with,
is not transportation to Babylon, but destruction in Egypt by sword,
hunger, and pestilence, until only a few individuals shall escape, and
these shall return to Judah ([Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014.md), [Jer
44:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027).md).

But if we compare with the prophecy of Jeremiah in [Jer
43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008.md), and in [Jer
46:13-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md), that of Ezekiel in [Jer
29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#017.md), which was uttered or
composed in the twenty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin,
i.e., in the year 573, it becomes abundantly evident that Nebuchadnezzar
cannot have invaded and conquered Egypt before that year, and not till
after the fall of Tyre, which immediately ensued. And that this was
actually the case, is put beyond doubt by the statement of Herodotus,
ii. 161ff., regarding Apris, that he lost his throne and his life in
consequence of being defeated in battle with the Cyrenians. What
Herodotus assigns as the cause of the fall of Apris, is insufficient to
account for the unhappy end of this king. Herodotus himself states, ii.
169, that the Egyptians were filled with the most intense hatred against
Apris; the monuments also bear witness to this fact. This bitter feeling
must have had a deeper source than merely the unsuccessful issue of a
war with Cyrene; it receives its explanation only when we find that
Apris, by his attempts against Nebuchadnezzar, had deserved and brought
on the subjugation of Egypt by the king of Babylon; cf. Hvernick on
Ezekiel, p. 500. By sending an auxiliary army to Judah, for the purpose
of driving back the Chaldeans, and by forming an expedition to Cyprus
and the cities of Phoenicia, which was evidently directed against the
establishment of the Chaldean power in Phoenicia, Apris had so provoked
the king of Babylon, that the latter, immediately after the subjugation
of Tyre, entered on the campaign against Egypt, which he invaded,
subdued, and spoiled, without, however, killing the king; him he
preferred allowing to rule on, but as his vassal, and under the promise
that he would recognise his authority and pay tribute, just as had been
done with King Jehoiakim when Jerusalem was first taken. If all this
actually took place (which we may well assume), Apris might probably
have begun another war against Cyrene, after the Chaldeans had departed,
in the hope of procuring some small compensation to the Egyptians for
the defeat they had suffered from the Chaldeans, by subduing that
province in the west; in this war the king might have lost his life, as
Herodotus relates, through want of success in his attempt. In this say,
the account of Herodotus regarding the death of Apris quite agrees with
the conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar. But that Herodotus makes no
mention of the conquest of Egypt, is sufficiently accounted for when we
remember that he derived his information from the stories of the
priests, who carefully omitted all mention of a struggle between Egypt
and the power of Chaldea, since this had ended in the humiliation of
Egypt; hence also mention was made only of the victories and mighty
deeds of Necho II, while his defeat at Carchemish was passed over in
silence.
