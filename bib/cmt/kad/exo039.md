### [Exodus Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 39:1</span></span>

Preparation of the priests' clothes. - Previous to the description of
the dress itself, we have a statement in [Exo
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001.md) of the materials employed, and
the purpose to which they were devoted ("cloths of service," see at [Exo
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#010).md). The robes consisted of the
ephod ([Exo 39:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#002.md), as in [Exo
28:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006).md), the choshen or breastplate
([Exo 39:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#008.md), as in [Exo
28:15-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#015).md), the mel or over-coat ([Exo
39:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#022.md), as in [Exo
28:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#031).md); the body-coats, turbans,
drawers, and girdles, for Aaron and his sons ([Exo
39:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#027.md), as in [Exo
28:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039.md), and [Exo
28:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#042).md). The Urim and Thummim are not
mentioned (cf. [Exo 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030).md). The
head-dresses of the ordinary priests, which are simply called "bonnets"
in [Exo 28:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#040.md), are called "goodly
bonnets" or "ornamental caps" in [Exo
39:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#028.md) of this chapter (מגבּעת פּארי,
from פּאר an ornament, cf. פּאר ornatus fuit). The singular, "girdle,"
in [Exo 39:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#029.md), with the definite
article, "the girdle," might appear to refer simply to Aaron's girdle,
i.e., the girdle of the high priest; but as there is no special
description of the girdles of Aaron's sons (the ordinary priests) in
[Exo 29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040.md), where they are distinctly
mentioned and called by the same name (abnet) as the girdle of Aaron
himself, we can only conclude that they were of the same materials and
the same form and make as the latter, and that the singular, האבנט, is
used here either in the most general manner, or as a generic noun in a
collective sense (see Ges. 109, 1). The last thing mentioned is the
diadem upon Aaron's turban ([Exo
39:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#030.md), [Exo
39:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#031.md), as in [Exo
28:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036).md), so that the order in which
the priests' robes are given here is analogous to the position in which
the ark of the covenant and the golden altar stand to one another in the
directions concerning the sacred things in ch. 25-30. "For just as all
the other things are there placed between the holy ark and the golden
altar as the two poles, so here all the rest of the priests' robes are
included between the shoulder-dress, the principal part of the official
robes of the high priest, and the golden frontlet, the inscription upon
which rendered it the most striking sign of the dignity of his office"
(Baumgarten).

[Exodus 39:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 39:32</span></span>

Delivery of the work to Moses. - The different things are again
mentioned one by one. By "the tent," in [Exo
39:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#033.md), we are to understand the two
tent-cloths, the one of purple and the other of goats' hair, by which
the dwelling (משׁכּן, generally rendered tabernacle) was made into a
tent (אלה). From this it is perfectly obvious, that the variegated cloth
formed the inner walls of the dwelling, or covered the boards on the
inner side, and that the goats' hair-cloth formed the other covering.
Moreover it is also obvious, that this is the way in which האהל is to be
understood, from the fact, that in the list of the things belonging to
the ohel the first to be mentioned are the gold and copper hooks ([Exo
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md), [Exo
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#011).md) with which the two halves of
the drapery that formed the tent were joined together, and then after
that the boards, bolts, pillars, and sockets, as though subordinate to
the tent-cloths, and only intended to answer the purpose of spreading
them out into a tent of dwelling.

[Exodus 39:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 39:37</span></span>

"The lamps of the order," i.e., the lamps set in order upon the
candlestick. In addition to all the vessels of the sanctuary, shew-bread
([Exo 39:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#036).md), holy oil for the
candlestick and for anointing, and fragrant incense ([Exo
39:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#038).md), were also prepared and
delivered to Moses, - everything, therefore, that was required for the
institution of the daily worship, as soon as the tabernacle was set up.

[Exodus 39:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">exo 39:40</span></span>

"Vessels of service:" see [Exo 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019.md).

[Exodus 39:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">exo 39:43</span></span>

When Moses had received and examined all the different articles, and
found that everything was made according to the directions of Jehovah,
he blessed the children of Israel. The readiness and liberality with
which the people had presented the gifts required for this work, and the
zeal which they had shown in executing the whole of the work in rather
less than half a year (see at [Exo
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017).md), were most cheering signs of
the willingness of the Israelites to serve the Lord, for which they
could not fail to receive the blessing of God.
