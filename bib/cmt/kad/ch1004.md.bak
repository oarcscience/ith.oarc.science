### [1 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 4:1</span></span>

[Ch1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md) is evidently intended to be a
superscription to the genealogical fragments which follow. Five names
are mentioned as sons of Judah, of whom only Pharez was his son ([Ch1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#004).md); the others are grandchildren or
still more distant descendants. Nothing is said as to the genealogical
relationship in which they stood to each other; that is supposed to be
already known from the genealogies in 1 Chron 2. Hezron is the son of
Pharez, and consequently grandson of Judah, [Ch1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#008.md). Carmi, a descendant of Zerah, the
brother of Pharez, see on [Ch1 2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md).
Hur is a son of Caleb, the son of Hezron, by Ephratah (see on [Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019.md) and [Ch1
2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050).md); and Shobal is the son of Hur,
who has just been mentioned ([Ch1
2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050).md). These five names do not denote
here, any more than in 1 Chron 2, "families of the tribe of Judah"
(Berth.), but signify persons who originated or were heads of families.
The only conceivable ground for these five being called "sons of Judah,"
is that the families registered in the following lists traced their
origin to them, although in the enumeration which follows the
genealogical connection of the various groups is not clearly brought
out. The enumeration begins,

[1 Chronicles 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 4:2</span></span>

[Ch1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#002.md), with the descendants of
Shobal. As to Reaiah the son of Shobal, see [Ch1
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052.md). He begat Jahath, a name often
occurring in Levite families, cf. [Ch1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#005.md), [Ch1
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028.md); [Ch1
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#010.md)., [Ch1
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#022.md), [Ch2
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012.md); but of the descendant of David
who bore this name nothing further is known. His sons Ahumai and Lahad
founded the families of the Zorathites, i.e., the inhabitants of Zora,
who also, according to [Ch1 2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053.md), were
descended from sons of Shobal. Our verse therefore gives more detailed
information regarding the lineage of these families.

[1 Chronicles 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 4:3</span></span>

[Ch1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#003.md) and [Ch1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004.md) contain notices of the descendants
of Hur. The first words of the third verse, "these, father of Etam,
Jezreel," have no meaning; but the last sentence of the second verse
suggests that משׁפּחות should be supplied, when we read, "and these are
the families of (from) Abi-Etam." The lxx and Vulgate have עיטם בני אלה,
which is also to be found in several codices, while other codices read
בני אלה אבי עיטם. Both readings are probably only conjectures. Whether
עיטם אבי is to be taken as the name of a person, or appellatively,
father = lord of Etam, cannot be decided. עיטם is in [Ch1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md), and probably also in [Jdg
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#008.md), [Jdg
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#011.md), the name of a town of the
Simeonites; and in [Ch2 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006.md), the name
of a little town in the highlands of Judah, south of Jerusalem. If עיטם
be the name of a place, only the lest named can be here meant. The names
Jezreel, Ishma, and Idbash denote persons as progenitors and head of
families or branches of families. For יזרעאל as the name of a person,
cf. [Hos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md). That these names should
be those of persons is required by the succeeding remark, "and their
sister Hazelel-poni." The formation of this name, with the derivative
termination i, seems to express a relationship of race; but the word may
also be an adjective, and as such may be a proper name: cf. Ew. 273, e.

[Ch1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004.md)

Penuel, in [Gen 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031.md)., [Jdg
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#008.md), name of a place in the
East-Jordan land, as here, and in [Jdg
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#025.md) the name of a man. Gedor is, we
may suppose, the town of that name in the mountains of Judah, which is
still to be found in the ruin Jedur (see on [Jos
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058).md). Penuel is here called father
of Bedor, while in [Ch1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018.md) one Jered
is so called, whence we must conclude that the inhabitants of Gedor were
descended from both. Ezer (Help) occurs in [Ch1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021.md); [Ch1
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#009.md); [Neh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#019.md), of other men; father of Hushah,
i.e., according to the analogy of Abi-Gedor, also the name of a place
not elsewhere mentioned, where the hero Sibbecai had his birth, [Ch1
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#029.md); [Sa2
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#027.md). Those thus named in [Ch1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#003.md) and [Ch1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004.md) are sons of Hur, the first-born of
Ephratah ([Ch1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019).md), the father of
Bethlehem. The inhabitants of Bethlehem then, according to this, were
descended from Hur through his son Salma, who is called in [Ch1
2:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#051.md) father of Bethlehem. The
circumstance, too, that in our [Ch1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#003.md), [Ch1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004.md) other names of persons are
enumerated as descendants of Hur than those given in [Ch1
2:50-55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050.md) gives rise to no discrepancy,
for there is no ground for the supposition that in [Ch1
2:50-55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050.md) all the descendants of Hur
have been mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 4:5</span></span>

Sons of Ashur, the father of Tekoa, who, according to [Ch1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024.md), was a posthumous son of Hezron.
Ashur had two wives, Helah and Naarah. Of the latter came four sons and
as many families: Ahuzam, of whom nothing further is known; Hepher, also
unknown, but to be distinguished from the Gileadite of the same name in
[Ch1 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#036.md) and [Num
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#032.md). The conjecture that the name is
connected wit the land of Hepher ([Kg1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#010).md), the territory of a king
conquered by Joshua ([Jos 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#017).md)
(Berth.), is not very well supported. Temani (man of the south) may be
simply the name of a person, but it is probably, like the following, the
name of a family. Haahashtari, descended from Ahashtar, is quite
unknown.

[1 Chronicles 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 4:7</span></span>

The first wife, Helah, bore three sons, Zereth, Jezoar, and Ethnan, who
are not elsewhere met with. For the Kethibh יצחר there is in the Keri
וצחר, the name of a son of Simeon ([Gen
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#010).md), and of a Hittite chief in the
time of the patriarchs ([Gen 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#008).md),
with whom the son of Helah has nothing to do.

[1 Chronicles 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 4:8</span></span>

[Ch1 4:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#008.md) contain a fragment, the
connection of which with the sons of Judah mentioned in 1 Chron 2 is not
clear. Coz begat Anub, etc. The name קוץ occurs only here; elsewhere
only הקּוץ is found, of a Levite, [Ch1
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#010.md), cf. [Ezr
2:61](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#061.md) and [Neh
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#004.md) - in the latter passage without
any statement as to the tribe to which the sons of Hakkoz belonged. The
names of the sons begotten by Coz, [Ch1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#008.md), do not occur elsewhere. The same
is to be said of Jabez, of whom we know nothing beyond what is
communicated in [Ch1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009.md) and [Ch1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#010.md). The word יעבּץ denotes in [Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055.md) a town or village which is quite
unknown to us; but whether our Jabez were father (lord) of this town
cannot be determined. If there be any genealogical connection between
the man Jabez and the locality of this name or its inhabitants ([Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055).md), then the persons named in [Ch1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#008.md) would belong to the descendants of
Shobal. For although the connection of Jabez with Coz and his sons is
not clearly set forth, yet it may be conjectured from the statements as
to Jabez being connected with the preceding by the words, "Jabez was
more honoured than his brethren." The older commentators have thence
drawn the conclusion that Jabez was a son or brother of Coz. Bertheau
also rightly remarks: "The statements that he was more honoured than his
brethren (cf. [Gen 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#019).md), that his
mother called him Jabez because she had borne him with sorrow; the use
of the similarly sounding word עצב along with the name יעבּץ (cf. [Gen
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025.md); [Gen
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037.md)., [Gen
29:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032.md), [Gen
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035.md); [Gen
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#006.md), [Gen
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#008), etc..md); and the statement that
Jabez vowed to the God of Israel (cf. [Gen
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#020).md) in a prayer (cf. [Gen
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020).md), - all bring to our
recollection similar statements of Genesis, and doubtless rest upon
primeval tradition." In the terms of the vow, עצבּי לבלתּי, "so that
sorrow may not be to me," there is a play upon the name Jabez. But of
the vow itself only the conditions proposed by the maker of the vow are
communicated: "If Thou wilt bless me, and enlarge my coast, and Thy hand
shall be with me, and Thou wilt keep evil far off, not to bring sorrow
to me," - without the conclusion, Then I vow to do this or that (cf.
[Gen 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020)..md), but with the remark that
God granted him that which he requested. The reason of this is probably
that the vow had acquired importance sufficient to make it worthy of
being handed down only from God's having so fulfilled his wish, that his
life became a contradiction of his name; the son of sorrow having been
free from pain in life, and having attained to greater happiness and
reputation than his brothers.

[1 Chronicles 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 4:11</span></span>

The genealogy of the men of Rechah. - As to their connection with the
larger families of Judah, nothing has been handed down to us. Chelub,
another form of the name Caleb or Chelubai (see [Ch1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009.md) and [Ch1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018).md), is distinguished from the
better known Caleb son of Hezron ([Ch1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018.md) and [Ch1
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042).md), and from the son of Jephunneh
([Ch1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#015).md), by the additional clause,
"the son of Shuah." Shuah is not met with elsewhere, but is without
reason identified with Hushah, [Ch1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004.md), by the older commentators. Mehir
the father of Eshton is likewise unknown. Eshton begat the house (the
family) of Rapha, of whom also nothing further is said; for they can be
connected neither with the Benjamite Rapha ([Ch1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#002).md) nor with the children of Rapha
([Ch1 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#004.md), [Ch1
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#006.md), [Ch1
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#008).md). Paseah and Tehinnah are also
unknown, for it is uncertain whether the sons of Paseah mentioned among
the Nethinim, [Ezr 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#049.md); [Neh
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#051.md), have any connection with our
Paseah. Tehinnah is called "father of the city of Nahash." The latter
name is probably not properly the name of a town, but rather the name of
a person Nahash, not unlikely the same as the father of Abigail ([Sa2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025).md), the step-sister of David (cf.
[Ch1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#016)). The men (or people.md) of
Rechah are unknown.

[1 Chronicles 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 4:13</span></span>

Descendants of Kenaz. - קנז is a descendant of Hezron the son of Pharez,
as may be inferred from the fact that Caleb the son of Jephunneh, a
descendant of Hezron's son Caleb, is called in [Num
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#012.md) and [Jos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md) קנזּי, and consequently was also
a descendant of Kenaz. Othniel and Seraiah, introduced here as קנז בּני,
are not sons (in the narrower sense of the word), but more distant
descendants of Kenaz; for Othniel and Caleb the son of Jephunneh were,
according to [Jos 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#017.md) and [Jdg
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#013.md), brothers.

(Note: The words used in [Jdg 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#013.md),
cf. [Jos 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#017.md), of the relationship of
Othniel and Caleb, הקּטון כלב אחי בּן־קנז, may be, it is true, taken in
different senses, either as signifying filius Kenasi fratris Caleb,
according to which, not Othniel, but Kenaz, was a younger brother of
Caleb; or in this way, filius Kenasi, frater Calebi minor, as we have
interpreted them in the text, and also in the commentary on [Jos
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#017.md). This interpretation we still
hold to be certainly the correct one, notwithstanding what Bachmann
(Buch der Richter, on [Ch1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#013).md) has
brought forward against it and in favour of the other interpretation,
and cannot see that his chief reasons are decisive. The assertion that
we must predicate of Othniel, if he be a younger brother of Caleb, an
unsuitably advanced age, is not convincing. Caleb was eighty-five years
of age at the division of the land of Canaan ([Jos
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#010).md). Now if we suppose that his
younger or youngest brother Othniel was from twenty-five to thirty years
younger, as often happens, Othniel would be from sixty to sixty-one or
fifty-five to fifty-six years of age at the conquest of Debir, - an age
at which he might well win a wife as the reward of valour. Ten years
later came the invasion of the land by Cushan Rishathaim, which lasted
eight years, till Othniel had conquered Cushan R., and there were judges
in Israel. This victory he would thus gain at the age of seventy-eight
or seventy-three; and even if he filled the office of judge for forty
years-which, however, [Jdg 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011.md) does
not state - he would have reached no greater age than 118 or 113 years,
only three or eight years older than Joshua had been. If we consider
what Caleb said of himself in his eighty-fifth year, [Jos
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#011.md), "I am still strong as in the
day that Moses sent me (i.e., forty years before); as my strength was
then, even so is my strength now for war, both to go out and to come
in," we cannot think that Othniel, in the seventy-third or
seventy-eighth years of his age, was too old to be a military leader.
But the other reason: "that Caleb is always called son of Jephunneh,
Othniel always son of Kenaz, should cause us to hesitate before we take
Othniel to be the proper brother of Caleb," loses all its weight when we
find that Caleb also is called in [Num
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#012.md) and [Jos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md) קנזי = בּן־קנז, and it is seen
that Caleb therefore, as well as Othniel, was a son of Kenaz. Now if the
Kenazite Caleb the son of Jephunneh were a brother of Kenaz, the father
of Othniel, we must suppose an older Kenaz, the grandfather or
great-grandfather of Caleb, and a younger Kenaz, the father of Othniel.
This supposition is certainly feasible, for, according to [Ch1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#015.md) of our chapter, a grandson of
Caleb again was called Kenaz; but if it be probable is another question.
For the answering of this question in the affirmative, Bachmann adduces
that, according to [Ch1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md), Othniel
is undoubtedly the son of Kenaz in the proper sense of the word; but it
might perhaps be difficult to prove, or even to render probable, this
"undoubtedly." In the superscriptions of the single genealogies of the
Chronicle, more than elsewhere, בּני has in general a very wide
signification. In [Ch1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md) of our
chapter, for instance, sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons of Judah are
all grouped together as יהוּדה בּני. But besides this, the ranging of
the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh ([Ch1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#015).md) after the enumeration of the
sons of Kenaz in [Ch1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md) and [Ch1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014.md), is clearly much more easily
explicable if Caleb himself belonged to the קנז בּני mentioned in [Ch1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md), than if he was a brother of
Kenaz. In the latter case we should expect, after the analogy of [Ch1
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042.md), to find an additional clause קנז
אחי after בּן־יפנּה כּלב; while if Caleb was a brother of Othniel, his
descent from Kenaz, or the fact that he belonged to the קנז בּני, might
be assumed to be known from [Num
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#012)..md)

Kenaz, therefore, can neither have been the father of Othniel nor father
of Caleb (in the proper sense of the word), but must at least have been
the grandfather or great-grandfather of both. Othniel is the famous
first judge of Israel, [Jdg 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009.md). Of
Seraiah nothing further is known, although the name is often met with of
different persons.

The sons of Othniel are Hathath. The plural בּני, even when only one
name follows, is met with elsewhere (vide on [Ch1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007).md); but the continuation is somewhat
strange, "and Meonothai begat Ophrah," for as Meonothai is not before
mentioned, his connection with Othniel is not given. There is evidently
a hiatus in the text, which may most easily be filled up by repeating
וּמעונתי at the end of [Ch1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md).
According to this conjecture two sons of Othniel would be named, Hathath
and Meonothai, and then the posterity of the latter is given. The name
מעונתי (my dwellings) is not met with elsewhere. It is not at all
probable that it is connected with the town Maon, and still less that it
is so in any way with the Mehunim, [Ezr
2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#050.md). Ophrah is unknown, for of course
we must not think of the towns called Ophrah, in the territory of
Benjamin, [Jos 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023.md), and in that of
Manasseh, [Jdg 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md), [Jdg
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024.md). Seraiah, who is mentioned in
[Ch1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md), begat Joab the father
(founder) of the valley of the craftsmen, "for they (i.e., the
inhabitants of this valley, who were descended from Joab) were
craftsmen." The valley of the חרשׁים (craftsmen) is again mentioned in
[Neh 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#035.md), whence we may conclude
that it lay at no great distance from Jerusalem, in a northern
direction.

[1 Chronicles 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 4:15</span></span>

Of Iru, Elah, and Naam, the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh (cf. on
[Ch1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013).md), nothing more is known. To
connect Elah with the Edomite chief of that name ([Ch1
1:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#052).md) is arbitrary. Of Elah's sons
only "and Kenaz" is mentioned; the ו copul. before קנז shows clearly
that a name has been dropped out before it.

[1 Chronicles 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 4:16</span></span>

Descendants of various men, whose genealogical connection with the sons
and grandsons of Judah, mentioned in [Ch1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md), is not given in the text as it
has come to us.

[Ch1 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#016.md)

Sons of Jehaleleel, a man not elsewhere mentioned. Ziph, Ziphah, etc.,
are met with only here. There is no strong reason for connecting the
name זיף with the towns of that name, [Jos
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024.md), [Jos
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055.md).

[Ch1 4:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md)

Ezra, whose four sons are enumerated, is likewise unknown. The singular
בּן is peculiar, but has analogies in [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md), [Ch1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#021.md), and [Ch1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#023.md). Of the names of his sons, Jether
and Epher again occur, the former in [Ch1
2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053.md), and the latter in [Ch1
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#033.md) and [Ch1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#024.md), but in other families. Jalon, on
the contrary, is found only here. The children of two wives of Mered are
enumerated in [Ch1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md) and [Ch1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018.md), but in a fashion which is quite
unintelligible, and shows clear traces of a corruption in the text. For
(1) the name of a woman as subject of ותּהר, "and she conceived (bare),"
is wanting; and (2) in [Ch1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018.md) the
names of two women occur, Jehudijah and Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh.
But the sons of Jehudijah are first given, and there follows thereupon
the formula, "and these are the sons of Bithiah," without any mention of
the names of these sons. This manifest confusion Bertheau has sought to
remove by a happy transposition of the words. He suggests that the
words, "and these are the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, whom
Mered had taken," should be placed immediately after וילון. "By this
means we obtain (1) the missing subject of ותּהר; (2) the definite
statement that Mered had two wives, with whom he begat sons; and (3) an
arrangement by which the sons are enumerated after the names of their
respective mothers." After this transposition the [Ch1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md) would read thus: "And the sons of
Ezra are Jether, Mered, ... and Jalon; and these are the sons of Bithia
the daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered took; and she conceived (and bare)
Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah, the father of Eshtemoa ([Ch1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018).md), and his wife Jehudijah bore
Jered the father of Gedor, etc." This conjecture commends itself by its
simplicity, and by the clearness which it brings into the words. From
them we then learn that two families, who dwelt in a number of the
cities of Judah, were descended from Mered the son of Ezra by his two
wives. We certainly know no more details concerning them, as neither
Mered not his children are met with elsewhere. From the circumstance,
however, that the one wife was a daughter of Pharaoh, we may conclude
that Mered lived before the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. The
name Miriam, which Moses' sister bore, is here a man's name. The names
introduced by אבי are the names of towns. Ishbah is father (lord) of the
town Eshtemoa, in the mountains of Judah, now Semua, a village to the
south of Hebron, with considerable ruins dating from ancient times (cf.
on [Jos 15:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#050).md). היהוּדיּה means
properly "the Jewess," as distinguished from the Egyptian woman,
Pharaoh's daughter. Gedor is a town in the high lands of Judah (cf. on
[Ch1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004).md). Socho, in the low land of
Judah, now Shuweikeh, in Wady Sumt (cf. on [Jos
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035).md). Zanoah is the name of a town
in the high lands of Judah, [Jos 15:56](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#056.md)
(which has not yet been discovered), and of a town in the low land, now
Zanua, not far from Zoreah, in an easterly direction (cf. on [Jos
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034).md). Perhaps the latter is here
meant. In [Ch1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#019.md), "the sons of the
wife of Hodiah, the sister of Naham, are the father of Keilah the
Garmite, and Eshtemoa the Maachathite." The stat. contr. אשׁת before
הודיּה shows that Hodiah is a man's name. Levites of this name are
mentioned in [Neh 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007.md); [Neh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005.md); [Neh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#011.md). The relationship of Hodiah and
Naham to the persons formerly named is not given. קעילה is a locality in
the low land of Judah not yet discovered (see on [Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044).md). The origin of the Epithet
הגּרמי we do not know. Before אשׁתּמע, אבי with ו copul. is probably to
be repeated; and the Maachathite, the chief of a part of the inhabitants
of Eshtemoa, is perhaps a descendant of Caleb by Maachah ([Ch1
2:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#048).md).

[Ch1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#020.md)

Of Shimon and his four sons, also, nothing is known. בּן־חנן is one
name. Ishi is often met with, e.g., [Ch1
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#042.md) and [Ch1
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#031.md), but nowhere in connection with
Zoheth (not further noticed). The names of the sons are wanting after
בּן־זוחת.

[1 Chronicles 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 4:21</span></span>

Descendants of Shelah, the third son of Judah, [Ch1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003.md), and [Gen
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#005.md). - All the families of Judah
enumerated in vv. 2-20 are connected together by the conjunction ו, and
so are grouped as descendants of the sons and grandsons of Judah named
in [Ch1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md). The conjunction is
omitted, however, before שׁלה בּני, as also before יהוּדה בּני in [Ch1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#003.md), to show that the descendants of
Shelah form a second line of descendants of Judah, co-ordinate with the
sons of Judah enumerated in vv. 1-19, concerning whom only a little
obscure but not unimportant information has been preserved. Those
mentioned as sons are Er (which also was the name of the first-born of
Judah, [Ch1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003)..md), father of Lecah,
and Laadan, the father of Mareshah. The latter name denotes, beyond
question, a town which still exists as the ruin Marash in the Shephelah,
[Jos 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044.md) (see on [Ch1
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042)), and consequently Lecah (לכה.md)
also is the name of a locality not elsewhere mentioned. The further
descendants of Shelah were, "the families of the Byssus-work of the
house of Ashbea," i.e., the families of Ashbea, a man of whom nothing
further is known. Of these families some were connected with a famous
weaving-house or linen (Byssus) manufactory, probably in Egypt; and then
further, in [Ch1 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022.md), "Jokim, and the
man of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, which ruled over Moab, and
Jashubi-lehem." Kimchi conjectured that כּזבה was the place called כזיב
in [Gen 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#005.md) = אכזיב, [Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044.md), in the low land, where Shelah
was born. לחם ישׁבי is a strange name, "which the punctuators would
hardly have pronounced in the way they have done if it had not come down
to them by tradition" (Berth.). The other names denote heads of families
or branches of families, the branches and families being included in
them.

(Note: Jerome has given a curious translation of [Ch1
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022.md), "et qui stare fecit solem,
virique mendacii et securus et incendens, qui principes fuerunt in Moab
et qui reversi sunt in Lahem: haec autem verba vetera," - according to
the Jewish Midrash, in which למואב בּעלוּ אשׁר was connected with the
narrative in the book of Ruth. For יוקים, qui stare fecit solem, is
supposed to be Elimelech, and the viri mendacii Mahlon and Chilion, so
well known from the book of Ruth, who went with their father into the
land of Moab and married Moabitesses.)

Nothing is told us of them beyond what is found in our verses, according
to which the four first named ruled over Moab during a period in the
primeval time; fir, as the historian himself remarks, "these things are
old."

[1 Chronicles 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 4:23</span></span>

"These are the potters and the inhabitants of Netaim and Gedera." It is
doubtful whether המּה refers to all the descendants of Shelah, or only
to those named in [Ch1 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022.md). Bertheau
holds the latter to be the more probable reference; "for as those named
in [Ch1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#021.md) have already been
denominated Byssus-workers, it appears fitting that those in [Ch1
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022.md) should be regarded as the
potters, etc." But all those mentioned in [Ch1
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022.md) are by no means called
Byssus-weavers, but only the families of Ashbea. What the descendants of
Er and Laadan were is not said. The המּה may consequently very probably
refer to all the sons of Shelah enumerated in [Ch1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#021.md) and [Ch1
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022.md), with the exception of the
families designated Byssus-weavers, who are, of course, understood to be
excepted. נטעים signifies "plantings;" but since גּדרה is probably the
name of a city Gedera in the lowlands of Judah (cf. [Jos
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#036.md); and for the situation, see on
[Ch1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#004).md), Netaim also will most
likely denote a village where there were royal plantations, and about
which these descendants of Shelah were employed, as the words "with the
king in his business to dwell there" expressly state. המּלך is not an
individual king of Judah, for we know not merely "of King Uzziah that he
had country lands, [Ch2 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010.md)"
(Berth.); but we learn from [Ch1
27:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025.md) that David also possessed
great estates and country lands, which were managed by regularly
appointed officers.

We may therefore with certainty assume that all the kings of Judah had
domains on which not only agriculture and the rearing of cattle, but
also trades, were carried on.

(Note: From the arrangement of the names in vv. 2-20, in which Bertheau
finds just twelve families grouped together, he concludes, S. 44f., that
the division of the tribe of Judah into these twelve families did
actually exist at some time or other, and had been established by a new
reckoning of the families which the heads of the community found
themselves compelled to make after deep and wide alterations had taken
place in the circumstances of the tribe. He then attempts to determine
this time more accurately by the character of the names. For since only
a very few names in these verses are known to us from the historical
books, from Genesis to 2 Kings, and the few thus known refer to the
original divisions of the tribe, which may have maintained themselves
till post-exilic times, while, on the contrary, a great number of the
other names recur in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah; and since
localities which in the earliest period after the exile were important
for the new community are frequently met with in our verses, while such
as were constantly being mentioned in prae-exilic times are nowhere to
be found, - Bertheau supposes that a division of the tribe of Judah is
here spoken of, which actually existed at some time in the period
between Zerubbabel and Ezra. This hypothesis has, however, no solid
foundation. The assumption even that the names in vv. 2-20 belong to
just twelve families is very questionable; for this number can only be
arrived at by separating the descendants of Caleb, [Ch1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#015.md), from the descendants of Kenaz,
[Ch1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md) and [Ch1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014.md), of whom Caleb himself was one,
and reckoning them separately. But the circumstance that in this
reckoning only the names in [Ch1
4:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#012.md) are taken into consideration,
which no notice is taken of the descendants of Shelah the son of Judah,
enumerated in [Ch1 4:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#021.md), is much
more important. Bertheau considers this verse to be merely a
supplementary addition, but without reason, as we have pointed out on
[Ch1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#021.md). For if the descendants of
Shelah form a second line of families descended from Judah, co-ordinate
with the descendants of Pharez and Zerah, the tribe of Judah could not,
either before or after the exile, have been divided into the twelve
families supposed by Bertheau; for we have no reason to suppose, on
behalf of this hypothesis, that all the descendants of Shelah had died
out towards the end of the exile, and that from the time of Zerubbabel
only families descended from Pharez and Zerah existed. But besides this,
the hypothesis is decisively excluded by the fact that in the
enumeration, vv. 2-20, no trace can be discovered of a division of the
tribe of Judah into twelve families; for not only are the families
mentioned not ranger according to the order of the sons and grandsons of
Judah mentioned in [Ch1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md), but also
the connection of many families with Judah is not even hinted at. An
enumeration of families which rested upon a division either made or
already existing at any particular time, would be very differently
planned and ordered. But if we must hold the supposition of a division
of the tribe of Judah into twelve families to be unsubstantiated, since
it appears irreconcilable with the present state of these genealogies,
we must also believe the opinion that this division actually existed at
any time between Zerubbabel and Ezra to be erroneous, and to rest upon
no tenable grounds. The relation of the names met with in these verses
to the names in the books from Genesis to 2 Kings on the one hand, and
to the books of Ezra and Nehemiah on the other, is not really that which
Bertheau represents it to be. If we turn our attention in the first
place to the names of places, we find that, except a few quite unknown
villages or towns, the localities mentioned in vv. 2-20 occur also in
the book of Joshua, and many of them even here and there throughout
Genesis, in the book of Judges, and in the books of Samuel and Kings. In
these latter they are somewhat more rarely met with, but only because
they played no great part in history. The fact of a disproportionate
number of these towns occurring also in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah
is connected with the peculiar character of the contents of these books,
containing as they do a number of registers of the families of Judah
which had returned out of exile. Then if we consider the names of
persons in vv. 2-20, we find that not a few of them occur in the
historical narratives of the books of Samuel and Kings. Others certainly
are found only in the family registers of the books of Ezra and
Nehemiah, while others again are peculiar to our verses. This phenomenon
also is completely accounted for by the contents of the various
historical books of the Old Testament. For example, had Nehemiah not
received into his book the registers of all the families who had
returned from Babylon, and who took part in the building of the walls of
Jerusalem, no more names would be met with in his book than are found in
the books of Samuel and Kings. Bertheau attempts to find support for his
hypothesis in the way in which the names are enumerated, and their loose
connection with each other, inasmuch as the disconnected statements
abruptly and intermittently following one another, which to us bring
enigma after enigma, must have been intended for readers who could bring
a key to the understanding of the whole from an accurate knowledge of
the relations which are here only hinted at; but the strength of this
argument depends upon the assumption that complete family registers were
at the command of the author of the Chronicle, from which he excerpted
unconnected and obscure fragments, without any regard to order. But such
an assumption cannot be justified. The character of that which is
communicated would rather lead us to believe that only fragments were in
the hands of the chronicler, which he has given to us as he found them.
We must therefore pronounce this attempt at an explanation of the
contents and form of vv. 2-20 to be an utter failure.)

[1 Chronicles 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 4:24</span></span>

The families of Simeon. - Of the six sons of Simeon, [Gen
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#010.md) and [Exo
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#015.md), only the five are here named
who, according to [Num 26:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012.md),
founded the families of this tribe. The third son, Ohad, is omitted even
in [Num 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012.md) in the list of the
families of Simeon, at the numbering of the people in the fortieth year
of the journey through the wilderness, clearly only because the
posterity of Ohad had either died out, or had so dwindled away that it
could form no independent family. The names of the five sons agree with
the names in [Num 26:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012.md), except in
the case of Jarib, who in [Num 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012.md),
which coincides here with [Gen 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#010.md)
and [Exo 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#015.md), is called Jachin; יריב,
consequently, must be looked upon as a transcriber's error for יכין.
Nemuel and Zerah (זרח, the rising of the sun) are called in Genesis and
Exodus Jemuel (a different form of the same name) and Zohar (צחר, i.e.,
candor), another name of similar meaning, which, at first used only as a
by-name, afterwards supplanted the original name.

[Ch1 4:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#025.md)

"Shallum (was) his son;" without doubt the son of the last named Shaul,
who in Genesis and Exodus is called the son of a Canaanitish woman, and
is thereby distinguished from the other sons. His family is traced down,
in [Ch1 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#025.md), [Ch1
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#026.md), through six generations to one
Shimei. But this list is divided into two groups by the words "and the
sons of Mishma," inserted at the beginning of [Ch1
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#026.md), but the reasons for the division
are unknown. The plural, sons of Mishma, refers to Hammuel and his
descendants Zacchur and Shimei. Perhaps these two together form, with
the sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons mentioned in [Ch1
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#025.md), a single larger family.

[Ch1 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#027.md)

Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, by whom he became the father
of a numerous race. "His brothers," i.e., the other Simeonites, on the
contrary, had not many sons. Hence it happens that they made not their
whole race, i.e., the whole race of the Simeonites, numerous unto the
sons of Judah, i.e., that the Simeonites were not so numerous as the
descendants of Judah. This account is corroborated by the statement made
at the numberings of the people under Moses; see on Num 1-4 (1:2, S.
192).

[1 Chronicles 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 4:28</span></span>

The ancient dwelling-places of the Simeonites, which they received
within the tribal domain of Judah at the division of the land by Joshua;
cf. [Jos 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md). - There are in all
eighteen cities, divided into two groups, numbering thirteen and five
respectively, as in [Jos 19:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002.md), where
these same cities are enumerated in the same order. The only difference
is, that in Joshua thirteen cities are reckoned in the first group and
four in the second, although the first group contains fourteen names.
Between Beersheba and Moladah there stands there a שׁבע which is not
found in our list, and which might be considered to be a repetition of
the second part of בּאר־שׁבע, if it were not that in the list of the
cities, [Jos 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#026.md), the name שׁמע
before Moladah corresponds to it. The other differences between the two
passages arise partly from different forms of the same name being used,
- as, for example, בּלהה for בּלה (Josh.), תּולד for אלתּולד, בּתוּאל
for בּתוּל; and partly from different names being used of the same city,
- e.g., בּית־בּראי ([Ch1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031).md) instead
of בּית־לבאות, "the house of lions" (Josh.), שׁערים instead of שׁרוּחן
(Josh.). All these cities lie in the south land of Judah, and have
therefore been named in [Jos 15:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#026.md)
among the cities of that district. As to Beersheba, now Bir es Seba, see
on [Gen 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031.md); and for Moladah, which
is to be identified with the ruin el Milh to the south of Hebron, on the
road to Ailah, see on [Jos 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#026.md).
Bilhah (in [Jos 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#029), בּעלה.md), Ezem,
Tolad, and Bethuel (for which in [Jos
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031) כּסיל is found.md), have not yet
been discovered; cf. on [Jos 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#029.md) and
[Jos 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#030.md). Hormah, formerly Sephat,
is now the ruin Sepata, on the western slope of the Rakhma table-land, 2
1/2 hours south of Khalasa (Elusa); cf. on [Jos
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#014.md). Ziklag is most probably to be
sought in the ancient village Aschludsch or Kasludsch, to the east of
Sepata; cf. on [Jos 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031.md).
Beth-marcaboth, i.e., "carriage-house," and Hazar-susim (or Susa), i.e.,
horse-village, both evidently by-names, are called in [Jos
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031.md) Madmannah and Sansannah. Their
position has not yet been discovered. Beth-Birei, or Beth-lebaoth, is
also as yet undiscovered; cf. on [Jos
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md). Shaaraim, called in [Jos
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md) Shilhim, is supposed to be the
same as Tell Sheriah, between Gaza and Beersheba; cf. Van de Velde,
Reise, ii. S. 154. The enumeration of these thirteen cities concludes in
[Ch1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md) with the strange
subscription, "These (were) their cities until the reign of David, and
their villages." וחצריהם, which, according to the Masoretic division of
the verses, stands at the beginning of [Ch1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md), should certainly be taken with
[Ch1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md); for the places mentioned in
[Ch1 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md) are expressly called cities,
and in [Jos 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#006.md), cities and their
villages, הצריהם, are spoken of. This subscription can hardly "only be
intended to remind us, that of the first-mentioned cities, one (viz.,
Ziklag, [Sa1 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006).md), or several, in the
time of David, no longer belonged to the tribe of Simeon;" nor can it
only be meant to state that "till the time of David the cities named
were in possession of the tribe of Simeon, though they did not all
continue to be possessed by this tribe at a later time" (Berth.). Ziklag
had been, even before the reign of David, taken away from the Simeonites
by the Philistines, and had become the property of King Achish, who in
the reign of Saul presented it to David, and through him it became the
property of the kings of Judah ([Sa1
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006).md). The subscription can only mean
that till the reign of David these cities rightfully belonged to the
Simeonites, but that during and after David's reign this rightful
possession of the Simeonites was trenched upon; and of this curtailing
of their rights, the transfer of the city of Ziklag to the kings of
Judah gives one historically attested proof. This, however, might not
have been the only instance of the sort; it may have brought with it
other alterations in the possessions of the Simeonites as to which we
have no information. The remark of R. Salomo and Kimchi, that the men of
Judah, when they had attained to greater power under David's rule, drove
the Simeonites out of their domains, and compelled them to seek out
other dwelling-places, is easily seen to be an inference drawn from the
notices in [Jos 19:33-43](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033.md) of
emigrations of the Simeonites into other districts; but it may not be
quite incorrect, as these emigrations under Hezekiah presuppose a
pressure upon or diminution of their territory. We would indeed expect
this remark to occur after [Jos 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033.md),
but it may have been placed between the first and second groups of
cities, for the reason that the alterations in the dwelling-places of
the Simeonites which took place in the time of David affected merely the
first group, while the cities named in [Jos
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#032.md)., with their villages, remained
at a later time even the untouched possession of the Simeonites.

[1 Chronicles 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 4:32</span></span>

Instead of the five cities, Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan, only
four are mentioned in [Jos 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007.md), viz.,
Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan; עתר is written instead of תּוכן, and עיטם
is wanting. According to Movers, p. 73, and Berth. in his commentary on
the passage, the list of these cities must have been at first as
follows: רמּון עין (one city), עתר, תּוכן, and עשׁן; in Joshua תּוכן
must have fallen out by mistake, in our text עתר has been erroneously
exchanged for the better known city עיטם in the tribe of Judah, while by
reckoning both עין and רמּון the number four has become five. These
conjectures are shown to be groundless by the order of the names in our
text. For had עתר been exchanged for עיטם, עיטם would not stand in the
first place, at the head of the four or five cities, but would have
occupied the place of עתר, which is connected with עשׁן in [Jos
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007.md) and [Jos
15:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#043.md). Then again, the face that in
[Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md) רמּון is separated from עין
by the ו cop., and in [Jos 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007.md) is
reckoned by itself as one city as in our verse, is decisive against
taking עין and רמּון together as one name. The want of the conjunction,
moreover, between the two names here and in [Jos
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007.md), and the uniting of the two words
into one name, עין־תּון, [Neh 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#029.md),
is explained by the supposition that the towns lay in the immediate
neighbourhood of each other, so that they were at a later time united,
or at least might be regarded as one city. Rimmon is perhaps the same as
the ruin Rum er Rummanim, four hours to the north of Beersheba; and Ain
is probably to be identified with a large half-ruined and very ancient
well which lies at from thirty to thirty-five minutes distance, cf. on
[Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md). Finally, the assertion
that the name עיטם has come into our text by an ex change of the unknown
עתר for the name of this better known city of Judah, is founded upon a
double geographical error. It rests (1) upon the erroneous assumption
that besides the Etam in the high lands of Judah to the south of
Bethlehem, there was no other city of this name, and that the Etam
mentioned in [Jdg 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#008.md), [Jdg
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#011.md) is identical with that in the
high lands of Judah; and (2) on the mistaken idea that Ether was also
situated in the high lands of Judah, whereas it was, according to [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042.md), one of the cities of the
Shephelah; and the Simeonites, moreover, had no cities in the high lands
of Judah, but had their dwelling-places assigned to them in the Negeb
and the Shephelah. The existence of a second Etam, besides that in the
neighbourhood of Bethlehem, is placed beyond doubt by [Jdg
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#008.md) and [Jdg
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#011.md); for mention is there made of an
Etam in the plain of Judah, which is to be sought in the neighbourhood
of Khuweilife, on the border of the Negeb and the mountainous district:
cf. on [Jdg 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#008.md). It is this Etam
which is spoken of in our verse, and it is rightly grouped with Ain and
Rimmon, which were situated in the Negeb, while Tochen and Ashan were in
the Shephelah. The statement of [Jos
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007.md) and [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042.md) leaves no doubt as to the fact
that the תּוכן of our verse is only another name for עתר. Etam must
therefore have come into the possession of the Simeonites after Joshua's
time, but as to when, or under what circumstances, we have no
information.

Concerning the villages belonging to these cities, cf. on [Jos
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#008.md), where for בּעל we have the more
accurate בּאר בּעלת, and Ramah of the south. The position of these
places has not yet been certainly ascertained. "These are their
dwelling-places, and their family register was to them;" i.e., although
they were only a small tribe and dwelt in the midst of Judah, they yet
had their own family register (Berth.). התיחשׂ infin. is used
substantively, "the entering in the family register."

Emigrations of Simeonite families into other districts. - [Ch1
4:34-41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#034.md) record an expedition of the
Simeonites, in the time of Hezekiah, undertaken for purposes of
conquest. In [Ch1 4:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#034.md), thirteen
princes of the tribe of Simeon are enumerated who undertook this
expedition. The families of some of them are traced through several
generations, but in no case are they traced down so far as to show their
connection with the families named in [Ch1
4:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#024.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">ch1 4:38</span></span>

"These mentioned by their names were princes in their families; whose
fathers'-houses had increased to a multitude. And they went," etc.
בשׁמות הבּאים, properly "those who have come with their names," i.e.,
those who have been mentioned by name; for בּוא with בּ = to come with,
is to bring something in, to introduce: cf. [Psa
71:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016.md). This formula is synonymous with
בשׁמות הכּתוּבים, [Ch1 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041.md); but we
cannot consider it, as J. H. Mich., Berth., and others do, identical in
meaning with בשׁמות נקּבוּ אשׁר, [Ch1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#031.md); [Num
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#017.md), etc. The predicate to אלּה is
נשׂיאים, and הבּאים is a relative sentence, more accurately defining the
subject אלּה. Princes in their families are not heads of families, but
heads of fathers'-houses, into which the families had divided
themselves. בּית־אבות is not construed with the plural, as being
collective (Berth.), but as the plural of the word בּית־אב: cf. Ew. 270,
c.

[1 Chronicles 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 4:39</span></span>

The princes named "went westward from Gedor to the east side of the
valley, to seek pasture for their flocks." גדר מבוא does not mean the
entrance of Gedor (Mich., Berth., and others); but is, as the
corresponding מזרח, "rising" of the sun, i.e., east, requires, a
designation of the west, and is abridged from השּׁמשׁ מבוא, as in
statements with reference to places מזרח is used instead of השּׁמשׁ
מזרח. The locality itself, however, is to us at present unknown. So much
is clear, that by Gedor, the Gedor mentioned in [Jos
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058.md), situated in the high lands of
Judah, north of Hebron, cannot be intended, for in that district there
is no open valley stretching out on either hand; and the Simeonites,
moreover, could not have carried on a war of conquest in the territory
of the tribe of Judah in the reign of Hezekiah. But where this Gedor is
to be sought cannot be more accurately determined; for הגּיא is
certainly not "the valley in which the Dead Sea lies, and the southern
continuation of that valley," as Ewald and Berth. think: that valley
has, in the Old Testament, always the name הערבה. From the use of the
article, "the valley," no further conclusion can be drawn, than that a
definite valley in the neighbourhood of Gedor is meant.

(Note: The lxx have rendered גדר by Γεράρ, whence Ewald and Bertheau
conclude that גדר is a transcriber's error for גרר. But a slip of the
pen which would make the Gerar so famed in the history of the patriarchs
into Gedor is priori not very probable; and the defective writing גדר,
while Gedor in the high lands is written גּדור, cannot be adduced, as
Bertheau thinks, in support of the hypothesis, since Gedor even in [Ch1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018.md) is written defectively. It is
decisive against Gerar, that the dwelling-places of the Simeonites
demonstrably did not extend till towards sunset (westward) from Gerar,
for the cities assigned to them all lie to the east of Gerar.)

Even the further statements in [Ch1
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#030.md), with regard to the district,
that they found there fat and good pasture, and that the land extended
on both sides (i.e., was wide), and at rest and secure, because formerly
the Hamites dwelt there, and the statement of [Ch1
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041.md), that the Simeonites found the
Meunim there, and smote them, give us no firm foothold for the
ascertainment of the district referred to. The whole Negeb of Judah has
been as yet too little travelled over and explored by modern travellers,
to allow of our forming any probable conjecture as to Gedor and the wide
valley stretching out on both sides. The description of the Hamite
inhabitants, וּשׁלוה שׁקטת, reminds us of the inhabitants of the ancient
Laish ([Jdg 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md), [Jdg
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027).md). Those צם מן are people from
Ham, i.e., Hamites, and they may have been Egyptians, Cushites, or even
Canaanites ([Ch1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#008).md). This only is
certain, that they were a peaceful shepherd people, who dwelt in tents,
and were therefore nomads. לפנים, "formerly," before the Simeonites took
possession of the land.

[1 Chronicles 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">ch1 4:41</span></span>

The above-mentioned Simeonite princes, with their people, fell upon the
peaceful little people of the Hamites in the days of Hezekiah, and
smote, i.e., destroyed, their tents, and also the Meunites whom they
found there. The Meunites were strangers in this place, and were
probably connected with the city Maan in the neighbourhood of Petra, to
the east of Wady Musa (cf. on [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md) and [Ch2
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007).md), who dwelt in tents as nomads,
with the Hamites in their richly pastured valley. ויּחרימם, and they
destroyed them utterly, as the Vulgate rightly renders it, et
deleverunt; and J. H. Mich., ad internecionem usque eos exciderunt. The
word החרים, to smite with the curse, having gradually lost its original
religious signification, came to be used in a wider sense, to denote
complete extirpation, because all accursed persons were slain. Undoubted
examples are [Ch2 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023.md); [Ch2
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#014.md); [Kg2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#011.md); [Isa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#011.md); and it is to be so understood
here also.

(Note: Bertheau ignores this secondary use of the word, and has drawn
from יחרימם the extremely wide inference, that the Simeonites, impelled
by holy enthusiasm, arising from the wondrous deliverance of Judah from
the attack of the Assyrian power, and the elevation of feeling which it
produced in the community, and filled with the thought awakened by the
discourses of the great prophets, that the time had come to extend
Israel's rule, and to bring the conquered peoples under the curse, just
as was done in the time of Joshua, had undertaken this war of
annexation. But there is unfortunately not a single trace of this
enthusiastic thought in the narrative of our verse, for it knows no
other motive for the whole undertaking than the purely earthly need to
seek and find new pasture lands.)

"Until this day," i.e., till the composition of the historical work used
by the author of the Chronicle, i.e., till the time before the exile.

[1 Chronicles 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 4:42</span></span>

A part of the Simeonites undertook a second war of conquest against
Mount Seir. Led by four chiefs of the sons of Shimei (cf. [Ch1
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#027).md), 500 men marched thither, smote
the remainder of the Amalekites who had escaped, and they dwell there to
this day (as in [Ch1 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041).md). מהם is
more accurately defined by שׁ מבּני, and is therefore to be referred to
the Simeonites in general, and not to that part of them only mentioned
in [Ch1 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#033) (Berth..md). From the
circumstance that the leaders were sons of Shimei, we may conclude that
the whole troop belonged to this family. The escaped of Amalek are those
who had escaped destruction in the victories of Saul and David over this
hereditary enemy of Israel ([Sa1
14:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#048.md); [Sa1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007.md); [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012).md). A remnant of them had been
driven into the mountain land of Idumea, where they were smitten, i.e.,
extirpated, by the Simeonites. It is not said at what time this was
done, but it occurred most probably in the second half of Hezekiah's
reign.
