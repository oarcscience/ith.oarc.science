Suppliant Cry of One Who Is Utterly Undone

The ירוּם of the personal cry with which David opens [Psa
13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md) harmonizes with כּרם of the
general lament which he introduces into [Psa
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md); and for this reason the
collector has coupled these two Psalms together. Hitzig assigns [Psa
13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md) to the time when Saul posted
watchers to hunt David from place to place, and when, having been long
and unceasingly persecuted, David dared to cherish a hope of escaping
death only by indefatigable vigilance and endurance. Perhaps this view
is correct. The Psalm consists of three strophes, or if it be preferred,
three groups of decreasing magnitude. A long deep sigh is followed, as
from a relieved breast, by an already much more gentle and half calm
prayer; and this again by the believing joy which anticipates the
certainty of being answered. This song as it were casts up constantly
lessening waves, until it becomes still as the sea when smooth as a
mirror, and the only motion discernible at last is that of the joyous
ripple of calm repose.

[Psalms 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 13:1</span></span>

(Heb.: 13:2-3) The complicated question: till when, how long...for ever
(as in [Psa 74:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010.md); [Psa
79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005.md); [Psa
89:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047).md), is the expression of a
complicated condition of soul, in which, as Luther briefly and forcibly
describes it, amidst the feeling of anguish under divine wrath "hope
itself despairs and despair nevertheless begins to hope." The
self-contradiction of the question is to be explained by the conflict
which is going on within between the flesh and the spirit. The dejected
heart thinks: God has forgotten me for ever. But the spirit, which
thrusts away this thought, changes it into a question which sets upon it
the mark of a mere appearance not a reality: how long shall it seem as
though Thou forgettest me for ever? It is in the nature of the divine
wrath, that the feeling of it is always accompanied by an impression
that it will last for ever; and consequently it becomes a foretaste of
hell itself. But faith holds fast the love that is behind the wrath; it
sees in the display of anger only a self-masking of the loving
countenance of the God of love, and longs for the time when this loving
countenance shall be again unveiled to it. Thrice does David send forth
this cry of faith out of the inmost depths of his spirit. To place or
set up contrivances, plans, or proposals in his soul, viz., as to the
means by which he may be able to escape from this painful condition, is
equivalent to, to make the soul the place of such thoughts, or the place
where such thoughts are fabricated (cf. [Pro
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024).md). One such עצה chases the other
in his soul, because he recognises the vanity of one after another as
soon as they spring up. With respect to the יומם which follows, we must
think of these cares as taking possession of his soul in the night time;
for the night leaves a man alone with his affliction and makes it doubly
felt by him. It cannot be proved from [Eze
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#016.md) (cf. [Zep
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004) בּצּהרים.md), that יומם like יום
([Jer 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025), short for יום יום.md) may
mean "daily" (Ew. 313, a). יומם does not mean this here, but is the
antithesis to לילה which is to be supplied in thought in [Psa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003.md). By night he proposes plan after
plan, each one as worthless as the other; and by day, or all the day
through, when he sees his distress with open eyes, sorrow (יגון) is in
his heart, as it were, as the feeling the night leaves behind it and as
the direct reflex of his helpless and hopeless condition. He is
persecuted, and his foe is in the ascendant. רוּם is both to be exalted
and to rise, raise one's self, i.e., to rise to position and arrogantly
to assume dignity to one's self (sich brsten). The strophe closes with
‛ad-āna which is used for the fourth time.

[Psalms 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 13:3</span></span>

(Heb.: 13:4-5) In contrast to God's seeming to have forgotten him and to
wish neither to see nor know anything of his need, he prays: הבּיטה (cf.
[Isa 63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015).md). In contrast to his being
in perplexity what course to take and unable to help himself, he prays:
ענני, answer me, who cry for help, viz., by the fulfilment of my prayer
as a real, actual answer. In contrast to the triumphing of his foe:
האירה עיני, in order that the triumph of his enemy may not be made
complete by his dying. To lighten the eyes that are dimmed with sorrow
and ready to break, is equivalent to, to impart new life ([Ezr
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008).md), which is reflected in the fresh
clear brightness of the eye ([Sa1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027.md), [Sa1
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#029).md). The lightening light, to which
האיר points, is the light of love beaming from the divine countenance,
[Psa 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#017.md). Light, love, and life are
closely allied notions in the Scriptures. He, upon whom God looks down
in love, continues in life, new powers of life are imparted to him, it
is not his lot to sleep the death, i.e., the sleep of death, [Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md), [Jer
51:57](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057.md), cf. [Psa
76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md). המּות is the accusative of
effect or sequence: to sleep so that the sleep becomes death (lxx εἰς
θάνατον), Ew. 281, e. Such is the light of life for which he prays, in
order that his foe may not be able at last to say יכלתּיו (with
accusative object, as in [Jer 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#005).md) =
יכלתּי לו, [Psa 129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002.md), [Gen
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026.md), I am able for him, a match for
him, I am superior to him, have gained the mastery over him. כּי, on
account of the future which follows, had better be taken as temporal
(quum) than as expressing the reason (quod), cf. בּמוט רגלי, [Psa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017.md).

[Psalms 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 13:5</span></span>

(Heb.: 13:6) Three lines of joyous anticipation now follow the five of
lament and four of prayer. By יאני he sets himself in opposition to his
foes. The latter desire his death, but he trusts in the mercy of God,
who will turn and terminate his affliction. בּטח בּ denotes faith as
clinging fast to God, just as חסה בּ denotes it as confidence which
hides itself in Him. The voluntative יגל pre-supposes the sure
realisation of the hope. The perfect in [Psa
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006.md) is to be properly understood
thus: the celebration follows the fact that inspires him to song. גּמל
על to do good to any one, as in [Psa
116:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007.md); [Psa
119:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#017), cf. the radically cognate (על.md)
גּמר [Psa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md). With the two iambics
gamal‛alaj the song sinks to rest. In the storm-tossed soul of the
suppliant all has now become calm. Though it rage without as much now as
ever - peace reigns in the depth of his heart.
