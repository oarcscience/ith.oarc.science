### [Jeremiah Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 22:0</span></span>

Rebuke of the Ungodly Kings Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin, and Promise of a
Righteous Branch of David. - This discourse begins with an exhortation
to the king, his servants, and the people to do right and justice, and
to eschew all unrighteousness, and with the warning, that in case of the
contrary the royal palace will be reduced to ruins and Jerusalem
destroyed by fire. After touching briefly on the fate of Jehoahaz, who
has been deported to Egypt ([Jer
22:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010)), the discourse turns against
Jehoiakim, rebukes his tyranny, in that he builds his house with
unrighteousness and schemes only bloodshed and violence, and threatens
him with ignominious ruin ([Jer
22:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013)). Then, after a threatening
against Jerusalem ([Jer 22:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020)), it
deals with Jechoniah, who is told he shall be carried to Babylon never
to return, and without any descendant to sit on his throne ([Jer
22:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024)). Next, after an outcry of
grief at the wicked shepherds, follows the promise that the Lord will
gather the remnant of His flock out of all the lands whither they have
been driven, that He will restore them to their fields and multiply
them, and that He will raise up to them a good shepherd in the righteous
branch of David ([Jer 23:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001)). -
According to [Jer 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001), Jeremiah spoke
these words in the house of the king of Judah; whence we see that in
this passage we have not merely ideas and scraps of addresses gathered
together, such as had been on various occasions orally delivered by the
prophet. It further appears from [Jer
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010) and [Jer
22:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013), that the portion of the
discourse addressed to Jehoiakim was uttered in the first year of his
reign; and from [Jer 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024), where
Jechoniah is addressed as king, that the utterance concerning him
belongs to the short period (only three months long) of his reign. But
the utterance concerning Jechoniah is joined with that concerning
Jehoiakim on account of the close relationship in matter between them.
The exhortation and warning against injustice, forming the introduction,
as regards it contents, fits very well into the time of Jehoiakim (cf.
[Jer 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017) with [Jer
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003)). The promise with which the
discourse concludes was apparently not spoken till the time of
Jechoniah, shortly before his being taken to Babylon. So that we have
here the discourses of Jeremiah belonging to the times of Jehoiakim and
Jehoiachin respectively, joined into one continuous whole.

[Jeremiah 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 22:1</span></span>

The king is warned against injustice, and the violent oppression of the
poor and defenceless. - [Jer 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001).
"Thus said Jahveh: Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak
there this word, [Jer 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#002). And say:
Hear the word of Jahveh, thou king of Judah, that sittest upon the
throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people, that go in by
these gates. [Jer 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003). Thus hath
Jahveh said: Do ye right and justice, and save the despoiled out of the
hand of the oppressor; to stranger, orphan, and widow do no wrong, no
violence; and innocent blood shed not in this place. [Jer
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#004). For if ye will do this word
indeed, then by the gates of this place there shall come in kings that
sit upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and
his servants, and his people. [Jer
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005). But if ye hearken not to these
words, by myself have I sworn, saith Jahve, that this house shall become
a desolation. [Jer 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006). For thus hath
Jahveh said concerning the house of the king of Judah: A Gilead art thou
to me, a head of Lebanon; surely I will make thee a wilderness, cities
uninhabited; [Jer 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#007). And will
consecrate against thee destroyers, each with his tools, who shall hew
down the choice of thy cedars and cast them into the fire. [Jer
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#008). And there shall pass may peoples
by this city, and one shall say to the other: Wherefore hath Jahveh done
thus unto this great city? [Jer 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#009).
And they will say: Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jahveh
their God, and worshipped other gods and served them."

Go down into the house of the king. The prophet could go down only from
the temple; cf. [Jer 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012) and [Jer
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#010). Not only the king is to hear
the word of the Lord, but his servants too, and the people, who go in by
these gates, the gates of the royal castle. The exhortation: to do right
and justice, etc., is only an expansion of the brief counsel at [Jer
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012), and that brought home to the
heart of the whole people in [Jer 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#006),
cf. [Eze 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006). The form עשׁוק for
עושׁק, [Jer 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012), occurs only here,
but is formed analogously to גּדול, and cannot be objected to. אל־תּנוּ
is strengthened by "do no violence." On "kings riding," etc., cf. [Jer
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025). - With [Jer
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005) cf. [Jer
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#027), where, however, the threatening
is otherwise worded. בּי , cf. [Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016). כּי introduces the contents of
the oath. "This house" is the royal palace. לחרבּה as in [Jer
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034), cf. [Jer
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#017). The threatening is illustrated
in [Jer 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006) by further description of
the destruction of the palace. The royal castle is addressed, and, in
respect of its lofty situation and magnificence, is called a Gilead and
a head of Lebanon. It lay on the north-eastern eminence of Mount Zion
(see on [Kg1 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#012), note 1), and
contained the so-called forest-house of Lebanon ([Kg1
7:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002)) and various other buildings
built of cedar, or, at least, faced with cedar planks (cf. [Jer
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014), [Jer
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023)); so that the entire building
might be compared to a forest of cedars on the summit of Lebanon. In the
comparison to Gilead, Gilead can hardly be adduced in respect of its
great fertility as a pasturing land ([Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014)), but in virtue of the thickly
wooded covering of the hill-country of Gilead on both sides of the
Jabbok. This is still in great measure clothed with oak thickets and,
according to Buckingham, the most beautiful forest tracts that can be
imagined; cf. C. v. Raumer, Pal. S. 82.

(Note: In 1834 Eli Smith travelled through it, and thus writes: "Jebel
'Ajlun presents the most charming rural scenery that I have seen in
Syria. A continued forest of noble trees, chiefly the evergreen oak,
covers a large part of it, while the ground beneath is clothed with
luxuriant grass and decked with a rich variety of wild flowers. As we
went from el-Husn to 'Ajlun our path lay along the summit of the
mountain; and we often overlooked a large part of Palestine on one side
and the whole of Haurn." - Rob. Phys. Geog. p. 54.)

אם לא is a particle of asseveration. This glorious forest of cedar
buildings is to become a מדבּר, a treeless steppe, cities uninhabited.
"Cities" refers to the thing compared, not to the emblem; and the
plural, as being the form for indefinite generality, presents no
difficulty. And the attachment thereto of a singular predicate has many
analogies in its support, cf. Ew. 317, a. The Keri נושׁבוּ is an
uncalled for emendation of the Chet. נושׁבה, cf. [Jer
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#005). - "I consecrate," in respect that
the destroyers are warriors whom God sends as the executors of His will,
see on [Jer 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004). With "a man and his
weapons," cf. [Eze 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002). In keeping
with the figure of a forest, the destruction is represented as the
hewing down of the choicest cedars; cf. [Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034). - Thus is to be accomplished in
Jerusalem what Moses threatened, [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023); the destroyed city will become
a monument of God's wrath against the transgressors of His covenant.
[Jer 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#008) is modelled upon [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023)., cf. [Kg1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008)., and made to bear upon Jerusalem,
since, along with the palace, the city too is destroyed by the enemy.

From [Jer 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010) onwards the
exhortation to the evil shepherds becomes a prophecy concerning the
kings of that time, who by their godless courses hurried on the
threatened destruction. The prophecy begins with King Jehoahaz, who,
after a reign of three months, had bee discrowned by Pharaoh Necho and
carried captive to Egypt; [Kg2
23:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030); [Ch2
36:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001).

[Jeremiah 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 22:10</span></span>

On Jehoahaz. - [Jer 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010). "Weep not
for the dead, neither bemoan him; weep rather for him that is gone away,
for he shall no more return and see the land of his birth. [Jer
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011). For thus saith Jahveh
concerning Shallum, the son of Josiah king of Judah, who became king in
his father Josiah's stead, and who went forth from this place: He shall
not return thither more; [Jer 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#012).
but in the place whither they have carried hi captive, there shall he
die and see this land no more." The clause: weep not for the dead, with
which the prophecy on Shallum is begun, shows that the mourning for King
Josiah was kept up and was still heartily felt amongst the people ([Ch2
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024).), and that the circumstances of
his death were still fresh in their memory. למת without the article,
although Josiah, slain in battle at Megiddo, is meant, because there was
no design particularly to define the person. Him that goes or is gone
away. He, again, is defined and called Shallum. This Shallum, who became
king in his father Josiah's place, can be none other than Josiah's
successor, who is called Joahaz in [Kg2
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030)., [Ch2
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001); as was seen by Chrysost. and
Aben-Ezra, and, since Grotius, by most commentators. The only question
is, why he should here be called Shallum. According to Frc. Junius,
Hitz., and Graf, Jeremiah compares Joahaz on account of his short reign
with Shallum in Israel, who reigned but one month ([Kg2
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#013)), and ironically calls him
Shallum, as Jezebel called Jehu, Zimri murderer of his lord, [Kg2
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#031). This explanation is
unquestionably erroneous, since irony of such a sort is inconsistent
with what Jeremiah says of Shallum. More plausible seems Hgstb.'s
opinion, Christ. ii. p. 401, that Jeremiah gives Joahaz the name
Shallum, i.e., the requited (cf. שׁלּם, [Ch1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#013), = משׁלּם, [Ch1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#011)), as nomen reale, to mark him out
as the man the Lord had punished for the evil of his doings. But this
conjecture too is overthrown by the fact, that in the genealogy of the
kings of Judah, [Ch1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015), we find
among the four sons of Josiah the name שׁלּוּם instead of Joahaz. Now
this name cannot have come there from the present passage, for the
genealogies of Chronicles are derived from old family registers. That
this is so in the case of Josiah's sons, appears from the mention there
of a fourth, Johanan, over and above the three known to history, of whom
we hear nothing more. In the genealogical tables persons are universally
mentioned by their own proper names, not according to "renamings" or
surnames, except in the case that these have received the currency and
value of historical names, as e.g., Israel for Jacob. On the ground of
the genealogical table 1 Chron 3 we must accordingly hold that Joahaz
was properly called Shallum, and that probably at his accession he
assumed the name יואחז, "Jahveh sustains, holds." But Jeremiah might
still have used the name Shallum in preference to the assumed Joahaz,
because the former had verified itself in that king's fate. With [Jer
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011) and [Jer
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#012), cf. [Kg2
23:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033). - The brief saying in regard
to Joahaz forms the transition from the general censure of the wicked
rulers of Judah who brought on the ruin of the kingdom, to the special
predictions concerning the ungodly kings Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin, in
whose time the judgment burst forth. In counselling not to weep for the
dead king (Josiah), but for the departed one (Joahaz), Jeremiah does not
mean merely to bewail the lot of the king carried prisoner to Egypt, but
to foreshadow the misery that awaits the whole people. From this point
of view Calv. well says: si lugenda est urbis hujus clades, potius
lugendi sunt qui manebunt superstites quam qui morientur. Mors enim erit
quasi requies, erit portus ad finienda omnia mala: Vita autem longior
nihil aliud erit quam continua miseriarum series; and further, that in
the words: he shall no more return and see the land of his birth,
Jeremiah shows: exilium fore quasi tabem, quae paulatim consumat miseros
Judaeos. Ita mors fuisset illis dulcior longe, quam sic diu cruciari et
nihil habere relaxationis. In the lot of the two kings the people had to
recognise what was in store for itself.

[Jeremiah 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 22:13</span></span>

The woe uttered upon Jehoiakim. - [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013). "Woe unto him that buildeth his
house with unrighteousness and his upper chambers with wrong, that
maketh his fellow labour for nought, and giveth him not his hire; [Jer
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014). That saith: I will build me a
wide house and spacious upper chambers, and cutteth him out many
windows, and covereth it with cedars, and painteth it with vermilion.
[Jer 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015). Art thou a king of thou
viest in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do right and
justice? Then it went well with him. [Jer
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016). He did justice to the poor and
wretched, then it was well. Is not this to know me? saith Jahveh. [Jer
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017). For on nothing are thine eyes
and thy heart set but on gain and on the blood of the innocent, to shed
it, and on oppression and violence, to do them. [Jer
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018). Therefore thus saith Jahveh
concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah: They shall not
mourn for him, saying: Alas, my brother! and alas, sister! they shall
not mourn for him: Alas, lord! and alas for his glory! [Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019). An ass's burial shall his
burial be, dragged and cast far away from the gates of Jerusalem."

The prediction as to Jehoiakim begins with a woe upon the unjust
oppression of the people. The oppression consisted in his building a
magnificent palace with the sweat and blood of his subjects, whom he
compelled to do forced labour without giving the labourers wages. The
people must have felt this burden all the more severely that Jehoiakim,
to obtain the throne, had bound himself to pay to Pharaoh a large
tribute, the gold and silver for which he raised from the population
according to Pharaoh's own valuation, [Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033). With "Woe to him that
buildeth," etc., cf. [Hab 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012); [Mic
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010). "That maketh his fellow labour,"
lit., through his neighbour he works, i.e., he causes the work to be
done by his neighbour (fellow-man) for nought, without giving him wages,
forces him to unpaid statute-labour. עבד בּ as in [Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039), [Lev
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#046). פּעל, labour, work, gain, then
wages, cf. [Job 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002). Jehoiakim sought
to increase the splendour of his kingship by palace-building. To this
the speech points, put in his mouth at [Jer
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014) : I will build me בּית מדּות, a
house of extensions, i.e., a palace in the grand style, with spacious
halls, vast chambers. מרוּח from רוח, to find vent, cheer up, [Sa1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023); not airy, but spacious, for
quite a modest house might have airy chambers. וקרע is a continuation of
the participle; literally: and he cuts himself out windows, makes huge
openings in the walls for windows. This verb is used in [Jer
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030) of opening up the eyes with
paint. חלּוני presents some difficulty, seeing that the suffix of the
first person makes no sense. It has therefore been held to be a
contracted plural form (Gesen. Lehrgeb. S. 523) or for a dual (Ew. 177,
a), but without any proof of the existence of such formations, since
גּובי, [Amo 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001); [Nah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017), is to be otherwise explained
(see on [Amo 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001)). Following on the
back of J. D. Mich., Hitz., Graf, and Bttcher (ausf. Gramm. 414) propose
to connect the ו before ספוּן with this word and to read חלּוניו: and
tears open for himself his windows; in support of which it is alleged
that one cod. so reads. But this one cod. can decide nothing, and the
suffix his is superfluous, even unsuitable, seeing that there can be no
thought of another person's building; whereas the copula cannot well be
omitted before ספוּן. For the rule adduced for this, that the manner of
the principal action is frequently explained by appending infinitives
absoll. (Ew. 280, a), does not meet the present case; the covering with
cedar, etc., does not refer to the windows, and so cannot be an
explanation of the cutting out for himself. We therefore hold, with
Bttcher (Proben, S. 40), that חלּוני is an adjective formation, with the
force of: abundant in windows, since this formation is completely
accredited by כּילי and חרי (cf. Ew. 164, c); and the objection alleged
against this by Graf, that then no object is specified for "cutteth
out," is not of much weight, it being easy to supply the object from the
preceding "house:" and he cuts it out for himself abounding in windows.
There needs be no change of וספוּן into וספון. For although the infin.
absol. would be quite in place as continuation of the verb. fin. (cf.
Ew. 351, c), yet it is not necessary. The word is attached in zeugma to
וקרע or חלּוני: and he covers with cedar, to: faces or overlays, for
this verb does not mean to plank or floor, for which צפּה is the usual
word, but hide, cover, and is used [Kg1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009); [Kg1
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#003), for roofing. The last statement
is given in infin. absol.: וּמשׁוח :.los, and besmears it, paints it
(the building) with שׁשׁר, red ochre, a brilliant colour (lxx μίλτος,
i.e., acc. to Kimchi, red lead; see Gesen. thess s.v.).

[Jeremiah 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 22:15</span></span>

In [Jer 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015) Jeremiah pursues the
subject: kingship and kingcraft do not consist in the erection of
splendid palaces, but in the administration of right and justice. The
reproachful question התמלך has not the meaning: wilt thou reign long? or
wilt thou consolidate thy dominion? but: dost thou suppose thyself to be
a king, to show thyself a king, if thy aim and endeavour is solely fixed
on the building of a stately palace? "Viest," as in [Jer
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005). בּארז, not: with the cedar, for
תחרה is construed with the accus. of that with which one vies, but: in
cedar, i.e., in the building of cedar palaces. It was not necessary to
say with whom he vied, since the thought of Solomon's edifices would
suggest itself. The lxx have changed בארז by a pointless quid pro quo
into באחז, ἐν ̓́Αχαζ, for which Cod. Alex. and Arabs have ἐν ̓Αχαάβ. The
fact that Ahab had built a palace veneered with ivory ([Kg1
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#039)) is not sufficient to approve
this reading, which Ew. prefers. Still less cause is there to delete
בארז as a gloss (Hitz.) in order to obtain the rendering, justified
neither by grammar nor in fact, "if thou contendest with thy father." To
confirm what he has said, the prophet sets before the worthless king the
example of his godly father Josiah. "Thy father, did not he eat and
drink," i.e., enjoy life (cf. [Ecc
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024); [Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013))? yet at the same time he
administered right and justice, like his forefather David; [Sa2
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015). Then went it well with him and
the kingdom. אז, [Jer 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016), is wider
than אז טו: in respect that he did justice to the poor and wretched,
things went well, were well managed in the kingdom at large. In so doing
consists "the knowing of me." The knowledge of Jahveh is the practical
recognition of God which is displayed in the fear of God and a pious
life. The infinitive nomin. דּעת has the article because a special
emphasis lies on the word (cf. Ew. 277, c), the true knowledge of God
required to have stress laid on it. - But Jehoiakim is the reverse of
his father. This thought, lying in [Jer
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016), is illustrated in [Jer
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#017). For thine eyes are set upon
nothing but gain. בּצע, gain with the suggestion of unrighteousness
about it, cf. [Jer 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013); [Jer
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010). His whole endeavour was after
wealth and splendour. The means of attaining this aim was injustice,
since he not only withheld their wages from his workers ([Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013)), but caused the innocent to be
condemned in the judgment that he might grasp their goods to himself, as
e.g., Ahab had done with Naboth. He also put to death the prophets who
rebuked his unrighteousness, [Jer
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#023), and used every kind of lawless
violence. "Oppression" is amplified by המרוּצה (from רצץ, cf. [Deu
28:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033); [Sa1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003)), crushing, "what we call flaying
people" (Hitz.); cf. on this subject, [Mic

[Jeremiah 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 22:18</span></span>

As punishment for this, his end will be full of horrors; when he dies he
will not be bemoaned and mourned for, and will lie unburied. To have an
ass's burial means: to be left unburied in the open field, or cast into
a flaying-ground, inasmuch as they drag out the dead body and cast it
far from the gates of Jerusalem. The words: Alas, my brother! alas,
etc.! are ipsissima verba of the regular mourners who were procured to
bewail the deaths of men and women. The lxx took objection to the "alas,
sister," and left it out, applying the words literally to Jehoiakim's
death; whereas the words are but a rhetorical individualizing of the
general idea: they will make no death-laments for him, and the omission
destroys the parallelism. His glory, i.e., the king's. The idea is:
neither his relatives nor his subjects will lament his death. The
infinn. absoll. סחוב והשׁלך, dragging forth and casting (him), serve to
explain: the burial of an ass, etc. In [Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030), where Jeremiah repeats this
prediction concerning Jehoiakim, it is said: His dead body shall be cast
out (exposed) to the heat by day and to the cold by night, i.e., rot
unburied under the open sky.

As to the fulfilment of this prophecy, we are told, indeed, in [Kg2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006) that Jehoiakim slept with his
fathers, and Jehoiachin, his son, was king in his stead. But the phrase
"to sleep with his fathers" denotes merely departure from this life,
without saying anything as to the manner of the death. It is not used
only of kings who died a peaceful death on a sickbed, but of Ahab ([Kg1
22:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#040)), who, mortally wounded in the
battle, died in the war-chariot. There is no record of Jehoiakim's
funeral obsequies or burial in 2 Kings 24, and in Chr. there is not even
mention made of his death. Three years after the first siege of
Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, and after he had become tributary to the
king of Babylon, Jehoiakim rose in insurrection, and Nebuchadnezzar sent
against him the troops of the Chaldeans, Aramaeans, Moabites, and
Ammonites. It was not till after the accession of Jehoiachin that
Nebuchadnezzar himself appeared before Jerusalem and besieged it ([Kg2
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001), and [Kg2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010)). So it is in the highest degree
probable that Jehoiakim fell in battle against the Chaldean-Syrian
armies before Jerusalem was besieged, and while the enemies were
advancing against the city; also that he was left to lie unburied
outside of Jerusalem; see on [Kg2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006), where other untenable attempts
to harmonize are discussed. The absence of direct testimony to the
fulfilment of the prophecy before us can be no ground for doubting that
it was fulfilled, when we consider the great brevity of the notices of
the last kings' reigns given by the authors of the books of Kings and
Chronicles. Graf's remark hereon is excellent: "We have a warrant for
the fulfilment of this prediction precisely in the fact that it is again
expressly recounted in Jer 36, a historical passage written certainly at
a later time ([Jer 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030) seems to
contain but a slight reference to the prediction in [Jer
22:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018), [Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030)); or, while [Jer
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#012), [Jer
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#025). tallies so completely with the
history, is [Jer 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018). to be held as
contradicting it?"

The ruin about to fall on Judah. - [Jer
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020). "Go up on Lebanon and cry, and
lift up thy voice in Bashan and cry from Abarim; for broken are all thy
lovers. [Jer 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#021). I spake to thee in
thy prosperity; thou saidst: I will not hear; that was thy way from thy
youth up, that thou hearkenedst not to my voice. [Jer
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#022). All thy shepherds the wind
shall sweep away, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; yea, then
shalt thou be put to shame and ashamed for all thy wickedness. [Jer
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023). Thou that dwellest on Lebanon
and makest thy nest on cedars, how shalt thou sigh when pangs come upon
thee, pain as of a woman in travail!" - It is the people personified as
the daughter of Zion, the collective population of Jerusalem and Judah,
that is addressed, as in [Jer 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029).
She is to lift up her wailing cry upon the highest mountains, that it
may be heard far and near. The peaks of the mountain masses that
bordered Palestine are mentioned, from which one would have a view of
the land; namely, Lebanon northwards, the mountains of Bashan ([Psa
86:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#016)) to the north-east, those of
Abarim to the south-east, amongst which was Mount Nebo, whence Moses
viewed the land of Canaan, [Num 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012);
[Deu 32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049). She is to lament because
all her lovers are destroyed. The lovers are not the kings (Ros., Ew.,
Neum. Ng.), nor the idols (Umbr.), but the allied nations (J. D. Mich.,
Maur., Hitz.), for whose favour Judah had intrigued ([Jer
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030)) - Egypt ([Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036)) and the little neighbouring
states ([Jer 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003)). All these nations
were brought under the yoke by Nebuchadnezzar, and could not longer give
Judah help ([Jer 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014); [Jer
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014)). On the form צעקי, see Ew. 41,
c.

[Jer 22:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#021)

The cause of this calamity: because Judah in its prosperity had not
hearkened to the voice of its God. שׁלות, from שׁלוה, security,
tranquillity, state of well-being free from anxiety; the plur. denotes
the peaceful, secure relations. Thus Judah had behaved from youth up,
i.e., from the time it had become the people of God and been led out of
captivity; see [Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002); [Hos
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017). - In [Jer
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#022) תּרעה is chosen for the sake of
the word-play with רעיך, and denotes to depasture, as in [Jer
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016). As the storm-wind, especially
the parching east wind, depastures, so to speak, the grass of the field,
so will the storm about to break on Judah sweep away the shepherds,
carry them off; cf. [Jer 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#024), [Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008); [Job
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021). The shepherds of the people are
not merely the kings, but all its leaders, the authorities generally, as
in [Jer 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021); and "thy shepherds" is
not equivalent to "thy lovers," but the thought is this: Neither its
allies nor its leaders will be able to help; the storm of calamity will
sweep away the former, the latter must go captive. So that there is no
need to alter רעיך into רעיך (Hitz.). With the last clause cf. [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036). Then surely will the daughter of
Zion, feeling secure in her cedar palaces, sigh bitterly. The
inhabitants of Jerusalem are said to dwell in Lebanon and to have their
nests in cedars in reference to the palaces of cedar belonging to the
great and famous, who at the coming destruction will suffer most. As to
the forms ישׁבתּי and מקנּנתּי, see on [Jer
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017). The explanation of the form
נחנתּי is disputed. Ros., Ges., and others take it for the Niph. of חנן,
with the force: to be compassionated, thus: who deserving of pity or
compassion wilt thou be! But this rendering does not give a very apt
sense, even if it were not the case that the sig. to be worthy of pity
is not approved by usage, and that it is nowhere taken from the Niph. We
therefore prefer the derivation of the word from אנץ, Niph. נאנח .hpi,
contr. ננח, a derivative founded on the lxx rendering: τὶ καταστενάξεις,
and Vulg. quomodo congemuisti. The only question that then remains is,
whether the form נחנתּ has arisen by transposition from ננחתּ, so as to
avoid the coming together of the same letter at the beginning (Ew.,
Hitz., Gr.); or whether, with Bttch. ausf. Gramm. 1124, B, it is to be
held as a reading corrupted from ננחתּי. With "pangs," etc., cf. [Jer
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021); [Jer
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024).

Against Jehoiachin or Jechoniah. - [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024). "As I live, saith Jahveh,
though Conjahu, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were a signet
ring on my right hand, yet would I pluck him thence, [Jer
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#025). And give thee into the hand of
them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art
afraid, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and
into the hand of the Chaldeans; [Jer
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#026). And will cast thee and thy
mother that bare thee into another land where ye were not born; and
there shall ye die. [Jer 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#027). And
into the land whither they lift up their soul to return, thither shall
they not return. [Jer 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028). Is this
man Conjahu a vessel despised and to be broken, or an utensil wherein
one has no pleasure? [Jer 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#029). O
land, land, land, hear the word of Jahveh! [Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030). Thus hath Jahveh said: Write
down this man as childless, as a man that hath no prosperity in his
life; for no man of his seed shall prosper that sitteth upon the throne
of David and ruleth widely over Judah."

The son and successor of Jehoiakim is called in [Kg2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006)., [Ch2
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#008)., [Jer
52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031), Jehojachin, and in [Eze
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002), Jojachin; here, [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024), [Jer
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028), and [Jer
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001), Conjahu; in [Jer
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001), Jeconjahu; and in [Jer
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020); [Jer
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004); [Jer
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002), [Est
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#006); [Ch1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016), Jeconjah. The names Jeconjahu
and abbreviated Jeconjah are equivalent to Jojachin and Jehojachin,
i.e., Jahveh will establish. Jeconjah was doubtless his original name,
and so stands in the family register, [Ch1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016), but was at his accession to the
throne changed into Jehojachin or Jojachin, to make it liker his
father's name. The abbreviation of Jeconjahu into Conjahu is held by
Hgstb. Christol. ii. p. 402, to be a change made by Jeremiah in order by
cutting off the y (will establish) to cut off the hope expressed by the
name, to make "a Jeconiah without the J, a 'God will establish' without
the will." For two reasons we cannot adopt this as the true view: 1. The
general reason, that if Jeremiah had wished to adumbrate the fate of the
three kings (Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, and Jehoiachin) by making changes in
their names, he would then have changed the name of Jehoiakim in like
manner as he did that of Jehoahaz into Shallum, and that of Jehoiachin
into Conjahu. The argument by which Hgstb. seeks to justify the
exception in the one case will not hold its own. Had Jeremiah thought it
unseemly to practise a kind of conceit, for however solemn a purpose, on
the name of the then reigning monarch, then neither could he have
ventured on the like in the case of Jehoiachin; for the present
prediction was not, as Hgstb. assumed, uttered before his accession,
but, as may be seen from the title king of Judah, [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024), after he had ascended the
throne, was actually king. Besides. 2. the name Conjahu occurs also at
[Jer 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001), in a historical heading, as
of equal dignity with Jeconjahu, [Jer
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002); [Jer
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004), etc., where a name proper only
to prophetic discourse would not have been in place. The passages in
which the prophets express the character and destiny of a person in a
name specially formed for the purpose, are of another kind. There we
have always: they shall call his name, or: his name shall be; cf. [Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016); [Isa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005); [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004); [Eze
48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035). That the name Jeconjah has not
merely the prophet's authority, is vouched for by [Ch1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015); [Est
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#006), and by the historical notices,
[Jer 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001); [Jer
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020); [Jer
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004); [Jer
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002). And the occurrence of the name
Jojachin only in 2 Kings 24; [Ch2
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001); [Jer
52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031), and [Eze
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002) is in consequence of the original
documents used by the authors of these books, where, so to speak, the
official names were made use of; whereas Jeremiah preferred the proper,
original name which the man bore as the prince-royal and son of
Jehoiakim, and which was therefore the current and best known one.

The utterance concerning Jechoniah is more distinct and decided than
that concerning Jehoiakim. With a solemn oath the Lord not only causes
to be made known to him that he is to be cast off and taken into exile,
but further, that his descendants are debarred from the throne for ever.
Nothing is said of his own conduct towards the Lord. In [Kg2
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#009) and [Ch2
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009) it is said of him that he did
that which was displeasing to the Lord, even as his father had done.
Ezekiel confirms this sentence when in [Eze
19:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005) he portrays him as a young lion
that devoured men, forced widows, and laid cities waste. The words of
Jahveh: Although Conjahu were a signet ring on my right hand, convey no
judgment as to his character, but simply mean: Although he were as
precious a jewel in the Lord's eyes as a signet ring (cf. [Hag
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023)), the Lord would nevertheless
cast him away. כּי before אם introduces the body of the oath, as in [Jer
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005), and is for rhetorical effect
repeated before the apodosis, as in [Sa2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#009); [Sa2
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#027), etc. Although he were, sc. what
he is not; not: although he is (Graf); for there is no proof for the
remark: that as being the prince set by Jahveh over His people, he has
really as close a connection with Him. Hitz.'s explanation is also
erroneous: "even if, seeking help, he were to cling so closely to me as
a ring does to the finger." A most unnatural figure, not supported by
reference to [Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006). As to אתּקנךּ,
from נתק with ן epenth., cf. Ew. 250, b. - From [Jer
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#025) on, the discourse is addressed
directly to Jechoniah, to make his rejection known to him. God will
deliver him into the hand of his enemies, whom he fears, namely, into
the hand of Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans, and cast him with his
mother into a strange land, where he shall die. The mother was called
Nehushta, [Kg2 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008), and is brought
forward in 29:2 as גּבירה. On the fulfilment of this threatening, see
[Kg2 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012), [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015); [Jer
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001); [Jer
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002). The construction הארץ is like
that of הגּפן נכריּה, [Jer 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021); and
the absence of the article from אחרת is no sufficient reason for holding
it to be a gloss (Hitz.), or for taking the article in הארץ to be a slip
caused by על הארץ, [Jer 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#027). To lift
up their souls, i.e., to direct their longings, wishes, towards a thing,
cf. [Deu 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015); [Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008), etc. - The further sentence on
Jechoniah was not pronounced after he had been carried captive, as Ng.
infers from the perfects הוּטלוּ and השׁלכוּ. The perfects are
prophetic. The question: Is this man a vessel despised and to be broken
(עצב, vas fictile)? is an expression of sympathising regret on the part
of the prophet for the unhappy fate of the king; but we may not hence
conclude that Jeremiah regarded him as better than his father. The
prophet's sympathy for his fate regarded less the person of the
unfortunate king than it did the fortunes of David's royal seed, in
that, of Jechoniah's sons, none was to sit on the throne of David ([Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030)). Ew. has excellently
paraphrased the sense: "Although there is many a sympathising heart in
the land that bitterly laments the hard fate of the dear young king, who
along with his infant children has been (? will be) dragged away, yet it
is God's unchangeable decree that neither he nor any of his sons shall
ascend the throne of David." נפוּץ, not: broken, but: that shall be
broken (cf. Ew. 335, b). Wherefore are they - he and his seed - cast
out? At his accession Jehoiachin was eighteen years old, not eight, as
by an error stands in [Ch2 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009), see
on [Kg2 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008); so that when taken
captive, he might well enough have children, or at least one son, since
his wives are expressly mentioned in the account of the captivity, [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015). That the sons mentioned in [Ch1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016) and [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017) were born to him in exile, cannot
be inferred from that passage, rightly understood, see on that passage.
The fact that no sons are mentioned in connection with the carrying
captive is simply explained by the fact that they were still infants.

[Jeremiah 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 22:29</span></span>

The land is to take the king's fate sore to heart. The triple repetition
of the summons: Land, gives it a special emphasis, and marks the
following sentence as of high importance; cf. [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004); [Eze
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032); [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003). Write him down, record him in the
family registers, as childless, i.e., as a man with whom his race
becomes extinct. This is more definitely intimated in the parallel
member, namely, that he will not have the fortune to have any of his
posterity sit on the throne of David. This does not exclude the
possibility of his having sons; it merely implies that none of them
should obtain the throne. ערירי sig. lit., solitary, forsaken. Thus a
man might well be called who has lost his children by death. Acc. to
[Ch1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016)., Jechoniah had two sons,
Zedekiah and Assir, of whom the former died childless, the second had
but one daughter; and from her and her husband, of the line of Nathan,
was born Shealtiel, who also died childless; see the expos. of [Ch1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016). Jechoniah was followed on the
throne by his uncle Mattaniah, whom Nebuchadnezzar installed under the
name of Zedekiah. He it was that rose in insurrection against the king
of Babylon, and after the capture of Jerusalem was taken prisoner while
in flight; and being carried before Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah, saw his
sons put to death before his eyes, was then made blind, thrown in
chains, and carried a prisoner to Babylon, [Kg2
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004).
