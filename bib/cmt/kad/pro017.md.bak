### [Proverbs Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 17:1</span></span>

[Pro 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md)

A comparative proverb with טוב, pairing with [Pro
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#032.md) :

Better a dry piece of bread, and quietness therewith,

Than a house full of slain beasts with unquietness.

Similar to this in form and contents are [Pro
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016.md). and [Pro
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#008.md). פּת חרבה is a piece of bread
(פת, fem., as [Pro 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#008).md) without
savoury drink (Theodotion, καθ ̓ ἑαυτόν, i.e., nothing with it), cf.
[Lev 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#010.md), a meat-offering without the
pouring out of oil. זבחים are not sacrificial gifts (Hitzig), but, as
always, slain animals, i.e., either offerings or banquets of slain
beasts; it is the old name of the שׁלמים (cf. [Exo
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#012.md); [Exo
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md); [Pro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014).md), part of which only were offered
on the altar, and part presented as a banquet; and זבח (in contradist.
to טבח, [Lev 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#002); 43:16.md) denotes
generally any kind of consecrated festival in connection with the
worship of God, [Sa1 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#029.md); cf. [Gen
31:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#054.md). "Festivals of hatred" are
festivals with hatred. מלא is part. with object.-accus.; in general מלא
forms a constructive, מלא occurs only once ([Jer
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011).md), and מלאי not at all. We have
already, [Pro 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md), remarked on the
degenerating of the shelamı̂m feasts; from this proverb it is to be
concluded that the merriment and the excitement bordering on
intoxication (cf. with Hitzig, [Sa1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#013.md) and [Sa1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003).md), such as frequently at the
Kirmsen merry-makings, brought quarrels and strife, so that the poor who
ate his dry bread in quiet peace could look on all this noise and tumult
without envy.

[Pro 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#002.md)

2 A prudent servant shall rule over the degenerate son;

And he divides the inheritance among the brethren.

Regarding the contrasts of משׂכּיל and מבישׁ, vid., at [Pro
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005.md); [Pro
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#035.md). The printed editions present
בּבן־מבישׁ in genit. connection: a son of the scandalous class, which is
admissible; but Cod. 1294 and Cod. Jaman,

(Note: The Cod. brought by Sapiir from Jemen, of which there is an
account in the preface to the edition of Isaiah by Baer and me.)

Erf. No. 2, 3, write בּבן מבישׁ (with Tsere and Munach), and that is
perhaps right, after [Pro 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005.md); [Pro
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#025.md). The futures have here also a
fut. signification: they say to what it will come. Grotius remarks, with
reference to this: manumissus tutor filiis relinquetur; יחלק tutorio
officio. But if he is a conscientious, unselfish tutor, he will not
enrich himself by property which belongs to another; and thus, though
not without provision, he is yet without an inheritance. And yet the
supplanting of the degenerate is brought about by this, that he loses
his inheritance, and the intelligent servant steps into his place. Has
one then to suppose that the master of the house makes his servant a
co-heir with his own children, and at the same time names him as his
executor? That were a bad anachronism. The idea of the διαθήκη was, at
the time when this proverb was coined, one unknown - Israelitish
iniquity knows only the intestate right of inheritance, regulated by
lineal and gradual succession. Then, if one thinks of the degenerate
son, that he is disowned by the father, but that the intelligent servant
is not rewarded during the life of his master for his true services, and
that, after the death of the master, to such a degree he possesses the
esteem and confidence of the family, that he it is who divides the
inheritance among the brethren, i.e., occupies the place amongst them of
distributor of the inheritance, not: takes a portion of the inheritance,
for חלק has not the double meaning of the Lat. participare; it means to
divide, and may, with בּ, mean "to give a part of anything" ([Job
39:17](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#017).md); but, with the accus., nothing
else than to distribute, e.g., [Jos
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#002.md), where it is to be translated:
"whose inheritance had not yet been distributed (not yet given to
them)." Jerome, haereditatem dividet; and thus all translators, from the
lxx to Luther.

[Pro 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003.md)

3 The fining-pot for silver, and the furnace for gold;

And a trier of hearts is Jahve.

An emblematical proverb, which means that Jahve is for the heart what
the smelting-pot (from צרף, to change, particularly to melt, to refine)
is for silver, and what the smelting furnace (כוּר, from כּוּר, R. כר,
to round, [Exo 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020).md) is for gold,
that Jahve is for the heart, viz., a trier (בחן, to grind, to try by
grinding, here as at [Psa 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010).md) of
their nature and their contents, for which, of the proof of metals, is
elsewhere ([Pro 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002.md); [Pro
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002.md); [Pro
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012).md) used the word (cf. בּחון, the
essay-master, [Jer 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007).md) תּכן, weigher,
or דּורשׁ, searcher ([Ch1 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009).md).
Wherever the subject spoken of is God, the searcher of hearts, the plur.
לבּות, once לבבות ecno ,, is used; the form לבבים occurs only in the
status conjunctus with the suffix. In [Pro
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021.md) there follow the two figures,
with which there is formed a priamel, as at [Pro
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#003.md), another tertium comparationis.

[Pro 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#004.md)

4 A profligate person giveth heed to perverse lips;

Falsehood listeneth to a destructive tongue.

The meaning, at all events, is, that whoever gives ear with delight to
words which are morally reprobate, and aimed at the destruction of
neighbours, thereby characterizes himself as a profligate. Though מרע is
probably not pred. but subj., yet so that what follows does not describe
the מרע (the profligate hearkens...), but stamps him who does this as a
מרע (a profligate, or, as we say: only a profligate...). מרע, for מרע,
is warranted by [Isa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#016.md), where מרע
(not מרע ton, according to which the Venet. here translates ἀπὸ κακοῦ)
is testified to not only by correct codd. and editions, but also by the
Masora (cf. Michlol 116b). הקשׁיב (from קשׁב, R. קש, to stiffen, or, as
we say, to prick, viz., the ear) is generally united with ל or אל, but,
as here and at [Pro 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012.md); [Jer
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#019.md), also with על. און, wickedness,
is the absolute contrast of a pious and philanthropic mind; הוּת, from
הוּה, not in the sense of eagerness, as [Pro
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003.md); [Pro
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#006.md), but of yawning depth, abyss,
catastrophe (vid., at [Psa 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010).md), is
equivalent to entire destruction - the two genitives denote the property
of the lips and the tongue (labium nequam, lingua perniciosa), on the
side of that which it instrumentally aims at (cf. [Psa
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#004.md); [Psa
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#004).md): practising mischief,
destructive plans. שׁקר beginning the second line is generally regarded
as the subj. parallel with מרע, as Luther, after Jerome, "A wicked man
gives heed to wicked mouths, and a false man listens willingly to
scandalous tongues." It is possible that שׁקר denotes incarnate
falsehood, as רמיּה, [Pro 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027.md),
incarnate slothfulness, cf. מרמה, [Pro
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025.md), and perhaps also [Pro
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#017.md); צדק, [Psa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002.md), תּוּשׁיּה, [Mic
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md); יצר סמוּך, [Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013.md), etc., where, without supplying
אישׁ (אנשׁי), the property stands instead of the person possession that
property. The clause, that falsehood listeneth to a deceitful tongue,
means that he who listens to it characterizes himself thereby, according
to the proverb, simile simili gaudet, as a liar. But only as a liar? The
punctuation before us, which represents מרע by Dechi as subj., or also
pred., takes שׁקר מזין as obj. with מזין as its governing word, and why
should not that be the view intended? The representation of the obj. is
an inversion less bold than [Isa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002.md);
[Isa 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md), and that על here should not
be so closely connected with the verb of hearing, as 4a lies near by
this, that הקשׁיב על is elsewhere found, but not האזין על. Jewish
interpreters, taking שׁקר as obj., try some other meaning of מזין than
auscultans; but neither זון, to approach, nor זין, to arm (Venet. ψεῦδος
ὁπλίζει), gives a meaning suitable to this place. מזין is equivalent to
מאזין. As אאזין, [Job 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#011.md), is
contracted into אזין, so must מאזין, if the character of the part. shall
be preserved, become מזין, mediated by מיזין.

[Pro 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md)

5 He that mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker;

He that rejoiceth over calamity remains not unpunished.

Line first is a variation of [Pro
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031.md). God is, according to [Pro
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002.md), the creator of the poor as well
as of the rich. The poor, as a man, and as poor, is the work of God, the
creator and governor of all things; thus, he who mocketh the poor,
mocketh Him who called him into existence, and appointed him his lowly
place. But in general, compassion and pity, and not joy (שׂמח ל,
commonly with ל, of the person, e.g., Obad. [Oba
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012.md), the usual formula for
ἐπιχαιρεκακία), is appropriate in the presence of misfortune (איד, from
אוּד, to be heavily burdened), for such joy, even if he on whom the
misfortune fell were our enemy, is a peccatum mortale, [Job
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#029.md). There is indeed a hallowed joy
at the actual revelation in history of the divine righteousness; but
this would not be a hallowed joy if it were not united with deep sorrow
over those who, accessible to no warning, have despised grace, and, by
adding sin to sin, have provoked God's anger.

[Proverbs 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 17:6</span></span>

With this verse this series of proverbs closes as it began:

A diadem of the old are children's children,

And the glory of children are their parents.

Children are a blessing from God (Ps 127-128); thus, a family circle
consisting of children and grandchildren (including great-grandchildren)
is as a crown of glory surrounding the grey-haired patriarch; and again,
children have glory and honour in their parents, for to have a man of an
honoured name, or of a blessed memory, as a father, is the most
effective commendation, and has for the son, even though he is unlike
his father, always important and beneficial consequences. In 6b a fact
of experience is expressed, from which has proceeded the rank of
inherited nobility recognised among men - one may abnegate his social
rights, but yet he himself is and remains a part of the moral order of
the world. The lxx has a distich after [Pro
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#004.md) the Vatican text places it after
[Pro 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#006.md) : "The whole world of wealth
belongs to the faithful, but to the unfaithful not even an obolus."
Lagarde supposes that ὄλος ὁ κόσμος τῶν χρημάτων is a translation of
שׁפעת יתר, instead of שׂפת יתר, 7a. But this ingenious conjecture does
not amount to the regarding of this distich as a variation of [Pro
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007.md).

[Proverbs 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 17:7</span></span>

The proverbs following, [Pro 17:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007.md),
appear to be united acrostically by the succession of the letters ש (שׂ,
שׁ) and ת.

[Pro 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007.md)

7 It does not become a fool to speak loftily,

How much less do lying lips a noble!

As at [Isa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005.md)., נבל and נדיב are
placed opposite to one another; the latter is the nobly magnanimous man,
the former the man who thinks foolishly and acts profligately, whom it
does not become to use lofty words, who thereby makes the impression of
his vulgarity so much the more repulsive (cf. [Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010).md). שּׂפת יתר (not יתר, for the
word belongs to those which retain their Pathach or Segol, in pausa) is
neither elevated (soaring) (Ewald) nor diffuse (Jo. Ernst Jungius in
Oetinger: lingua dicax ac sermonem ultra quam decorum verbis extendere
solita), rather imperative (Bertheau), better presumptuous (Hitzig)
words, properly words of superfluity, i.e., of superabundant
self-consciousness and high pretension (cf. the transitive bearing of
the Arab. watr with ὑβρίζειν, from ὑπέρ, Aryan upar, Job, p. 363).
Rightly Meri, שׂפת נאוה ושׂררה. It produces a disagreeable impression,
when a man of vulgar mind and of rude conduct, instead of keeping
himself in retirement, makes himself of importance, and weighty in a
shameless, impudent manner (cf. Ps. 12:9, where זלּוּת, vilitas, in a
moral sense); but yet more repulsive is the contrast, when a man in whom
one is justified in expecting nobility of mind, in accordance with his
life-position and calling, degrades himself by uttering deceitful words.
Regarding the אף כּי, concluding a minori ad majus, we have already
spoken at [Pro 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031.md); [Pro
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011.md). R. Ismael, in Bereschith Rabba,
at 44:8, reckons ten such conclusions a minori ad majus in the
Scriptures, but there are just as many quanto magis. The right
accentuation (e.g., in Cod. 1294) is here אף כי־לנדיב, transformed from
אף כי־לנדיב, according to Accentuationssystem, xviii. 2.

[Pro 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008.md)

8 The gift of bribery appears a jewel to its receiver;

Whitherso'er he turneth himself he acteth prudently.

How 8b is to be understood is shown by [Sa1
14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md), cf. [Jos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#007.md); the quoque se vertit, prudenter
rem agit, has accordingly in both sentences the person meant by בּעליו
as subject, not the gift (Hitzig), of which ישׂכּיל, "it maketh
prosperous," is not said, for השׂכּיל means, used only of persons,
prudent, and therefore successful, fortunate conduct. Such is said of
him who has to give (Luther): he presses through with it whithersoever
he turns. But the making of בּעיני the subj. does not accord with this:
this means gift to one who has to give, appears to open doors and
hearts, not merely as a golden key, it is truly such to him. Thus בעליו,
as at [Pro 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md), will be meant of him
to whom the present is brought, or to whom a claim thereto is given. But
שׂחד means here not the gift of seasonable liberality (Zckler), but, as
always, the gift of bribery, i.e., a gift by which one seeks to purchase
for himself ([Pro 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023).md) preference on
the part of a judge, or to mitigate the displeasure of a high lord ([Pro
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#014).md); here (for one does not let it
depend merely on the faithfulness of another to his duty) it is that by
which one seeks to secure an advantage to himself. The proverb expresses
a fact of experience. The gift of bribery, to which, as to a well-known
approved means, השּׂחד, refers, appears to him who receives and accepts
it (Targ.) as a stone of pleasantness, a charming, precious stone, a
jewel (Juwl from joie = gaudium); it determines and impels him to apply
all his understanding, in order that he may reach the goal for which it
shall be his reward. What he at first regarded as difficult, yea,
impossible, that he now prudently carries out, and brings to a
successful conclusion, wherever he turns himself, overcoming the
seemingly insurmountable hindrances; for the enticement of the gift
lifts him, as with a charm, above himself, for covetousness is a
characteristic feature of human nature - pecuniae obediunt omnia ([Ecc
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019), Vulg..md).

[Pro 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009.md)

9 He covereth transgressions who seeketh after love,

And he who always brings back a matter separateth friends.

The pred. stands first in the simple clause with the order of the words
not inverted. That מכסה פשׁע is also to be interpreted here as pred.
(cf. 19a) is shown by [Pro 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md),
according to which love covereth all transgressions. We write
מכסּה־פּשׂע with Dag. forte conjunctivum of פ (as of ב in [Eze
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006).md), and Gaja with the Sheva,
according to the Meth.-Setzung, 37; the punctuation מכסּה פּשׁע also
occurs. What the expression "to seek love" here means, is to be judged,
with Hitzig, after [Zep 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003.md); [Co1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md). It is in no case equivalent to
seek to gain the love of another, rather to seek to preserve the love of
men towards one another, but it is to be understood not after 9b, but
after [Pro 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md) : he seeks to prove
love who does not strike on the great bell when his neighbour has sinned
however grievously against him, does not in a scandal-loving manner make
much ado about it, and takes care not thereby to widen the breach
between men who stand near to one another, but endeavours by a
reconciling, soothing, rectifying influence, to mitigate the evil,
instead of making it worse. He, on the contrary, who repeats the matter
(שׁנה with ב of the obj., to come back with something, as [Pro
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011).md), i.e., turns always back again
to the unpleasant occurrence (Theodotion, δευτερῶν ἐν λόγῳ; Symmachus,
δευτερῶν λόγον, as Sir. 7:14; 19:7), divides friends (vid., [Pro
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#028).md), for he purposely fosters the
strife, the disharmony, ill-will, and estrangement which the offence
produced; while the noble man, who has love for his motive and his aim,
by prudent silence contributes to bring the offence and the division
which it occasioned into forgetfulness.

[Pro 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#010.md)

10 One reproof maketh more impression on a wise man

Than if one reckoned a hundred to the fool

One of the few proverbs which begin with a future, vid., [Pro
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#026.md). It expresses what influence
there is in one reproof with a wise man (מבין, [Pro
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#009).md); גּערה is the reproof expressed
by the post-bibl. נזיפה .lbib, as the lowest grade of disciplinary
punishment, admonitio, connected with warning. The verbal form תהת is
the reading of the lxx and Syr. (συντρίβει ἀπειλὴ καρδίαν φρονίμου) for
they read תחת גערה לב מבין, derived from חתת, and thus תּחת (from Hiph.
החת); thus Luther: reproof alarms more the intelligent, but חחת with ב
of the obj. is not Hebr.; on the contrary, the reading of the lxx is in
accordance with the usage of the language, and, besides, is suitable. It
is, however, first to be seen whether the traditional text stands in
need of this correction. As fut. Niph. תּחת, apart from the ult. accent.
to be expected, gives no meaning. Also if one derives it from חתה, to
snatch away, to take away, it gives no appropriate thought; besides, חתה
is construed with the object. accus., and the fut. Apoc., in itself
strange here, must be pointed either תּהת or תּחתּ (after יחדּ)
(Bttcher, Lehrb. ii. p. 413). Thus יחת, as at [Job
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013.md); [Jer
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md), will be fut. Kal of נחת = ינחת,
[Psa 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003) (Theodotion, Targ., Kimchi.md).
With this derivation, also, תּחת is to be expected; the reference in the
Handwrterbuch to Gesen. Lehrgebude, 51, 1, Anm. 1, where, in an
extremely inadequate way, the retrogression of the tone (נסוג אחור) is
spoken of, is altogether inappropriate to this place; and Bttcher's
explanation of the ult. tone from an intended expressiveness is
ungrammatical; but why should not תּחת, from נחת, with its first
syllable originating from contraction, and thus having the tone be Milel
as well as Milra, especially here, where it stands at the head of the
sentence? With ב connected with it, נחת means: to descend into anything,
to penetrate; Hitzig appropriately compares altius in pectus descendit
of Sallust, Jug. 11. Jerome rightly, according to the sense: plus
proficit, and the Venet. ἀνεῖ (read ὀνεῖ) ἀπειλὴ τῷ συνίοντι. In 10b
מכּה (cf. [Deu 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003.md); [Co2
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024).md) is to be supplied to מאה, not
פאמים (an hundred times, which may be denoted correctly by מאה as well
as מאת, [Ecc 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012).md). With the wise
(says a Talmudic proverb) a sign does as much as with the fool a stick
does. Zehner, in his Adagia sacra (1601), cites Curtius (vii. 4):
Nobilis equus umbra quoque virgae regitur, ignavus ne calcari quidem
concitari potest.

[Proverbs 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 17:11</span></span>

Five proverbs of dangerous men against whom one has to be on his guard:

11 The rebellious seeketh only after evil,

And a cruel messenger is sent out against him.

It is a question what is subj. and what obj. in 11a. It lies nearest to
look on מרי as subj., and this word (from מרה, stringere, to make
oneself exacting against any, to oppose, ἀντιτείνειν) is appropriate
thereto; it occurs also at [Eze 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007.md) as
abstr. pro concreto. That it is truly subj. appears from this, that
בּקּשׁ רע, to seek after evil (cf. [Pro
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#010.md); [Kg1
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#007), etc..md), is a connection of idea
much more natural than בּקּשׁ מרי to seek after rebellion. Thus אך will
be logically connected with רע, and the reading אך מרי will be preferred
to the reading אך־מרי; אך (corresponding to the Arab. âinnama) belongs
to those particles which are placed before the clause, without referring
to the immediately following part of the sentence, for they are much
more regarded as affecting the whole sentence (vid., [Pro
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010).md): the rebellious strives after
nothing but only evil. Thus, as neut. obj. רע is rendered by the Syr.,
Targ., Venet., and Luther; on the contrary, the older Greek translators
and Jerome regard רע as the personal subject. If now, in reference to
rebellion, the discourse is of a מלאך אכזרי, we are not, with Hitzig, to
think of the demon of wild passions unfettered in the person of the
rebellious, for that is a style of thought and of expression that is
modern, not biblical; but the old unpoetic yet simply true remark
remains: Loquendi formula inde petita quod regis aut summi magistratus
minister rebelli supplicium nunciat infligitque. מלאך is n. officii, not
naturae. Man as a messenger, and the spiritual being as messenger, are
both called מלאך. Therefore one may not understand מלאך אכזרי, with the
lxx, Jerome, and Luther, directly and exclusively of an angel of
punishment. If one thinks of Jahve as the Person against whom the
rebellion is made, then the idea of a heavenly messenger lies near,
according to [Psa 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md)., [Psa
78:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#049.md); but the proverb is so meant,
that it is not the less true if an earthly king sends out against a
rebellious multitude a messenger with an unlimited commission, or an
officer against a single man dangerous to the state, with strict
directions to arrest him at all hazards. אכזרי we had already at [Pro
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010.md); the root קש חש means, to be
dry, hard, without feeling. The fut. does not denote what may be done
(Bertheau, Zckler), which is contrary to the parallelism, the order of
the words, and the style of the proverb, but what is done. And the
relation of the clause is not, as Ewald interprets it, "scarcely does
the sedition seek out evil when an inexorable messenger is sent."
Although this explanation is held by Ewald as "unimprovable," yet it is
incorrect, because אך in this sense demands, e.g., [Gen
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#003.md), the perf. (strengthened by the
infin. intensivus). The relation of the clause is, also, not such as
Bttcher has interpreted it: a wicked man tries only scorn though a stern
messenger is sent against him, but not because such a messenger is
called אכזרי, against whom this "trying of scorn" helps nothing, so that
it is not worth being spoken of; besides, שׁלּח or משׁלּח would have
been used if this relation had been intended. We have in 11a and 11b, as
also e.g., at [Pro 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#024.md); [Pro
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001.md), two clauses standing in internal
reciprocal relation, but syntactically simply co-ordinated; the force
lies in this, that a messenger who recognises no mitigating
circumstances, and offers no pardon, is sent out against such an one.

12 Meet a bear robbed of one of her whelps,

Only not a fool in his folly.

The name of the bear, as that of the cow, [Job
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#010.md); [Psa
144:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#014.md), preserves its masculine form,
even when used in reference to sexual relationship (Ewald, 174b); the
ursa catulis orbata is proverbially a raging beast. How the abstract
expression of the action פּגושׁ \[to meet\], here as e.g., [Psa
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md), with the subj. following, must
sound as finite (occurrat, may always meet), follows from ואל =
ואל־יפגּשׁ (non autem occurrat). פּגושׁ has on the last syllable
Mehuppach, and Zinnorith on the preceding open syllable (according to
the rule, Accentssystem, vi. 5d).

(Note: In the Torath Emeth, p. 18, the word is irregularly represented
as Milel - a closed syllable with Cholem can suffer no retrogression of
the tone.)

שׁכּוּל, in the state of his folly, i.e., when he is in a paroxysm of
his anger, corresponds with the conditional noun-adjective שׁכּוּל, for
folly morbidly heightened is madness (cf. [Hos
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007); Psychol. p. 291f..md).

20:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#022).md). Instead of תמישׁ, the Kerı̂
reads תמוּשׁ; but that this verb, with a middle vowel, may be 'י'ע as
well as 'ו'ע, [Psa 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002.md) shows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 17:14</span></span>

14 As one letteth out water is the beginning of a strife;

But cease thou from such strife ere it comes to showing teeth.

The meaning of this verb פּטר is certain: it means to break forth; and
transitively, like Arab. faṭr, to bring forth from a cleft, to make to
break forth, to let go free (Theodotion, ἀπολύων; Jerome, dimittit;
Venet. ἀφιείς). The lxx, since it translates by ἐξουσίαν δίδωσι, thinks
on the juristic signification, which occurs in the Chronicles: to make
free, or to declare so; but here פּוטר מים (vid., regarding the Metheg
at [Pro 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031).md) is, as Luther
translates, one who tears away the dam from the waters. And ראשׁית מדון
is not accus. dependent on פוטר, to be supplied (Hitzig: he unfetters
water who the beginning of strife, viz., unfetters); but the part. is
used as at [Pro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017.md) : one who
unfetters the water is the beginning of strife, i.e., he is thus related
to it as when one... This is an addition to the free use of the part. in
the language of the Mishna, where one would expect the infin., e.g.,
בּזורע (= בּזרע), if one sows, בּמזיד (= בּזדון), of wantonness. It is
thus unnecessary, with Ewald, to interpret פוטר as neut., which lets
water go = a water-outbreak; פוטר is meant personally; it represents one
who breaks through a water-dam, withdraws the restraint of the water,
opens a sluice, and then emblematically the proverb says: thus
conditioned is the beginning of a strife. Then follows the warning to
let go such strife (הריב, with the article used in the more elevated
style, not without emphasis), to break from it, to separate it from
oneself ere it reach a dangerous height. This is expressed by לפני
התגּלּע, a verb occurring only here and at [Pro
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001.md); [Pro
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#003.md), always in the Hithpa. The Targum
(misunderstood by Gesenius after Buxtorf; vid., to the contrary, Levy,
under the word צדי II) translates it at [Pro
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001.md); [Pro
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#003.md), as the Syr., by "to mock," also
Aquila, who has at [Pro 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#003.md),
ἐξυβρισθήσεται, and the lxx at [Pro
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001.md), ἐπονείδιστος ἔσται, and Jerome,
who has this in all the three passages, render the Hithpa. in this
sense, passively. In this passage before us, the Targ., as Hitzig gives
it, translates, "before it heats itself," but that is an error
occasioned by Buxtorf; vid., on the contrary, Levy, under the word קריא
(κύριος); this translation, however, has a representative in Haja Gaon,
who appeals for גלע, to glow, to Nidda viii. 2.

(Note: Vid., Simon Nascher's Der Gaon Haja u. seine giest. Thtig. p.
15.)

Elsewhere the lxx, at [Pro 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#003.md),
συμπλέκεται (where Jerome, with the amalgamation of the two
significations, miscentur contumeliis); Kimchi and others gloss it by
התערב, and, according to this, the Venet. translates, πρὸ τοῦ συνχυθῆναι
(τὴν ἔριν); Luther, "before thou art mingled therein." But all these
explanations of the word: insultare, excandescere, and commisceri, are
etymologically inadmissible. Bertheau's and Zckler's "roll itself forth"
is connected at least with a meaning rightly belonging to the R. גל. But
the Arab. shows, that not the meaning volvere, but that of retegere is
to be adopted. Aruch

(Note: Vid., p. 109, note.)

for Nidda viii. 2 refers to the Arab., where a wound is designated as
יכולה להגּלע ולהוציא דם, i.e., as breaking up, as it were, when the
crust of that which is nearly healed is broken off (Maimuni glosses the
word by להתקלף, were uncrusted), and blood again comes forth. The
meaning retegere requires here, however, another distinction. The
explanation mentioned there by Aruch: before the strife becomes public
to thee, i.e., approaches thee, is not sufficient. The verbal stem גלע
is the stronger power of גלה, and means laying bare; but here, not as
there, in the Mishna of a wound covered with a crust. The Arab. jal'
means to quarrel with another, properly to show him the teeth, the Pol
or the tendency-stem from jali'a, to have the mouth standing open, so
that one shows his teeth; and the Syr. glaṣ, with its offshoots and
derivatives, has also this meaning of ringi, opening the mouth to show,
i.e., to make bare the teeth. Schultens has established this explanation
of the words, and Gesenius further establishes it in the Thesaurus,
according to which Fleischer also remarks, "גלע, of showing the teeth,
the exposing of the teeth by the wide opening of the mouth, as happens
in bitter quarrels." But הריב does not agree with this. Hitzig's
translation, "before the strife shows its teeth," is as modern as in
[Pro 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#011.md) is the passion of the
unfettered demon, and Fleischer's prius vero quam exacerbetur rixa
renders the Hithpa. in a sense unnecessarily generalized for [Pro
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001.md) and [Pro
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#003.md). The accentuation, which
separates להתגלע from הריב by Rebia Mugrash, is correct. One may
translate, as Schultens, antequam dentes stringantur, or, since the
Hithpa. has sometimes a reciprocal signification, e.g., [Gen
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md); [Psa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#008.md) : ere one reciprocally shows his
teeth, Hitzig unjustly takes exception to the inversion הריב נטושׁ. Why
should not the object precede, as at [Hos
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md) :15, the נטוש, placed with
emphasis at the end? The same inversion for a like reason occurs at [Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006.md).

[Proverbs 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 17:15</span></span>

15 He that acquitteth the guilty and condemneth the righteous -

An abomination to Jahve are they both.

The proverb is against the partisan judge who is open to bribery, like
[Pro 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#024.md), cf. [Isa
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023.md), where, with reference to such,
the announcement of punishment is emphatically made. רשׁע and צדּיק, in
a forensic sense, are equivalent to sons (reus) and insons. גּם (cf. the
Arab. jmy'na, altogether, but particularly the Pers. ham and the Turkish
dkhy standing wholly thus in the numeral) is here, as at [Gen
27:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#045.md), equivalent to יחדּיו, [Jer
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#012) (in its unions = united.md).
Whoever pronounces sentence of justification on the guilty, appears as
if he must be judged more mildly than he who condemns the guiltless, but
both the one and the other alike are an abhorrence to God.

[Proverbs 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 17:16</span></span>

We take [Pro 17:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016.md) together. This
group beings with a proverb of the heartless, and ends with one of the
perverse-hearted; and between these there are not wanting noticeable
points of contact between the proverbs that follow one another.

[Pro 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016.md)

16 Why the ready money in the hand of the fool;

To get wisdom when he has yet no heart?

The question is made pointed by זה, thus not: why the ready money
when...? Is it to obtain wisdom? - the whole is but one question, the
reason of which is founded in לבו אין (thus to be accented with Mugrash
going before).

(Note: If we write ולב־ with Makkeph, then we have to accentuate לקנות
חכמה with Tarcha Munach, because the Silluk word in this writing has not
two syllables before the tone. This sequence of accents if found in the
Codd. Ven. 1521, 1615, Basel 1619, while most editions have לקנות חכמה
ולב־אין, which is false. But according to MSS we have ולב without
Makkeph, and that is right according to the Makkeph rules of the
metrical Accentuationssystem; vid., Torath Emeth, p. 40.)

The fool, perhaps, even makes some endeavours, for he goes to the school
of the wise, to follow out their admonitions, קנה חכמה ([Pro
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#005), etc..md), and it costs him something
([Pro 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#007).md), but all to no purpose, for
he has no heart. By this it is not meant that knowledge, for which he
pays his honorarium, remains, it may be, in his head, but goes not to
his heart, and thus becomes an unfruitful theory; but the heart is
equivalent to the understanding, in the sense in which the heart appears
as the previous condition to the attainment of wisdom ([Pro
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#015).md), and as something to be gained
before all ([Pro 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#032).md), viz.,
understanding, as the fitting intellectual and practical habitus to the
reception, the appropriation, and realization of wisdom, the ability
rightly to comprehend the fulness of the communicated knowledge, and to
adopt it as an independent possession, that which the Greek called νοῦς,
as in that "golden proverb" of Democrates: πολλοὶ πολυμαθέες νοῦν οὐκ
ἔχουσι, or as in [Luk 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025.md), where it
is said that the Lord opened τὸν νοῦν of His disciples to understand the
Scriptures. In the lxx a distich follows [Pro
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016.md), which is made up of 19b and
20b, and contains a varied translation of these two lines.

[Pro 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017.md)

17 At all times the right friend shows himself loving;

And as a brother is he born for adversity.

Brother is more than friend, he stands to one nearer than a friend does,
[Psa 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014.md); but the relation of a
friend may deepen itself into a spiritual, moral brotherhood, [Psa
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024.md), and there is no name of friend
that sounds dearer than אחי, [Sa2
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#026.md). 17a and 17b are, according to
this, related to each other climactically. The friend meant in 17a is a
true friend. Of no other is it said that he loves בּכל־עת, i.e., makes
his love manifest; and also the article in הרע not only here gives to
the word more body, but stamps it as an ideal-word: the friend who
corresponds to the idea of such an one.

(Note: The Arab. grammarians say that the article in this case stands,
l'astfrâgh khsânas âljnas, as an exhaustive expression of all essential
properties of the genus, i.e., to express the full ideal realization of
the idea in that which is named.)

The inf. of the Hiph., in the sense "to associate" (Ewald), cannot
therefore be הרע, because רע is not derived from רעע, but from רעה. Thus
there exists no contrast between 17a and 17b, so that the love of a
friend is thought of, in contradistinction to that of a brother, as
without permanency (Fl.); but 17b means that the true friend shows
himself in the time of need, and that thus the friendship becomes
closer, like that between brothers. The statements do not refer to two
kinds of friends; this is seen from the circumstance that אח has not the
article, as הרע has. It is not the subj. but pred., as אדם, [Job
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012.md) : sooner is a wild ass born or
born again as a man. The meaning of הוּלד there, as at [Psa
87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005.md)., borders on the notion of
regenerari; here the idea is not essentially much less, for by the
saying that the friend is born in the time of need, as a brother, is
meant that he then for the first time shows himself as a friend, he
receives the right status or baptism of such an one, and is, as it were,
born into personal brotherly relationship to the sorely-tried friend.
The translation comprobatur (Jerome) and erfunden \[is found out\]
(Luther) obliterates the peculiar and thus intentional expression, for
נולד is not at all a metaphor used for passing into the light - the two
passages in Proverbs and in Job have not their parallel. לצרה is not
equivalent to בּצרה (cf. [Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md);
[Psa 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001).md), for the interchange of the
prep. in 17a and 17b would then be without any apparent reason. But
Hitzig's translation also: as a brother he is born of adversity, is
impossible, for ל after נודל and ילּד always designates that for which
the birth is an advantage, not that from which it proceeds. Thus ל will
be that of the purpose: for the purpose of the need, - not indeed to
suffer ([Job 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007).md) on account of it,
but to bear it in sympathy, and to help to bear it. Rightly Fleischer:
frater autem ad aerumnam (sc. levandam et removendam) nascitur. The lxx
gives this sense to the ל: ἀδελφοὶ δὲ ἐν ἀνάγκαις χρήσιμοι ἔστωσαν,
τοῦτο γὰρ χάριν γεννῶνται.

[Pro 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018.md)

18 A man void of understanding is he who striketh hands,

Who becometh surety with his neighbour.

Cf. [Pro 6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md), where the warning
against suretyship is given at large, and the reasons for it are
adduced. It is incorrect to translate (Gesen., Hitzig, and others) לפני
רעהוּ, with the lxx, Jerome, the Syr., Targ., and Luther, "for his
neighbour;" to become surety for any one is ערב ל, [Pro
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md), or, with the object. accus. [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015.md), another suitable prep. is בּעד;
but לפני never means pro (ὑπέρ), for at [Sa1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#016.md) it means "to the person," and
[Sa2 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#031.md), "before Abner's corpse
(bier)." רעהוּ is thus here the person with whom the suretyship is
entered into; he can be called the רע of him who gives bail, so much the
more as the reception of the bail supposes that both are well known to
each other. Here also Fleischer rightly translates: apud alterum (sc.
creditorem pro debitore).

[Pro 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019.md)

19 He loveth sin who loveth strife;

He who maketh high his doors seeketh destruction.

A synthetic distich. Bttcher finds the reason of the pairing of these
two lines in the relationship between a mouth and a door (cf. [Mic
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#006), פּתחי פיך.md). Hitzig goes further,
and supposes that 19b figuratively expresses what boastfulness brings
upon itself. Against Geier, Schultens, and others, who understand פּתחו
directly of the mouth, he rightly remarks that הגדּיל פה is not heard
of, and that הגדּיל פה taht dn would be used instead. But the two lines
harmonize, without this interchangeable reference of os and ostium.
Zanksucht \[quarrelsomeness\] and Prunksucht \[ostentation\] are related
as the symptoms of selfishness. But both bear their sentence in
themselves. He who has pleasure in quarrelling has pleasure in evil, for
he commits himself to the way of great sinning, and draws others along
with him; and he who cannot have the door of his house high enough and
splendid enough, prepares thereby for himself, against his will, the
destruction of his house. An old Hebrew proverb says, כל העוסק בבנין
יתמסכן, aedificandi nimis studiosus ad mendicitatem redigitur. Both
parts of this verse refer to one and the same individual, for the
insanum aedificandi studium goes only too often hand in hand with unjust
and heartless litigation.

[Pro 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020.md)

20 He that is of a false heart findeth no good;

And he that goeth astray with his tongue falleth into evil.

Regarding עקּשׁ־לב, vid., [Pro 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#020.md).
In the parallel member, נהפּך בּלשׁונו is he who twists or winds (vid.,
at [Pro 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012).md) with his tongue, going
about concealing and falsifying the truth. The phrase ונהפּך (the
connecting form before a word with a prep.) is syntactically possible,
but the Masora designates the word, in contradistinction to ונהפּך,
pointed with Pathach, [Lev 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#016.md), with
לית as unicum, thus requires ונהפּך, as is also found in Codd. The
contrast of רעה is here טוב, also neut., as [Pro
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#021.md), cf. [Pro
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#020.md), and רע, [Pro
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017.md).

[Pro 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021.md)

The first three parts of the old Solomonic Book of Proverbs ((1) Prov
10-12; (2) 13:1-15:19; (3) 15:20-17:20) are now followed by the fourth
part. We recognise it as striking the same keynote as [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md). In [Pro
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021.md) it resounds once more, here
commencing a part; there, [Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md),
beginning the second group of proverbs. The first closes, as it begins,
with a proverb of the fool.

21 He that begetteth a fool, it is to his sorrow;

And the father of a fool hath no joy.

It is admissible to supply ילדו, developing itself from ילד, before
לתוּגה לו (vid., regarding this passive formation, at [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md), cf. [Pro
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013).md), as at [Isa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md), מעלה (Fl.: in maerorem sibi
genuit h. e. ideo videtur genuisse ut sibi maerorem crearet); but not
less admissible is it to interpret לתוגה לו as a noun-clause
corresponding to the ולא־ישׂמח (thus to be written with Makkeph): it
brings grief to him. According as one understands this as an
expectation, or as a consequence, ילד, as at [Pro
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#024.md), is rendered either qui gignit
or qui genuit. With נבל, seldom occurring in the Book of Proverbs (only
here and at [Pro 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007).md), כּסיל,
occurring not unfrequently, is interchanged. Schultens rightly defines
the latter etymologically: marcidus h. e. qui ad virtutem, pietatem,
vigorem omnem vitae spiritualis medullitus emarcuit; and the former:
elumbis et mollitie segnitieve fractus, the intellectually heavy and
sluggish (cf. Arab. kasal, laziness; kaslân, the lazy).

(Note: Nldeke's assertion (Art. Orion in Schenkel's Bibel-Lexicon) that
the Arab. kasal corresponds to the Hebr. כּשׁל proceeds from the twofold
supposition, that the meaning to be lazy underlies the meaning to totter
(vid., also Dietrich in Gesenius' Heb. Wrterbuch), and that the Hebr. ס
must correspond with the Arab. š. The former supposition is untenable,
the latter is far removed (cf. e.g., כּסּא and kursı̂, ספר and sifr,
מסכּן and miskı̂n). The verb כּשׁל, Aram. תּקל, is unknown in the Arab.)

22 A joyful heart bringeth good recovery;

And a broken spirit drieth the bones.

The heart is the centre of the individual life, and the condition and
the tone of the heart communicates itself to this life, even to its
outermost circumference; the spirit is the power of self-consciousness
which, according as it is lifted up or broken, also lifts up or breaks
down the condition of the body (Psychol. p. 199), vid., the similar
contrasted phrases לב שׂמח and רוּח נכאה, [Pro
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013.md). The ἄπ. λεγ. גּהה (here and
there in Codd. incorrectly written גּיהה) has nothing to do with the
Arab. jihat, which does not mean sight, but direction, and is formed
from wjah (whence wajah, sight), like עדה, congregation, from ועד (יעד).
The Syr., Targ. (perhaps also Symmachus: ἀγαθύνει ἡλικίαν; Jerome:
aetatem floridam facit; Luther: makes the life lstig \[cheerful\])
translate it by body; but for this גּוה (גּויּה) is used, and that is a
word of an entirely different root from גּהה. To what verb this refers
is shown by [Hos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md) : ולא־יגהה מכּם
מזור, and healed not for you her ulcerous wound. מזור is the compress,
i.e., the bandage closing up the ulcer, then also the ulcer-wound
itself; and גּהה is the contrary of עלה, e.g., [Jer
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022.md); it means the removing of the
bandage and the healing of the wound. This is confirmed by the Syr. gho,
which in like manner is construed with min, and means to be delivered
from something (vid., Bernstein's Lex. Syr. to Kirsch's Chrestomathie).
The Aethiop. quadriliteral gâhgěh, to hinder, to cause to cease,
corresponds to the causative Syr. agahish. Accordingly גּהה means to be
in the condition of abatement, mitigation, healing; and גּהה (as synonym
of כּהה, [Neh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#019.md), with which Parchon
combines it), levamen, levatio, in the sense of bodily healing (lxx
εὐεκτεῖν ποιεῖ; Venet., after Kimchi, ἀγαθυνεῖ θεραπείαν); and היטיב
גּהה (cf. [Pro 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002).md) denotes, to bring
good improvement, to advance powerfully the recovery. Schultens compares
the Arab. jahy, nitescere, disserenari, as Menahem has done ננהּ, but
this word is one of the few words which are explained exclusively from
the Syriac (and Aethiop.). גּרם (here and at [Pro
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#015).md) is the word interchanging with
עצם, [Pro 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030.md); [Pro
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024.md).

23 Bribery from the bosom the godless receiveth,

To pervert the ways of justice.

Regarding שׂחד, vid., [Pro 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008.md). The
idea of this word, as well as the clause containing the purpose, demand
for the רשׁע a high judicial or administrative post. The bosom, חק
(חיק), is, as [Pro 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#023.md), that of the
clothing. From the bosom, מחק, where it was kept concealed, the gift is
brought forth, and is given into the bosom, בּחק, [Pro
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#014.md), of him whose favour is to be
obtained - an event taking place under four eyes, which purposely
withdraws itself from the observation of any third person. Since this is
done to give to the course of justice a direction contrary to rectitude,
the giver of the bribe has not right on his side; and, under the
circumstances, the favourable decision which he purchases may be at once
the unrighteous sentence of a צדיק, accusing him, or accused by him,
[Pro 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005.md).

[Proverbs 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 17:24</span></span>

24 The understanding has his attention toward wisdom;

But the eyes of a fool are on the end of the earth.

Many interpreters explain, as Euchel:

"The understanding finds wisdom everywhere;

The eyes of the fool seek it at the end of the world."

Ewald refers to [Deu 30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011.md) as an
unfolding of the same thought. But although it may be said of the fool
(vid., on the contrary, [Pro 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#014).md)
that he seeks wisdom, only not at the right place, as at [Pro
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#006.md), of the mocker that he seeks
wisdom but in vain, yet here the order of the words, as well as the
expression, lead us to another thought: before the eyes of the
understanding את־פּניע, as [Gen 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018.md);
[Sa1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011.md), and frequently in the
phrase 'את־פני ה, e.g., [Sa1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#022).md)
wisdom lies as his aim, his object, the end after which he strives; on
the contrary, the eyes of the fool, without keeping that one necessary
thing in view, wander in alia omnia, and roam about what is far off,
without having any fixed object. The fool is everywhere with his
thoughts, except where he ought to be. Leaving out of view that which
lies nearest, he loses himself in aliena. The understanding has an ever
present theme of wisdom, which arrests his attention, and on which he
concentrates himself; but the fool flutters about fantastically from one
thing to another, and that which is to him precisely of least importance
interests him the most.

[Proverbs 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 17:25</span></span>

The series of proverbs, v. 25-18:2, begins and closes in the same way as
the preceding, and only [Pro 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026.md)
stands by itself without apparent connection.

This verse begins connecting itself with [Pro
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021.md) :

A grief to his father is a foolish son,

And a bitter woe for her that bare him.

The ἅπ. λεγ. ממר is formed from מרר (to be bitter, properly harsh), as
מכס from כּסס. The Syr. and Targ. change the subst. into participles;
some codd. also have ממר (after the forms מחל, מסב, מפר, מרע), but as
may be expected in 25a, מבעיס. The dat. obj. instead of the accus. may
be possible; the verse immediately following furnishes a sufficient
example of this.

[Proverbs 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 17:26</span></span>

26 Also to inflict punishment on the righteous is not good;

This, that one overthrows the noble on account of his rectitude.

Does the גּם \[also\] refer to a connection from which the proverb is
separated? or is it tacitly supposed that there are many kinds of
worthless men in the world, and that one from among them is brought
forward? or is it meant, that to lay upon the righteous a pecuniary
punishment is also not good? None of all these. The proverb must have a
meaning complete in itself; and if pecuniary punishment and corporeal
punishment were regarded as opposed to one another, 26b would then have
begun with אף כּי (quanto magis percutere ingenuos). Here it is with גם
as at [Pro 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#011.md), and as with אך at
11a, and רק at [Pro 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#010.md) : according
to the sense, it belongs not to the word next following, but to לצּדּיק;
and ענשׁ (whence inf. ענושׁ, as [Pro
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011.md), with the ǎ in ע, cf. also עבד,
[Pro 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#010), for אבד.md) means here not
specially to inflict a pecuniary fine, but generally to punish, for, as
in mulctare, the meaning is generalized, elsewhere with the accus., [Deu
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#019.md), here to give to any one to
undergo punishment. The ruler is the servant of God, who has to preserve
rectitude, εἰς ὀργὴν τῷ τὸ κακὸν πράσσοντι ([Rom
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014).md). It is not good when he makes
his power to punish to be felt by the innocent as well as by the guilty.

In 26b, instead of הכּות, the proverb is continued with להכּות; לא־טוב,
which is to be supplied, takes the inf. alone when it precedes, and the
inf. with ל when it follows, [Pro
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005.md); [Pro
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021.md); [Pro
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009.md) (but cf. [Pro
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#019).md). הכּות is the usual word for
punishment by scourging, [Deu 25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001.md),
cf. [Co2 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024.md), N.T. μαστιγοῦν,
δίρειν, Rabb. מכּות, strokes, or מלקוּת from לקה, vapulare, to receive
stripes. נדיבים are here those noble in disposition. The idea of נדיב
fluctuates between generosus in an outward and in a moral sense,
wherefore על־ישׁר, or rather עלי־ישׁר, is added; for the old editions,
correct MSS, and e.g., also Soncin. 1488, present עלי (vid., Norzi).
Hitzig incorrectly explains this, "against what is due" (ישׁר, as [Pro
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024).md); also [Psa
94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020.md), עלי־חק does not mean κατὰ
προστάγματος (Symmachus), but ἐπὶ προστάγματι (lxx and Theod.), on the
ground of right = praetextu juris (Vatabl.). Thus עלי־ישׁר means here
neither against nor beyond what is due, but: on the ground of honourable
conduct, making this (of course mistakenly) a lawful title to
punishment; Aquila, ἐπὶ εὐθύτητι, cf. [Mat
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010.md), ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης. Besides, for
על after הכּה, the causal signification lies nearest [Num
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#032.md), cf. [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005) (על־מה, on account of anything.md).
If the power of punishment is abused to the punishing of the righteous,
yea, even to the corporeal chastisement of the noble, and their
straight, i.e., conscientious, firm, open conduct, is made a crime
against them, that is not good - it is perversion of the idea of
justice, and an iniquity which challenges the penal rectitude of the
Most High ([Ecc 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007) \[8\].md).

[Proverbs 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 17:27</span></span>

27 He that keepeth his words to himself hath knowledge,

And the cool of temper is a man of understanding.

The first line here is a variation of [Pro
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#019.md). The phrase ידע דּעת (here and
at [Dan 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004).md) means to possess
knowledge (novisse); more frequently it is בּינה ידע, e.g., [Pro
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001.md), where ידע has the inchoative
sense of noscere. In 27b the Kerı̂ is יקר־רוח. Jerome translates it
pretiosi spiritus, the Venet. τίμιος τὸ πνεῦμα. Rashi glosses יקר here,
as at [Sa1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md), by מנוע (thus to be
read after codd.), retentus spiritu; most interpreters remark that the
spirit here comes into view as expressing itself in words. It is
scarcely correct to say that יקר דּברים could designate one who is
sparing in his words, but יקר־רוּח is, according to the fundamental
conception of the verb יקר, gravis spiritu (Schultens), of a dignified,
composed spirit; it is a quiet seriousness proceeding from high
conscientiousness, and maintaining itself in self-control, which is
designated by this word. But the Chethı̂b וקר־רוּח presents almost the
same description of character. קר from קרר (of the same root as יקר)
means to be firm, unmoveable, καρτερὸν εἶναι, hence to be congealed,
frozen, cold (cf. frigus with rigere, rigor), figuratively to be
cold-blooded, passionless, quiet, composed (Fl.); cf. post-bibl. קרת
רוּח (Arab. ḳurrat‛ain), cooling = refreshing, ἀνάψυξις ([Act
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020).md).

(Note: "He has made my eye glowing" (askhn, cf. שׁחין) is in Arab.
equivalent to "he has deeply troubled me." The eye of the benevolent is
bârid, and in the Semitic manner of expression, with deep psychological
significance, it is said that the tears of sorrow are hot, but those of
joy cold.)

Whether we read יקר or קר, in any case we are not to translate rarus
spiritu, which, apart from the impossibility of the expression, makes
27b almost a tautological repetition of the thought of 27a. The first
line recommends bridling of the tongue, in contrast to inconsiderate and
untimely talk; the second line recommends coldness, i.e., equanimity of
spirit, in contrast to passionate heat.

[Proverbs 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 17:28</span></span>

Ver. 28 continues the same theme, the value of silence:

Even a fool, when he keeps silence, is counted wise;

When he shutteth his mouth, discreet.

The subj. as well as the pred. of the first line avail for the second.
אטם, obturare, occludere, usually of the closing the ear, is here
transferred to the mouth. The Hiph. החרישׁ means mutum agere (cf. Arab.
khrs, mutum esse), from חרשׁ, which, like κωφός, passes from the meaning
surdus to that of mutus (Fl.). The words of [Job
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#005.md), and also those of Alexander: si
tacuisses sapiens mansisses, are applicable to fools. An Arab. proverb
says, "silence is the covering of the stupid." In the epigrammatical
hexameter,

πᾶς τις ἀπαίδευτος φρονιμώτατός ἐστι σιωπῶν,

the word σιωπῶν has the very same syntactical position as these two
participles.

(Note: Cf. C. Schultze's Die bibl. Sprichwrter (1860), p. 60f.)
