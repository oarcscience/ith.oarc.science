### [Numbers Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 7:1</span></span>

Presentation of Dedicatory Gifts by the Princes of the Tribes. - [Num
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md). This presentation took place at
the time (יום) when Moses, after having completed the erection of the
tabernacle, anointed and sanctified the dwelling and the altar, together
with their furniture ([Lev 8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010).md).
Chronologically considered, this ought to have been noticed after [Lev
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010.md). But in order to avoid
interrupting the connection of the Sinaitic laws, it is introduced for
the first time at this point, and placed at the head of the events which
immediately preceded the departure of the people from Sinai, because
these gifts consisted in part of materials that were indispensably
necessary for the transport of the tabernacle during the march through
the desert. Moreover, there was only an interval of at the most forty
days between the anointing of the tabernacle, which commenced after the
first day of the first month (cf. [Exo
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#016.md) and [Lev
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010).md), and lasted eight days, and the
departure from Sinai, on the twentieth day of the second month ([Num
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011).md), and from this we have to
deduct six days for the Passover, which took place before their
departure ([Num 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001)..md); and it was
within this period that the laws and ordinances from Lev 11 to Num 6 had
to be published, and the dedicatory offerings to be presented. Now, as
the presentation itself was distributed, according to [Num
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#011.md)., over twelve or thirteen days,
we may very well assume that it did not entirely precede the publication
of the laws referred to, but was carried on in part contemporaneously
with it. The presentation of the dedicatory gifts of one tribe-prince
might possibly occupy only a few hours of the day appointed for the
purpose; and the rest of the day, therefore, might very conveniently be
made use of by Moses for publishing the laws. In this case the short
space of a month and a few days would be amply sufficient for everything
that took place.

[Numbers 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 7:2</span></span>

The presentation of six waggons and twelve oxen for the carriage of the
materials of the tabernacle is mentioned first, and was no doubt the
first thing that took place. The princes of Israel, viz., the heads of
the tribe-houses (fathers' houses), or princes of the tribes (see [Num
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#004)..md), "those who stood over those
that were numbered," i.e., who were their leaders or rulers, offered as
their sacrificial gift six covered waggons and twelve oxen, one ox for
each prince, and a waggon for every two. צב עגלת, ἁμάξας λαμπηνίκας
(lxx), i.e., according to Euseb. Emis., two-wheeled vehicles, though the
Greek scholiasts explain λαμπήνη as signifying ἅμαξα περιφανής, βασιλικὴ
and ῥέδιον περιφανὲς ὁ ἐστὶν ἅρμα σκεπαστόν (cf. Schleussner, Lex. in
lxx s.v.), and Aquila, ἅμαξαι σκεπασταί, i.e., plaustra tecta (Vulg. and
Rabb.). The meaning "litters," which Gesenius and De Wette support, can
neither be defended etymologically, nor based upon צבּים in [Isa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md).

[Numbers 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 7:4</span></span>

At the command of God, Moses received them to apply them to the purposes
of the tabernacle, and handed them over to the Levites, "to every one
according to the measure of his service," i.e., to the different classes
of Levites, according to the requirements of their respective duties.

[Numbers 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 7:7</span></span>

He gave two waggons and four oxen to the Gershonites, and four waggons
and eight oxen to the Merarites, as the former had less weight to carry,
in the coverings and curtains of the dwelling and the hangings of the
court, than the latter, who had to take charge of the beams and pillars
([Num 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#024.md)., [Num
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#031)..md). "Under the hand of Ithamar"
([Num 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#008).md); as in [Num
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#028.md), [Num
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#033.md). The Kohathites received no
waggon, because it was their place to attend to "the sanctuary" (the
holy), i.e., the holy things, which had to be conveyed upon their
shoulders, and were provided with poles for the purpose ([Num
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004)..md).

[Numbers 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 7:10</span></span>

Presentation of dedicatory gifts for the altar. - [Num
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#010.md). Every prince offered "the
dedication of the altar," i.e., what served for the dedication of the
altar, equivalent to his sacrificial gift for the consecration of the
altar, "on the day," i.e., at the time, "that they anointed it." "Day:"
as in [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md). Moses was directed by
God to receive the gifts from the princes on separate days, one after
another; so that the presentation extended over twelve days. The reason
for this regulation was not to make a greater display, as Knobel
supposes, or to avoid cutting short the important ceremony of
consecration, but was involved in the very nature of the gifts
presented. Each prince, for example, offered, (1) a silver dish (kearah,
[Exo 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029).md) of 130 sacred shekels
weight, i.e., about 4 1/2 lbs.; (2) a silver bowl (mizrak, a sacrificial
bowl, not a sacrificial can, or wine-can, as in [Exo
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003).md) of 70 shekels weight, both
filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a meat-offering; (3) a golden
spoon (caph, as in [Exo 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029).md) filled
with incense for an incense-offering; (4) a bullock, a ram, and a sheep
of a year old for a burnt-offering; (5) a shaggy goat for a
sin-offering; (5) two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, and five sheep of
a year old for a peace-offering. Out of these gifts the fine flour, the
incense, and the sacrificial animals were intended for sacrificing upon
the altar, and that not as a provision for a lengthened period, but for
immediate use in the way prescribed. This could not have been carried
out if more than one prince had presented his gifts, and brought them to
be sacrificed on any one day. For the limited space in the court of the
tabernacle would not have allowed of 252 animals being received,
slaughtered, and prepared for sacrificing all at once, or on the same
day; and it would have been also impossible to burn 36 whole animals
(oxen, rams, and sheep), and the fat portions of 216 animals, upon the
altar.

[Numbers 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 7:12</span></span>

All the princes brought the same gifts. The order in which the twelve
princes, whose names have already been given at [Num
1:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#005.md), made their presentation,
corresponded to the order of the tribes in the camp (ch. 2), the
tribe-prince of Judah taking the lead, and the prince of Naphtali coming
last. In the statements as to the weight of the silver kearoth and the
golden cappoth, the word shekel is invariably omitted, as in [Gen
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016.md), etc. - In [Num
7:84-86](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#084.md), the dedication gifts are
summed up, and the total weight given, viz., twelve silver dishes and
twelve silver bowls, weighing together 2400 shekels, and twelve golden
spoons, weighing 120 shekels in all. On the sacred shekel, see at [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md); and on the probable value of
the shekel of gold, at [Exo 38:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024.md).
The sacrificial animals are added together in the same way in [Num
7:87](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#087.md), [Num
7:88](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#088.md).

[Numbers 7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_089">num 7:89</span></span>

Whilst the tribe-princes had thus given to the altar the consecration of
a sanctuary of their God, through their sacrificial gifts, Jehovah
acknowledged it as His sanctuary, by causing Moses, when he went into
the tabernacle to speak to Him, and to present his own entreaties and
those of the people, to hear the voice of Him that spake to him from
between the two cherubim upon the ark of the covenant. The suffix in
אתּו points back to the name Jehovah, which, though not expressly
mentioned before, is contained implicite in ohel mod, "the tent of
meeting." For the holy tent became an ohel mod first of all, from the
fact that it was there that Jehovah appeared to Moses, or met with him
(נועד, [Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022).md). מדּבּר, part.
Hithpael, to hold conversation. On the fact itself, see the explanation
in [Exo 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020.md), [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md). "This voice from the inmost
sanctuary of Moses, the representative of Israel, was Jehovah's reply to
the joyfulness and readiness with which the princes of Israel responded
to Him, and made the tent, so far as they were concerned, a place of
holy meeting"' (Baumg.). This was the reason for connecting the remark
in [Num 7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089.md) with the account of the
dedicatory gifts.
