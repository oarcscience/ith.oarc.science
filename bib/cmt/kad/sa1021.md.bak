David's Flight to Nob, and Thence to Gath - [Sa1
21:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md)

After the information which David had received from Jonathan, nothing
remained for him in order to save his life but immediate flight. He
could not return to the prophets at Ramah, where he had been
miraculously preserved from the first outbreak of Saul's wrath, because
they could not ensure him permanent protection against the death with
which he was threatened. He therefore fled first of all to Nob, to
Ahimelech the high priest, to inquire the will of God through him
concerning his future course ([Sa1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#010.md), [Sa1
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#015).md), and induced him to give him
bread and the sword of Goliath, also, under the pretext of having to
perform a secret commission from the king with the greatest speed; for
which Saul afterwards took fearful vengeance upon the priests at Nob
when he was made acquainted with the affair through the treachery of
Doeg ([Sa1 21:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001).md). David then fled to
Gath to the Philistian king Achish; but here he was quickly recognised
as the conqueror of Goliath, and obliged to feign insanity in order to
save his life, and then to flee still farther ([Sa1
21:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010).md). The state of his mind at
this time he poured out before God in the words of [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md); [Psa
52:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md), and 34.

[Sa1 21:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md)

David at Nob. - The town of Nob or Nobeh (unless indeed the form נבה
stands for נבה here and in [Sa1 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md),
and the ה attached is merely ה local, as the name is always written נב
in other places: vid., [Sa1 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#011.md),
[Sa1 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#019.md); [Sa1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md); [Isa
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#032.md); [Neh
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#032).md) was at that time a priests'
city ([Sa1 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#019).md), in which, according
to the following account, the tabernacle was then standing, and the
legal worship carried on. According to [Isa
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030.md), [Isa
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#032), it was between Anathoth (Anata.md)
and Jerusalem, and in all probability it has been preserved in the
village of el-Isawiyeh, i.e., probably the village of Esau or Edom,
which is midway between Anata and Jerusalem, an hour from the latter,
and the same distance to the south-east of Gibeah of Saul (Tell el
Phul), and which bears all the marks of an ancient place, partly in its
dwellings, the stones of which date from a great antiquity, and partly
in many marble columns which are found there (vid., Tobler, Topogr. v.
Jerusalem ii. p. 720). Hence v. Raumer (Pal. p. 215, ed. 4) follows
Kiepert in the map which he has appended to Robinson's Biblical
Researches, and set down this place as the ancient Nob, for which
Robinson indeed searched in vain (see Pal. ii. p. 150). Ahimelech, the
son of Ahitub, most probably the same person as Ahiah ([Sa1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003).md), was "the priest," i.e., the
high priest (see at [Sa1 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003).md). When
David came to him, the priest "went trembling to meet him" (לקראת יחרד)
with the inquiry, "Why art thou alone, and no one is with thee?" The
unexpected appearance of David, the son-in-law of the king, without any
attendants, alarmed Ahimelech, who probably imagined that he had come
with a commission from the king which might involve him in danger. David
had left the few servants who accompanied him in his flight somewhere in
the neighbourhood, as we may gather from [Sa1
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002.md), because he wished to converse
with the high priest alone. Ahimelech's anxious inquiry led David to
resort to the fabrication described in [Sa1
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002.md) : "The king hath commanded me a
business, and said to me, No one is to know anything of this matter, in
which (lit. in relation to the matter with regard to which) I send thee,
and which I have entrusted to thee (i.e., no one is to know either the
occasion or the nature of the commission): and the servants I have
directed to such and such a place." יודע, Poel, to cause to know, point,
show. Ahimelech had received no information as yet concerning the most
recent occurrences between Saul and David; and David would not confess
to him that he was fleeing from Saul, because he was evidently afraid
that the high priest would not give him any assistance, lest he should
draw down the wrath of the king. This falsehood brought he greatest
calamities upon Ahimelech and the priests at Nob ([Sa1
22:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009).md), and David was afterwards
obliged to confess that he had occasioned it all ([Sa1
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#022).md).

[Sa1 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#003.md)

"And now what is under thy hand? give into my hand (i.e., hand me) five
loaves, or whatever (else) is to be found." David asked for five loaves,
because he had spoken of several attendants, and probably wanted to make
provision for two or three days (Thenius).

[Sa1 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004.md)

The priest answered that he had no common bread, but only holy bread,
viz., according to [Sa1 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006.md),
shew-bread that had been removed, which none but priests were allowed to
eat, and that in a sacred place; but that he was willing to give him
some of these loaves, as David had said that he was travelling upon an
important mission from the king, provided only that "the young men had
kept themselves at least from women," i.e., had not been defiled by
sexual intercourse ([Lev 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#018).md). If
they were clean at any rate in this respect, he would in such a case of
necessity depart from the Levitical law concerning the eating of the
shew-bread, for the sake of observing the higher commandment of love to
a neighbour ([Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md); cf. [Mat
12:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#005.md); [Mar
2:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#025).md).

(Note: When Mark ([Mar 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026).md) assigns
this action to the days of Abiathar the high priest, the statement rests
upon an error of memory, in which Ahimelech is confounded with
Abiathar.)

[Sa1 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#005.md)

David quieted him concerning this scruple, and said, "Nay, but women
have been kept from us since yesterday and the day before." The use of
אם כּי may be explained from the fact, that in David's reply he paid
more attention to the sense than to the form of the priest's scruple,
and expressed himself as concisely as possible. The words, "if the young
men have only kept themselves from women," simply meant, if only they
are not unclean; and David replied, That is certainly not the case, but
women have been kept from us; so that אם כּי has the meaning but in this
passage also, as it frequently has after a previous negative, which is
implied in the thought here as in [Sa2
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#033.md). "When I came out, the young
men's things were holy (Levitically clean); and if it is an unholy way,
it becomes even holy through the instrument." David does not say that
the young men were clean when he came out (for the rendering given to
הנּערים כּלי in the Septuagint, πάντα τὰ παιδάρια, is without any
critical value, and is only a mistaken attempt to explain the word כּלי,
which was unintelligible to the translator), but simply affirms that
קדשׁ הנּערים כּלי, i.e., according to Luther's rendering (der Knaben
Zeug war heilig), the young men's things (clothes, etc.) were holy.
כּלים does not mean merely vessels, arms, or tools, but also the dress
([Deu 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005).md), or rather the clothes as
well as such things as were most necessary to meet the wants of life. By
the coitus, or strictly speaking, by the emissio seminis in connection
with the coitus, not only were the persons themselves defiled, but also
every article of clothing or leather upon which any of the semen fell
([Lev 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#018).md); so that it was necessary
for the purpose of purification that the things which a man had on
should all be washed. David explains, with evident allusion to this
provision, that the young men's things were holy, i.e., perfectly clean,
for the purpose of assuring the priest that there was not the smallest
Levitical uncleanness attaching to them. The clause which follows is to
be taken as conditional, and as supposing a possible case: "and if it is
an unholy way." דּרך, the way that David was going with his young men,
i.e., his purpose of enterprise, by which, however, we are not to
understand his request of holy bread from Ahimelech, but the performance
of the king's commission of which he had spoken. כּי ואף, lit. besides
(there is) also that, = moreover there is also the fact, that it becomes
holy through the instrument; i.e., as O. v. Gerlach has correctly
explained it, "on the supposition of the important royal mission, upon
which David pretended to be sent, through me as an ambassador of the
anointed of the Lord," in which, at any rate, David's meaning really
was, "the way was sanctified before God, when he, as His chosen servant,
the preserver of the true kingdom of God in Israel, went to him in his
extremity." That פּלי in the sense of instrument is also applied to men,
is evident from [Isa 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005.md) and [Jer
50:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#025.md).

[Sa1 21:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006.md)

The priest then gave him (what was) holy, namely the shew-loaves "that
were taken from before Jehovah," i.e., from the holy table, upon which
they had lain before Jehovah for seven days (vid., [Lev
24:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#006).md). - In [Sa1
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#007.md) there is a parenthetical remark
introduced, which was of great importance in relation to the
consequences of this occurrence. There at the sanctuary there was a man
of Saul's servants, נעצר, i.e., "kept back (shut off) before Jehovah:"
i.e., at the sanctuary of the tabernacle, either for the sake of
purification or as a proselyte, who wished to be received into the
religious communion of Israel, or because of supposed leprosy, according
to [Lev 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#004.md). His name was Doeg the
Edomite, הרעים אבּיר, "the strong one (i.e., the overseer) of the
herdsmen of Saul."

(Note: The Septuagint translators have rendered these words νέμων τὰς
ἡμιόνους, "feeding the mules of Saul;" and accordingly in [Sa1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md) also they have changed Saul's
servants into mules, in accordance with which Thenius makes Doeg the
upper herdsman of Saul. But it is very evident that the text of the lxx
is nothing more than a subjective interpretation of the expression
before us, and does not presuppose any other text, from the simple fact
that all the other ancient versions are founded upon the Hebrew text
both here and in [Sa1 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md), including
even the Vulgate (potentissimus pastorum); and the clause contained in
some of the MSS of the Vulgate (his pascebat mulas Saul) is nothing more
than a gloss that has crept in from the Itala; and this is still more
obvious in [Sa1 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md), where נצּב והוּא
is applicable enough to עבדי, but is altogether unsuitable in connection
with פרדי, since נצּב is no more applied in Hebrew to herdsmen or
keepers of animals, than we should think of speaking of presidents of
asses, horses, etc. Moreover, it is not till the reign of David that we
read of mules being used as riding animals by royal princes ([Sa2
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029.md); [Sa2
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009).md); and they are mentioned for the
first time as beasts of burden, along with asses, camels, and oxen, in
[Ch1 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#040.md), where they are said to
have been employed by the northern tribes to carry provisions to Hebron
to the festival held at the recognition of David as king. Before David's
time the sons of princes rode upon asses (vid., [Jdg
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004.md); [Jdg
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#014))..md)

[Sa1 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#008.md)

David also asked Ahimelech whether he had not a sword or a javelin at
hand; "for I have neither brought my sword nor my (other) weapons with
me, because the affair of the king was pressing," i.e., very urgent,
נחוּץ, ἁπ. λεγ., literally, compressed.

[Sa1 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md)

The priest replied, that there was only the sword of Goliath, whom David
slew in the terebinth valley ([Sa1
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#002).md), wrapped up in a cloth hanging
behind the ephod (the high priest's shoulder-dress), - a sign of the
great worth attached to this dedicatory offering. He could take that.
David accepted it, as a weapon of greater value to him than any other,
because he had not only taken this sword as booty from the Philistine,
but had cut off the head of Goliath with it (see [Sa1
17:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#051).md). When and how this sword had
come into the tabernacle is not known (see the remarks on [Sa1
17:54](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#054).md). The form בּזּה for בּזה is
only met with here. On the Piska, see at [Jos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 21:10</span></span>

David with Achish at Gath. - David fled from Nob to Achish of Gath. This
Philistian king is called Abimelech in the heading of Ps 34, according
to the standing title of the Philistian princes at Gath. The fact that
David fled at once out of the land, and that to the Philistines at Gath,
may be accounted for from the great agitation into which he had been
thrown by the information he had received from Jonathan concerning
Saul's implacable hatred. As some years had passed since the defeat of
Goliath, and the conqueror of Goliath was probably not personally known
to many of the Philistines, he might hope that he should not be
recognised in Gath, and that he might receive a welcome there with his
few attendants, as a fugitive who had been driven away by Saul, the
leading foe of the Philistines.

(Note: This removes the objection raised by modern critics to the
historical credibility of the narrative before us, namely, that David
would certainly not have taken refuge at once with the Philistines, but
would only have gone to them in the utmost extremity (Thenius). It is
impossible to see how the words "he fled that day for fear of Saul"
([Sa1 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#011).md) are to prove that this
section originally stood in a different connection, and are only
arbitrarily inserted here (Thenius). Unless we tear away the words in
the most arbitrary manner from the foregoing word ויּברח, they not only
appear quite suitable, but even necessary, since David's journey to
Abimelech was not a flight, or at all events it is not described as a
flight in the text; and David's flight from Saul really began with his
departure from Nob. Still less can the legendary origin of this account
be inferred from the fact that some years afterwards David really did
take refuge with Achish in the Philistian country ([Sa1
27:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md) and [Sa1
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001).md), or the conjecture sustained
that this is only a distorted legend of that occurrence. For if the
later sojourn of David with Achish be a historical fact, that popular
legend could not possibly have assumed a form so utterly different as
the account before us, to say nothing of the fact that this occurrence
has a firm historical support in [Psa
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001)..md)

But in this he was mistaken. He was recognised at once by the courtiers
of Achish. They said to their prince, "Is not this David the king of the
land? Have they not sung in circles, Saul hath slain his thousands, and
David his ten thousands?" (cf. [Sa1
18:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006).md). "King of the land" they call
David, not because his anointing and divine election were known to them,
but on account of his victorious deeds, which had thrown Saul entirely
into the shade. Whether they intended by these words to celebrate David
as a hero, or to point him out to their prince as a dangerous man,
cannot be gathered from the words themselves, nor can the question be
decided with certainty at all (cf. [Sa1
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#005).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 21:12</span></span>

But David took these words to heart, and was in great fear of Achish,
lest he should treat him as an enemy, and kill him. In order to escape
this danger, "he disguised his understanding (i.e., pretended to be out
of his mind) in their eyes (i.e., before the courtiers of Achish),
behaved insanely under their hands (when they tried to hold him as a
madman), scribbled upon the door-wings, and let his spittle run down
into his beard." The suffix to וישׁנּו is apparently superfluous, as the
object, את־טעמו, follows immediately afterwards. But it may be accounted
for from the circumstantiality of the conversation of every-day life, as
in [Sa2 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#006.md), and (though these cases
are not perfectly parallel) [Exo 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006.md);
[Pro 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#022.md); [Eze
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#003.md) (cf. Gesenius' Gramm. 121, 6,
Anm. 3). ויתו, from תּוה, to make signs, i.e., to scribble. The lxx and
Vulgate render it ἐτυμπανίζειν, impingebat, he drummed, smote with his
fists upon the wings of the door, which would make it appear as if they
had read ויּתף (from תּפף), which seems more suitable to the condition
of a madman whose saliva ran out of his mouth.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 21:14</span></span>

By this dissimulation David escaped the danger which threatened him; for
Achish thought him mad, and would have nothing to do with him.
"Wherefore do ye bring him to me? Have I need of madmen, that ye have
brought this man hither to rave against me? Shall this man come into my
house?" Thus Achish refused to receive him into his house. But whether
he had David taken over the border, or at any rate out of the town; or
whether David went away of his own accord; or whether he was taken away
by his servants, and then hurried as quickly as possible out of the land
of the Philistines, is not expressly mentioned, as being of no
importance in relation to the principal object of the narrative. All
that is stated is, that he departed thence, and escaped to the cave
Adullam.
