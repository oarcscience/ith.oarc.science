### [Job Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001.md)

Fourth Part - The Unravelment - Job 32-42

The Speeches of Elihu which Prepare the Way for the Unravelment - Job
32-37

Historical Introduction to the Section - [Job
32:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001.md)

A short introduction in historical prose, which introduces the speaker
and justifies his appearance, opens the section. It is not, like the
prologue and epilogue, accented as prose; but, like the introductions to
the speeches and the clause, [Job
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#040.md) extra, is taken up in the
network of the poetical mode of accentuation, because a change of the
mode of accentuation in the middle of the book, and especially in a
piece of such small compass, appeared awkward. The opposition of the
three has exhausted itself, so that in that respect Job seems to have
come forth out the controversy as conqueror.

[Job 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 32:1</span></span>

1-3 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in
his own eyes. And the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of
the family of Ram, was kindled: against Job was his wrath kindled,
because he justified himself at the expense of God. And against his
three friends was his wrath kindled, because they found no answer, and
condemned Job.

The name of the speaker is אליהוּא (with Mahpach), son of בּרכאל (with
Munach) the buwziy (with Zarka). The name Elihu signifies "my God is
He," and occurs also as an Israelitish name, although it is not
specifically Israelitish, like Elijah (my God is Jehovah). Brach'el (for
which the mode of writing בּרכאל with Dag. implic. is also found)
signifies "may God bless!" (Olsh. 277, S. 618); for proper names, as the
Arabian grammarians observe, can be formed both into the form of
assertory clauses (ichbâr), and also into the form of modal (inshâ); the
name ברכאל is in this respect distinguished from the specifically
Israelitish name בּרכיה (Jehovah blesseth). The accompanying national
name defines the scene; for on the one side בּוּז and עוּץ, according to
[Gen 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md), are the sons of Nahor,
Abraham's brother, who removed with him (though not at the same time)
from Ur Casdim to Haran, therefore by family Aramaeans; on the other
side, בּוּז, [Jer 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md), appears as an
Arab race, belonging to the קצוּצי פאה (comp. [Jer
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025.md); [Jer
49:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#032).md), i.e., to the Arabs proper, who
cut the hair of their heads short all round (περιτρόχαλα, Herodotus iii.
8), because wearing it long was accounted as disgraceful (vid., Tebrzi
in the Hamsa, p. 459, l. 10ff.). Within the Buzite race, Elihu sprang
from the family of רם. Since רם is the name of the family, not the race,
it cannot be equivalent to ארם (like רמּים, [Ch2
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#005), = ארמים.md), and it is therefore
useless to derive the Aramaic colouring of Elihu's speeches from design
on the part of the poet. But by making him a Buzite, he certainly
appears to make him an Aramaean Arab, as Aristeas in Euseb. praep. ix.
25 calls him Ἐλιοῦν τὸν Βαραξηιὴλ τὸν Ζωβίτην (from ארם צובה). It is
remarkable that Elihu's origin is given so exactly, while the three are
described only according to their country, without any statement of
father or family. It would indeed be possible, as Lightfoot and Rosenm.
suppose, for the poet to conceal his own name in that of Elihu, or to
make allusion to it; but an instance of this later custom of Oriental
poets is found nowhere else in Old Testament literature.

The three friends are silenced, because all their attempts to move Job
to a penitent confession that his affliction is the punishment of his
sins, have rebounded against this fact, that he was righteous in his own
eyes, i.e., that he imagined himself righteous; and because they now
(שׁבת of persons, in distinction from חדל, has the secondary notion of
involuntariness) know of nothing more to say. Then Elihu's indignation
breaks forth in two directions. First, concerning Job, that he justified
himself מאלהים, i.e., not a Deo (so that He would be obliged to account
him righteous, as [Job 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017).md), but prae
Deo. Elihu rightly does not find it censurable in Job, that as a more
commonly self-righteous man he in general does not consider himself a
sinner, which the three insinuate of him ([Job
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014.md); [Job
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#004).md), but that, declaring himself to
be righteous, he brings upon God the appearance of injustice, or, as
Jehovah also says further on, [Job
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008.md), that he condemns God in order
that he may be able to maintain his own righteousness. Secondly,
concerning the three, that they have found no answer by which they might
have been able to disarm Job in his maintenance of his own righteousness
at the expense of the divine justice, and that in consequence of this
they have condemned Job. Hahn translates: so that they should have
represented Job as guilty; but that they have not succeeded in stamping
the servant of God as a רשׁע, would wrongly excite Elihu's displeasure.
And Ewald translates: and that they had nevertheless condemned him (345,
a); but even this was not the real main defect of their opposition. The
fut. consec. describes the condemnation as the result of their inability
to hit upon the right answer; it was a miserable expedient to which they
had recourse. According to the Jewish view, ויּרשׁיעוּ את־איּוב is one
of the eighteen תקוני סופרים (correctiones scribarum), since it should
be וירשׁיעו את־האלהים. But it is not the friends who have been guilty of
this sin of הרשׁיע against God, but Job, [Job
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008.md), to whom Elihu opposes the
sentence אל לא־ירשׁיע, [Job 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012.md). Our
judgment of another such tiqqûn, [Job
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020.md), was more favourable. That Elihu,
notwithstanding the inward conviction to the contrary by which he is
followed during the course of the controversial dialogue, now speaks for
the first time, is explained by what follows.

[Job 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 32:4</span></span>

4-6 And Elihu had waited for Job with words, for they were older than he
in days. And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the
three men, then his wrath was kindled. And Elihu the son of Barachel the
Buzite began, and said.

He had waited (perf. in the sense of the plusquamperf., Ew. 135, a) for
Job with words (בּדברים as elsewhere בּמלּים, בּמלּין), i.e., until Job
should have spoken his last word in the controversial dialogue. Thus he
considered it becoming on his part, for they (המּה, illi, whereas אלּה
according to the usage of the language is hi) were older (seniores) than
he in days (לימים as [Job 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006.md), less
harsh here, instead of the acc. of closer definition, [Job
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010.md), comp. [Job
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#009).md). As it now became manifest that
the friends made no reply to Job's last speeches for want of the right
solution of problem, and therefore also Job had nothing further to say,
he believes that he may venture, without any seeming want of courtesy,
to give utterance to his long-restrained indignation; and Elihu (with
Mahpach) the son of Barach'el (Mercha) the Buzite (with Rebia parvum)
began and spoke (ויּאמר not with Silluk, but Mercha mahpach., and in
fact with Mercha on the accented penult., as [Job
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#002), and further.md).

[Job 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 32:6</span></span>

6b I am young in days, and ye are hoary,

Therefore I stood back and was afraid

To show you my knowledge.

7 I thought: Let age speak,

And the multitude of years teach wisdom.

It becomes manifest even here that the Elihu section has in part a
peculiar usage of the language. זחל in the signification of Arab. zḥl,
cogn. with Arab. dḥl, דּחל, to frighten back;

(Note: The lexicographers explain the Arab. zḥl by zâla (זול), to stand
away from, back, to retreat, or tanahha, to step aside; Piel, Hiph., to
push any one aside, place anything back; Hithpa., to keep one's self on
one side; adj. זחל, זחיל, זחוּל, etc., standing back. Thus the town of
Zahla in the plain of the Lebanon takes its name from the fact that it
does not stand out in the plain, but is built close at the foot of the
mountain in a corner, and consequently retreats. And zuhale (according
to the Kamus) is an animal that creeps backwards into its hole, e.g.,
the scorpion; and hence, improperly, a man who, as we say with a similar
figure, never comes out of his hole, always keeps in his hole, i.e.,
never leaves his dwelling, as zuhal in general signifies a man who
retires or keeps far from active life; in connection with which also the
planet Saturn is called Zuhal, the retreating one, on account of its
great distance from the rest. Slippery (of ground) is זחלוּל, because it
draws the foot backwards (muzhil) by its smoothness, and thus causes the
walker to fall. A further formation is זחלק, to be slippery, and to slip
in a slippery place; beside which, זלק, a word of similar meaning, is no
longer used in Syria. According to this Arabic primary notion of zḥl, it
appears זחלי ארץ, [Mic 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017.md), is
intended to describe the serpents not as creeping upon the earth, but as
creeping into the earth (comp. the name of the serpent, achbi' at
el-ard, those that hide themselves in the earth); but in Talmud. and
Aram. זחל used of animals has the general signification to creep, and of
water, to glide (flow gently down). The primary notion, to glide (to
slip, creep, flow gently, labi), is combined both in the derivatives of
the root זח and in those of the root זל with the notion of a departing
and retreating motion. - Wetzst. and Fl.)

and דּע for דּעת (here and [Job 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#010.md),
[Job 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#017.md); [Job
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#003.md); [Job
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016).md) occurs nowhere else in the Old
Testament; על־כּן (comp. לכן, [Job
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003).md) is used only by Elihu within the
book of Job. ימים, days = fulness of days, is equivalent to advanced
age, old age with its rich experience. רב with its plural genitive is
followed (as כל sa( d usually is) by the predicate in the plur.; it is
the attraction already described by מספר, [Job
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010.md); [Job
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#021.md), Ges. 148, 1.

[Job 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 32:8</span></span>

8 Still the spirit, it is in mortal man,

And the breath of the Almighty, that giveth them understanding.

9 Not the great in years are wise,

And the aged do not understand what is right.

10 Therefore I say: O hearken to me,

I will declare my knowledge, even I.

The originally affirmative and then (like אוּלם) adversative אכן also
does not occur elsewhere in the book of Job. In contradiction to
biblical psychology, Rosenm. and others take [Job
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md) as antithetical: Certainly there
is spirit in man, but ... . The two halves of the verse are, on the
contrary, a synonymous ("the spirit, it is in man, viz., that is and
acts") or progressive parallelism) thus according to the accents: "the
spirit, even that which is in man, and ... "). It is the Spirit of God
to which man owes his life as a living being, according to [Job
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004.md); the spirit of man is the
principle of life creatively wrought, and indeed breathed into him, by
the Spirit of God; so that with regard to the author it can be just as
much God's רוּח or נשׁמה, [Job 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014.md),
as in respect of the possessor: man's רוח or נשׁמה. All man's life, his
thinking as well as his bodily life, is effected by this inwrought
principle of life which he bears within him, and all true understanding,
without being confined to any special age of life, comes solely from
this divinely originated and divinely living spirit, so far as he acts
according to his divine origin and basis of life. רבּים are here (as the
opposite of צעירים, [Gen 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023).md)
grandes = grandaevi (lxx πολυχρόνιοι). לא governs both members of the
verse, as [Job 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#010.md); [Job
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#017.md); [Job
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024.md). Understanding or ability to
form a judgment is not limited to old age, but only by our allowing the
πνεῦμα to rule in us in its connection with the divine. Elihu begs a
favourable hearing for that of which he is conscious. דּע, and the
Hebr.-Aramaic הוּה, which likewise belong to his favourite words, recur
here.

[Job 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 32:11</span></span>

11 Behold, I waited upon your words,

Hearkened to your perceptions,

While ye searched out replies.

12 And I attended closely to you,

Yet behold: there was no one who refuted Job,

Who answered his sentences, from you.

13 Lest ye should say: "We found wisdom,

God is able to smite him, not man!"

14 Now he hath not arranged his words against me,

And with your sentences I will not reply to him.

He has waited for their words, viz., that they might give utterance to
such words as should tend to refute and silence Job. In what follows, עד
still more emphatically than ל refers this aim to that to which Elihu
had paid great attention: I hearkened to your understandings, i.e.,
explanations of the matter, that, or whether, they came forth, (I
hearkened) to see if you searched or found out words, i.e., appropriate
words. Such abbreviated forms as אזין = אאזין (comp. מזין = מיזין for
מעזין, [Pro 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#004.md), Ges. 68, rem. 1, if
it does not signify nutriens, from זוּן) we shall frequently meet with
in this Elihu section. In [Job 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#012.md),
[Job 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#012.md) evidently is related as an
antecedent to what follows: and I paid attention to you (עדיכם contrary
to the analogy of the cognate praep. instead of עדיכם, moreover for
עליכם, with the accompanying notion: intently, or, according to
Aben-Duran: thoroughly, without allowing a word to escape me), and
behold, intently as I paid attention: no one came forward to refute Job;
there was no one from or among you who answered (met successfully) his
assertions. Every unbiassed reader will have an impression of the
remarkable expressions and constructions here, similar to that which one
has in passing from the book of the Kings to the characteristic sections
of the Chronicles. The three, Elihu goes on to say, shall not indeed
think that in Job a wisdom has opposed them - a false wisdom, indeed -
which only God and not any man can drive out of the field (נדף, Arab.
ndf, discutere, dispellere, as the wind drives away chaff or dry
leaves); while he has not, however (ולא followed directly by a v. fin.
forming a subordinate clause, as [Job
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003.md); [Psa
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018), and freq., Ew. 341, a.md), arrayed
(ערך in a military sense, [Job 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#005.md);
or forensic, [Job 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#004.md); or even as
[Job 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#019.md), in the general sense of
proponere) words against him (Elihu), i.e., utterances before which he
would be compelled to confess himself affected and overcome. He will not
then also answer him with such opinions as those so frequently repeated
by them, i.e., he will take a totally different course from theirs in
order to refute him.

[Job 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 32:15</span></span>

15 They are amazed, they answer no more,

Words have fled from them.

16 And I waited, for they spake not,

For they stand still, they answer no more.

17 Therefore I also will answer for my part,

I will declare my knowledge, even I.

In order to give a more rapid movement and an emotional force to the
speech, the figure asyndeton is introduced in [Job
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#015.md), as perhaps in [Jer
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007.md), Ew. 349, a. Most expositors
render העתּיקוּ passively, according to the sense: they have removed
from them, i.e., are removed from them; but why may העתיק not signify,
like [Gen 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md); [Gen
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#022.md), to move away, viz., the tent =
to wander on (Schlottm.)? The figure: words are moved away (as it were
according to an encampment broken up) from them, i.e., as we say: they
have left them, is quite in accordance with the figurative style of this
section. It is unnecessary to take והוחלתּי, [Job
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#016), with Ew. (342, c.md) 2 and Hirz.
as perf. consec. and interrogative: and should I wait, because they
speak no more? Certainly the interrog. part. sometimes disappears after
the Waw of consequence, e.g., [Eze
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013.md), [Eze
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024) (and will he live?.md); but by what
would והוחלתי be distinguished as perf. consec. here? Hahn's
interpretation: I have waited, until they do not speak, for they stand
... , also does not commend itself; the poet would have expressed this
by עד לא ידברו, while the two כי, especially with the poet's
predilection for repetition, appear to be co-ordinate. Elihu means to
say that he has waited a long time, surprised that the three did not
speak further, and that they stand still without speaking again.
Therefore he thinks the time is come for him also to answer Job. אענה
cannot be fut. Kal, since where the 1 fut. Kal and Hiph. cannot be
distinguished by the vowel within the word (as in the Ayin Awa and
double Ayin verbs), the former has an inalienable Segol; it is therefore
1 fut. Hiph., but not as in [Ecc 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#019.md)
in the signification to employ labour upon anything (lxx περισπᾶν), but
in an intensive Kal signification (as הזעיק for זעק, [Job
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009.md), comp. on [Job
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#018).md): to answer, to give any one an
answer when called upon. Ewald's supposedly proverbial: I also plough my
field! (192, c, Anm. 2) does unnecessary violence to the usage of the
language, which is unacquainted with this הענה, to plough. It is
perfectly consistent with Elihu's diction, that חלקי beside אני as
permutative signifies, "I, my part," although it might also be an acc.
of closer definition (as pro parte mea, for my part), or even - which
is, however, less probable - acc. of the obj. (my part). Elihu speaks
more in the scholastic tone of controversy than the three.

[Job 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 32:18</span></span>

18 For I am full of words,

The spirit of my inner nature constraineth me.

19 Behold, my interior is like wine which is not opened,

Like new bottles it is ready to burst.

20 I will speak, that I may gain air,

I will open my lips and reply.

21 No, indeed, I will accept no man's person,

And I will flatter no man.

22 For I understand not how to flatter;

My Maker would easily snatch me away.

The young speaker continues still further his declaration, promising so
much. He has a rich store of מלּים, words, i.e., for replying. מלתי
defective for מלאתי, like יצתי for יצאתי, [Job
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md); whereas מלוּ, [Eze
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#006.md), is not only written defectively,
but is also conjugated after the manner of a Lamed He verb, Ges. 23, 3,
74, rem. 4, 75, 21, c. The spirit of his inner nature constrains him,
since, on account of its intensity and the fulness of this interior, it
struggles to break through as through a space that is too narrow for it.
בּטן, as [Job 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002.md), [Job
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035.md), not from the curved appearance
of the belly, but from the interior of the body with its organs, which
serve the spirit life as the strings of a harp; comp. Arab. batn, the
middle or interior; bâtin, inwardly (opposite of zâhir, outwardly). His
interior is like wine לא יפּתח, which, or (as an adverbial dependent
clause) when it is not opened, i.e., is kept closed, so that the
accumulated gas has no vent, lxx δεδεμένος (bound up), Jer. absque
spiraculo; it will burst like new bottles. יבּקע is not a relative
clause referring distributively to each single one of these bottles
(Hirz. and others), and not an adverbial subordinate clause (Hahn: when
it will explode), but predicate to בטני: his interior is near bursting
like new bottles (אבות masc. like נאדות, [Jos
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#013).md), i.e., not such as are
themselves new (ἀσκοὶ καινοὶ, [Mat
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#017.md), for these do not burst so
easily), but like bottles of new wine, which has to undergo the action
of fermentation, lxx ὥσπερ φυσητὴρ (Cod. Sinait.1 φυσητής) χαλκέως,
i.e., חרשׁים whence it is evident that a bottle and also a pair of
bellows were called אוב). Since he will now yield to his irresistible
impulse, in order that he may obtain air or free space, i.e.,
disburdening and ease (וירוח לּי), he intends to accept no man's person,
i.e., to show partiality to no one (vid., on [Job
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008).md), and he will flatter no one.
כּנּה signifies in all three dialects to call any one by an honourable
name, to give a surname, here with אל, to speak fine words to any one,
to flatter him. This Elihu is determined he will not do; for לא ידעתּי
אכנּה, I know not how to flatter (French, je ne sais point flatter), for
כנּות or לכנּות; comp. the similar constructions, [Job
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003.md) (as [Est
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#006).md), [Job
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#016.md), [Sa1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003.md); [Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md); [Isa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md), Ges. 142, 3, c; also in Arabic
similar verbs, as "to be able" and "to prepare one's self," are thus
connected with the fut. without a particle between (e.g., anshaa
jef‛alu, he began to act). Without partiality he will speak, flattery is
not his force. If by flattery he should deny the truth, his Maker would
quickly carry him off. כּמעט followed by subjunct. fut.: for a little
(with disjunctive accent, because equivalent to haud multum abest quin),
i.e., very soon indeed, or easily would or might ... ; ישּׂני (as [Job
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021).md) seems designedly to harmonize
with עשׂני.
