### [Isaiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 33:1</span></span>

We are now in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign. The threatenings
of the first years, which the repentance of the people had delayed, are
now so far in force again, and so far actually realized, that the
Assyrians are already in Judah, and have not only devastated the land,
but are threatening Jerusalem. The element of promise now gains the
upper hand, the prophet places himself between Asshur and his own nation
with the weapons of prophecy and prayer, and the woe turns from the
latter to the former. "Woe, devastator, and thyself not devastated; and
thou spoiler, and still not spoiled! Hast thou done with devastating?
thou shalt be devastated. Hast thou attained to rob? men rob thee."
Asshur is described as not devastated and not spoiled (which could not
be expressed by a participle as with us, since bâgad is construed with
Beth, and not with the accusative of the person), because it had not yet
been visited by any such misfortune as that which had fallen upon other
lands and nations. But it would be repaid with like for the like as soon
as כּ indicating simultaneousness, as in [Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019.md) and [Isa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005), for example.md) its devastating and
spoiling had reached the point determined by Jehovah. Instead of בך, we
find in some codd. and editions the reading בו, which is equally
admissible. In כּהתימך (from תּמם) the radical syllable is lengthened,
instead of having dagesh. כּנּלתך is equivalent to כּהנלותך, a hiphil
syncopated for the sake of rhythm (as in [Isa
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#008.md); [Deu
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#033), and many other passages.md),
written here with dagesh dirmens, from the verb nâlâh, which is attested
also by [Job 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#029.md). The coincidence in
meaning with the Arab. verb nâl (fut. i and u), to acquire or attain
(see Comm. on Job, at [Job 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#029.md) and
[Job 30:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024).md), has been admitted by
the earliest of the national grammarians, Ben-Koreish, Chayug, etc. The
conjecture כּכלּותך (in addition to which Cappellus proposed כנלאותך) is
quite unnecessary. The play upon the sound sets forth the punishment of
the hitherto unpunished one as the infallible echo of its sin.

[Isaiah 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 33:2</span></span>

In [Isa 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002.md) the prophet's word of
command is changed into a believing prayer: "Jehovah, be gracious to us;
we wait for Thee: be their arm with every morning, yea, our salvation in
time of need!" "Their arm," i.e., the power which shelters and defends
them, viz., Thy people and my own. "Yea," 'aph, is emphatic. Israel's
arm every morning, because the danger is renewed every day; Israel's
salvation, i.e., complete deliverance ([Isa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009).md), because the culminating point
of the trouble is still in prospect.

[Isaiah 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 33:3</span></span>

While the prophet is praying thus, he already sees the answer. "At the
sound of a noise peoples pass away; at Thy rising nations are scattered.
And your booty is swept away as a swarm of locusts sweeps away; as
beetles run, they run upon it." The indeterminate hâmōn, which produces
for that very reason the impression of something mysterious and
terrible, is at once explained. The noise comes from Jehovah, who is
raising Himself judicially above Assyria, and thunders as a judge. Then
the hostile army runs away (נפצוּ = נפצּוּ, from the niphal נפץ, [Sa1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#011), from פּץ = נפוץ, from פּוּץ.md);
and your booty (the address returns to Assyria) is swept away, just as
when a swarm of locusts settles on a field, it soon eats it utterly
away. Jerome, Cappellus, and others follow the Septuagint rendering, ὃν
τρόπον ἐάν τις συναγάγη ἀκρίδας. The figure is quite as appropriate, but
the article in hechâsı̄l makes the other view the more natural one; and
[Isa 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004.md) places this beyond all
doubt. Shâqaq, from which the participle shōqēq and the substantive
masshâq are derived, is sued here, as in [Joe
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#009.md), to signify a busy running hither
and thither (discursitare). The syntactic use of shōqēq is the same as
that of קרא (they call) in [Isa 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md),
and sōphedı̄m (they smite) in [Isa
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#012.md). The inhabitants of Jerusalem
swarm in the enemy's camp like beetles; they are all in motion, and
carry off what they can.

[Isaiah 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 33:5</span></span>

The prophet sees this as he prays, and now feasts himself on the
consequences of this victory of Jehovah, prophesying in [Isa
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005.md), [Isa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006.md) : "Jehovah is exalted; for,
dwelling on high, He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. And
there will be security of thy times, riches of salvation, of wisdom, and
knowledge. Fear of Jehovah is then the treasure of Judah." Exalted: for
though highly exalted in Himself, He has performed an act of justice and
righteousness, with the sight and remembrance of which Zion is filled as
with an overflowing rich supply of instruction and praise. A new time
has dawned for the people of Judah. The prophet addresses them in [Isa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006.md); for there is nothing to warrant
us in regarding the words as addressed to Hezekiah. To the times
succeeding this great achievement there would belong 'emūnâh, i.e.,
(durability ([Exo 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012).md) - a uniform
and therefore trustworthy state of things (compare [Isa
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#008), "peace and truth".md). Secondly,
there would also belong to them חסן, a rich store of salvation, wisdom,
and knowledge (compare the verb in [Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018).md). We regard these three ideas as
all connected with chōsen. The prophet makes a certain advance towards
the unfolding of the seven gifts in [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md), which are implied in
"salvation;" but he hurries at once to the lowest of them, which forms
the groundwork of all the rest, when he says, thirdly, that the fear of
Jehovah will be the people's treasure. The construct form, chokhmath,
instead of chokhmâh, is a favourite one, which Isaiah employs, even
apart from the genitive relation of the words, for the purpose of
securing a closer connection, as [Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002.md); [Isa
51:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021.md) (compare pârash in [Eze
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#010).md), clearly show. In the case
before us, it has the further advantage of consonance in the closing
sound.

[Isaiah 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 33:7</span></span>

The prophet has thus run through the whole train of thought with a few
rapid strides, in accordance with the custom which we have already
frequently noticed; and now he commences afresh, mourning over the
present miserable condition of things, in psalm-like elegiac tones, and
weeping with his weeping people. "Behold, their heroes weep without; the
messengers of peace weep bitterly. Desolate are roads, disappeared are
travellers; he has broken covenant, insulted cities, despised men. The
land mourns, languishes; Lebanon stands ashamed, parched; the meadow of
Sharon has become like a steppe, and Bashan and Carmel shake their
leaves." אראלּם is probably chosen with some allusion to 'Ariel, the
name of Jerusalem in chapter 29; but it has a totally different meaning.
We have rendered it "heroes," because אראל is here synonymous with אראל
in the Nibelung-like piece contained in [Sa2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020.md) and [Ch1
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#022.md). This 'ărı̄'ēl, which is here
contracted into 'er'el (compare the biblical name 'Ar'ēlı̄ and the
post-biblical name of the angels, 'Er'ellı̄m), is compounded of 'arı̄ (a
lion) and ‛El (God), and therefore signifies "the lion of God," but in
this sense, that El (God) gives to the idea of leonine courage merely
the additional force of extraordinary or wonderful; and as a composite
word, it contents itself with a singular, with a collective sense
according to circumstances, without forming any plural at all. The
dagesh is to be explained from the fact that the word (which tradition
has erroneously regarded as a compound of להם אראה) is pointed in
accordance with the form כּרמל (כרמלּו). The heroes intended by the
prophet were the messengers sent to Sennacherib to treat with him for
peace. They carried to him the amount of silver and gold which he had
demanded as the condition of peace ([Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014).md). But Sennacherib broke the
treaty, by demanding nothing less than the surrender of Jerusalem
itself. Then the heroes of Jerusalem cried aloud, when they arrived at
Jerusalem, and had to convey this message of disgrace and alarm to the
king and nation; and bitterly weeping over such a breach of faith, such
deception and disgrace, the embassy, which had been sent off, to the
deep self-humiliation of Judah and themselves, returned to Jerusalem.
Moreover, Sennacherib continued to storm the fortified places, in
violation of his agreement (on mâ'as ‛arı̄m, see [Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013).md). The land was more and more
laid waste, the fields were trodden down; and the autumnal aspect of
Lebanon, with its faded foliage, and of Bashan and Carmel, with their
falling leaves, looked like shame and grief at the calamities of the
land. It was in the autumn, therefore, that the prophet uttered these
complaints; and the definition of the time given in his prophecy ([Isa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010).md) coincides with this. קמל is the
pausal form for קמל, just as in other places an ē with the tone, which
has sprung from i, easily passes into a in pause; the sharpening of the
syllable being preferred to the lengthening of it, not only when the
syllable which precedes the tone syllable is an open one, but sometimes
even when it is closed (e.g., [Jdg
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#019), ויּגּשׁ.md). Instead of כּערבה we
should read כּערבה (without the article), as certain codd. and early
editions do.

(Note: We find the same in [Zac 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md),
and כּערבים in [Isa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004.md), whereas we
invariably have בּערבה (see Michlol, 45b), just as we always find
בּאבנים, and on the other hand כּבנים.)

Isaiah having mourned in the tone of the Psalms, now comforts himself
with the words of a psalm. Like David in [Psa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006.md), he hears Jehovah speak. The
measure of Asshur's iniquity is full; the hour of Judah's redemption is
come; Jehovah has looked on long enough, as though sitting still ([Isa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004).md). [Isa
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010.md) "Now will I arise, saith
Jehovah, now exalt myself, now lift up myself." Three times does the
prophet repeat the word ‛attâh (now), which is so significant a word
with all the prophets, but more especially with Hosea and Isaiah, and
which always fixes the boundary-line and turning-point between love and
wrath, wrath and love. ארומם (in half pause for ארוממא is contracted
from עתרומם (Ges. 54, 2, b). Jehovah would rise up from His throne, and
show Himself in all His greatness to the enemies of Israel.

[Isaiah 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 33:11</span></span>

After the prophet has heard this from Jehovah, he knows how it will fare
with them. He therefore cries out to them in triumph ([Isa
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011).md), "Ye are pregnant with hay, ye
bring forth stubble! Your snorting is the fire that will devour you."
Their vain purpose to destroy Jerusalem comes to nothing; their burning
wrath against Jerusalem becomes the fire of wrath, which consumes them
(for chashash and qash, see at [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024).md).

[Isaiah 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 33:12</span></span>

The prophet announces this to them, and now tells openly what has been
exhibited to him in his mental mirror as the purpose of God. "And
nations become as lime burnings, thorns cut off, which are kindled with
fire." The first simile sets forth the totality of the destruction: they
will be so completely burned up, that nothing but ashes will be left,
like the lump of lime left at the burning of lime. The second contains a
figurative description of its suddenness: they have vanished suddenly,
like dead brushwood, which is cut down in consequence, and quickly
crackles up and is consumed ([Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md), cf., [Isa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017).md): kâsach is the Targum word for
zâmar, amputare, whereas in Arabic it has the same meaning as sâchâh,
verrere.

[Isaiah 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 33:13</span></span>

But the prophet, while addressing Asshur, does not overlook those
sinners of his own nation who are deserving of punishment. The judgment
upon Asshur is an alarming lesson, not only for the heathen, but for
Israel also; for there is no respect of persons with Jehovah. "Hear, ye
distant ones, what I have accomplished; and perceive, ye near ones, my
omnipotence! The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling seizes the
hypocrites: who of us can abide with devouring fire? who of us abide
with everlasting burnings?" Even for the sinners in Jerusalem also there
is no abiding in the presence of the Almighty and Just One, who has
judged Asshur (the act of judgment is regarded by the prophet as having
just occurred); they must either repent, or they cannot remain in His
presence. Jehovah, so far as His wrath is concerned, is "a consuming
fire" ([Deu 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Deu
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#003).md); and the fiery force of His anger
is "everlasting burnings" (mōkedē ‛ōlâm), inasmuch as it consists of
flames that are never extinguished, never burn themselves out. And this
God had His fire and His furnace in Jerusalem ([Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009).md), and had just shown what His
fire could do, when once it burst forth. Therefore do the sinners
inquire in their alarm, whilst confessing to one another (lânū; cf.,
[Amo 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001).md) that none of them can endure
it, "Who can dwell with devouring fire?" etc. (gūr with the acc. loci,
as in [Psa 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 33:15</span></span>

The prophet answers their question. "He that walketh in righteousness,
and speaketh uprightness; he that despiseth gain of oppressions, whose
hand keepeth from grasping bribes; he that stoppeth his ear from hearing
murderous counsel, and shutteth his eyes from looking at evil; he will
dwell upon high places; rocky fastnesses are his castle; his bread is
abundant, his waters inexhaustible." Isaiah's variation of [Psa
15:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md) and [Psa
24:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md) (as [Jer
17:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md) contains Jeremiah's variation
of [Psa 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md). Tsedâqōth is the
accusative of the object, so also is mēshârı̄m: he who walks in all the
relations of life in the full measure of righteousness, i.e., who
practises it continually, and whose words are in perfect agreement with
his inward feelings and outward condition. The third quality is, that he
not only does not seek without for any gain which injures the interests
of his neighbour, but that he inwardly abhors it. The fourth is, that he
diligently closes his hands, his ears, and his eyes, against all danger
of moral pollution. Bribery, which others force into his hand, he throws
away (cf., [Neh 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#013).md); against
murderous suggestions, or such as stimulate revenge, hatred, and
violence, he stops his ear; and from sinful sights he closes his eyes
firmly, and that without even winking. Such a man has no need to fear
the wrath of God. Living according to the will of God, he lives in the
love of God; and in that he is shut in as it were upon the inaccessible
heights and in the impregnable walls of a castle upon a rock. He suffers
neither hunger nor thirst; but his bread is constantly handed to him
(nittân, partic.), namely, by the love of God; and his waters never
fail, for God, the living One, makes them flow. This is the picture of a
man who has no need to be alarmed at the judgment of God upon Asshur.

[Isaiah 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 33:17</span></span>

Over this picture the prophet forgets the sinners in Zion, and greets
with words of promise the thriving church of the future. "Thine eyes
will see the king in his beauty, will see a land that is very far off."
The king of Judah, hitherto so deeply humbled, and, as Micah instances
by way of example, "smitten upon the cheeks," is then glorified by the
victory of his God; and the nation, constituted as described in [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md), [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016.md), will see him in his God-given
beauty, and see the land of promise, cleared of enemies as far as the
eye can reach and the foot carry, restored to Israel without reserve,
and under the dominion of this sovereign enjoying all the blessedness of
peace.

[Isaiah 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 33:18</span></span>

The tribulation has passed away like a dream. "Thy heart meditates upon
the shuddering. Where is the valuer? where the weigher? where he who
counted the towers? The rough people thou seest no more, the people of
deep inaudible lip, of stammering unintelligible tongue." The dreadful
past is so thoroughly forced out of mind by the glorious present, that
they are obliged to turn back their thoughts (hâgâh, meditari, as Jerome
renders it) to remember it at all. The sōphēr who had the management of
the raising of the tribute, the shōqēl who tested the weight of the gold
and silver, the sōpher 'eth hammigdâl who drew up the plan of the city
to be besieged or stormed, are all vanished. The rough people (נועז עם,
the niphal of עזז, from יעז), that had shown itself so insolent, so
shameless, and so insatiable in its demands, has become invisible. This
attribute is a perfectly appropriate one; and the explanation given by
Rashi, Vitringa, Ewald, and Frst, who take it in the sense of lō‛ēz in
[Psa 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md), is both forced and
groundless. The expressions ‛imkē and nil‛ag refer to the obscure and
barbarous sound of their language; misshemōă to the unintelligibility of
their speech; and בּינה אין to the obscurity of their meaning. Even if
the Assyrians spoke a Semitic language, they were of so totally
different a nationality, and their manners were so entirely different,
that their language must have sounded even more foreign to an Israelite
than Dutch to a German.

[Isaiah 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 33:20</span></span>

And how will Jerusalem look when Asshur has been dashed to pieces on the
strong fortress? The prophet passes over here into the tone of [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md) ([Psa
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#013.md), [Psa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#014).md). [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md) and [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md) probably belong to the time of
Jehoshaphat; but they are equally applicable to the deliverance of
Jerusalem in the time of Hezekiah. "Look upon Zion, the castle of our
festal meeting. Thine eyes will see Jerusalem, a pleasant place, a tent
that does not wander about, whose pegs are never drawn, and none of
whose cords are ever broken." Jerusalem stands there unconquered and
inviolable, the fortress where the congregation of the whole land
celebrates its feasts, a place full of good cheer ([Isa
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#018).md), in which everything is now
arranged for a continuance. Jerusalem has come out of tribulation
stronger than ever - not a nomadic wandering tent (tsâ‛am, a nomad word,
to wander, lit., to pack up = tâ‛an in [Gen
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#017).md), but one set up for a permanent
dwelling.

[Isaiah 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 33:21</span></span>

It is also a great Lord who dwells therein, a faithful and almighty
defender. "No, there dwells for us a glorious One, Jehovah; a place of
streams, canals of wide extent, into which no fleet of rowing vessels
ventures, and which no strong man of war shall cross. For Jehovah is our
Judge; Jehovah is our war-Prince; Jehovah is our King; He will bring us
salvation." Following upon the negative clauses in [Isa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020.md), the next v. commences with kı̄
'im (imo). Glorious ('addı̄r) is Jehovah, who has overthrown Lebanon,
i.e., Assyria ([Isa 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034).md). He dwells
in Jerusalem for the good of His people - a place of streams, i.e., one
resembling a place of streams, from the fact that He dwells therein.
Luzzatto is right in maintaining, that בּו and יעברנּוּ point back to
מקום, and therefore that mekōm is neither equivalent to loco (tachath,
instead of), which would be quite possible indeed, as [Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md), if not [Hos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001.md), clearly proves (cf., [Kg1
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#038).md), nor used in the sense of
substitution or compensation. The meaning is, that, by virtue of
Jehovah's dwelling there, Jerusalem had become a place, or equivalent to
a place, or broad streams, like those which in other instances defended
the cities they surrounded (e.g., Babylon, the "twisted snake," [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md), and of broad canals, which kept
off the enemy, like moats around a fortification. The word יארים was an
Egyptian word, that had become naturalized in Hebrew; nevertheless it is
a very natural supposition, that the prophet was thinking of the No of
Egypt, which was surrounded by waters, probably Nile-canals (see Winer,
R.W. [Nah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008).md). The adjective in which
yâdaim brings out with greater force the idea of breadth, as in [Isa
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018) ("on both sides".md), belongs to
both the nouns, which are placed side by side, ὰσυνδέτως (because
permutative). The presence of Jehovah was to Jerusalem what the broadest
streams and canals were to other cities; and into these streams and
canals, which Jerusalem had around it spiritually in Jehovah Himself, no
rowing vessels ventured בּ הלך, ingredi). Luzzatto renders the word
"ships of roving," i.e., pirate ships; but this is improbable, as shūt,
when used as a nautical word, signifies to row. Even a majestic tsı̄,
i.e., trieris magna, could not cross it: a colossal vessel of this size
would be wrecked in these mighty and dangerous waters. The figure is the
same as that in [Isa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md). In the
consciousness of this inaccessible and impenetrable defence, the people
of Jerusalem gloried in their God, who watched as a shōphēt over
Israel's rights and honour, who held as mechoqēq the commander's rod,
and ruled as melekh in the midst of Israel; so that for every future
danger it was already provided with the most certain help.

[Isaiah 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 33:23</span></span>

Now indeed it was apparently very different from this. It was not
Assyria, but Jerusalem, that was like a ship about to be wrecked; but
when that which had just been predicted should be fulfilled, Jerusalem,
at present so powerless and sinful, would be entirely changed. "Thy
ropes hang loose; they do not hold fast the support of thy mast; they do
not hold the flag extended: then is booty of plunder divided in
abundance; even lame men share the prey. And not an inhabitant will say,
I am weak: the people settled there have their sins forgiven." Nearly
every commentator (even Luzzatto) has taken [Isa
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md) as addressed to Assyria, which,
like a proud vessel of war, would cross the encircling river by which
Jerusalem was surrounded. But Drechsler has very properly given up this
view. The address itself, with the suffix ayikh (see at [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026).md), points to Jerusalem; and the
reference to this gives the most appropriate sense, whilst the contrast
between the now and then closes the prophecy in the most glorious
manner. Jerusalem is now a badly appointed ship, dashed about by the
storm, the sport of the waves. Its rigging hangs loose (Jerome, laxati
sunt); it does not hold the kēn tornâm fast, i.e., the support of their
mast, or cross beam with a hole in it, into which the mast is slipped
(the mesodme of Homer, Od. xv 289), which is sure to go to ruin along
with the falling mast, if the ropes do not assist its bearing power
(malum sustinentes thecae succurrant, as Vitruvius says). And so the
ropes of the ship Jerusalem do not keep the nēs spread out, i.e., the
ἐπίσημον of the ship, whether we understand by it a flag or a sail, with
a device worked upon it (see Winer, R.W. s. v. Schiffe). And this is the
case with Jerusalem now; but then ('âz) it will be entirely different.
Asshur is wrecked, and Jerusalem enriches itself, without employing any
weapons, from the wealth of the Assyrian camp. It was with a prediction
of this spoiling of Asshur that the prophet commenced in [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md); so that the address finishes as
it began. But the closing words of the prophet are, that the people of
Jerusalem are now strong in God, and are עון נשׂא (as in [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001).md), lifted up, taken away from
their guilt. A people humbled by punishment, penitent, and therefore
pardoned, would then dwell in Jerusalem. The strength of Israel, and all
its salvation, rest upon the forgiveness of its sins.
