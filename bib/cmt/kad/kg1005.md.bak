Preparations for Building the Temple - 1 Kings 5

Immediately after the consolidation of his kingdom, Solomon commenced
the preparations for the building of a temple, first of all by entering
into negotiations with king Hiram of Tyre, to procure from him not only
the building materials requisite, viz., cedars, cypresses, and hewn
stones, but also a skilled workman for the artistic work of the temple
([Kg1 5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001).md); and, secondly, by
causing the number of workmen required for this great work to be raised
out of his own kingdom, and sending them to Lebanon to prepare the
materials for the building in connection with the Tyrian builders ([Kg1
5:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013).md). - We have a parallel passage
to this in 2 Chron 2, which agrees with the account before us in all the
leading points, but differs in many of the details, omitting several
things which were not essential to the main fact, and communicating
others which are passed over in our account, e.g., Solomon's request
that a Tyrian workman might be sent. This shows that the two accounts
are extracts from a common and more elaborate source, the historical
materials being worked up in a free and independent manner according to
the particular plan adopted by each of the two authors. (For further
remarks on the mutual relation of the two narratives, see my
apologetischer Versuch ber die Bcher der Chronik, pp. 216ff.)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 5:1</span></span>

Solomon's negotiations with Hiram of Tyre. - [Kg1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001.md). When king Hiram of Tyre heard
that Solomon had been anointed king in the place of David, he sent his
servants, i.e., an embassage, to Solomon, to congratulate him (as the
Syriac correctly explains) on his ascent of the throne, because he had
been a friend of David the whole time (כּל־הימים, i.e., as long as both
of them David and Hiram were kings). On Hiram and the length of his
reign, see the remarks on [Sa2 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md).
This is passed over in the Chronicles as having no essential bearing
upon the building of the temple.

[Kg1 5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#002.md)

Solomon thereupon communicated to Hiram, by means of an embassy, his
intention to carry out the building of the temple which his father
projected, and asked him for building wood from Lebanon for the purpose.
From the words, "Thou knowest that my father David could not build,"
etc., it is evident that David had not only been busily occupied for a
long time with the plan for building a temple, but that he had already
commenced negotiations with Hiram on the matter; and with this [Ch1
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#004.md) agrees. "To the name of Jehovah:"
this expression is based upon [Deu
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md) and [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md) : "the place which the Lord
shall choose to put His name there, or that His name may dwell there."
The name of Jehovah is the manifestation of the divine nature in a
visible sign as a real pledge of His presence (see at [Kg1
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#005).md), and not merely numen Jovae
quatenus ab hominibus cognoscitur, colitur, celebratur (Winer, Thenius).
Hence in 2 Sam 7, to which Solomon refers, בּית לי בּנה ([Kg1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005.md), [Kg1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#007).md) alternates with לשׁמי בּית בּנה
([Kg1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013).md). On the obstacle which
prevented it, "because of the war, with which they (the enemies) had
surrounded me," see at [Sa2 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#009.md). On
the construction, סבב with a double accusative, compare the very similar
passage, [Psa 109:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#003.md), which fully
establishes the rendering we have given, so that there is no necessity
to assume that מלחמה, war, stands for enemies (Ewald, 317, b.).

[Kg1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#004.md)

"And now Jehovah my God has given me rest roundabout," such as David
never enjoyed for a permanency (cf. [Sa2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001).md). "No adversary is there." This is
not at variance with [Kg1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md), for
Hadad's enterprise belonged to a later period (see the comm. on that
passage). "And no evil occurrence:" such as the rebellions of Absalom
and Sheba, the pestilence at the numbering of the people, and other
events which took place in David's reign.

[Kg1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005.md)

"Behold, I intend to build." אמר followed by an infinitive, as in [Exo
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014.md); [Sa2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016.md). "As Jehovah spake to David;"
viz., [Sa2 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md), [Sa2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md).

[Kg1 5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md)

"And now command that they fell me cedars from Lebanon." We may see from
[Kg1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#008.md) that Solomon had also asked
for cypresses; and according to the parallel passage [Ch2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006.md)., he had asked for a skilful
artist, which is passed over here, so that it is only in [Kg1
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013.md) that we find a supplementary
notice that Hiram had sent one. It is evident from this request, that
that portion of Lebanon on which the cedars suitable for building wood
grew, belonged to the kingdom of Hiram. The cedar forest, which has been
celebrated from very ancient times, was situated at least two days'
journey to the north of Beirut, near the northernmost and loftiest
summits of the range, by the village of Bjerreh, to the north of the
road which leads to Baalbek and not far to the east of the convent of
Canobin, the seat of the patriarch of the Maronites, although Seetzen,
the American missionaries, and Professor Ehrenberg found cedars and
cedar groves in other places on northern Lebanon (see Rob. Pal. iii.
440,441, and Bibl. Res. pp. 588ff.). The northern frontier of Canaan did
not reach as far as Bjerreh (see at [Num
34:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008).md). "My servants shall be with
thy servants," i.e., shall help them in the felling of the wood. "And
the wages of thy servants will I give to thee altogether as thou
sayest." "For thou knowest that no one among us is skilful in felling
trees like the Sidonians." This refers to the knowledge of the most
suitable trees, of the right time for felling, and of the proper
treatment of the wood. The expression Sidonians stands for Phoenicians
generally, since Sidon was formerly more powerful than Tyre, and that
portion of Lebanon which produced the cedars belonged to the district of
Sidon. The inhabitants of Sidon were celebrated from time immemorial as
skilful builders, and well versed in mechanical arts (compare Rob. Pal.
iii. 421ff., and Movers, Phoenizier, ii. 1, pp. 86ff.).

Hiram rejoiced exceedingly at this proposal on the part of Solomon, and
praised Jehovah for having given David so wise a son as his successor
([Kg1 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#007).md). It must have been a matter
of great importance to the king of Tyre to remain on good terms with
Israel, because the land of Israel was a granary for the Phoenicians,
and friendship with such a neighbour would necessarily tend greatly to
promote the interests of the Phoenician commerce. The praise of Jehovah
on the part of Hiram does not presuppose a full recognition of Jehovah
as the only true God, but simply that Hiram regarded the God of Israel
as being as real a God as his own deities. Hiram expresses a fuller
acknowledgment of Jehovah in [Ch2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011.md), where he calls Jehovah the
Creator of heaven and earth; which may be explained, however, from
Hiram's entering into the religious notions of the Israelites, and does
not necessarily involve his own personal belief in the true deity of
Jehovah.

[Kg1 5:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#008.md)

Hiram then sent to Solomon, and promised in writing (בּכתב, [Ch2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#010).md) to comply with his wishes. אלי
שׁלחתּ אשׁר את, "that which thou hast sent to me," i.e., hast asked of
me by messenger. ברושׁים are not firs, but cypresses. "My servants shall
bring down (the trees) from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them
into rafts (i.e., bind them into rafts and have them floated) upon the
sea to the place which thou shalt send (word) to me, and will take them
(the rafts) to pieces there, and thou wilt take (i.e., fetch them
thence)." The Chronicles give Yafo, i.e., Joppa, Jaffa, the nearest
harbour to Jerusalem on the Mediterranean Sea, as the landing-place (see
at [Jos 19:46](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#046).md). "And thou wilt do all
my desire to give bread for my house," i.e., provisions to supply the
wants of the king's court. "The שׂכר mentioned in [Kg1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006) was also to be paid" (Thenius.md).
This is quite correct; but Thenius is wrong when he proceeds still
further to assert, that the chronicler erroneously supposed this to
refer to the servants of Hiram who were employed in working the wood.
There is not a word of this kind in the Chronicles; but simply Solomon's
promise to Hiram ([Kg1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#009).md): "with
regard to the hewers (the fellers of the trees), I give thy servants
wheat 20,000 cors, and barley 20,000 cors, and wine 20,000 baths, and
oil 20,000 baths." This is omitted in our account, in which the wages
promised in [Kg1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md) to the Sidonian
fellers of wood are not more minutely defined. On the other hand, the
payment for the wood delivered by Solomon to Hiram, which is not
mentioned in the Chronicles, is stated here in [Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011.md). "Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors
of wheat as food (מכּלת, a contraction of מאכלת, from אכל; cf. Ewald,
79, b.) for his house (the maintenance of his royal court), and 20 cors
of beaten oil; this gave Solomon to Hiram year by year," probably as
long as the delivery of the wood or the erection of Solomon's buildings
lasted. These two accounts are so clear, that Jac. Capp., Gramt., Mov.,
Thenius, and Bertheau, who have been led by critical prejudices to
confound them with one another, and therefore to attempt to emend the
one from the other, are left quite alone. For the circumstance that the
quantity of wheat, which Solomon supplied to Hiram for his court, was
just the same as that which he gave to the Sidonian workmen, does not
warrant our identifying the two accounts. The fellers of the trees also
received barley, wine, and oil in considerable quantities; whereas the
only other thing which Hiram received for his court was oil, and that
not common oil, but the finest olive oil, namely 20 cors of כּתית שׁמן,
i.e., beaten oil, the finest kind of oil, which was obtained from the
olives when not quite ripe by pounding them in mortars, and which had
not only a whiter colour, but also a purer flavour than the common oil
obtained by pressing from the ripe olives (cf. Celsii Hierobot. ii. pp.
349f., and Bhr, Symbolik, i. p. 419). Twenty cors were 200 baths, i.e.,
according to the calculations of Thenius, about ten casks (1 cask = 6
pails; 1 pail = 72 cans). If we bear in mind that this was the finest
kind of oil, we cannot speak of disproportion to the quantity of wheat
delivered. Thenius reckons that 20,000 cors of wheat were about 38,250
Dresden scheffeln (? sacks).

[Kg1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#012.md)

The remark that "the Lord gave Solomon wisdom" refers not merely to the
treaty which Solomon made with Hiram, through which he obtained
materials and skilled workmen for the erection of the house of God
(Thenius), but also to the wise use which he made of the capacities of
his own subjects for this work. For this verse not only brings to a
close the section relating to Solomon's negotiations with Hiram, but it
also forms an introduction to the following verses, in which the
intimation given by Solomon in [Kg1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md), concerning the labourers who were
to fell wood upon Lebanon in company with Hiram's men, is more minutely
defined.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 5:13</span></span>

The tributary labourers out of Israel. - [Kg1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013.md), [Kg1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#014.md). Solomon raised a tribute (מס,
tribute-labourers, as in [Kg1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006).md) out
of all Israel, i.e., out of the whole nation (not "out of the whole
territory of Israel," as Ewald supposes), 30,000 men, and sent them up
to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in rotation; one month they were on Lebanon
(doing tribute work), two months at home (looking after the cultivation
of their own ground). ויּעל, from העלה, does not mean in tabulas
referre, in support of which appeal is made to [Ch1
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#024.md), though on insufficient ground,
but ascendere fecit, corresponding to the German ausheben (to raise). He
raised them out of the nation, to send the up Lebanon (cf. [Kg1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025).md). These 30,000 Israelitish
labourers must be distinguished from the remnants of the Canaanites who
were made into tribute-slaves ([Kg1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015.md) and [Kg1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020).md). The latter are called עבד מס,
tribute-slaves, in [Kg1 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#021.md) as in
[Jos 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010.md). That the Israelites were
not to render the service of bondsmen is evident from the fact, that
they only rendered tribute for four months of the year, and were at home
for eight months; and the use of the epithet מס is not at variance with
this. For even if this word is applied elsewhere to the Canaanitish
bondsmen (e.g., [Jos 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#013.md); [Jdg
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#028.md), [Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md), and [Ch2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#008).md), a distinction is decidedly made
in our account of Solomon between מס and עבד מס, inasmuch as in [Kg1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#022.md), after the Canaanitish bondsmen
have been mentioned, it is expressly stated that "of Israel Solomon made
no one a slave" (עגלים). The 30,000 Israelitish tribute-servants are "to
be thought of as free Israelites, who simply performed the less severe
work of felling trees in fellowship with and under the direction of the
subjects of Hiram \_(see at [Kg1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006).md),
according to the command of the king, and probably not even that without
remuneration" (Thenius). For Adoniram see at [Kg1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 5:15</span></span>

And Solomon had 70,000 bearers of burdens and 80,000 hewers of stone on
the mountains (of Lebanon). חצב is understood by the older translators
as referring simply to hewers of stone. This is favoured both by the
context, since [Kg1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018.md) speaks of
stone-mason's work, and also by the usage of the language, inasmuch as
חצב is mostly applied to the quarrying and cutting of stones ([Deu
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#011.md); [Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md); [Pro
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md); [Kg2
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#013).md), and only occurs in [Isa
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015.md) in connection with the cutting
of wood. The hewing and preparing of the wood were amply provided for by
30,000 Israelites. That the 150,000 bearers of burdens and hewers of
stone were not taken from the Israelites, is evident from the fact that
they are distinguished from the latter, or at all events are not
described as Israelites. We obtain certainty on this point from the
parallel passages, [Kg1 9:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020.md); [Ch2
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016.md), and [Ch2
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001.md), according to which Solomon
pressed the Canaanites who were left in the land to this bond-service.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 5:16</span></span>

"Beside (לבד), i.e., without reckoning, the princes, Solomon's officers,
who were over the work (i.e., the chiefs appointed by Solomon as
overlookers of the work), 3300, who ruled over the people who laboured
at the work." הנּצּבים שׂרי, as Thenius correctly observes, cannot be
the chief of the overlookers, i.e., the head inspectors, as there is no
allusion made to subordinate inspectors, and the number given is much
too large for head inspectors. נצּבים, which is governed by שׂרי in the
construct state, is to be taken as defining the substantive: principes
qui praefecti erant (Vatabl.; cf. Ewald, 287, a.). Moreover, at the
close of the account of the whole of Solomon's buildings ([Kg1
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023).md), 550 more הנּצּבים שׂרי are
mentioned as presiding over the people who did the work. The accounts in
the Chronicles differ from these in a very peculiar manner, the number
of overseers being given in [Ch2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017.md)
and 3600, and in [Ch2 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010.md) as 250.
Now, however natural it may be, with the multiplicity of errors
occurring in numerical statements, to assume that these differences have
arisen from copyists' errors through the confounding together of
numerical letters resembling one another, this explanation is overthrown
as an improbable one, by the fact that the sum-total of the overseers is
the same in both accounts (3300 + 550 = 3850 in the books of Kings, and
3600 + 250 = 3850 in the Chronicles); and we must therefore follow J. H.
Michaelis, an explain the differences as resulting from a different
method of classification, namely, from the fact that in the Chronicles.
the Canaanitish overseers are distinguished from the Israelitish (viz.,
3600 Canaanites and 250 Israelites), whereas in the books of Kings the
inferiores et superiores praefecti are distinguished. Consequently
Solomon had 3300 inferior overseers and 550 superior (or
superintendents), of whom 250 were selected from the Israelites and 300
from the Canaanites. In [Ch2 2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016.md),
it is expressly stated that the 3600 were taken from the גּרים, i.e.,
the Canaanites who were left in the land of Israel. And it is equally
certain that the number given in [Kg1
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023.md) and [Ch2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010) (550 and 250.md) simply comprises
the superintendents over the whole body of builders, notwithstanding the
fact that in both passages ([Kg1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016.md)
and [Kg1 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023).md) the same epithet
הנּצּבים שׂרי is used. If, then, the number of overseers is given in
[Kg1 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023.md) and 550, i.e., 300 more than
in the parallel passage of the Chronicles, there can hardly be any doubt
that the number 550 includes the 300, in which the number given in our
chapter falls short of that in the Chronicles, and that in the 3300 of
our chapter the superintendents of Canaanitish descent are not included.

(Note: Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 292) assumes that "by the 550 ([Kg1
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023).md) we are to understand the actual
superintendents, whereas the 3300 ([Kg1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013).md) include inferior inspectors as
well; and of the 550 superintendents, 300 were taken from the
Canaanaeans, so that only 250 ([Ch2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010).md) were native Hebrews;" though he
pronounces the number 3600 ([Ch2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017).md)
erroneous. Bertheau, on the other hand, in his notes in [Ch2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010.md), has rather complicated than
elucidated the relation in which the two accounts stand to one another.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 5:17</span></span>

And the king had large, costly stones broken, "to lay the foundation of
the house with hewn stones." יקרות does not mean heavy (Thenius), for
this would be a perfectly superfluous remark, inasmuch as large stones
are always heavy, but costly, valuable stones, qui multa pecunia
constabant (Cler.); compare [Kg1 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002.md),
where the word stands for precious stones. ליסּד, i.e., to lay the
foundation for the temple, by which we are to understand not merely the
foundation for the temple-house, but the magnificent substructions for
the whole of the temple area, even though the strong walls which
surrounded the temple mountain, and which Josephus describes in his
Antiquities, viii. 3, 9, and xv. 11, 3, and in his de Bell. Jud. v. 5,
1, may not have been all completed by Solomon, but may have been a work
of centuries. For further remarks on this subject, see at [Kg1
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038.md). גזית אבני are squared stones,
according to [Kg1 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#010.md), of ten and
eight cubits.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 5:18</span></span>

With [Kg1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018.md) the account of the
preparations for the building of the temple, which were the object of
Solomon's negotiations with Hiram, is brought to a close. "Solomon's
builders and Hiram's builders, even the Giblites, hewed and prepared the
wood and the stones for the building of the house." The object to יפסלוּ
is not the square stones mentioned before, but the trees (beams) and
stones mentioned after ויּכנוּ. והגּבלים is to be taken as explanatory,
"even the Giblites," giving a more precise definition of "Hiram's
builders." The Giblites are the inhabitants of the town of Gebal, called
Byblos by the Greeks, to the north of Beirut (see at [Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005).md), which was the nearest to the
celebrated cedar forest of the larger Phoenician towns. According to
[Eze 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009), the Giblites (Byblians.md)
were experienced in the art of shipbuilding, and therefore were probably
skilful builders generally, and as such the most suitable of Hiram's
subjects to superintend the working of the wood and stone for Solomon's
buildings. For it was in the very nature of the case that the number of
the Phoenician builders was only a small one, and that they were merely
the foremen; and this may also be inferred from the large number of his
own subjects whom Solomon appointed to the work.

(Note: Without any satisfactory ground Thenius has taken offence at the
word והגּבלים, and on the strength of the critically unattested καὶ
ἔβαλον αὐτούς of the lxx and the paraphrastic ἁρμόσαντας καὶ συνδήσαντας
of Josephus, which is only introduced to fill in the picture, has
altered it into ויּגבּילוּם, "they bordered them (the stones)." This he
explains as relating to the "bevelling" of the stones, upon the
erroneous assumption that the grooving of the stones in the old walls
encircling the temple area, which Robinson (Pal. i. 423) was the first
to notice and describe, "occurs nowhere else in precisely the same
form;" whereas Robinson found them in the ancient remains of the
foundations of walls in different places throughout the land, not only
in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, viz., at Bethany, but also at Carmel
on the mountains of Judah, at Hebron, Semua (Esthemoa), Beit Nusib
(Nezib), on Tabor, and especially in the north, in the old remains of
the walls of the fortification es Shukif, Hunn, Banias, Tyrus, Jebail
(Byblus), Baalbek, on the island of Ruwad (the ancient Aradus), and in
different temples on Lebanon (see Rob. Pal. ii. 101,198, 434,627; iii.
12,213, 214; and Bibl. Researches, p. 229). Bttcher (n. ex. Krit.
Aehrenl. ii. p. 32) has therefore properly rejected this conjecture as
"ill-founded," though only to put in its place another which is
altogether unfounded, namely, that before והגּבלים the word הצּרים ("the
Tyrians") has dropped out. For this has nothing further in its favour
than the most improbable assumption, that king Hiram gathered together
the subjects of his whole kingdom to take part in Solomon's buildings. -
The addition of τρία ἔτη, which is added by the lxx at the end of the
verse, does not warrant the assumption of Thenius and Bttcher, that
שׁנים שׁלשׁ has dropped out of the text. For it is obvious that the lxx
have merely made their addition e conjectura, and indeed have concluded
that, as the foundation for the temple was laid in the fourth year of
Solomon's reign, the preliminary work must have occupied the first three
years of his reign.)
