### [Haggai Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md)

[Haggai 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hag 1:1</span></span>

In [Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md) this address is introduced
by a statement of the time at which it had been delivered, and the
persons to whom it was addressed. The word of Jehovah was uttered
through the prophet in the second year of king Darius, on the first day
of the sixth month. דּריושׁ answers to the name Dâryavush or Dârayavush
of the arrow-headed inscriptions; it is derived from the Zendic dar,
Sanskrit dhri, contracted into dhar, and is correctly explained by
Herodotus (vi. 98) as signifying ἑρξείης = corcitor. It is written in
Greek Δαρεῖος (Darius). The king referred to is the king of Persia ([Ezr
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#005.md), [Ezr
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#024).md), the first of that name, i.e.,
Darius Hystaspes, who reigned from 521 to 486 b.c. That this is the king
meant, and not Darius Nothus, is evident from the fact that Zerubbabel
the Jewish prince, and Joshua the high priest, who had led back the
exiles from Babylon to Judaea in the reign of Cyrus, in the year 536
([Ezr 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008.md); [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002).md), might very well be still at the
head of the returned people in the second year of the reign of Darius
Hystaspes, i.e., in the year 520, but could not have been still living
in the reign of Darius Nothus, who did not ascend the throne till 113
years after the close of the captivity. Moreover, in [Hag
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md), Haggai presupposes that many of
his contemporaries had seen the temple of Solomon. Now, as that temple
had been destroyed in the year 588 or 587, there might very well be old
men still living under Darius Hystaspes, in the year 520, who had seen
that temple in their early days; but that could not be the case under
Darius Nothus, who ascended the Persian throne in the year 423. The
prophet addresses his word to the temporal and spiritual heads of the
nation, to the governor Zerubbabel and the high priest Joshua. זרבּבל is
written in many codd. זרוּבבל, and is either formed from זרוּי בבל, in
Babyloniam dispersus, or as the child, if born before the dispersion in
Babylonia, would not have received this name proleptically, probably
more correctly from זרוּע בּבל, in Babylonia satus s. genitus, in which
case the ע was assimilated to the ב when the two words were joined into
one, and ב received a dagesh. Zerubbabel (lxx Ζοροβάβελ) was the son of
Shealtil. שׁאלתּיאל is written in the same way in [Hag
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023.md); [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md); [Ezr
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md), and [Neh
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001.md); whereas in [Neh
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012.md) and [Neh
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#014.md), and [Hag
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#002.md), it is contracted into שׁלתּיאל.
She'altı̄'ēl, i.e., the prayer of God, or one asked of God in prayer,
was, according to [Ch1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md), if we
take 'assı̄r as an appellative, a son of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin), or, if we
take 'assı̄r as a proper name, a son of Assir the son of Jeconiah, and
therefore a grandson of Jehoiachin. But, according to [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md), Zerubbabel was a son of Pedaiah,
a brother of Shealtiel. And lastly, according to the genealogy in [Luk
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#027.md), Shealtiel was not a son of
either Assir or Jeconiah, but of Neri, a descendant of David through his
son Nathan. These three divergent accounts, according to which
Zerubbabel was (1) a son of Shealtil, (2) a son of Pedaiah, the brother
of Shealtil, and a grandson of Assir or Jeconiah, (3) a son of Shealtil
and grandson of Neri, may be brought into harmony by means of the
following combinations, if we bear in mind the prophecy of Jeremiah
([Jer 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#030).md), that Jeconiah would be
childless, and not be blessed with having one of his seed sitting upon
the throne of David and ruling over Judah. Since this prophecy of
Jeremiah was fulfilled, according to the genealogical table given by
Luke, inasmuch as Shealtil's father there is not Assir or Jeconiah, a
descendant of David in the line of Solomon, but Neri, a descendant of
David's son Nathan, it follows that neither of the sons of Jeconiah
mentioned in [Ch1 3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md) (Zedekiah
and Assir) had a son, but that the latter had only a daughter, who
married a man of the family of her father's tribe, according to the law
of the heiresses, [Num 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#008.md); [Num
36:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#008.md) - namely Neri, who belonged to
the tribe of Judah and family of David. From this marriage sprang
Shealtil, Malkiram, Pedaiah, and others. The eldest of these took
possession of the property of his maternal grandfather, and was regarded
in law as his (legitimate) son. Hence he is described in [Ch1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md) as the son of Assir the son of
Jeconiah, whereas in Luke he is described, according to his lineal
descent, as the son of Neri. But Shealtil also appears to have died
without posterity, and simply to have left a widow, which necessitated a
Levirate marriage on the part of one of the brothers ([Deu
25:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md); [Mat
22:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#024).md). Shealtil's second brother
Pedaiah appears to have performed his duty, and to have begotten
Zerubbabel and Shimei by this sister-in-law ([Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019).md), the former of whom, Zerubbabel,
was entered in the family register of the deceased uncle Shealtil,
passing as his (lawful) son and heir, and continuing his family. Koehler
holds essentially the same views (see his comm. on [Hag
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023).md).

Zerubbabel was pechâh, a Persian governor. The real meaning of this
foreign word is still a disputed point.

(Note: Prof. Spiegel (in Koehler on [Mal
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008).md) objects to the combination
attempted by Benfey, and transferred to the more modern lexicons, viz.,
with the Sanscrit paksha, a companion or friend (see at [Kg1
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015).md), on the ground that this word
(1) signifies wing in the Vedas, and only received the meaning side,
party, appendix, at a later period, and (2) does not occur in the
Eranian languages, from which it must necessarily have been derived.
Hence Spiegel proposes to connect it with pâvan (from the root pâ, to
defend or preserve: compare F. Justi, Hdb. der Zendsprache, p. 187),
which occurs in Sanskrit and Old Persian (cf. Khsatrapâvan = Satrap) at
the end of composite words, and in the Avesta as an independent word, in
the contracted form pavan. "It is quite possible that the dialectic form
pagvan (cf. the plural pachăvōth in [Neh
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#007.md), [Neh
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#009).md) may have developed itself from
this, like dregvat from drevat, and hvôgva from hvôva." Hence pechh
would signify a keeper of the government, or of the kingdom (Khsatra).)

In addition to his Hebrew name, Zerubbabel also bore the Chaldaean name
Sheshbazzar, as an officer of the Persian king, as we may see by
comparing [Ezr 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008.md), [Ezr
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#011.md); [Ezr
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#014.md), [Ezr
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#016.md), with [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md); [Ezr
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md), [Ezr
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md), and [Ezr
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002.md). For the prince of Judah,
Sheshbazzar, to whom Koresh directed the temple vessels brought from
Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to be delivered, and who brought them back
from Babylon to Jerusalem ([Ezr 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008.md),
[Ezr 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#011.md); [Ezr
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#014).md), and who laid the foundation for
the house of God, according to [Ezr
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#016.md), is called Zerubbabel in [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md), as the leader of the procession,
who not only laid the foundation for the temple, along with Joshua the
high priest, according to [Ezr 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md),
[Ezr 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md), but also resumed the
building of the temple, which had been suspended, in connection with the
same Joshua during the reign of Darius. The high priest Joshua
(Yehōshuă‛, in [Ezr 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md), [Ezr
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md); [Ezr
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#003), contracted into Yēshūă‛.md) was a
son of Jozadak, who had been carried away by the Chaldaeans to Babylon
([Ezr 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#011).md), and a grandson of the
high priest Seraiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar had caused to be executed at
Riblah in the year 588, after the conquest of Jerusalem ([Kg2
25:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md); [Jer
52:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024).md). The time given, "in the
sixth month," refers to the ordinary reckoning of the Jewish year
(compare [Zac 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007.md) and [Zac
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md), and [Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md) with [Neh
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md), where the name of the month is
given as well as the number). The first day, therefore, was the new
moon's day, which was kept as a feast-day not only by a special festal
sacrifice ([Num 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011)..md), but also by
the holding of a religious meeting at the sanctuary (compare [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013.md) and the remarks on [Kg2
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023).md). On this day Haggai might expect
some susceptibility on the part of the people for his admonition,
inasmuch as on such a day they must have been painfully and doubly
conscious that the temple of Jehovah was still lying in ruins
(Hengstenberg, Koehler).

[Haggai 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hag 1:2</span></span>

The prophet begins by charging the people with their unconcern about
building the house of God. [Hag 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002.md).
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: This people saith, It is not time to come,
the time for the house of Jehovah to be built." העם הזּה, iste populus,
not my people, or Jehovah's people, but hazzeh (this) in a contemptuous
sense. Of the two clauses, (a) "It is not time to come," and (b) "The
time of the house of Jehovah," the latter gives the more precise
definition of the former, the בּא (to come) being explained as meaning
the time to build the house of Jehovah. The meaning is simply this: the
time has not yet arrived to come and build the house of Jehovah; for לא
in this connection signifies "not yet," as in [Gen
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005.md); [Job
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#016.md). A distinction is drawn between
coming to the house of Jehovah and building the house, as in [Hag
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md). There is no ground, therefore,
for altering the text, as Hitzig proposes, inasmuch as the defective
mode of writing the infinitive בּא is by no means rare (compare, for
example, [Exo 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018.md); [Lev
14:48](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#048.md); [Num
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#009.md); [Kg1
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#028.md); [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001).md); and there is no foundation
whatever for the absurd rendering of the words of the text, "It is not
the time of the having arrived of the time of the house," etc. (Hitzig).

[Haggai 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hag 1:3</span></span>

The word of Jehovah is opposed in [Hag
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004.md) to this speech of the people; and
in order to give greater prominence to the antithesis, the introductory
formula, "The word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet thus," is
repeated in [Hag 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#003.md). In order to
appeal to the conscience of the people, God meets them with the question
in [Hag 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004.md) : "Is it time for you
yourselves to live in your houses wainscoted, whilst this house lies
waste?" The ה before עת is not the article, but ה interr. אתּם is added
to strengthen the pronoun (cf. Ges. 121, 3). Sephūnı̄m without the
article is connected with the noun, in the form of an apposition: in
your houses, they being wainscoted, i.e., with the inside walls covered
or inlaid with costly wood-work. Such were the houses of the rich and of
the more distinguished men (cf. [Jer
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014.md); [Kg1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#007).md). Living in such houses was
therefore a sing of luxury and comfort. והבּית וגו is a circumstantial
clause, which we should express by "whilst this house," etc. With this
question the prophet cuts off all excuse, on the ground that the
circumstances of the times, and the oppression under which they
suffered, did not permit of the rebuilding of the temple. If they
themselves lived comfortably in wainscoted houses, their civil and
political condition could not be so oppressive, that they could find in
that a sufficient excuse for neglecting to build the temple. Even if the
building of the temple had been prohibited by an edict of
Pseudo-Smerdes, as many commentators infer from Ezra 4:8-24, the reign
of this usurper only lasted a few months; and with his overthrow, and
the ascent of the throne by Darius Hystaspes, a change had taken place
in the principles of government, which might have induced the heads of
Judah, if the building of the house of God had rested upon their hearts
as it did upon the heart of king David ([Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md); [Psa
132:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#002).md), to take steps under the new
king to secure the revocation of this edict, and the renewal of the
command issued by Cyrus.

[Haggai 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hag 1:5</span></span>

After rebutting the untenable grounds of excuse, Haggai calls attention
in vv. 5, 6 to the curse with which God has punished, and is still
punishing, the neglect of His house. [Hag
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#005.md). "And now, thus saith Jehovah of
hosts, Set your heart upon your ways. [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md). Ye have sowed much, and brought
in little: ye eat, and not for satisfaction; drink, and not to be filled
with drink: ye clothe yourselves, and it does not serve for warming; and
the labourer for wages works for wages into a purse pierced with holes."
שׂימוּ לבבכם, a favourite formula with Haggai (cf. v. 7 and [Hag
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md), [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018).md). To set the heart upon one's
ways, i.e., to consider one's conduct, and lay it to heart. The ways are
the conduct, with its results. J. H. Michaelis has given it correctly,
"To your designs and actions, and their consequences." In their ways,
hitherto, they have reaped no blessing: they have sowed much, but
brought only a little into their barns. הבא, inf. abs., to bring in what
has been reaped, or bring it home. What is here stated must not be
restricted to the last two harvests which they had had under the reign
of Darius, as Koehler supposes, but applies, according to [Hag
2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md), to the harvests of many
years, which had turned out very badly. The inf. abs., which is used in
the place of the finite verb and determined by it, is continued in the
clauses which follow, אכול, etc. The meaning of these clauses is, not
that the small harvest was not sufficient to feed and clothe the people
thoroughly, so that they had to "cut their coat according to their
cloth," as Maurer and Hitzig suppose, but that even in their use of the
little that had been reaped, the blessing of God was wanting, as is not
only evident from the words themselves, but placed beyond the
possibility of doubt by [Hag 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md).

(Note: Calvin and Osiander see a double curse in [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md). The former says, "We know that
God punishes men in both ways, both by withdrawing His blessing, so that
the earth is parched, and the heaven gives no rain, and also, even when
there is a good supply of the fruits of the earth, by preventing their
satisfying, so that there is no real enjoyment of them. It often happens
that men collect what would be quite a sufficient quantity for food, but
for all that, are still always hungry. This kind of curse is seen the
more plainly when God deprives the bread and wine of their true virtue,
so that eating and drinking fail to support the strength.")

What they ate and drank did not suffice to satisfy them; the clothes
which they procured yielded no warmth; and the ages which the
day-labourer earned vanished just as rapidly as if it had been placed in
a bag full of holes (cf. [Lev 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md);
[Hos 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md); [Mic
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014).md). לו after לחם refers to the
individual who clothes himself, and is to be explained from the phrase
חם לי, "I am warm" ([Kg1 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001), etc..md).

[Haggai 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hag 1:7</span></span>

After this allusion to the visitation of God, the prophet repeats the
summons in [Hag 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#007.md), [Hag
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#008.md), to lay to heart their previous
conduct, and choose the way that is well-pleasing to God. [Hag
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#007.md). "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,
Direct your heart upon your ways. [Hag
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#008.md). Go up to the mountains and fetch
wood and build the house, and I will take pleasure therein and glorify
myself, saith Jehovah." Hâhâr (the mountain) is not any particular
mountain, say the temple mountain (Grotius, Maurer, Ros.), or Lebanon
(Cocceius, Ewald, etc.); but the article is used generically, and hâhâr
is simply the mountain regarded as the locality in which wood chiefly
grows (cf. [Neh 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#015).md). Fetching wood
for building is an individualizing expression for providing building
materials; so that there is no ground for the inference drawn by Hitzig
and many of the Rabbins, that the walls of the temple had been left
standing when it was destroyed, so that all that had to be done was to
renew the wood-work, - an inference at variance not only with the
reference made to the laying of the foundation of the temple in [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md) and [Ezr
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010.md), but also to the express
statement in the account sent by the provincial governor to king Darius
in [Ezr 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008.md), viz., that the house of
the great God was built with square stones, and that timber was laid in
the walls. וארצה־בּו, so will I take pleasure in it (the house); whereas
so long as it lay in ruins, God was displeased with it. ואכּבד, and I
will glorify myself, sc. upon the people, by causing my blessing to flow
to it again. The keri ואכּבדה is an unnecessary emendation, inasmuch as,
although the voluntative might be used (cf. Ewald, 350, a), it is not
required, and has not been employed, both because it is wanting in ארצה,
for the simple reason that the verbs לה do not easily admit of this form
(Ewald, 228, a), and also because it is not used in other instances,
where the same circumstances do not prevail (e.g., [Zac
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#003).md).

(Note: The later Talmudists, indeed, have taken the omission of the ה,
which stands for 5 when used as a numeral, as an indication that there
were five things wanting in the second temple: (1) the ark of the
covenant, with the atoning lid and the cherubim; (2) the sacred fire;
(3) the shechinah; (4) the Holy Spirit; (5) the Urim and Thummim
(compare the Babylonian tract Joma 21b, and Sal. ben Melech, Miclal
Jophi on [Hag 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#008))..md)

Ewald and Hitzig adopt this rendering, "that I may feel myself
honoured," whilst Maurer and Rckert translate it as a passive, "that I
may be honoured." But both of these views are much less in harmony with
the context, since what is there spoken of is the fact that God will
then turn His good pleasure to the people once more, and along with that
His blessing. How thoroughly this thought predominates, is evident from
the more elaborate description, which follows in [Hag
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md), of the visitation from God,
viz., the failure of crops and drought.

[Haggai 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hag 1:9</span></span>

"Ye looked out for much, and behold (it came) to little; and ye brought
it home, and I blew into it. Why? is the saying of Jehovah of hosts.
Because of my house, that it lies waste, whereas ye run every man for
his house. [Hag 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#010.md). Therefore the
heaven has withheld its dew on your account, that no dew fell, and the
earth has withheld her produce. [Hag
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#011.md). And I called drought upon the
earth, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine,
and upon the oil, and upon everything that the ground produces, and upon
men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands." The meaning
of [Hag 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md) is evident from the
context. The inf. abs. pânōh stands in an address full of emotion in the
place of the perfect, and, as the following clause shows, for the second
person plural. Ye have turned yourselves, fixed your eye upon much,
i.e., upon a rich harvest, והנּה־למעט, and behold the desired much
turned to little. Ye brought into the house, ye fetched home what was
reaped, and I blew into it, i.e., I caused it to fly away, like chaff
before the wind, so that there was soon none of it left. Here is a
double curse, therefore, as in [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md) : instead of much, but little was
reaped, and the little that was brought home melted away without doing
any good. To this exposition of the curse the prophet appends the
question יען מה, why, sc. has this taken place? that he may impress the
cause with the greater emphasis upon their hardened minds. For the same
reason he inserts once more, between the question and the answer, the
words "is the saying of Jehovah of hosts," that the answer may not be
mistaken for a subjective view, but laid to heart as a declaration of
the God who rules the world. The choice of the form מה for מה was
probably occasioned by the guttural ע in the יען, which is closely
connected with it, just as the analogous use of על־מה instead of על־מה
in [Isa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005.md); [Psa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013.md), and [Jer
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010.md), where it is not followed by a
word commencing with ע as in [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md); [Kg1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008.md); [Jer
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#008.md). The former have not been taken
into account at all by Ewald in his elaborate Lehrbuch (cf. 182, b). In
the answer given by God, "because of my house" (ya‛an bēthı̄) is placed
first for the sake of emphasis, and the more precise explanation
follows. אשׁר הוּא, "because it," not "that which." ואתּם וגו is a
circumstantial clause. לביתו ... רצים, not "every one runs to his
house," but "runs for his house," ל denoting the object of the running,
as in [Isa 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md) and [Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md). "When the house of Jehovah was
in question, they did not move from the spot; but if it concerned their
own house, they ran" (Koehler). In [Hag
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#010.md) and [Hag
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#011.md), the curse with which God
punished the neglect of His house is still further depicted, with an
evident play upon the punishment with which transgressors are threatened
in the law ([Lev 26:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md); [Deu
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017.md) and [Deu
28:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023).md). עליכם is not a dat. incomm.
(Hitzig), which is never expressed by על; but על is used either in a
causal sense, "on your account" (Chald.), or in a local sense, "over
you," after the analogy of [Deu 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023.md),
שׁמיך אשׁר על ראשׁך, in the sense of "the heaven over you will withold"
(Ros., Koehl.). It is impossible to decide with certainty between these
two. The objection to the first, that "on your account" would be
superfluous after על־כּן, has no more force than that raised by Hitzig
against the second, viz., that super would be מעל. There is no tautology
in the first explanation, but the עליכם, written emphatically at the
commencement, gives greater intensity to the threat: "on account of
you," you who only care for your own houses, the heaven witholds the
dew. And with the other explanation, מעל would only be required in case
עליכם were regarded as the object, upon which the dew ought to fall down
from above. כּלא, not "to shut itself up," but in a transitive sense,
with the derivative meaning to withhold or keep back; and mittâl, not
partitively "of the dew," equivalent to "a portion of it," but min in a
privative sense, "away from," i.e., so that no dew falls; for it is
inadmissible to take mittâl as the object, "to hold back along with the
dew," after the analogy of [Num 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#011.md)
(Hitzig), inasmuch as the accusative of the person is wanting, and in
the parallel clause כּלא is construed with the accus. rei. ואקרא in [Hag
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#011.md) is still dependent upon על־כּן.
The word chōrebh, in the sense of drought, applies strictly speaking
only to the land and the fruits of the ground, but it is also
transferred to men and beasts, inasmuch as drought, when it comes upon
all vegetation, affects men and beasts as well; and in this clause it
may be taken in the general sense of devastation. The word is carefully
chosen, to express the idea of the lex talionis. Because the Jews left
the house of God chârēbh, they were punished with chōrebh. The last
words are comprehensive: "all the labour of the hands" had reference to
the cultivation of the soil and the preparation of the necessities of
life.

[Haggai 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012.md)

The result of this reproof. - [Hag
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012.md). "Zerubbabel, and Joshua, and the
whole of the remnant of the people, hearkened to the voice of Jehovah
their God, and according to the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah
their God had sent him; and the people feared before Jehovah." "All the
remnant of the people" does not mean the rest of the nation besides
Zerubbabel and Joshua, in support of which Koehler refers to [Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md) and [Ch1
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#038.md), either here or in [Hag
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md) and [Hag
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#002.md), inasmuch as Zerubbabel as the
governor and prince of Judah, and Joshua as the high priest, are not
embraced under the idea of the "people" (‛âm), as in the case in the
passages quoted, where those who are described as the she'ērı̄th, or
remnant, are members or portions of the whole in question. The "remnant
of the people," as in [Zac 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006.md), is
that portion of the nation which had returned from exile as a small
gleaning of the nation, which had once been much larger. שׁמע בּקול, to
hearken to the voice, i.e., to lay to heart, so as to obey what was
heard. בּקול יי is still more minutely defined by ועל־דּברי וגו: "and
(indeed) according to the words of Haggai, in accordance with the fact
that Jehovah had sent him." This last clause refers to דּברי, which he
had to speak according to the command of God (Hitzig); cf. [Mic
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004.md). The first fruit of the hearing
was, that the people feared before Jehovah; the second is mentioned in
[Hag 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md), namely, that they resumed
the neglected building of the temple. Their fearing before Jehovah
presupposes that they saw their sin against God, and discerned in the
drought a judgment from God.

[Haggai 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hag 1:13</span></span>

This penitential state of mind on the part of the people and their
rulers was met by the Lord with the promise of His assistance, in order
to elevate this disposition into determination and deed. [Hag
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013.md). "Then spake Haggai, the
messenger of Jehovah, in the message of Jehovah to the people, thus: I
am with you, is the saying of Jehovah. [Hag
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md). And Jehovah stirred up the
spirit of Zerubbabel, and the spirit of Joshua, and the spirit of all
the remnant of the nation; and they came and did work at the house of
Jehovah of hosts, their God." The prophet is called מלאך in [Hag
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013.md), i.e., messenger (not "angel," as
many in the time of the fathers misunderstood the word as meaning), as
being sent by Jehovah to the people, to make known to them His will
(compare [Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md), where the same
epithet is applied to the priest). As the messenger of Jehovah, he
speaks by command of Jehovah, and not in his own name or by his own
impulse. אני אתּכם, I am with you, will help you, and will remove all
the obstacles that stand in the way of your building (cf. [Hag
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#004).md). This promise Jehovah fulfilled,
first of all by giving to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the people, a
willingness to carry out the work. העיר רוּח, to awaken the spirit of
any man, i.e., to make him willing and glad to carry out His resolutions
(compare [Ch1 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md); [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md); [Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md), [Ezr
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005).md). Thus filled with joyfulness,
courage, and strength, they began the work on the twenty-fourth day of
the sixth month, in the second year of king Darius ([Hag
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015).md), that is to say, twenty-three
days after Haggai had first addressed his challenge to them. The
interval had been spent in deliberation and counsel, and in preparations
for carrying out the work. In several editions and some few mss in
Kennicott, in Tischendorf's edition of the lxx, in the Itala and in the
Vulgate, [Hag 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015.md) is joined to the
next chapter. But this is proved to be incorrect by the fact that the
chronological statements in [Hag 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015.md)
and [Hag 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md) are irreconcilable with
one another. [Hag 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015.md) is really so
closely connected with [Hag 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md), that
it is rather to be regarded as the last clause of that verse.
