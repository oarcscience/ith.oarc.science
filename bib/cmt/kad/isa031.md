### [Isaiah Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 31:1</span></span>

There is nothing to surprise us in the fact, that the prophet returns
again and again to the alliance with Egypt. After his warning had failed
to prevent it, he wrestled with it in spirit, set before himself afresh
the curse which would be its certain fruit, brought out and unfolded the
consolation of believers that lay hidden in the curse, and did not rest
till the cursed fruit, that had become a real thing, had been swallowed
up by the promise, which was equally real. The situation of this fourth
woe is just the same as that of the previous one. The alliance with
Egypt is still in progress. "Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help,
and rely upon horses, and put their trust in chariots, that there are
many of them; and in horsemen, that there is a powerful multitude of
them; and do not look up to the Holy One of Israel, and do not inquire
for Jehovah! And yet He also is wise; thus then He brings evil, and sets
not His words aside; and rises up against the house of miscreants, and
against the help of evil-doers. And Egypt is man, and not God; and its
horses flesh, and not spirit. And when Jehovah stretches out His hand,
the helper stumbles, and he that is helped falls, and they all perish
together." The expression "them that go down" (hayyōredı̄m) does not
imply that the going down was taking place just then for the first time.
It is the participle of qualification, just as God is called הבּרא.
לעזרה with Lamed of the object, as in [Isa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006.md). The horses, chariots, and
horsemen here, as those of Egypt, which Diodorus calls ἱππάσιμος, on
account of its soil being so suitable for cavalry (see Lepsius in
Herzog's Cyclopaedia). The participle is combined in the finite verb.
Instead of ועל־סוּסים, we also find the reading preferred by Norzi, of
על without Vav, as in [Isa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md) (cf.,
[Isa 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023).md). The perfects, שׁעוּ לא and
דרשׁוּ לא, are used without any definite time, to denote that which was
always wanting in them. The circumstantial clause, "whilst He is
assuredly also wise," i.e., will bear comparison with their wisdom and
that of Egypt, is a touching μείωσις. It was not necessary to think very
highly of Jehovah, in order to perceive the reprehensible and
destructive character of their apostasy from Him. The fut. consec. ויּבא
is used to indicate the inevitable consequence of their despising Him
who is also wise. He will not set aside His threatening words, but carry
them out. The house of miscreants is Judah ([Isa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004).md); and the help (abstr. pro concr.,
just as Jehovah is frequently called "my help," ‛ezrâthı̄, by the
Psalmist) of evil-doers is Egypt, whose help has been sought by Judah.
The latter is "man" ('âdâm), and its horses "flesh" (bâsâr); whereas
Jehovah is God (El) and spirit (rūăch; see Psychol. p. 85). Hofmann
expounds it correctly: "As ruuach has life in itself, it is opposed to
the bâsâr, which is only rendered living through the rūăch; and so El is
opposed to the corporeal 'âdâm, who needs the spirit in order to live at
all." Thus have they preferred the help of the impotent and conditioned,
to the help of the almighty and all-conditioning One. Jehovah, who is
God and spirit, only requires to stretch out His hand (an
anthropomorphism, by the side of which we find the rule for interpreting
it); and the helpers, and those who are helped (i.e., according to the
terms of the treaty, though not in reality), that is to say, both the
source of the help and the object of help, are all cast into one heap
together.

[Isaiah 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 31:4</span></span>

And things of this kind would occur. "For thus hath Jehovah spoken to
me, As the lion growls, and the young lion over its prey, against which
a whole crowd of shepherds is called together; he is not alarmed at
their cry, and does not surrender at their noise; so will Jehovah of
hosts descend to the campaign against the mountain of Zion, and against
their hill." There is no other passage in the book of Isaiah which
sounds so Homeric as this (vid., Il. xviii. 161, 162, xii. 299ff.). It
has been misunderstood by Knobel, Umbreit, Drechsler, and others, who
suppose על לצבּא to refer to Jehovah's purpose to fight for Jerusalem:
Jehovah, who would no more allow His city to be taken from Him, than a
lion would give up a lamb that it had taken as its prey. But how could
Jerusalem be compared to a lamb which a lion holds in its claws as
tereph? ([Isa 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#029).md). We may see, even
from [Isa 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md), what construction is
meant to be put upon על צבא. Those sinners and their protectors would
first of all perish; for like a fierce indomitable lion would Jehovah
advance against Jerusalem, and take it as His prey, without suffering
Himself to be thwarted by the Judaeans and Egyptians, who set themselves
in opposition to His army (The Assyrians). The mountain of Zion was the
citadel and temple; the hill of Zion the city of Jerusalem ([Isa
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#032).md). They would both be given up to
the judgment of Jehovah, without any possibility of escape. The
commentators have been misled by the fact, that a simile of a promising
character follows immediately afterwards, without anything to connect
the one with the other. But this abrupt μετάβασις was intended as a
surprise, and was a true picture of the actual fulfilment of the
prophecy; for in the moment of the greatest distress, when the actual
existence of Jerusalem was in question (cf., [Isa
10:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033).md), the fate of Ariel took
suddenly and miraculously a totally different turn ([Isa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002).md). In this sense, a pleasant
picture is placed side by side with the terrible one (compare [Mic
5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 31:5</span></span>

Jehovah suddenly arrests the work of punishment, and the love which the
wrath enfolds within itself begins to appear. "Like fluttering birds, so
will Jehovah of Hosts screen Jerusalem; screening and delivering,
sparing and setting free." The prophet uses the plural, "like fluttering
birds," with an object - namely, not so much to represent Jehovah
Himself, as the tender care and, as it were, maternal love, into which
His leonine fierceness would be changed. This is indicated by the fact,
that he attaches the feminine ‛âphōth to the common gender tsippŏrı̄m.
The word pâsōăch recals to mind the deliverance from Egypt (as in [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029).md) in a very significant manner.
The sparing of the Israelites by the destroyer passing over their doors,
from which the passover derived its name, would be repeated once more.
We may see from this, that in and along with Assyria, Jehovah Himself,
whose instrument of punishment Assyria was, would take the filed against
Jerusalem ([Isa 29:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002).md); but His
attitude towards Jerusalem is suddenly changed into one resembling the
action of birds, as they soar round and above their threatened nests. On
the inf. abs. kal (gânōn) after the hiphil, see Ewald, 312, b; and on
the continuance of the inf. abs. in the finite verb, 350, a. This
generally takes place through the future, but here through the
preterite, as in [Jer 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014.md); [Gen
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#013.md), and [Sa1
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#026.md) (if indeed vegâdēl is the third
pers. preterite there).

[Isaiah 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 31:6</span></span>

On the ground of this half terrible, half comforting picture of the
future, the call to repentance is now addressed to the people of the
prophet's own time. "Then turn, O sons of Israel, to Him from whom men
have so deeply departed." Strictly speaking, "to Him with regard to whom
(אשׁר) ye are deeply fallen away" (he‛ĕmı̄q, as in [Hos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009.md), and sârâh, that which is
alienated, alienation, as in [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005).md); the transition to the third
person is like the reverse in [Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md). This call to repentance the
prophet strengthens by two powerful motives drawn from the future.

[Isaiah 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 31:7</span></span>

The first is, that idolatry would one day be recognised in all its
abomination, and put away. "For in that day they will abhor every one
their silver idols and their gold idols, which your hands have made you
for a sin," i.e., to commit sin and repent, with the preponderance of
the latter idea, as in [Hos 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md)
(compare [Kg1 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#034).md). חטא, a second
accusative to עשׂוּ, indicating the result. The prospect is the same as
that held out in [Isa 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022.md); [Isa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009.md); [Isa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008.md); [Isa
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020.md).

[Isaiah 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 31:8</span></span>

The second motive is, that Israel will not be rescued by men, but by
Jehovah alone; so that even He from whom they have now so deeply fallen
will prove Himself the only true ground of confidence. "And Asshur falls
by a sword not of a man, and a sword not of a man will devour him; and
he flees before a sword, and his young men become tributary. And his
rock, for fear will it pass away, and his princes be frightened away by
the flags: the saying of Jehovah, who has His fire in Zion, and His
furnace in Jerusalem." The lxx and Jerome render this falsely φεύξεται
οὐκ (לא) ἀπὸ προσώπου μαχαίρας. לו is an ethical dative, and the prophet
intentionally writes "before a sword" without any article, to suggest
the idea of the unbounded, infinite, awful (cf., [Isa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002), beyâd; Psalter, vol. i. p. 15.md).
A sword is drawn without any human intervention, and before this Asshur
falls, or at least so many of the Assyrians as are unable to save
themselves by flight. The power of Asshur is for ever broken; even its
young men will henceforth become tributary, or perform feudal service.
By "his rock" most commentators understand the rock upon which the
fugitive would gladly have taken refuge, but did not dare (Rosenmller,
Gesenius, Knobel, etc.); others, again, the military force of Asshur, as
its supposed invincible refuge (Saad., etc.); others, the apparently
indestructible might of Asshur generally (Vulgate, Rashi, Hitzig). But
the presence of "his princes" in the parallel clause makes it most
natural to refer "his rock" to the king; and this reference is
established with certainty by what [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md) affirms of the king and princes
of Judah. Luther also renders it thus: und jr Fels wird fur furcht
wegzihen (and their rock will withdraw for fear). Sennacherib really did
hurry back to Assyria after the catastrophe in a most rapid flight.
Minnēs are the standards of Asshur, which the commanders of the army fly
away from in terror, without attempting to rally those that were
scattered. Thus speaks Jehovah, and this is what He decrees who has His
'ūr and tannūr in Jerusalem. We cannot suppose that the allusion here is
to the fire and hearth of the sacrifices; for tannūr does not mean a
hearth, but a furnace (from nūr, to burn). The reference is to the light
of the divine presence, which was outwardly a devouring fire for the
enemies of Jerusalem, an unapproachable red-hot furnace (ignis et
caminus qui devorat peccatores et ligna, faenum stipulamque consumit:
Jerome).
