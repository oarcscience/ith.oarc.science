### [Genesis Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 48:1</span></span>

Adoption of Joseph's Sons. - [Gen
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001.md), [Gen
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#002.md). After these events, i.e., not
long after Jacob's arrangements for his burial, it was told to Joseph
(ויּאמר "one said," cf. [Gen 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#002).md)
that his father was taken ill; whereupon Joseph went to him with his two
sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, who were then 18 or 20 years old. On his
arrival being announced to Jacob, Israel made himself strong (collected
his strength), and sat up on his bed. The change of names is as
significant here as in [Gen 45:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#027.md).
Jacob, enfeebled with age, gathered up his strength for a work, which he
was about to perform as Israel, the bearer of the grace of the promise.

[Genesis 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 48:3</span></span>

Referring to the promise which the Almighty God had given him at Bethel
([Gen 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#010.md). cf. [Gen
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#013)..md), Israel said to Joseph ([Gen
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005).md): "And now thy two sons, which
were born to thee in the land of Egypt, until (before) I came to thee
into Egypt...let them be mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, like Reuben and
Simeon (my first and second born), let them be mine." The promise which
Jacob had received empowered the patriarch to adopt the sons of Joseph
in the place of children. Since the Almighty God had promised him the
increase of his seed into a multitude of peoples, and Canaan as an
eternal possession to that seed, he could so incorporate into the number
of his descendants the two sons of Joseph who were born in Egypt before
his arrival, and therefore outside the range of his house, that they
should receive an equal share in the promised inheritance with his own
eldest sons. But this privilege was to be restricted to the two
first-born sons of Joseph. "Thy descendants," he proceeds in [Gen
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#006.md), "which thou hast begotten since
them, shall be thine; by the name of their brethren shall they be called
in their inheritance;" i.e., they shall not form tribes of their own
with a separate inheritance, but shall be reckoned as belonging to
Ephraim and Manasseh, and receive their possessions among these tribes,
and in their inheritance. These other sons of Joseph are not mentioned
anywhere; but their descendants are at any rate included in the families
of Ephraim and Manasseh mentioned in [Num
26:28-37](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#028.md); 1 Chron 7:14-29. By this
adoption of his two eldest sons, Joseph was placed in the position of
the first-born, so far as the inheritance was concerned ([Ch1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002).md). Joseph's mother, who had died so
early, was also honoured thereby. And this explains the allusion made by
Jacob in [Gen 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007.md) to his beloved
Rachel, the wife of his affections, and to her death-how she died by his
side (עלי), on his return from Padan (for Padan-Aram, the only place in
which it is so called, cf. [Gen
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020).md), without living to see her
first-born exalted to the position of a saviour to the whole house of
Israel.

[Genesis 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 48:8</span></span>

The Blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh. - [Gen
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#008.md). Jacob now for the first time
caught sight of Joseph's sons, who had come with him, and inquired who
they were; for "the eyes of Israel were heavy (dim) with age, so that he
could not see well" ([Gen 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#010).md). The
feeble old man, too, may not have seen the youths for some years, so
that he did not recognise them again. On Joseph's answering, "My sons
whom God hath given he mere," he replied, "Bring them to me then
(קחם־נא), that I may bless them;" and he kissed and embraced them, when
Joseph had brought them near, expressing his joy, that whereas he never
expected to see Joseph's face again, God had permitted him to see his
seed. ראה for ראות, like עשׂו ([Gen
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#028).md). עלּל: to decide; here, to
judge, to think.

[Genesis 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 48:12</span></span>

Joseph then, in order to prepare his sons for the reception of the
blessing, brought them from between the knees of Israel, who was sitting
with the youths between his knees and embracing them, and having
prostrated himself with his face to the earth, he came up to his father
again, with Ephraim the younger on his right hand, and Manasseh the
elder on the left, so that Ephraim stood at Jacob's right hand, and
Manasseh at his left.

[Genesis 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 48:14</span></span>

The patriarch then stretched out his right hand and laid it upon
Ephraim's head, and placed his left upon the head of Manasseh (crossing
his arms therefore), to bless Joseph in his sons. "Guiding his hands
wittingly;" i.e., he placed his hands in this manner intentionally.
Laying on the hand, which is mentioned here for the first time in the
Scriptures, was a symbolical sign, by which the person acting
transferred to another a spiritual good, a supersensual power or gift;
it occurs elsewhere in connection with dedication to an office ([Num
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018.md), [Num
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#023.md); [Deu
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#009.md); [Mat
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#013.md); [Act
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006.md); [Act
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#017), etc..md), with the sacrifices, and
with the cures performed by Christ and the apostles. By the imposition
of hands, Jacob transferred to Joseph in his sons the blessing which he
implored for them from his own and his father's God: "The God
(Ha-Elohim) before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God
(Ha-Elohim) who hath fed me (led and provided for me with a shepherd's
faithfulness, [Psa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md); [Psa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#009).md) from my existence up to this
day, the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads." This
triple reference to God, in which the Angel who is placed on an equality
with Ha-Elohim cannot possibly be a created angel, but must be the
"Angel of God," i.e., God manifested in the form of the Angel of
Jehovah, or the "Angel of His face" ([Isa
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009).md), contains a foreshadowing of the
Trinity, though only God and the Angel are distinguished, not three
persons of the divine nature. The God before whom Abraham and Isaac
walked, had proved Himself to Jacob to be "the God which fed" and "the
Angel which redeemed," i.e., according to the more fully developed
revelation of the New Testament, ὁ Θεός and ὁ λόγος, Shepherd and
Redeemer. By the singular יברך (bless, benedicat) the triple mention of
God is resolved into the unity of the divine nature. Non dicit (Jakob)
benedicant, pluraliter, nec repetit sed conjungit in uno opere
benedicendi tres personas, Deum Patrem, Deum pastorem et Angelum. Sunt
igitur hi tres unus Deus et unus benedictor. Idem opus facit Angelus
quod pastor et Deus Patrum (Luther). "Let my name be named on them, and
the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac," i.e., not, "they shall bear
my name and my fathers'," "dicantur filii mei et patrum meorum, licet ex
te nati sint" (Rosenm.), which would only be another way of
acknowledging his adoption of them, "nota adoptionis" (Calvin); for as
the simple mention of adoption is unsuitable to such a blessing, so the
words appended, "and according to the name of my fathers Abraham and
Isaac," are still less suitable as a periphrasis for adoption. The
thought is rather: the true nature of the patriarchs shall be discerned
and acknowledged in Ephraim and Manasseh; in them shall those blessings
of grace and salvation be renewed, which Jacob and his fathers Isaac and
Abraham received from God. The name expressed the nature, and "being
called" is equivalent to "being, and being recognised by what one is."
The salvation promised to the patriarchs related primarily to the
multiplication into a great nation, and the possession of Canaan. Hence
Jacob proceeds: "and let them increase into a multitude in the midst of
the land." דּגה: ἁπ λεγ, "to increase," from which the name דּג, a fish,
is derived, on account of the remarkable rapidity with which they
multiply.

[Genesis 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 48:17</span></span>

When Joseph observed his father placing his right hand upon the head of
Ephraim, the younger son, he laid hold of it to put it upon Manasseh's
head, telling his father at the same time that he was the first-born;
but Jacob replied, "I know, my son, I know: he also (Manasseh) will
become a nation, and will become great, yet (ואוּלם as in [Gen
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019).md) his younger brother will become
greater than he, and his seed will become the fulness of nations." This
blessing began to be fulfilled from the time of the Judges, when the
tribe of Ephraim so increased in extent and power, that it took the lead
of the northern tribes and became the head of the ten tribes, and its
name acquired equal importance with the name Israel, whereas under
Moses, Manasseh had numbered 20,000 more than Ephraim ([Num
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#034.md) and [Num
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#037).md). As a result of the promises
received from God, the blessing was not merely a pious wish, but the
actual bestowal of a blessing of prophetic significance and force. - In
[Gen 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020.md) the writer sums up the
entire act of blessing in the words of the patriarch: "In thee (i.e.,
Joseph) will Israel (as a nation) bless, saying: God make thee as
Ephraim and Manasseh" (i.e., Joseph shall be so blessed in his two sons,
that their blessing will become a standing form of benediction in
Israel); "and thus he placed Ephraim before Manasseh," viz., in the
position of his hands and the terms of the blessing. Lastly, ([Gen
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#021).md) Israel expressed to Joseph his
firm faith in the promise, that God would bring back his descendants
after his death into the land of their fathers (Canaan), and assigned to
him a double portion in the promised land, the conquest of which passed
before his prophetic glance as already accomplished, in order to insure
for the future the inheritance of the adopted sons of Joseph. "I give
thee one ridge of land above thy brethren" (i.e., above what thy
brethren receive, each as a single tribe), "which I take from the hand
of the Amorites with my sword and bow" (i.e., by force of arms). As the
perfect is used prophetically, transposing the future to the present as
being already accomplished, so the words לקחתּי אשׁר must also be
understood prophetically, as denoting that Jacob would wrest the land
from the Amorites, not in his own person, but in that of his posterity.

(Note: There is no force in Kurtz's objection, that this gift did not
apply to Joseph as the father of Ephraim and Manasseh, but to Joseph
personally; for it rests upon the erroneous assumption, that Jacob
separated Joseph from his sons by their adoption. But there is not a
word to that effect in [Gen 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#006.md), and
the very opposite in [Gen 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015.md), viz.,
that Jacob blessed Joseph in Ephraim and Manasseh. Heim's conjecture,
which Kurtz approves, that by the land given to Joseph we are to
understand the high land of Gilead, which Jacob had conquered from the
Amorites, needs no refutation, for it is purely imaginary.)

The words cannot refer to the purchase of the piece of ground at Shechem
([Gen 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019).md), for a purchase could not
possibly be called a conquest by sword and bow; and still less to the
crime committed by the sons of Jacob against the inhabitants of Shechem,
when they plundered the town ([Gen
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#025)..md), for Jacob could not possibly
have attributed to himself a deed for which he had pronounced a curse
upon Simeon and Levi ([Gen 49:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006).md),
not to mention the fact, that the plundering of Shechem was not followed
in this instance by the possession of the city, but by the removal of
Jacob from the neighbourhood. "Moreover, any conquest of territory would
have been entirely at variance with the character of the patriarchal
history, which consisted in the renunciation of all reliance upon human
power, and a believing, devoted trust in the God of the promises"
(Delitzsch). The land, which the patriarchs desired to obtain in Canaan,
they procured not by force of arms, but by legal purchase (cf. Gen 24
and [Gen 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019).md). It was to be very
different in the future, when the iniquity of the Amorites was full
([Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016).md). But Jacob called the
inheritance, which Joseph was to have in excess of his brethren, שׁכם
(lit., shoulder, or more properly nape, neck; here figuratively a ridge,
or tract of land), as a play upon the word Shechem, because he regarded
the piece of land purchased at Shechem as a pledge of the future
possession of the whole land. In the piece purchased there, the bones of
Joseph were buried, after the conquest of Canaan ([Jos
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#032).md); and this was understood in
future times, as though Jacob had presented the piece of ground to
Joseph (vid., [Joh 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#005).md).
