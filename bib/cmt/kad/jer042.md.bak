### [Jeremiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 42:0</span></span>

The Word of God Concerning the Flight to Egypt

At the halting-place near Bethlehem the captains and the people whom
they led deem it necessary to inquire through Jeremiah as to the will of
God regarding their intention; they betake themselves to the prophet
with the request that he would address God in prayer for them regarding
this matter, and they promise that they will, in any case, comply with
the message that he may receive from God ([Jer
42:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001).md). Whereupon, after ten days,
the word of the Lord came to the prophet, vv. 7-22, to the effect that,
if they remained in the country, the Lord would take pity on them and
protect them from the Chaldeans, and establish them; but, should they go
to Egypt, against the will of the Lord, then the evil which they feared
would follow them thither, so that they would perish by the sword,
hunger, and pestilence.

[Jeremiah 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 42:1</span></span>

"And there drew near all the captains, namely, Johanan the son of
Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people, from
little to great, [Jer 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002.md). And said
to Jeremiah the prophet, Let our supplication come before thee, and pray
for us to Jahveh thy God, for all this remnant (for we are left a few
out of many, as thine eyes see us); [Jer
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#003.md). That Jahveh thy God may tell us
the way in which we should go, and the thing that we should do." Of the
captains, two, viz., Johanan and Jezaniah, are mentioned as the leaders
of the people and the directors of the whole undertaking, who also, [Jer
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md)., insolently accuse the prophet
of falsehood, and carry out the proposed march to Egypt. Jezaniah is in
[Jer 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008.md) called the Maachathite; here
he is named in connection with his father, "the son of Hoshaiah;" while
in [Jer 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#002.md), in conjunction with
Johanan the son of Kareah, Azariah the son of Hoshaiah is mentioned,
which name the lxx also have in [Jer
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md) of this chapter. Hitzig, Ewald,
etc., are consequently of the opinion that יזניה in our verse has been
written by mistake for עזריה. But more probable is the supposition that
the error is in the עזריה of [Jer
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#002.md), inasmuch as there is no reason
to doubt the identity of Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah with the Jezaniah
descended from Maacha ([Jer 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008).md); and
the assumption that יזניה is incorrect in two passages ([Jer
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md) and [Jer
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008).md) is highly improbable. They go to
the prophet Jeremiah, whom they had taken with them from Mizpah, where
he was living among the people, with the rest of the inhabitants of the
place ([Jer 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016).md). תּפּל־נא as in
[Jer 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#020.md); see on [Jer
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md). The request made to the prophet
that he would intercede for them with the Lord, which they further urge
on the ground that the number left out of the whole people is small,
while there is implied in this the wish that God may not let this small
remnant also perish; - this request Nהgelsbach considers a piece of
hypocrisy, and the form of asking the prophet "a mere farce," since it
is quite plain from [Jer 43:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001.md) that
the desire to go to Egypt was already deeply rooted in their minds, and
from this they would not allow themselves to be moved, even by the
earnest warning of the prophet. But to hypocrites, who were playing a
mere farce with the prophet, the Lord would have probably replied in a
different way from what we find in [Jer
42:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#008.md). As the Searcher of hearts, He
certainly would have laid bare their hypocrisy. And however
unequivocally the whole address implies the existence of disobedience to
the voice of God, it yet contains nothing which can justify the
assumption that it was only in hypocrisy that they wished to learn the
will of God. We must therefore assume that their request addressed to
the prophet was made in earnest, although they expected that the Lord's
reply would be given in terms favourable to their intention. They wished
to obtain from God information as to which way they should go, and what
they should do, - not as to whether they should remain in the country or
go to Egypt. "The way that we should go" is, of course, not to be
understood literally, as if they merely wished to be told the road by
which they would most safely reach Egypt; neither, on the other hand,
are the words to be understood in a merely figurative sense, of the mode
of procedure they ought to pursue; but they are to be understood of the
road they ought to take in order to avoid the vengeance of the Chaldeans
which they dreaded, - in the sense, whither they ought to go, in order
to preserve their lives from the danger which threatened them.

[Jer 42:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004.md)

Jeremiah replies: "I have heard (i.e., acceded to your request); behold,
I will pray to Jahveh your God, according to your words; and it shall
come to pass that whatever Jahveh answers you I will tell you, I will
not keep anything from you." [Jer
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#005.md). They said further: "Let Jahveh
be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not just according
to all the word which Jahveh thy God shall send thee (to declare) unto
us. [Jer 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#006.md). Whether it be good or
bad, we shall obey the voice of Jahveh our God, to whom we send thee,
that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of Jahveh our God."
עד, [Pro 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#025.md), and נאמן, [Isa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#002.md); [Psa
89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md). Both predicates occupy emphatic
positions. God is to be a faithful witness, not in regard to the truth
of what they say, but as regards the fulfilment of their promise, so
that, if they would not obey His word, He might come forward to punish
them. ישׁלחך is construed with a double accusative: to send away a
person with something, i.e., to give him a commission. After "whether it
be good or evil," there is no need for supplying "in our eyes"
(בּעינינוּ), as Hitzig and Graf allege: "whether it please us or not;"
the subject is הדּבר: "we will obey the word, whether it be good or
evil," i.e., whether it announce good or evil to come (cf. [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014).md). The Kethib אנוּ occurs only in
this passage in the Old Testament; the Qeri accordingly substitutes
אנחנוּ: the former, however, is taken from the vulgar tongue, and should
not be altered here. כּי נשׁמע does not mean "because we obey," but
"when we obey." The hearing is the condition, not the cause of the
prosperity.

[Jeremiah 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 42:7</span></span>

The word of the Lord. - At the end of ten days, the reply that had been
asked for came from the Lord. Hitzig and Graf think that Jeremiah had
lingered ten days with the answer, in order to obtain strong and clear
conviction, "matured through his own meditation, probably also in part
confirmed by the arrival of further news." This opinion is characterized
by Ngelsbach as "in harmony with modern science, but unhistorical;" it
should rather be called unscriptural, as resting on a denial of divine
inspiration. The reason why the Lord did not make known His will to the
prophet for ten days was a disciplinary one. By waiting, those who asked
would get time for bethinking themselves, and for quietly considering
the situation of affairs, so that they might be able, calmly and
collectedly, to receive and obey the answer of God, which was far from
satisfying the fears and wishes of their heart. [Jer
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#008.md). Jeremiah called the captains and
all the people together, and announced to them as follows: [Jer
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#009.md). "Thus saith Jahveh, the God of
Israel, to whom ye have sent me, that I might bring your supplication
before Him: [Jer 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010.md). If ye will
indeed abide in this land, then will I build you up and not pull down;
and I will plant you, but not root out; for I repent of the evil that I
have done to you. [Jer 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#011.md). Be not
afraid of the king of Babylon, whom ye fear, be not afraid of him, saith
Jahveh; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you out of his
hand. [Jer 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#012.md). And I will get pity
for you, so that he shall take pity on you, and bring you back to your
land. [Jer 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#013.md). But if ye say, We
will not remain in this land, so that ye will not obey the voice of
Jahveh your God, [Jer 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#014.md). Saying,
Nay, but we will go to the land of Egypt, that we may not see war nor
hear the wound of a trumpet, and we shall not hunger after bread, and we
will dwell there. - [Jer 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#015.md). Now
therefore hear the word of Jahveh, ye remnant of Judah: Thus saith
Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, If ye do indeed set your face to go
to Egypt, and go to sojourn there, [Jer
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#016.md). Then shall the sword, of which
ye are afraid, overtake you there, in the land of Egypt, and hunger,
which ye dread, shall there follow hard after you, in Egypt, and there
shall ye die. [Jer 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#017.md). And all the
men who have set their face to go to Egypt, to sojourn there, shall die
by the sword, and through hunger, and from the plague; nor shall they
have any one left or escaped from the evil which I will bring on them.
[Jer 42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018.md). For thus saith Jahveh of
hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath were poured out
upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured out upon
you when ye go to Egypt, and ye shall become an execration, and an
astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach, and ye shall not see this
place again. - [Jer 42:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019.md). Jahveh hath
spoken to you, O remnant of Judah. Go not to Egypt: ye shall know for
certain that I have warned you to-day. [Jer
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#020.md). For ye err at the risk of your
souls when ye sent me to Jahveh your God, saying, Pray for us to Jahveh
our God, and according to all that Jahveh our God shall say to us, so
tell us, and we will do it. [Jer
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#021.md). Now I have told you to-day, and
ye have not obeyed the voice of Jahveh your God, nor in anything for
which He hath sent me unto you. [Jer
42:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#022.md). Now, therefore, ye must surely
know that ye shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the
place whither ye have been pleased to go to sojourn."

The Lord's reply extends as far as [Jer
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018); the last four verses (19-22.md)
form an epilogue, a further address by the prophet, in which he once
more specially impresses God's resolution on the minds of the people.
The answer of God consists (1) in the promise that, if they will remain
in the land, the Lord is willing to build them up, and protect them from
the wrath of the king of Babylon ([Jer
42:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#009)); and (2.md) the threat that, if
they will go to Egypt against the advice and will of the Lord, they
shall certainly perish there by the sword, famine, and pestilence ([Jer
42:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#013).md). On the expression הפּיל
תּהנּה, see on [Jer 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md). שׁוב ([Jer
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010).md) can only be inf. abs. of ישׁב,
for ישׁוב ; if we view it as coming from שׁוּב morf , we get no suitable
meaning, for the thought si revertendo illuc manseritis in hc terr (C.
B. Michaelis) could not be expressed by שׁוב תּשׁבוּ. Certainly there is
no other instance of such a form as שׁוב being used for ישׁוב; in a verb
like ישׁב, however, which drops the י in the inf. constr., a like
omission in the inf. abs. is quite conceivable, while the supposition of
some injury having been done to the text (Olshausen, Gram. 89) is less
probable. On the expression, "I will build you," etc., cf. [Jer
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006.md); [Jer
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#004.md); [Jer
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007.md). "I repent of the evil" is an
anthropopathic expression for the cancelling of a penal sentence: cf.
[Joe 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014.md), etc. - In [Jer
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#011.md), the repetition of the words "do
not fear him" produces special emphasis.

[Jeremiah 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 42:12</span></span>

"I shall give you compassion," i.e., obtain it for you, so that the king
of Babylon will show pity on you; cf. [Gen
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014.md); [Kg1
8:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050.md). J. D. Michaelis, Hitzig, Ewald,
and Graf, following the lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac, would change והשׁיב
into הושׁיב (make you dwell); but there is no necessity for this, since
השׁיב makes good enough sense, provided we refer it, not to the return
of those who had been exiled to Babylon, but, as the connection
requires, to the departure from Mizpah, after the half near Bethlehem,
in the intended flight to Egypt; we must, besides, view this departure
as a complete forsaking of their country, and the leaders in this
emigration as being fugitives who had fled before the Chaldeans, and had
returned only a short time before, for the purpose of settling down
again in the country.

[Jeremiah 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 42:13</span></span>

The threatening if, in spite of warning and against God's will, they
should still persist in going to Egypt. The protasis of the conditional
sentence begun in [Jer 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#013.md), "If ye
say," etc., extends onwards through [Jer
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#014.md); the apodosis is introduced
co-ordinately with the commencement of [Jer
42:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#015.md), "Now therefore," etc. קול
שׁופר, "the sound of war-trumpet," as in [Jer
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md). On "hungering after bread," cf.
[Amo 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011). הלחם (with the article.md) is
the bread necessary for life. "The remnant of Judah" is to be understood
of those who still remained in the land, as is shown by [Jer
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002.md); see also [Jer
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019.md), [Jer
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#005.md); [Jer
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#012.md), [Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014.md). The warning given in [Jer
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#016.md) contains the idea that the very
evil which they feared would come on them in Judah will befall them in
Egypt. There they shall perish by sword, famine, and plague, since
Nebuchadnezzar will conquer Egypt; cf. [Jer
43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008.md).

[Jeremiah 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 42:17</span></span>

ויהיוּ, used instead of the impersonal והיה, is referred to the
following subject by a rather unusual kind of attraction; cf. Ewald,
345, b. All the men who set their faces, i.e., intend, to go to Egypt
shall perish; not a single one shall escape the evil; for the same
judgment of wrath which has befallen Jerusalem shall also come on those
who flee to Egypt; cf. [Jer 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#020.md). On
the expression "ye shall become a curse," etc., cf. [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md); [Jer
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md); [Jer
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018.md).

Taking for granted that the leaders of the people will not obey,
Jeremiah appends to the word of the Lord an earnest address, in which
several points are specially insisted on, viz., that the Lord had spoken
to them, that He had forbidden them to go to Egypt, and that he (the
prophet), by proclaiming the word of the Lord, had warned them (העיד בּ,
to testify, bear witness against a person, i.e., warn him of something,
cf. [Jer 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007).md). Thus he discloses to
them the dangerous mistake they are in, when they first desire some
expression of the mind of the Lord regarding their intentions, and, in
the hope that He will accede to their request, promise unconditional
obedience to whatever He may direct, but afterwards, when they have
received a message from the Lord, will not obey it, because it is
contrary to what they wish. The Kethib התעתים has been incorrectly
written for התעיים, the Hiphil from תּעה, to err; here, as in [Pro
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017.md), it means to make a mistake.
בּנפשׁותיכם, not, "you mislead your own selves," decepistis animas
vestras (Vulg.), nor "in your souls," - meaning, in your thoughts and
intentions (Ngelsbach), - but "at the risk of your souls," your life;
cf. [Jer 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021.md). וּלכל אשׁר ([Jer
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#021).md), "and that in regard to all
that for which Jahveh has sent me to you," points back to their promise,
[Jer 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#005.md), that they would do
"according to all the word." By employing the perfect in [Jer
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#020.md), [Jer
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#021.md), the thing is represented as
quite certain, as if it had already taken place. [Jer
42:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#022.md) concludes the warning with a
renewed threat of the destruction which shall befall them for their
disobedience.
