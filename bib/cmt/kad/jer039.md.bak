### [Jeremiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 39:1</span></span>

In [Jer 39:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md) the events which took
place at the taking of Jerusalem are summarily related, for the purpose
of showing how the announcements of Jeremiah the prophet have been
fulfilled.

(Note: The greater portion of the section [Jer
39:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md) is set down by Movers, Hitzig,
Ewald, and Graf as the interpolation of a later glosser, compiled either
out of [Jer 52:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004.md), or from 2 Kings
25. [Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md), [Jer
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011.md), [Jer
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#012.md), and [Jer
39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014.md) are supposed by Hitzig to be all
that are genuine, on the ground that these are the only portions
containing independent statements, not derived from any other source.
They treat simply of the person of the prophet, and state how, at the
command of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the body-guard,
brought Jeremiah out of the court of the prison and delivered him over
to the care of Gedaliah. If we gather together the verses that are left
as genuine, we find, of course, that the subject treated of in them is
what occurred when Jeremiah was liberated from his confinement in the
court of the prison. But neither is the difference between [Jer
39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014.md) and [Jer
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001.md). thereby settled, nor the
difficulty removed, that Nebuzaradan, the captain of the body-guard, was
not present with the army when Jerusalem was taken; according to [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md), it was not till a month after
that event that he was sent to Jerusalem from Riblah by the king, who
was staying there. [Jer 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011.md) and [Jer
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#012.md), too, retain the appearance of
being interpolations. Ewald and Graf, accordingly, consider these two
verses also as later insertions. But even this view does not settle the
differences and difficulties that have been raised, but only increases
them; for it would represent Jeremiah as being set at liberty, not by
Nebuzaradan, as is related [Jer 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001.md).,
but by the Chaldean generals named in [Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md). - When, however, we inquire into
the grounds taken as the foundation of this hypothesis, the fact that
the lxx have omitted [Jer 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md), [Jer
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010.md), and [Jer
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013.md) can prove nothing, since [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md) and [Jer
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002.md) are found in the lxx, although
these also are supposed to be spurious. The only argument adduced for
the attempted excision, viz., that [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md), [Jer
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002.md), [Jer
39:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md) break the connection, proves
absolutely nothing in itself, but merely receives importance on the
supposition that the present section could only treat of the liberation
of Jeremiah, and must contain nothing that is mentioned elsewhere
regarding the taking of Jerusalem. But this supposition is quite
unwarranted. That [Jer 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md) and [Jer
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002.md) are inserted parenthetically
cannot afford any ground of suspicion as regards their genuineness; and
that, in [Jer 39:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md), mention is
briefly made of Zedekiah's being seized and condemned, of the
destruction of Jerusalem, and the carrying away of the people, except
the very meanest, - this also cannot throw suspicion on the genuineness
of these verses; fore these statements obviously aim at showing how the
word of the Lord, which Jeremiah had proclaimed repeatedly, and once
more a short time before the storming of the city, had been fulfilled.
Finally, it follows from this that these statements agree with those
given in Jer 52 and in 2 Kings regarding the capture and destruction of
Jerusalem; but it does not follow that they have been derived from the
latter as their source. The language in the disputed verses is
peculiarly that of Jeremiah. The expression כּל־חרי יהוּדה is found in
[Jer 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020.md); while in [Jer
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010.md), instead of it, we find
כּל־שׂרי, and in 2 Kings the whole sentence is wanting. So, also, דּבּר
משׁפּטים, [Jer 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md) and [Jer
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009.md), is an expression peculiar to
Jeremiah (see on [Jer 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016).md); in [Kg2
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006.md) it is changed to דּבּר משׁפּט.
Thus we must set down as groundless and erroneous the allegation made by
Hitzig and Graf, that these verses of our chapter have been derived from
2 Kings; for the form of the name Nebuchadnezzar (with n) in [Jer
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md) instead of Nebuchadrezzar, which
agrees with 2 Kings, and which has been brought to bear on this
question, can prove nothing, just because not only in [Jer
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011.md) but also in [Jer
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md) (which also is said to be taken
from 2 Kings) we find Nebuchadrezzar.)

[Jer 39:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md)

"And it came to pass, when Jerusalem had been taken (in the ninth year
of Zedekiah the king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar and
all his army had come against Jerusalem and besieged it; in the eleventh
year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, was
the city broken into), then came all the princes of the king of Babylon
and sat down at the middle gate, - Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo,
Sarsechim, chief chamberlain, Nergal-sharezer, chief magician, and all
the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon." These three verses, to
which the last clause of [Jer 38:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#028.md)
belongs, form one period, broken up by a pretty long piece inserted in
it, on the beginning and duration of the siege of Jerusalem; so that,
after the introductory clause והיה כּאשׁר( = ויהי as in [Jer
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011).md), [Jer
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#028.md), the conclusion does not come
till the word ויּבאוּ, [Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md). In
the parenthesis, the length of the siege, as stated, substantially
agrees with [Jer 52:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004.md) and [Kg2
25:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md), only that in these passages
the time when the siege began is further determined by the mention of
the day of the month, לחדשׁ be בּעשׂור, which words are omitted here.
The siege, then, lasted eighteen months, all but one day. After the
besiegers had penetrated into the city through the breaches made in the
wall, the princes, i.e., the chief generals, took up their position at
"the gate of the midst." ישׁבוּ, "they sat down," i.e., took up a
position, fixed their quarters. "The gate of the midst," which is
mentioned only in this passage, is supposed, and perhaps rightly, to
have been a gate in the wall which divided the city of Zion from the
lower city; from this point, the two portions of the city, the upper and
the lower city, could most easily be commanded.

With regard to the names of the Babylonian princes, it is remarkable (1)
that the name Nergal-sharezer occurs twice, the first time without any
designation, the second time with the official title of chief magician;
(2) that the name Samgar-nebo has the name of God (Nebo or Nebu) in the
second half, whereas in all other compounds of this kind that are known
to us, Nebu forms the first portion of the name, as in Nebuchadnezzar,
Nebuzaradan, Nebushasban ([Jer 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013).md),
Naboned, Nabonassar, Nabopolassar, etc.; (3) from this name, too, is
omitted the title of office, while we find one with the following name.
Moreover (4) in [Jer 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013.md), where the
Babylonian grandees are again spoken of, instead of the four names, only
three are given, but every one of them with a title of office; and only
the third of these, Nergal-sharezer, the chief magician, is identical
with the one who is named last in [Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md); while Nebushasban is mentioned
instead of the Sarsechim of [Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md)
as רב־סריס, chief of the eunuchs (high chamberlain); and in place of
Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, we find Nebuzaradan as the commander of
the body-guards (רב טבּחים). On these four grounds, Hitzig infers that
[Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md), in the passage before us,
has been corrupted, and that it contained originally only the names of
three persons, with their official titles. Moreover, he supposes that
סמגּר is formed from the Persian jâm and the derivation-syllable kr,
Pers. war, and means "he who has or holds the cup," the cup-bearer; thus
corresponding to רב שׁקה ot gnidnop, Rab-shakeh, "chief cup-bearer,"
[Kg2 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md); [Isa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#002.md). He also considers שׂרסכים a
Hebraizing form of רב סריס; סכה or שׂכה, "to cut," by transposition from
חצה, Arab. chtṣy, from which comes chatṣiyun, "a eunuch," = סכי, plur.
סכים; hence שׂרסכים = רב סריס, of which the former has been a marginal
gloss, afterwards received into the text. This complicated combination,
however, by which Hitzig certainly makes out two official titles, though
he retains no more than the divine name Nebu as that of Rabsaris, is
founded upon two very hazardous conjectures. Nor do these conjectures
gain much support from the renewal of the attempt, made about fifty
years since by the late P. von Bohlen, to explain from the Neo-Persian
the names of persons and titles occurring in the Assyrian and
Old-Babylonian languages, an attempt which has long since been looked
upon as scientifically unwarranted. Strange as it may seem that the two
persons first named are not further specified by the addition of an
official title, yet the supposition that the persons named in [Isa
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#003.md) are identical with those
mentioned in [Isa 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#013.md) is erroneous,
since it stands in contradiction with [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md), which even Hitzig recognises as
historically reliable. According to [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md), Nebuzaradan, who is the first
mentioned in [Jer 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013.md), was not
present at the taking of Jerusalem, and did not reach the city till four
weeks afterwards; he was ordered by Nebuchadnezzar to superintend
arrangements for the destruction of Jerusalem, and also to make
arrangements for the transportation of the captives to Babylon, and for
the administration of the country now being laid waste. But in [Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md) are named the generals who, when
the city had bee taken by storm, took up their position within it. - Nor
do the other difficulties, mentioned above, compel us to make such harsh
conjectures. If Nergal-sharezer be the name of a person, compounded of
two words, the divine name, Nergal ([Kg2
17:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#030).md), and Sharezer, probably
dominator tuebitur (see Delitzsch on [Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038).md), then Samgar-Nebu-Sarsechim may
possibly be a proper name compounded of three words. So long as we are
unable with certainty to explain the words סמגּר and שׂרסכים out of the
Assyrian, we can form no decisive judgment regarding them. But not even
does the hypothesis of Hitzig account for the occurrence twice over of
the name Nergal-sharezer. The Nergal-sharezer mentioned in the first
passage was, no doubt, the commander-in-chief of the besieging army; but
it could hardly be maintained, with anything like convincing power, that
this officer could not bear the same name as that of the chief magician.
And if it be conceded that there are really errors in the strange words
סמגּר־נבוּ and שׂרסכים, we are as yet without the necessary means of
correcting them, and obtaining the proper text.

[Jer 39:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md)

In [Jer 39:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md) are narrated the flight
of Zedekiah, his capture, and his condemnation, like what we find in
[Jer 52:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007.md) and [Kg2
25:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004.md). "When Zedekiah the king of
Judah and all the men of war saw them (the Chaldean generals who had
taken up their position at the mid-gate), they fled by night out of the
city, by the way of the king's garden, by a gate between the walls, and
he went out by the way to the Arabah. [Jer
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md). But the army of the Chaldeans
pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the steppes of Jericho, and
captured him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, to
Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him."
Hitzig and Graf consider that the connection of these events, made by
כּאשׁר ראם, is awkward, and say that the king would not have waited till
the Chaldean generals took up their position at the mid-gate, nor could
he see these in the night-time; that, moreover, he would hardly have
waited till the city was taken before he fled. These objections are
utterly worthless. If the city of Zion, in which the royal palace stood,
was separated from the lower city by a wall, then the king might still
be quite at ease, with his men of war, in the upper city or city of
Zion, so long as the enemy, who were pushing into the lower city from
the north, remained at the separating wall, near the middle gate in it;
and only when he saw that the city of Zion, too, could no longer be
held, did he need to betake himself to flight with the men of war around
him. In actual fact, then, he might have been able to see the Chaldean
generals with his own eyes, although we need not press ראם so much as to
extract this meaning from it. Even at this juncture, flight was still
possible through the south gate, at the king's garden, between the two
walls. Thenius, on [Kg2 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004.md), takes
חמתים to mean a double wall, which at the southern end of Ophel closed
up the ravine between Ophel and Zion. But a double wall must also have
had two gates, and Thenius, indeed, has exhibited them in his plan of
Jerusalem; but the text speaks of but one gate (שׁער). "The two walls"
are rather the walls which ran along the eastern border of Zion and the
western border of Ophel. The gate between these was situated in the wall
which ran across the Tyropoean valley, and united the wall of Zion and
that of Ophel; it was called the horse-gate ([Neh
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#028).md), and occupied the position of
the modern "dung-gate" (Bab-el Moghribeh); see on [Neh
3:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#027.md). It was not the "gate of the
fountain," as Thenius (Bcher der Kn. S. 456), Ngelsbach, and others
imagine, founding on the supposed existence of the double wall at the
south end of Ophel. Outside this gate, where the valley of the Tyropoeon
joined with the valley of the Kidron, lay the king's garden, in the
vicinity of the pool of Siloam; see on [Neh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md). The words 'ויּצא וגו introduce
further details as to the king's flight. In spite of the preceding
plurals ויּברחוּ , the sing. יצא is quite suitable here, since the
narrator wishes to give further details with regard to the flight of the
king alone, without bringing into consideration the warriors who fled
along with him. Nor does the following אחריהם militate against this
view; for the Chaldean warriors pursued the king and his followers, not
to capture these followers, but the king. Escaped from the city, the
king took the direction of the ערבה, the plain of the Jordan, in order
to escape over Jordan to Gilead. But the pursuing enemy overtook him in
the steppes of Jericho (see Comm. on Joshua on [Jos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013).md), and thus before he had crossed
the Jordan; they led him, bound, to Riblah, before the king of Babylon.
"Riblah in the land of Hamath" is still called Ribleh, a wretched
village about 20 miles S.S.W. from Hums (Emesa) on the river el Ahsy
(Orontes), in a large fertile plain in the northern portion of the Beka,
on the great caravan-track which passes from Palestine through Damascus,
Emesa, and Hamath to Thapsacus and Carchemish on the Euphrates; see
Robinson's Bibl. Res. iii. 545, and on Comm. on Kings at [Kg2
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033.md). - On דּבּר משׁפּטים, to speak
judgment, pronounce sentence of punishment, see on [Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016.md). Nebuchadnezzar caused the sons
of Zedekiah and all the princes of Judah (חרים, nobles, lords, as in
27:30) to be slain before the eyes of the Jewish king; then he put out
his eyes and bound him with brazen fetters, to carry him away to Babylon
(לביא for להביא), where, according to [Jer
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011.md), he remained in confinement till
his death.

[Jer 39:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#008.md)

[Jer 39:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#008.md) contain a brief notice
regarding the fate of the city of Jerusalem and its inhabitants, joined
on to the passage preceding, in order to prepare the way for a short
account of the treatment which Jeremiah experienced at the same time.
From the more detailed notice regarding the fate of the city, given in
[Jer 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md)., [Kg2
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md)., we see that the destruction of
the city and the carrying away of the people took place one month after
their fall, and that the king of Babylon had appointed Nebuzaradan, the
commander of his body-guards, to go to Jerusalem for the purpose of
carrying out these matters. In these verses of ours, also, Nebuzaradan
is mentioned as the one who carried out the judgment that had been
pronounced ([Jer 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010)..md); but the fact
of his being sent from Riblah and the date of the execution of his
commission are here omitted, so that it appears as if it had all
occurred immediately after the capture of the city, and as if
Nebuzaradan had been always on the spot. For the writer of this chapter
did not need to give a historically exact account of the separate
events; it was merely necessary briefly to mention the chief points, in
order to place in proper light the treatment experienced by the prophet.
The Chaldeans burned the king's house (the palace) and בּית־העם. This
latter expression, taken in connection with "the king's house,"
signifies the rest of the city apart from the king's palace; hence בּית
is used in a collective sense. the temple is not mentioned, as being of
no consequence for the immediate purpose of this short notice.

[Jer 39:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009.md)

"And the rest of the people that had remained in the city, and the
deserters who had deserted to him, and the rest of the people that
remained, Nebuzaradan, the chief of the body-guards, led captive to
Babylon. [Jer 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010.md). But of the
poorest of the people, who had nothing, Nebuzaradan left some in the
country, and he gave them vineyards and arable fields at the same time."
עליו after נפלוּ refers, ad sensum, to the king of Babylon; his name,
certainly, is not given in the immediate context, but it is readily
suggested by it. In [Jer 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#015.md) we find
אל־מלך בּבל instead of עליו; yet we might also refer this last-named
word to the following subject, Nebuzaradan, as the representative of the
king. רב־טבּחים, properly, chief of the slayers, i.e., of the
executioners, is the chief of the king's body-guard, who occupied the
first place among the royal attendants; see on [Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036.md). By the addition of the words
בּיום ההוּא, on that day, i.e., then, the more general account regarding
Jerusalem and its inhabitants is concluded, for the purpose of attaching
to it the notice regarding the fate of the prophet Jeremiah, [Jer
39:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011.md).

[Jer 39:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011.md)

Nebuchadnezzar gave orders regarding Jeremiah, through Nebuzaradan, the
chief of the body-guards: "Take him, and set thine eyes upon him, and do
him no harm; but, just as he telleth thee, so do with him." In obedience
to this command, "Nebuzaradan, the chief of the body-guards, sent-and
Nebushasban the head chamberlain, and Nergal-sharezer the chief
magician, and all (the other) chief men of the king of Babylon-they sent
and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and delivered him over
to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him out to
the house. Thus he dwelt among the people." - On the names of the
Chaldean grandees, see on [Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md).
Instead of the chief chamberlain (רב־סריס) Sarsechim, there is here
named, as occupying this office, Nebushasban, who, it seems, along with
Nebuzaradan, was not sent from Riblah till after the taking of
Jerusalem, when Sarsechim was relieved.

We cannot come to any certain conclusion regarding the relation in which
the two persons or names stand to one another, since Nebushasban is only
mentioned in [Jer 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013.md), just as
Sarsechim is mentioned only in [Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md). Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the
man who had already on a former occasion given protection to Jeremiah
([Jer 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024).md), was, according to [Jer
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#005.md), placed by the king of Babylon
over the cities of Judah, i.e., was nominated the Chaldean governor over
Judah and the Jews who were left in the land. To him, as such, Jeremiah
is here ([Jer 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014).md) delivered, that
he may take him into the house. בּית is neither the temple (Hitzig) nor
the palace, the king's house (Graf), but the house in which Gedaliah
resided as the governor; and we find here הבּית, not בּביתו, since the
house was neither the property nor the permanent dwelling-place of
Gedaliah. - According to this account, Jeremiah seems to have remained
in the court of the prison till Nebuchadnezzar came, to have been
liberated by Nebuzaradan only at the command of the king, and to have
been sent to Gedaliah the governor. But this is contradicted by the
account in [Jer 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001.md)., according to
which, Nebuzaradan liberated the prophet in Ramah, where he had been
kept, confined by manacles, among the captives of Judah that were to be
carried to Babylon: Nebuzaradan sent for him, and gave him his liberty.
This contradiction has arisen simply from the intense brevity with
which, in this verse, the fate of Jeremiah at the capture and
destruction of Jerusalem is recorded; it is easy to settle the
difference in this way: - When the city was taken, those inhabitants,
especially males, who had not carried arms, were seized by the Chaldeans
and carried out of the city to Ramah, where they were held prisoners
till the decision of the king regarding their fate should be made known.
Jeremiah shared this lot with his fellow-countrymen. When, after this,
Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem to execute the king's commands regarding
the city and its inhabitants, at the special order of his monarch, he
sent for Jeremiah the prophet, taking him out from among the crowd of
prisoners who had been already carried away to Ramah, loosed him from
his fetters, and gave him permission to choose his place of residence.
This liberation of Jeremiah from his confinement might, in a summary
account, be called a sending for him out of the court of the prison,
even though the prophet, at the exact moment of his liberation, was no
longer in the court of the prison of the palace at Jerusalem, but had
been already carried away to Ramah as a captive.

[Jeremiah 39:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 39:15</span></span>

Jeremiah's message of comfort to Ebedmelech. - [Jer
39:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015.md). "Now to Jeremiah there had come
the word of the Lord, while he remained shut up in the court of the
prison, as follows: [Jer 39:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#016.md). Go and
speak to Ebedmelech the Cushite, saying, Thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the
God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words against this city for evil
and not for good, and they shall take place before thee on that day.
[Jer 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#017.md). But I will deliver thee on
that day, saith Jahveh; neither shalt thou be given into the hand of the
men of whom thou art afraid. [Jer
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018.md). For I will surely save thee,
neither shalt thou fall by the sword, and thine own life shall be thy
spoil, because thou hast trusted me, saith Jahveh." - This word of God
for Ebedmelech came to the prophet, no doubt, very soon after his
deliverance from the miry pit by this pious Ethiopian; but it is not
given till now, and this by way of supplement, lest its introduction
previously should break the chain of events which occurred at the time
of that deliverance, Jer 38:14-39:13. Hence היה, [Jer
39:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015.md), is to be translated as a
pluperfect. "Go and say," etc., is not inconsistent with the fact that
Jeremiah, from being in confinement, could not leave the court of the
prison. For Ebedmelech could come into the prison, and then Jeremiah
could go to him and declare the word of God. "Behold, I will bring my
words against this city," i.e., I shall cause the evil with which I have
threatened Jerusalem and its inhabitants to come, or, to be accomplished
(מבי with א dropped, as in [Jer 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015.md),
and אל־ for על). והיוּ לפּניך, "and these words are to take place before
thy face," i.e., thou shalt with thine own eyes behold their fulfilment,
בּיום ההוּא, i.e., at the time of their occurrence. But thou shalt be
saved, not fall into the hands of the enemy and be killed, but carry
away thy body out of it all as booty; cf. [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009.md); [Jer
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002.md). "Because thou hast trusted me;"
i.e., through the aid afforded to my prophet thou hast continued thy
faith in me.
