A Well-Wishing Glance Back at the Pilgrims' City

If by "the mountains" in [Psa 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md)
the mountains of the Holy Land are to be understood, it is also clear
for what reason the collector placed this Song of degrees, which begins
with the expression of joy at the pilgrimage to the house of Jahve, and
therefore to the holy mountain, immediately after the preceding song. By
its peace-breathing (שׁלום) contents it also, however, touches closely
upon [Psa 120:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md). The poet utters
aloud his hearty benedictory salutation to the holy city in remembrance
of the delightful time during which he sojourned there as a visitor at
the feast, and enjoyed its inspiring aspect. If in respect of the לדוד
the Psalm were to be regarded as an old Davidic Psalm, it would belong
to the series of those Psalms of the time of the persecution by Absalom,
which cast a yearning look back towards home, the house of God ([Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md); [Psa
26:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001.md), [Psa
55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015.md); [Psa
61:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001.md), and more particularly [Psa
63:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001).md). But the לדוד is wanting in
the lxx, Codd. Alex. and Vat.; and the Cod Sinait., which has ΤΩ ΔΑΔ,
puts this before [Psa 124:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md), ει ̓ μὴ
ὅτι κύριος κ. τ. λ., also, contrary to Codd. Alex. and Vat. Here it is
occasioned by [Psa 122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005.md), but without
any critical discernment. The measures adopted by Jeroboam I show,
moreover, that the pilgrimages to the feasts were customary even in the
time of David and Solomon. The images of calves in Dan and Bethel, and
the changing of the Feast of Tabernacles to another month, were intended
to strengthen the political rupture, by breaking up the religious unity
of the people and weaning them from visiting Jerusalem. The poet of the
Psalm before us, however, lived much later. He lived, as is to be
inferred with Hupfeld from [Psa 122:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003.md),
in the time of the post-exilic Jerusalem which rose again out of its
ruins. Thither he had been at one of the great feasts, and here, still
quite full of the inspiring memory, he looks back towards the holy city;
for, in spite of Reuss, Hupfeld, and Hitzig, [Psa
122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md)., so far as the style is
concerned, are manifestly a retrospect.

[Psalms 122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 122:1</span></span>

The preterite שׂמחתי may signify: I rejoice ([Sa1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001).md), just as much as: I rejoiced.
Here in comparison with [Psa 122:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#002.md) it
is a retrospect; for היה with the participle has for the most part a
retrospective signification, [Gen
39:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#022.md); [Deu
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#022.md), [Deu
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#024.md); [Jdg
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007.md); [Job
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#014.md). True, עמדות היוּ might also
signify: they have been standing and still stand (as in [Psa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014.md); [Isa
59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002.md); [Isa
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#020).md); but then why was it not more
briefly expressed by עמדוּ ([Psa
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#012).md)? The lxx correctly renders:
εὐφράνθην and ἑστῶτες ἦσαν. The poet, now again on the journey
homewards, or having returned home, calls to mind the joy with which the
cry for setting out, "Let us go up to the house of Jahve!" filled him.
When he and the other visitors to the feast had reached the goal of
their pilgrimage, their feet came to a stand-still, as if spell-bound by
the overpowering, glorious sight.

(Note: So also Veith in his, in many points, beautiful Lectures on
twelve gradual Psalms (Vienna 1863), S. 72, "They arrested their steps,
in order to give time to the amazement with which the sight of the
Temple, the citadel of the king, and the magnificent city filled them.")

Reviving this memory, he exclaims: Jerusalem, O thou who art built up
again - true, בּנה in itself only signifies "to build," but here, where,
if there is nothing to the contrary, a closed sense is to be assumed for
the line of the verse, and in the midst of songs which reflect the joy
and sorrow of the post-exilic restoration period, it obtains the same
meaning as in [Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md); [Psa
147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md), and frequently (Gesenius: O
Hierosolyma restituta). The parallel member, [Psa
122:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003.md), does not indeed require this
sense, but is at least favourable to it. Luther's earlier rendering, "as
a city which is compacted together," was happier than his later
rendering, "a city where they shall come together," which requires a
Niph. or Hithpa. instead of the passive. חבּר signifies, as in [Exo
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#007.md), to be joined together, to be
united into a whole; and יחדּו strengthens the idea of that which is
harmoniously, perfectly, and snugly closed up (cf. [Psa
133:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001).md). The Kaph of כּעיר is the
so-called Kaph veritatis: Jerusalem has risen again out of its ruined
and razed condition, the breaches and gaps are done away with ([Isa
58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012).md), it stands there as a closely
compacted city, in which house joins on to house. Thus has the poet seen
it, and the recollection fills him with rapture.

(Note: In the synagogue and church it is become customary to interpret
[Psa 122:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003.md) of the parallelism of the
heavenly and earthly Jerusalem.)

[Psalms 122:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 122:4</span></span>

The imposing character of the impression was still greatly enhanced by
the consideration, that this is the city where at all times the twelve
tribes of God's nation (which were still distinguished as its elements
even after the Exile, [Rom 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md); [Luk
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036.md); [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001).md) came together at the three great
feasts. The use of the שׁ twice as equivalent to אשׁר is (as in
Canticles) appropriate to the ornamental, happy, miniature-like manner
of these Songs of degrees. In שׁשּׁם the שׁם is, as in [Ecc
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#007.md), equivalent to שׁמּה, which on the
other hand in [Psa 122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005.md) is no more
than an emphatic שׁם (cf. [Psa 76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004.md);
[Psa 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007).md). עלוּ affirms a habit (cf.
[Job 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#004).md) of the past, which extends
into the present. עדוּת לישׂראל is not an accusative of the definition
or destination (Ew. ֗300, c), but an apposition to the previous clause,
as e.g., in [Lev 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014.md), [Lev
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#021.md), [Lev
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#031) (Hitzig.md), referring to the
appointing in [Exo 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017.md); [Exo
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#023.md); [Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md). The custom, which arose thus,
is confirmed in [Psa 122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005.md) from the
fact, that Jerusalem, the city of the one national sanctuary, was at the
same time the city of the Davidic kingship. The phrase ישׁב למשׁפּט is
here transferred from the judicial persons (cf. [Psa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md) with [Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005.md); [Psa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006).md), who sit in judgment, to the
seats (thrones) which are set down and stand there fro judgment (cf.
[Psa 125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md), and θρόνος ἔκειτο, [Rev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002).md). The Targum is thinking of seats
in the Temple, viz., the raised (in the second Temple resting upon
pillars) seat of the king in the court of the Israelitish men near the
שׁער העליון, but למשׁפט points to the palace, [Kg1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#007.md). In the flourishing age of the
Davidic kingship this was also the highest court of judgment of the
land; the king was the chief judge ([Sa2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002.md); [Kg1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016).md), and the sons, brothers, or
kinsmen of the king were his assessors and advisers. In the time of the
poet it is different; but the attractiveness of Jerusalem, not only as
the city of Jahve, but also as the city of David, remains the same for
all times.

[Psalms 122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 122:6</span></span>

When the poet thus calls up the picture of his country's "city of peace"
before his mind, the picture of the glory which it still ever possesses,
and of the greater glory which it had formerly, he spreads out his hands
over it in the distance, blessing it in the kindling of his love, and
calls upon all his fellow-countrymen round about and in all places:
apprecamini salutem Hierosolymis. So Gesenius correctly (Thesaurus, p.
1347); for just as שׁאל לו לשׁלום signifies to inquire after any one's
well-being, and to greet him with the question: השׁלום לך ([Jer
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#005).md), so שׁאל שׁלום signifies to find
out any one's prosperity by asking, to gladly know and gladly see that
it is well with him, and therefore to be animated by the wish that he
may prosper; Syriac, שׁאל שׁלמא ד directly: to salute any one; for the
interrogatory השׁלום לך and the well-wishing שׁלום לך, εἰρήνη σοί ([Luk
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#005.md); [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019)..md), have both of them the same
source and meaning. The reading אהליך, commended by Ewald, is a
recollection of [Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006.md) that is
violently brought in here. The loving ones are comprehended with the
beloved one, the children with the mother. שׁלה forms an alliteration
with שׁלום; the emphatic form ישׁליוּ occurs even in other instances out
of pause (e.g., [Psa 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002).md). In [Psa
122:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#007.md) the alliteration of שׁלום and
שׁלוה is again taken up, and both accord with the name of Jerusalem. Ad
elegantiam facit, as Venema observes, perpetua vocum ad se invicem et
omnium ad nomen Hierosolymae alliteratio. Both together mark the Song of
degrees as such. Happiness, cries out the poet to the holy city from
afar, be within thy bulwarks, prosperity within thy palaces, i.e.,
without and within. חיל, ramparts, circumvallation (from חוּל, to
surround, Arabic hawl, round about, equally correct whether written חיל
or חל), and ארמנות as the parallel word, as in [Psa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#014.md). The twofold motive of such an
earnest wish for peace is love for the brethren and love for the house
of God. For the sake of the brethren is he cheerfully resolved to speak
peace (τὰ πρὸς ἐιρήνην αὐτῆς, [Luk
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042).md) concerning (דּבּר בּ, as in
[Psa 87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md), [Deu
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md), lxx περὶ σοῦ; cf. דּבּר שׁלום
with אל and ל, to speak peace to, [Psa
85:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#009.md); [Est
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003).md) Jerusalem, for the sake of the
house of Jahve will he strive after good (i.e., that which tends to her
well-being) to her (like בּקּשׁ טובה ל in [Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010.md), cf. דּרשׁ שׁלום, [Deu
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#006.md), [Jer
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007).md). For although he is now again
far from Jerusalem after the visit that is over, he still remains united
in love to the holy city as being the goal of his longing, and to those
who dwell there as being his brethren and friends. Jerusalem is and will
remain the heart of all Israel as surely as Jahve who has His house
there, is the God of all Israel.
