### [Exodus Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 21:1</span></span>

The mishpatim ([Exo 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001).md) are not the
"laws, which were to be in force and serve as rules of action," as
Knobel affirms, but the rights, by which the national life was formed
into a civil commonwealth and the political order secured. These rights
had reference first of all to the relation in which the individuals
stood one towards another. The personal rights of dependants are placed
at the head ([Exo 21:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002).md); and first
those of slaves ([Exo 21:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002).md), which
are still more minutely explained in [Deu
15:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md), where the observance of them
is urged upon the hearts of the people on subjective grounds.

[Exodus 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 21:2</span></span>

The Hebrew servant was to obtain his freedom without paying
compensation, after six years of service. According to [Deu
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md), this rule applied to the Hebrew
maid-servant as well. The predicate עברי limits the rule to Israelitish
servants, in distinction from slaves of foreign extraction, to whom this
law did not apply (cf. [Deu 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md),
"thy brother").

(Note: Saalschtz is quite wrong in his supposition, that עברי relates
not to Israelites, but to relations of the Israelites who had come over
to them from their original native land. (See my Archהologie, ֗112, Note
2.))

An Israelite might buy his own countryman, either when he was sold by a
court of justice on account of theft ([Exo
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001).md), or when he was poor and sold
himself ([Lev 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039).md). The emancipation
in the seventh year of service was intimately connected with the
sabbatical year, though we are not to understand it as taking place in
that particular year. "He shall go out free," sc., from his master's
house, i.e., be set at liberty. חנּם: without compensation. In
Deuteronomy the master is also commanded not to let him go out empty,
but to load him (חעניק to put upon his neck) from his flock, his
threshing-floor, and his wine-press (i.e., with corn and wine); that is
to say, to give him as much as he could carry away with him. The motive
for this command is drawn from their recollection of their own
deliverance by Jehovah from the bondage of Egypt. And in [Exo
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#018.md) an additional reason is
supplied, to incline the heart of the master to this emancipation, viz.,
that "he has served thee for six years the double of a labourer's
wages," - that is to say, "he has served and worked so much, that it
would have cost twice as much, if it had been necessary to hire a
labourer in his place" (Schultz), - and "Jehovah thy God hath blessed
thee in all that thou doest," sc., through his service.

[Exodus 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 21:3</span></span>

There were three different circumstances possible, under which
emancipation might take place. The servant might have been unmarried and
continued so (בּגפּו: with his body, i.e., alone, single): in that case,
of course, there was no one else to set at liberty. Or he might have
brought a wife with him; and in that case his wife was to be set at
liberty as well. Or his master might have given him a wife in his
bondage, and she might have borne him children: in that case the wife
and children were to continue the property of the master. This may
appear oppressive, but it was an equitable consequence of the possession
of property in slaves at all. At the same time, in order to modify the
harshness of such a separation of husband and wife, the option was given
to the servant to remain in his master's service, provided he was
willing to renounce his liberty for ever ([Exo
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#005.md), [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006).md). This would very likely be the
case as a general rule; for there were various legal arrangements, which
are mentioned in other places, by which the lot of Hebrew slaves was
greatly softened and placed almost on an equality with that of hired
labourers (cf. [Exo 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#012.md); [Lev
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#006.md), [Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md), [Lev
25:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#043.md), [Lev
25:53](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#053.md); [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md); [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011).md). In this case the master was to
take his servant האלהים אל, lit., to God, i.e., according to the correct
rendering of the lxx, πρὸς τὸ κριτήριον, to the place where judgment was
given in the name of God ([Deu 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#017.md);
cf. [Exo 22:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#007.md), and [Deu
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#017).md), in order that he might make a
declaration there that he gave up his liberty. His ear was then to be
bored with an awl against the door or lintel of the house, and by this
sign, which was customary in many of the nations of antiquity, to be
fastened as it were to the house for ever. That this was the meaning of
the piercing of the ear against the door of the house, is evident from
the unusual expression in [Deu 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017.md),
"and put (the awl) into his ear and into the door, that he may be thy
servant for ever," where the ear and the door are co-ordinates. "For
ever," i.e., as long as he lives. Josephus and the Rabbins would
restrict the service to the time ending with the year of jubilee, but
without sufficient reason, and contrary to the usage of the language, as
לעלם is used in [Lev 25:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#046.md) to denote
service which did not terminate with the year of jubilee. (See the
remarks on [Lev 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010.md); also my
Archologie.)

[Exodus 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 21:7</span></span>

The daughter of an Israelite, who had been sold by her father as a
maid-servant (לאמה), i.e., as the sequel shows, as a housekeeper and
concubine, stood in a different relation to her master's house. She was
not to go out like the men-servants, i.e., not to be sent away as free
at the end of six years of service; but the three following regulations,
which are introduced by אם ([Exo
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#008).md), ואם ([Exo
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#009).md), and ואם ([Exo
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#011).md), were to be observed with
regard to her. In the first place ([Exo
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#008).md), "if she please not her master,
who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed."
The לא before יעדהּ is one of the fifteen cases in which לא has been
marked in the Masoretic text as standing for לו; and it cannot possibly
signify not in the passage before us. For if it were to be taken as a
negative, "that he do not appoint her," sc., as a concubine for himself,
the pronoun לו would certainly not be omitted. הפדּהּ (for הפדּהּ, see
Ges. 53, Note 6), to let her be redeemed, i.e., to allow another
Israelite to buy her as a concubine; for there can hardly have been any
thought of redemption on the part of the father, as it would no doubt be
poverty alone that caused him to sell his daughter ([Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039).md). But "to sell her unto a
strange nation (i.e., to any one but a Hebrew), he shall have no power,
if he acts unfaithfully towards her," i.e., if he do not grant her the
promised marriage. In the second place ([Exo
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#009.md), [Exo
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#010).md), "if he appoint her as his
son's wife, he shall act towards her according to the rights of
daughters," i.e., treat her as a daughter; "and if he take him (the son)
another (wife), - whether because the son was no longer satisfied, or
because the father gave the son another wife in addition to her - "her
food (שׁאר flesh as the chief article of food, instead of לחם, bread,
because the lawgiver had persons of property in his mind, who were in a
position to keep concubines), her raiment, and her duty of marriage he
shall not diminish," i.e., the claims which she had as a daughter for
support, and as his son's wife for conjugal rights, were not to be
neglected; he was not to allow his son, therefore, to put her away or
treat her badly. With this explanation the difficulties connected with
every other are avoided. For instance, if we refer the words of [Exo
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#009.md) to the son, and understand them
as meaning, "if the son should take another wife," we introduce a change
of subject without anything to indicate it. If, on the other hand, we
regard them as meaning, "if the father (the purchaser) should take to
himself another wife," this ought to have come before [Exo
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#009.md). In the third place ([Exo
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#011)), "if he do not (do not grant.md)
these three unto her, she shall go out for nothing, without money."
"These three" are food, clothing, and conjugal rights, which are
mentioned just before; not "si eam non desponderit sibi nec filio, nec
redimi sit passus" (Rabbins and others), nor "if he did not give her to
his son as a concubine, but diminished her," as Knobel explains it.

[Exodus 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 21:12</span></span>

Still higher than personal liberty, however, is life itself, the right
of existence and personality; and the infliction of injury upon this was
not only prohibited, but to be followed by punishment corresponding to
the crime. The principle of retribution, jus talionis, which is the only
one that embodies the idea of justice, lies at the foundation of these
threats.

[Exo 21:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md)

A death-blow was to be punished with death (cf. [Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md); [Lev
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#017).md). "He that smiteth a man and (so
that) he die (whether on the spot or directly afterwards did not
matter), he shall be put to death." This general rule is still further
defined by a distinction being drawn between accidental and intentional
killing. "But whoever has not lain in wait (for another's life), and God
has caused it to come to his hand" (to kill the other); i.e., not only
if he did not intend to kill him, but did not even cherish the intention
of smiting him, or of doing him harm from hatred and enmity ([Num
35:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016.md); [Deu
19:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#004).md), and therefore did so quite
unawares, according to a dispensation of God, which is generally called
an accident because it is above our comprehension. For such a man God
would appoint places of refuge, where he should be protected against the
avenger of blood. (On this point, see [Num
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#009)..md).

[Exo 21:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014.md)

"But he who acts presumptuously against his neighbour, to slay him with
guile, thou shalt take him from Mine altar that he may die." These words
are not to be understood as meaning, that only intentional and
treacherous killing was to be punished with death; but, without
restricting the general rule in [Exo
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md), they are to be interpreted from
their antithesis to [Exo 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013.md), as
signifying that even the altar of Jehovah was not to protect a man who
had committed intentional murder, and carried out his purpose with
treachery. (More on this point at [Num
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016)..md) By this regulation, the idea,
which was common to the Hebrews and many other nations, that the altar
as God's abode afforded protection to any life that was in danger from
men, was brought back to the true measure of its validity, and the place
of expiation for sins of weakness (cf. [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md); [Lev
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015.md), [Lev
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#018.md); [Num
15:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#027).md) was prevented from being
abused by being made a place of refuge for criminals who were deserving
of death. Maltreatment of a father and mother through striking ([Exo
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#015).md), man-stealing ([Exo
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#016).md), and cursing parents ([Exo
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017.md), cf. [Lev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009).md), were all to be placed on a par
with murder, and punished in the same way. By the "smiting" (הכּה) of
parents we are not to understand smiting to death, for in that case ומת
would be added as in [Exo 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md), but
any kind of maltreatment. The murder of parents is not mentioned at all,
as not likely to occur and hardly conceivable. The cursing (קלּל as in
[Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003).md) of parents is placed on a
par with smiting, because it proceeds from the same disposition; and
both were to be punished with death, because the majesty of God was
violated in the persons of the parents (cf. [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012).md). Man-stealing was also no less
a crime, being a sin against the dignity of man, and a violation of the
image of God. For אישׁ "a man," we find in [Deu
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#007.md), נפשׁ "a soul," by which both man
and woman are intended, and the still more definite limitation, "of his
brethren of the children of Israel." The crime remained the same whether
he had sold him (the stolen man), or whether he was still found in his
hand. (For ו - ו as a sign of an alternative in the linking together of
short sentences, see [Pro 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#009.md), and
Ewald, 361.) This is the rendering adopted by most of the earlier
translators, and we get no intelligent sense if we divide the clauses
thus: "and sell him so that he is found in his hand."

[Exodus 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 21:18</span></span>

Fatal blows and the crimes placed on a par with them are now followed in
simple order by the laws relating to bodily injuries.

[Exo 21:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#018.md)

If in the course of a quarrel one man should hit another with a stone or
with his fist, so that, although he did not die, he "lay upon his bed,"
i.e., became bedridden; if the person struck should get up again and
walk out with his staff, the other would be innocent, he should "only
give him his sitting and have him cured," i.e., compensate him for his
loss of time and the cost of recovery. This certainly implies, on the
one hand, that if the man died upon his bed, the injury was to be
punished with death, according to [Exo
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md); and on the other hand, that if
he died after getting up and going out, no further punishment was to be
inflicted for the injury done.

[Exo 21:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#020.md)

The case was different with regard to a slave. The master had always the
right to punish or "chasten" him with a stick ([Pro
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013.md); [Pro
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024).md); this right was involved in the
paternal authority of the master over the servants in his possession.
The law was therefore confined to the abuse of this authority in
outbursts of passion, in which case, "if the servant or the maid should
die under his hand (i.e., under his blows), he was to be punished"
(ינּקם נקם: "vengeance shall surely be taken"). But in what the נקם was
to consist is not explained; certainly not in slaying by the sword, as
the Jewish commentators maintain. The lawgiver would have expressed this
by יוּמת מות. No doubt it was left to the authorities to determine this
according to the circumstances. The law in [Exo
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md) could hardly be applied to a
case of this description, although it was afterwards extended to
foreigners as well as natives ([Lev
24:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#021).md), for the simple reason, that
it is hardly conceivable that a master would intentionally kill his
slave, who was his possession and money. How far the lawgiver was from
presupposing any such intention here, is evident from the law which
follows in [Exo 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#021.md),
"Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two (i.e., remain alive), it
shall not be avenged, for he is his money." By the continuance of his
life, if only for a day or two, it would become perfectly evident that
the master did not wish to kill his servant; and if nevertheless he died
after this, the loss of the slave was punishment enough for the master.
There is no ground whatever for restricting this regulation, as the
Rabbins do, to slaves who were not of Hebrew extraction.

[Exo 21:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#022.md)

If men strove and thrust against a woman with child, who had come near
or between them for the purpose of making peace, so that her children
come out (come into the world), and no injury was done either to the
woman or the child that was born,

(Note: The words ילדיה ויצאוּ are rendered by the lxx καὶ ἐξέλθη τὸ
παιδίον αὐτῆς μὴ ἐξεικονισμένον and the corresponding clause יהיה אסון
ואם by ἐὰν δὲ ἐξεικονισμένον ᾖ; consequently the translators have
understood the words as meaning that the fruit, the premature birth of
which was caused by the blow, if not yet developed into a human form,
was not to be regarded as in any sense a human being, so that the giver
of the blow was only required to pay a pecuniary compensation, - as
Philo expresses it, "on account of the injury done to the woman, and
because he prevented nature, which forms and shapes a man into the most
beautiful being, from bringing him forth alive." But the arbitrary
character of this explanation is apparent at once; for ילד only denotes
a child, as a fully developed human being, and not the fruit of the womb
before it has assumed a human form. In a manner no less arbitrary אסון
has been rendered by Onkelos and the Rabbins מותא, death, and the clause
is made to refer to the death of the mother alone, in opposition to the
penal sentence in [Exo 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#023.md), [Exo
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#024.md), which not only demands life for
life, but eye for eye, etc., and therefore presupposes not death alone,
but injury done to particular members. The omission of להּ, also,
apparently renders it impracticable to refer the words to injury done to
the woman alone.)

a pecuniary compensation was to be paid, such as the husband of the
woman laid upon him, and he was to give it בּפללים by (by an appeal to)
arbitrators. A fine is imposed, because even if no injury had been done
to the woman and the fruit of her womb, such a blow might have
endangered life. (For יצא roF( to go out of the womb, see [Gen
25:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#025)..md) The plural ילדיה is
employed for the purpose of speaking indefinitely, because there might
possibly be more than one child in the womb. "But if injury occur (to
the mother or the child), thou shalt give soul for soul, eye for
eye,...wound for wound:" thus perfect retribution was to be made.

[Exo 21:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#026.md)

But the lex talionis applied to the free Israelite only, not to slaves.
In the case of the latter, if the master struck out an eye and destroyed
it, i.e., blinded him with the blow, or struck out a tooth, he was to
let him go free, as a compensation for the loss of the member. Eye and
tooth are individual examples selected to denote all the members, from
the most important and indispensable down to the very least.

[Exo 21:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#028.md)

The life of man is also protected against injury from cattle (cf. [Gen
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005).md). "If an ox gore a man or a woman,
that they die, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be
eaten;" because, as the stoning already shows, it was laden with the
guilt of murder, and therefore had become unclean (cf. [Num
35:33](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#033).md). The master or owner of the ox
was innocent, sc., if his ox had not bee known to do so before. But if
this were the case, "if his master have been warned (בּבעליו הוּעד,
lit., testimony laid against its master), and notwithstanding this he
have not kept it in," then the master was to be put to death, because
through his carelessness in keeping the ox he had caused the death, and
therefore shared the guilt. As this guilt, however, had not been
incurred through an intentional crime, but had arisen simply from
carelessness, he was allowed to redeem his forfeited life by the payment
of expiation money (כּפר, lit., covering, expiation, cf. [Exo
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012).md), "according to all that was
laid upon him," sc., by the judge.

[Exo 21:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#031.md)

The death of a son or a daughter through the goring of an ox was also to
be treated in the same way; but that of a slave (man-servant or
maid-servant) was to be compensated by the payment of thirty shekels of
silver (i.e., probably the ordinary price for the redemption of a slave,
as the redemption price of a free Israelite was fifty shekels, [Lev
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#003).md) on the part of the owner of the
ox; but the ox was to be killed in this case also. There are other
ancient nations in whose law books we find laws relating to the
punishment of animals for killing or wounding a man, but not one of them
had a law which made the owner of the animal responsible as well, for
they none of them looked upon human life in its likeness of God.

[Exodus 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 21:33</span></span>

Passing from life to property, in connection with the foregoing, the
life of the animal, the most important possession of the Israelites, is
first of all secured against destruction through carelessness. If any
one opened or dug a pit or cistern, and did not close it up again, and
another man's ox or ass (mentioned, for the sake of example, as the most
important animals among the live stock of the Israelites) fell in and
was killed, the owner of the pit was to pay its full value, and the dead
animal to belong to him. If an ox that was not known to be vicious gored
another man's ox to death, the vicious animal was to be sold, and its
money (what it fetched) to be divided; the dead animal was also to be
divided, so that both parties bore an equal amount of damage. If, on the
other hand, the ox had been known to be vicious before, and had not been
kept in, carefully secured, by its possessor, he was to compensate the
owner of the one that had been killed with the full value of an ox, but
to receive the dead one instead.
